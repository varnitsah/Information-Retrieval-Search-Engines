the greek myths of storm given partly in university college london march 9 1869  ii  athena keramitis       athena in the earth study supplementary to the preceding lecture of the supposed and actual relations of athena to the vital force in material organism  iii  athena ergane       athena in the heart various notes relating to the conception of athena as the directress of the imagination and will     preface   my days and strength have lately been much broken and i never more felt the insufficiency of both than in preparing for the press the following desultory memoranda on a most noble subject  but i leave them now as they stand for no time nor labor would be enough to complete them to my contentment and i believe that they contain suggestions which may be followed with safety by persons who are beginning to take interest in the aspects of mythology which only recent investigation has removed from the region of conjecture into that of rational inquiry  i have some advantage also from my field work in the interpretation of myths relating to natural phenomena and i have had always near me since we were at college together a sure and unweariedly kind guide in my friend charles newton to whom we owe the finding of more treasure in mines of marble than were it rightly estimated all california could buy  i must not however permit the chance of his name being in any wise associated with my errors  much of my work as been done obstinately in my own way and he is never responsible for me though he has often kept me right or at least enabled me to advance in a new direction absolutely right no one can be in such matters nor does a day pass without convincing every honest student of antiquity of some partial error and showing him better how to think and where to look  but i knew that there was no hope of my being able to enter with advantage on the fields of history opened by the splendid investigation of recent philologists though i could qualify myself by attention and sympathy to understand here and there a verse of homers or hesiods as the simple people did for whom they sang  even while i correct these sheets for press a lecture by professor tyndall has been put into my hands which i ought to have heard last 16th january but was hindered by mischance and which i now find completes in two important particulars the evidence of an instinctive truth in ancient symbolism showing first that the greek conception of an ætherial element pervading space is justified by the closest reasoning of modern physicists and secondly that the blue of the sky hitherto thought to be caused by watery vapour is indeed reflected from the divided air itself so that the bright blue of the eyes of athena and the deep blue of her ægis prove to be accurate mythic expressions of natural phenomena which it is an uttermost triumph of recent science to have revealed  indeed it would be difficult to imagine triumph more complete  to form within an experimental tube a bit of more perfect sky than the sky itself here is magic of the finest sort singularly reversed from that of old time which only asserted its competency to enclose in bottles elemental forces that werenot of the sky  let me in thanking professor tyndall for the true wonder of this piece of work ask his pardon and that of all masters in physical science for any words of mine either in the following pages or elsewhere that may ever seem to fail in the respect due to their great powers of thought or in the admiration due to the far scope of their discovery  but i will be judged by themselves if i have not bitter reason to ask them to teach us more than yet they have taught  this first day of may 1869 i am writing where my work was begun thirtyfive years ago within sight of the snows of the higher alps  in that half of the permitted life of man i have seen strange evil brought upon every scene that i best loved or tried to make beloved by others the light which once flushed those pale summits with its rose at dawn and purple at sunset is now umbered and faint the air which once inlaid the clefts of all their golden crags with azure is now defiled with languid coils of smoke belched from worse than volcanic fires their very glacier waves are ebbing and their snows fading as if hell had breathed on them the waters that once sank at their feet into crystalline rest are now dimmed and foul from deep to deep and shore to shore  these are no careless wordsthey are accurately horribly true i know what the swiss lakes were no pool of alpine fountain at its source was clearer  this morning on the lake of geneva at half a mile from the beach i could scarcely see my oarblade a fathom deep  the light the air the waters all defiled  how of the earth itself take this one fact for type of honour done by the modern swiss to the earth of his native land  there used to be a little rock at the end of the avenue by the port of neuchâtel there the last marble of the foot of jura sloping to the blue water and at this time of year covered with bright pink tufts of saponaria  i went three days since to gather a blossom at the place  the goodly native rock and its flowers were covered with the dust and refuse of the town but in the middle of the avenue was a newlyconstructed artificial rockery with a fountain twisted through a spinning spout and an inscription on one of its loosetumbled stones        aux botanistes       le club jurassique  ah masters of modern science give me back my athena out of your vials and seal if it may be once more asmodeus therein  you have divided the elements and united them enslaved them upon the earth and discerned them in the stars  teach us now but this of them which is all that man need knowthat the air is given to him for his life and the rain to his thirst and for his baptism and the fire for warmth and the sun for sight and the earth for his meatand his rest  vevay may 1 1869     the queen of the air    i  athena chalinitis athena in the heavens    athena the restrainer  the name is given to her as having helped bellerophon to bridle pegasus the flying cloud   lecture on the greek myths of storm given partly in university       college london march 9 1869   1 i will not ask your pardon for endeavoring to interest you in the subject of greek mythology but i must ask your permission to approach it in a temper differing from that in which it is frequently treated we cannot justly interpret the religion of any people unless we are prepared to admit that we ourselves as well as they are liable to error in matters of faith and that the convictions of others however singular may in some points have been well founded while our own however reasonable may be in some particulars mistaken  you must forgive me therefore for not always distinctively calling the creeds of the past superstition and the creeds of the present day religion as well as for assuming that a faith now confessed may sometimes be superficial and that a faith long forgotten may once have been sincere it is the task of the divine to condemn the errors of antiquity and of the philologists to account for them i will only pray you to read with patience and human sympathy the thoughts of men who lived without blame in a darkness they could not dispel and to remember that whatever charge of folly may justly attach to the saying there is no god the folly is prouder deeper and less pardonable in saying there is no god but for me  2 a myth in its simplest definition is a story with a meaning attached to it other than it seems to have at first and the fact that it has such a meaning is generally marked by some of its circumstances being extraordinary or in the common use of the word unnatural  thus if i tell you that hercules killed a waterserpent in the lake of lerna and if i mean and you understand nothing more than that fact the story whether true or false is not a myth  but if by telling you this i mean that hercules purified the stagnation of many streams from deadly miasmata my story however simple is a true myth only as if i leftit in that simplicity you would probably look for nothing beyond it will be wise in me to surprise your attention by adding some singular circumstance for instance that the watersnake had several heads which revived as fast as they were killed and which poisoned even the foot that trod upon them as they slept  and in proportion to the fulness of intended meaning i shall probably multiply and refine upon these improbabilities as suppose if instead of desiring only to tell you that hercules purified a marsh i wished you to understand that he contended with the venom and vapor of envy and evil ambition whether in other mens souls or in his own and choked that malaria only by supreme toili might tell you that this serpent was formed by the goddess whose pride was in the trial of hercules and that its place of abode as by a palmtree and that for every head of it that was cut off two rose up with renewed life and that the hero found at last that he could not kill the creature at all by cutting its heads off or crushing them but only by burning them down and that the midmost of them could not be killed even that way but had to be buried alive  only in proportion as i mean more  i shall certainly appear more absurd in my statement and at last when i get unendurably significant all practical persons will agree that i was talking mere nonsense from the beginning and never meant anything at all  3  it is just possible however also that the storyteller may all along have meant nothing but what he said and that incredible as the events may appear he himself literally believedand expected you also to believeall this about hercules without any latent moral or history whatever  and it is very necessary in reading traditions of this kind to determine first of all whether you are listening to a simple person who is relating what at all events he believes to be true and may therefore possibly have been so to some extent or to a reserved philosopher who is veiling a theory of the universe under the grotesque of a fairy tale  it is in general more likely that the first supposition should be the right one simple and credulous persons are perhaps fortunately more common than philosophers and it is of the highest importance that you should take their innocent testimony as it was meant and not efface under the graceful explanation which your cultivated ingenuity may suggest either the evidence their story may contain such as it is worth of an extraordinary event having really taken place or the unquestionable light which it will cast upon the character of the person by whom it was frankly believed  and to deal with greek religion honestly you must at once understand that this literal belief was in the mind of the general people as deeply rooted as ours in the legends of our own sacred book and that a basis of unmiraculous event was as little suspected and an explanatory symbolism as rarely traced by them as by us  you must therefore observe that i deeply degrade the position which such a myth as that just referred to occupied in the greek mind by comparing it for fear of offending you to our story of st george and the dragon  still the analogy is perfect in minor respects and though it fails to give you any notion of the greek faith it will exactly illustrate the manner in which faith laid hold of its objects  4  this story of hercules and the hydra then was to the general greek mind in its best days a tale about a real hero and a real monster  not one in a thousand knew anything of the way in which the story had arisen any more than the english peasant generally is aware of the plebeian original of st george or supposes that there were once alive in the world with sharp teeth and claws real and very ugly flying dragons on the other hand few persons traced any moral or symbolical meaning in the story and the average greek was as far from imagining any interpretation like that i have just given you as an average englishman is from seeing is st george the red cross knight of spenser or in the dragon the spirit of infidelity  but for all that there was a certain undercurrent of consciousness in all minds that the figures meant more than they at first showed and according to each mans own faculties of sentiment he judged and read them just as a knight of the garter reads more in the jewel on his collar than the george and dragon of a publichouse expresses to the host or to his customers  thus to the mean person the myth always meant little to the noble person much and the greater their familiarity with it the more contemptible it became to one and the more sacred to the other until vulgar commentators explained it entirely away while virgil made the crowning glory of his choral hymn to hercules        around thee powerless to infect thy soul       rose in his crested crowd the lerna worm                            non te rationis egentem       lernæus turbâ capitum circumstetit anguis  and although in any special toil of the heros life the moral interpretation was rarely with definiteness attached to the event yet in the whole course of the life not only for a symbolical meaning but the warrant for the existence of a real spiritual power was apprehended of all men  hercules was no dead hero to be remembered only as a victor over monsters of the pastharmless now as slain  he was the perpetual type and mirror of heroism and its present and living aid against every ravenous form of human trial and pain  5  but if we seek to know more than this and to ascertain the manner in which the story first crystallized into its shape we shall find ourselves led back generally to one or other of two sourceseither to actual historical events represented by the fancy under figures personifying them or else to natural phenomena similarly endowed with life by the imaginative power usually more or less under the influence of terror  the historical myths we must leave the masters of history to follow they and the events they record being yet involved in great though attractive and penetrable mystery  but the stars and hills and storms are with us now as they were with others of old and it only needs that we look at them with the earnestness of those childish eyes to understand the first words spoken of them by the children of men and then in all the most beautiful and enduring myths we shall find not only a literal story of a real person not only a parallel imagery of moral principle but an underlying worship of natural phenomena out of which both have sprung and in which both forever remain rooted  thus from the real sun rising and settingfrom the real atmosphere calm in its dominion of unfading blue and fierce in its descent of tempestthe greek forms first the idea of two entirely personal and corporal gods whose limbs are clothes in divine flesh and whose brows are crowned with divine beauty yet so real that the quiver rattles at their shoulder and the chariot bends beneath their weight  and on the other hand collaterally with these corporeal images and never for one instant separated from them he conceives also two omnipresent spiritual influences as the sun with a constant fire whatever in humanity is skilful and wise and the other like the living air breathes the calm of heavenly fortitude and strength of righteous anger into every human breast that is pure and brave  6  now therefore in nearly every myth of importance and certainly in every one of those which i shall speak tonight you have to discern these three structural partsthe root and the two branches the root in physical existence sun or sky or cloud or sea then the personal incarnation of that becoming a trusted and companionable deity with whom you may walk hand in hand as a child with its brother or its sister and lastly the moral significance of the image which is in all the great myths eternally and beneficently true  7  the great myths that is to say myths made by great people  for the first plain fact about mythmaking is one which has been most strangely lost sight ofthat you cannot make a myth unless you have something to make it of  you cannot tell a secret which you dont know  if the myth is about the sky it must have been made by somebody who has looked at the sky  if the myth is about justice and fortitude it must have been made by someone who knew what it was to be just or patient  according to the quantity of understanding in the person will be the quantity of significance in his fable and the myth of a simple and ignorant race must necessarily mean little because a simple and ignorant race have little to mean  so the great question in reading a story is always not what wild hunter dreamed or what childish race first dreaded it but what wise man first perfectly told and what strong people first perfectly lived by it  and the real meaning of any myth is that which it has at the noblest age of the nation among whom it is current  the farther back you pierce the less significance you will find until you come to the first narrow thought which indeed contains the germ of the accomplished tradition but only as the seed contains the flower  as the intelligence and passion of the race develop they cling to and nourish their beloved and sacred legend leaf by leaf it expands under the touch of more pure affections and more delicate imagination until at last the perfect fable burgeons out into symmetry of milky stem and honied bell  8  but through whatever changes it may pass remember that our right reading of it is wholly dependent on the materials we have in our own minds for an intelligent answering sympathy  if it first arose among a people who dwelt under stainless skies and measures their journeys by ascending and declining stars we certainly cannot read their story if we have never seen anything above us in the day but smoke nor anything around us in the night but candles  if the tale goes on to change clouds or planets into living creaturesto invest them with fair forms and inflame them with mighty passionswe can only understand the story of the humanhearted things in so far as we ourselves take pleasure in the perfectness of visible form or can sympathize by an effort of imagination with the strange people who had other loves than those of wealth and other interests than those of commerce  and lastly if the myth complete itself to the fulfilled thoughts of the nation by attributing to the gods whom they have carved out of their fantasy continual presence with their own souls and their every effort for good is finally guided by the sense of the companionship the praise and the pure will of immortals we shall be able to follow them into this last circle of their faith only in the degree in which the better parts of our own beings have been also stirred by the aspects of nature or strengthened by her laws  it may be easy to prove that the ascent of apollo in his chariot signifies nothing but the rising of the sun  but what does the sunrise itself signify to us  if only languid return to frivolous amusement or fruitless labor it will indeed not be easy for us to conceive the power over a greek of the name of apollo  but if fir us also as for the greek the sunrise means daily restoration to the sense of passionate gladness and of perfect lifeif it means the thrilling of new strength through every nervethe shedding over us of a better peace than the peace of night in the power of the dawnand the purging of evil vision and fear by the baptism of its dewif the sun itself is an influence to us also of spiritual goodand becomes thus in reality not in imagination to us also a spiritual powerwe may then soon overpass the narrow limit of conception which kept that power impersonal and rise with the greek to the thought of an angel who rejoiced as a strong man to run his course whose voice calling to life and to labor rang round the earth and whose going forth was to the ends of heaven  9  the time then at which i shall take up for you as well as i can decipher it the traditions of the gods of greece shall be near the beginning of its central and formed faithabout 500 bca faith of which the character is perfectly represented by pindar and Æschylus who are both of them outspokenly religious and entirely sincere men while we may always look back to find the less developed thought of the preceding epoch given by homer in a more occult subtle halfinstinctive and involuntary way  10  now at that culminating period of the greek religion we find under one governing lord of all things four subordinate elemental forces and four spiritual powers living in them and commanding them the elements are of course the wellknown four of the ancient world the earth the waters the fire and the air and the living powers of them are demeter the latin ceres poseidon the latin neptune apollo who has retained always his greek name and athena the latin minerva each of these are descended from or changed from more ancient and therefore more mystic deities of the earth and heaven and of a finer element of æther supposed to be beyond the heavens but at this time we find the four quite definite both in their kingdoms and in their personalities  they are the rulers of the earth that we tread upon and the air that we breathe and are with us closely in their vivid humanity as the dust that they animate and the winds that they bridle i shall briefly define for you the range of their separate dominions and then follow as far as we have time the most interesting of the legends which relate to the queen of the air    and by modern science now also asserted and with probability argued to exist   11  the rule of the first spirit demeter the earth mother is over the earth first as the origin of all lifethe dust from whence we were taken secondly as the receiver of all things back at last into silence dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return  and therefore as the most tender image of this appearing and fading life in the birth and fall of flowers her daughter proserpine plays in the fields of sicily and thence is torn away into darkness and becomes the queen of fatenot merely of death but of the gloom which closes over and ends not beauty only but sin and chiefly of sins the sin against the life she gave so that she is in her highest power persephone the avenger and purifier of bloodthe voice of thy brothers blood cries to me out of the ground  then side by side with this queen of the earth we find a demigod of agriculture by the ploughthe lord of grain or of the thing ground by the mill  and it is a singular proof of the simplicity of greek character at this noble time that of all representations left to us of their deities by their art few are so frequent and none perhaps so beautiful as the symbol of this spirit of agriculture  12  then the dominant spirit of the element water is neptune but subordinate to him are myriads of other water spirits of whom nereus is the chief with palæmon and leucothea the white lady of the sea and thetis and nymphs innumerable who like her could suffer a sea change while the river deities had each independent power according to the preciousness of their streams to the cities fed by themthe fountain arethuse and thou honoured flood smooth sliding mincius crowned with vocal reeds  and spiritually this king of the waters is lord of the strength and daily flow of human lifehe gives it material force and victory which as the meaning of the dedication of the hair as the sign of the strength of life to the river or the native land  13  demeter then over the earth and its giving and receiving of life neptune over the waters and the flow and force of lifealways among the greeks typified by the horse which was to them as a crested seawave animated and bridled  then the third element fire has set over it two powers over earthly fire the assistant of human labor is set hephæstus lord of all labor in which is the flush and the sweat of the brow and over heavenly fire the source of day is set apollo the spirit of all kindling purifying and illuminating intellectual wisdom each of these gods having also their subordinate or associated powers servant or sister or companion muse  14  then lastly we come to the myth which is to be our subject of closer inquirythe story of athena and of the deities subordinate to her  this great goddess the neith of the egyptians the athena or athenaia of the greeks and with broken power half usurped by mars the minerva of the latins is physically the queen of the air having supreme power both over its blessing of calm and wrath of storm and spiritually she is the queen of the breath of man first of the bodily breathing which is life to his blood and strength to his arm in battle and then of the mental breathing or inspiration which is his moral health and habitual wisdom wisdom of conduct and of the heart as opposed to the wisdom of imagination and the brain moral as distinct from intellectual inspired as distinct from illuminated  15  by a singular and fortunate though i believe wholly accidental coincidence the heartvirtue of which she is the spirit was separated by the ancients into four divisions which have since obtained acceptance from all men as rightly discerned and have received as if from the quarters of the four winds of which athena is the natural queen the name of cardinal virtues namely prudence the right seeing and foreseeing of events through darkness justice the righteous bestowal of favor and of indignation fortitude patience under trial by pain and temperance patience under trial by pleasure  with respect to these four virtues the attributes of athena are all distinct  in her prudence or sight in darkness she is glaukopis owleyed  in her justice which is the dominant virtue she wears two robes one of light and one of darkness the robe of light saffron color or the color of the daybreak falls to her feet covering her wholly with favor and lovethe calm of the sky in blessing it is embroidered along its edge with her victory over the giants the troublous powers of the earth and the likeness of it was woven yearly by the athenian maidens and carried to the temple of their own athena not to the parthenon that was the temple of all the worlds athenabut this they carried to the temple of their own only one who loved them and stayed with them always  then her robe of indignation is worn on her breast and left arm only fringed with fatal serpents and fastened with gorgonian cold turning men to stone physically the lightning and hail of chastisement by storm  then in her fortitude she wears the crested and unstooping hemlet and lastly in her temperance she is the queen of maidenhoodstainless as the air of heaven    there are many other meanings in the epithet see farther on §91 pp 133 134  i am compelled for clearness sake to mark only one meaning at a time  athenas helmet is sometimes a mask sometimes a sign of anger sometimes of the highest light of æther but i cannot speak of all this at once   16  but all these virtues mass themselves in the greek mind into the two main onesof justice or noble passion and fortitude or noble patience and of these the chief powers of athena the greeks have divinely written for them and for all men after them two mighty songs one of the menis mens passion or zeal of athena breathed into a mortal whose name is ache of heart and whose short life is only the incarnate brooding and burst of storm and the other is of the foresight and fortitude of athena maintained by her in the heart of a mortal whose name is given to him from a longer grief odysseus the full of sorrow the much enduring and the longsuffering    this first word of the iliad menis afterwards passes into the latin mens is the root of the latin name for athena minerva and so the root of the english mind   17  the minor expressions by the greeks in word in symbol and in religious service of this faith are so many and so beautiful that i hope some day to gather at least a few of them into a separate body of evidence respecting the power of athena and of its relations to the ethical conception of the homeric poems or rather to their ethical nature for they are not conceived didactically but are didactic in their essence as all good art is  there is an increasing insensibility to this character and even an open denial of it among us now which is one of the most curious errors of modernismthe peculiar and judicial blindness of an age which having long practised art and poetry for the sake of pleasure only has become incapable of reading their language when they were both didactic and also having been itself accustomed to a professedly didactic teaching which yet for private interests studiously avoids collision with every prevalent vice of its day and especially with avarice has become equally dead to the intensely ethical conceptions of a race which habitually divided all men into two broad classes of worthy or worthlessgood and good for nothing  and even the celebrated passage of horace about the iliad is now misread or disbelieved as if it were impossible that the iliad could be instructive because it is not like a sermon  horce does not say that it is like a sermon and would have been still less likely to say so if he ever had had the advantage of hearing a sermon  i have been reading that story of troy again thus he writes to a noble youth of rome whom he cared for quietly at præneste while you have been busy at rome and truly i think that what is base and what is noble and what useful and useless may be better learned from that than from all chrysippus and crantors talk put together  which is profoundly true not of the iliad only but of all other great art whatsoever for all pieces of such art are didactic in the purest way indirectly and occultly so that first you shall only be bettered by them if you are already hard at work in bettering yourself and when you are bettered by them it shall be partly with a general acceptance of their influence so constant and subtile that you shall be no more conscious of it than of the healthy digestion of food and partly by a gift of unexpected truth which you shall only find by slow mining for itwhich is withheld on purpose and closelocked that you may not get it till you have forged the key of it in a furnace of your own heating  and this withholding of their meaning is continual and confessed in the great poets  thus pindar says of himself there is many an arrow in my quiver full of speech to the wise but for the many they need interpreters  and neither pindar nor Æschylus nor hesiod nor homer nor any of the greater poets or teachers of any nation or time ever spoke but with intentional reservation nay beyond this there is often a meaning which they themselves cannot interpert sicwhich it may be for ages long after them to intrepert sicin what they said so far as it recorded true imaginative vision  for all the greatest myths have been seen by the men who tell them involuntarily and passivelyseen by them with as great distinctness and in some respects though not in all under conditions as far beyond the control of their will as a dream sent to any of us by night when we dream clearest and it is this veracity of vision that could not be refused and of moral that could not be foreseen which in modern historical inquiry has been left wholly out of account being indeed the thing which no merely historical investigator can understand or even believe for it belongs exclusively to the creative or artistic group of men and can only be interpreted by those of their race who themselves in some measure also see visions and dream dreams    note once for all that unless when there is question about some particular expression i never translate literally but give the real force of what is said as i best can freely   so that you may obtain a more truthful idea of the nature of greek religion and legend from the poems of keats and the nearly as beautiful and in general grasp of subject far more powerful recent work of morris than from frigid scholarship however extensive  not that the poets impressions or renderings of things are wholly true but their truth is vital not formal  they are like sketches from the life by reynolds or gainsborough which may be demonstrably inaccurate or imaginary in many traits and indistinct in others yet will be in the deepest sense like and true while the work of historical analysis is too often weak with loss through the very labor of its miniature touches or useless in clumsy and vapid veracity of externals and complacent security of having done all that is required for the portrait when it has measured the breadth of the forehead and the length of the nose  18  the first of requirements then for the right reading of myths is the understanding of the nature of all true vision by noble persons namely that it is founded on constant laws common to all human nature that it perceives however darkly things which are for all ages true that we can only understand it so far as we have some perception of the same truth and that its fulness is developed and manifested more and more by the reverberation of it from minds of the same mirrortemper in succeeding ages  you will understand homer better by seeing his reflection in dante as you may trace new forms and softer colors in a hillside redoubled by a lake  i shall be able partly to show you even tonight how much in the homeric vision of athena has been made clearer by the advance of time being thus essentially and eternally true but i must in the outset indicate the relation to that central thought of the imagery of the inferior deities of storm  19  and first i will take the myth of Æolus the sage hippotades of milton as it is delivered pure by homer from the early times  why do you suppose milton calls him sage  one does not usually think of the winds as very thoughtful or deliberate powers  but hear homer then we came to the Æolian island and there dwelt Æolus hippotades dear to the deathless gods there he dwelt in a floating island and round it was a wall of brass that could not be broken and the smooth rock of it ran up sheer  to whom twelve children were born in the sacred chamberssix daughters and six strong sons and they dwell foreer with their beloved father and their mother strict in duty and with them are laid up a thousand benefits and the misty house around them rings with fluting all the day long  now you are to note first in this description the wall of brass and the sheer rock  you will find throughout the fables of the tempestgroup that the brazen wall and the precipice occurring in another myth as the brazen tower of danaë are always connected with the idea of the towering cloud lighted by the sun here truly described as a floating island  secondly you hear that all treasures were laid up in them therefore you know this Æolus is lord of the beneficent winds he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries and presently afterwards homer calls him the steward of the winds the master of the storehouse of them  and this idea of gifts and preciousness in the winds of heaven is carried out in the wellknown sequel of the fable Æolus gives them to ulysses all but one bound in leathern bags with a glittering cord of silver and so like bags of treasure that the sailors think they are so and open them to see  and when ulysses is thus driven back to Æolus and prays him again to help him note the deliberate words of the kings refusaldid i not says he send thee on thy way heartily that thou mightest reach thy country thy home and whatever is dear to thee  it is not lawful for me again to send forth favorably on his journey a man hated by the happy gods this idea of the beneficence of Æolus remains to the latest times though virgil by adopting the vulgar change of the cloud island into lipari has lost it a little but even when it is finally explained away by diodorus Æolus is still a kindhearted monarch who lived on the coast of sorrento invented the use of sails and established a system of storm signals  20  another beneficent stormpower boreas occupies an important place in early legend and a singularly principal one in art and i wish i could read to you a passage of plato about the legend of boreas and oreithyia and the breeze and shade of the ilissusnotwithstannding its severe reflection upon persons who waste their time on mythological studies but i must go on at once to the fable with which you are all generally familiar that of the harpies    translated by max müller in the opening of his essay on comparative mythologychips from a german workshop vol ii   this is always connected with that of boreas or the north wind because the two sons of boreas are enemies of the harpies and drive them away into frantic flight  the myth in its first literal form means only the battle between the fair north wind and the foul south one the two harpies stormswift and swiftfoot are the sisters of the rainbow that is to say they are the broken drifts of the showery south wind and the clear north wind drives them back but they quickly take a deeper and more malignant significance  you know the short violent spiral gusts that lift the dust before coming rain the harpies get identified first with these and then with more violent whirlwinds and so they are called harpies the snatchers and are thought of as entirely destructive their manner of destroying being twofoldby snatching away and by defiling and polluting  this is a month in which you may really see a small harpy at her work almost whenever you choose  the first time that there is threatening of rain after two or three days of fine weather leave your window well open to the street and some books or papers on the table and if you do not in a little while know what the harpies mean and how they snatch and how they defile ill give up my greek myths  21  that is the physical meaning  it is now easy to find the mental one  you must all have felt the expression of ignoble anger in those fitful gusts of storm  there is a sense of provocation in their thin and senseless fury wholly different from the nobler anger of the greater tempests  also they seem useless and unnatural and the greek thinks of them always as vile in malice and opposed therefore to the sons of boreas who are kindly winds that fill sails and wave harvestsfull of bracing health and happy impulses  from this lower and merely greater terror always associated with their whirling motion which is indeed indicative of the most destructive winds and they are thus related to the nobler tempests as charybdis to the sea they are devouring and desolating making all things disappear that come in their grasp and so spiritually they are the gusts of vexatious fretful lawless passion vain and overshadowing discontented and lamenting meager and insane spirits of wasted energy and wandering disease and unappeased famine and unsatisfied hope  so you have on the one side the winds of prosperity and health on the other of ruin and sickness  understand that once deeplyany who have ever known the weariness of vain desires the pitiful unconquerable coiling and recoiling famine and thirst of heartand you will know what was in the sound of the harpy celænos shriek from her rock and why in the seventh circle of the inferno the harpies make their nests in the warped branches of the trees that are the souls of suicides  22  now you must always be prepared to read greek legends as you trace threads through figures on a silken damask the same thread runs through the web but it makes part of different figures  joined with other colors you hardly recognize it and in different lights it is dark or light  thus the greek fables blend and cross curiously in different directions till they knit themselves into an arabesque where sometimes you cannot tell black from purple nor blue from emeraldthey being all the truer for this because the truths of emotion they represent are interwoven in the same way but all the more difficult to read and to explain in any order  thus the harpies as they represent vain desire are connected with the sirens who are the spirits of constant desire so that it is difficult sometimes in early art to know which are meant both being represented alike as birds with womens heads only the sirens are the great constant desiresthe infinite sicknesses of heartwhich rightly placed give life and wrongly placed waste it away so that there are two groups of sirens one noble and saving as the other is fatal  but there are no animating or saving harpies their nature is always vexing and full of weariness and thus they are curiously connected with the whole group of legends about tantalus  33  we all know what it is to be tantalized but we do not often think of asking what tantalus was tantalized forwhat he had done to be forever kept hungry in sight of food  well he had not been condemned to this merely for being a glutton  by dante the same punishment is assigned to simple gluttony to purge it away but the sins of tantalus were of a much wider and more mysterious kind  there are four great sins attributed to him one stealing the food of the gods to give it to men another sacrificing his son to feed the gods themselves it may remind you for a moment of what i was telling you of the earthly character of demeter that while the other gods all refuse she dreaming about her lost daughter eats part of the shoulder of pelops before she knows what she is doing another sin is telling the secrets of the gods and only the fourthstealing the golden dog of pandareosis connected with gluttony  the special sense of this myth is marked by pandareos receiving the happy privilege of never being troubled with indigestion the dog in general however mythically represents all utter senseless and carnal desires mainly that of gluttony and in the mythic sense of hadesthat is to say so far as it represents spiritual ruin in this life and not a literal hellthe dog cerberus as its gatekeeperwith this special marking of his character of sensual passion that he fawns on all those who descend but rages against all who would return the virgilian facilis descendus being a later recognition of this mythic character of hades the last labor of hercules is the dragging him up to the light and in some sort he represents the voracity or devouring of hades itself and the mediæval representation of the mouth of hell perpetuates the same thought  then also the power of evil passion is partly associated with the red and scorching light of sirius as opposed to the pure light of the sun he is the dogstar of ruin and hence the continual homeric dwelling upon him and comparison of the flame of anger to his swarthy light only in his scorching it is thirst not hunger over which he rules physically so that the fable of icarius his first master corresponds among the greeks to the legend of the drunkenness of noah    printers error should be 23   the story of actæon the raging death of hecuba and the tradition of the white dog which ate part of hercules first sacrifice and so gave name to the cynosarges are all various phases of the same thoughtthe greek notion of the dog being throughout confused between its serviceable fidelity its watchfulness its foul voracity shamelessness and deadly madness while with the curious reversal or recoil of the meaning which attaches itself to nearly every great mythand which we shall presently see notably exemplified in the relations of the serpent to athenathe dog becomes in philosophy a type of severity and abstinence  24  it would carry us too far aside were i to tell you the story of pandareos dogor rather of jupiters dog for pandareos was its guardian only all that bears on our present purpose is that the guardian of this golden dog had three daughters one of whom was subject to the power of the sirens and is turned into a nightingale and the other two were subject to the power of the harpies and this was what happened to them they were very beautiful and they were beloved by the gods in their youth and all the great goddesses were anxious to bring them up rightly  of all types of young ladies education there is nothing so splendid as that of the younger daughters of pandareos  they have literally the four greatest goddesses for their governesses  athena teaches them domestic accomplishments how to weave and sew and the like artemis teaches them to hold themselves up straight hera how to behave proudly and oppressively to company and aphrodite delightful governess feeds them with cakes and honey all day long  all goes well until just the time when they are going to be brought out then there is a great dispute whom they are to marry and in the midst of it they are carried off by the harpies given by them to be slaves to the furies and never seen more  but of course there is nothing in greek myths and one never heard of such things as vain desires and empty hopes and clouded passions defiling and snatching away the souls of maidens in a london season  i have no time to trace for you any more harpy legends though they are full of the most curious interest but i may confirm for you my interpretation of this one and prove its importance in the greek mind by noting that polygnotus painted these maidens in his great religious series of paintings at delphi crowned with flowers and playing at dice and that penelope remembers them in her last fit of despair just before the return of ulysses and prays bitterly that she may be snatched away at once into nothingness by the harpies like pandareos daughters rather than be tormented longer by her deferred hope and anguish of disappointed love  25  i have hitherto spoken only of deities of the winds  we pass now to a far more important group the deities of cloud  both of these are subordinate to the ruling power of the air as the demigods of the fountains and minor seas are to the great deep but as the cloudfirmament detaches itself more from the air and has a wider range of ministry than the minor streams and seas the highest cloud deity hermes has a rank more equal with athena than nereus or proteus with neptune and there is greater difficulty in tracing his character because his physical dominion over the clouds can of course be asserted only where clouds are and therefore scarcely at all in egypt so that the changes which hermes undergoes in becoming a greek from an egyptian and phnician god are greater than in any other case of adopted tradition  in egypt hermes is a deity of historical record and a conductor of the dead to judgment the greeks take away much of this historical function assigning it to the muses but in investing him with the physical power over clouds they give him that which the muses disdainthe power of concealment and of theft  the snatching away by the harpies is with brute force but the snatching away by the clouds is connected with the thought of hiding and of making things seem to be what they are not so that hermes is the god of lying as he is of mist and yet with this ignoble function of making things vanish and disappear is connected the remnant of his grand egyptian authority of leading away souls in the cloud of death the actual dimness of sight caused by mortal wounds physically suggesting the darkness and descent of clouds and continually being so described in the iliad while the sense of the need of guidance on the untrodden road follows necessarily you cannot but remember how this thought of cloud guidance and cloud receiving souls at death has been elsewhere ratified    i believe that the conclusions of recent scholarship are generally opposed to the herodotean ideas of any direct acceptance by the greeks of egyptian myths and very certainly greek art is developed by giving the veracity and simplicity of real life to eastern savage grotesque and not by softening the severity of pure egyptian design  but it is of no consequence whether one conception was or was not in this case derived from the other my object is only to mark the essential difference between them   26  without following that higher clue i will pass to the lovely group of myths connected with the birth of hermes on the greek mountains  you know that the valley of sparta is one of the noblest mountain ravines in the world and that the western flank of it is formed by an unbroken chain of crags forty miles long rising opposite sparta to a height of 8000 feet and known as the chain of taygetus  now the nymph from whom that mountain ridge is named was the mother of lacedæmon therefore the mythic ancestress of the spartan race  she is the nymph taygeta and one of the seven stars of spring one of those pleiades of whom is the question to jobcanst thou bind the sweet influences of pleiades or loose the bands of orion  the sweet influences of pleiades of the stars of springnowhere sweeter than among the pineclad slopes of the hills of sparta and arcadia when he snows of their higher summits beneath the sunshine of april fell into fountains and rose into clouds and in every ravine was a newly awakened voice of waterssoft increase of whisper among its sacred stones and on every crag its forming and fading veil of radiant cloud temple above temple of the divine marble that no tool can pollute nor ruin undermine  and therefore beyond this central valley this great greek vase of arcadia on the hollow mountain cyllene or pregnant mountain called also cold because there the vapors rest and born of the eldest of those stars of spring that maia from whom your own month of may has its name bringing to you in the green of her garlands and the white of her hawthorn the unrecognized symbols of the pastures and the wreathed snows of arcadia where long ago she was queen of stars there first cradled and wrapt in swaddlingclothes then raised in a moment of surprise into his wandering poweris born the shepherd of the clouds wingedfooted and deceivingblinding the eyes of argusescaping from the grasp of apollorestless messenger between the highest sky and topmost earth the herald mercury new lighted on a heavenkissing hill    on the altar of hermes on its summit as on that of the lacinian hera no wind ever stirred the ashes  by those altars the gods of heaven were appeased and all their storms at rest   27  now it will be wholly impossible at present to trace for you any of the minor greek expressions of this thought except only that mercury as the cloud shepherd is especially called eriophoros the woolbearer you will recollect the name from the common woolly rush eriophorum which has a cloud of silky seed and note also that he wears distinctively the flap cap petasos named from a word meaning to expand which shaded from the sun and is worn on journeys  you have the epithet of mountains cloudcapped as an established form with every poet and the mont pilate of lucerne is named from a latin word signifying specially a woollen cap but mercury has besides a general homeric epithet curiously and intensely concentrated in meaning the profitable or serviceable by wool that is to say by shepherd wealth hence pecuniarily rich or serviceable and so he passes at last into a general mercantile deity while yet the cloud sense of the wool is retained by homer always so that he gives him this epithet when it would otherwise have been quite meaningless in iliad xxiv 440 when he drives priams chariot and breathes force into his horses precisely as we shall find athena drive diomed and yet the serviceable and profitable senseand something also of gentle and soothing character in the mere woolsoftness as used for dress and religious ritesis retained also in the epithet and thus the gentle and serviceable hermes is opposed to the deceitful one    i am convinced that the eri in eriounios is not intensitive but retained from erion but even if i am wrong in thinking this the mistake is of no consequence with respect to the general force of the term as meaning the profitableness of hermes  athenas epithet of ageleia has a parallel significance transcribers note words inside single apostrophes are greek and use the greek alphabet   28  in connection with this driving of priams chariot remember that as autolycus is the son of hermes the deceiver myrtilus the auriga of the  stars is the son of hermes the guide  the name hermes itself means impulse and he is especially the shepherd of the flocks of the sky in driving or guiding or stealing them and yet his great name argeiphontes not onlyas in different passages of the olden poetsmeans shining white which is said of him as being himself the silver cloud lighted by the sun but arguskiller the killer of rightness which is said of him as he veils the sky and especially the stars which are the eyes of argus or literally eyes of brightness which juno who is with jupiter part of the type of highest heaven keeps in her peacocks train  we know that this interpretation is right from a passage in which euripides describes the shield of hippomedon which bore for his sign argus the allseeing covered with eyes open towards the rising of the stars and closed towards their setting  and thus hermes becomes the spirit of the movement of the sky or firmament not merely the fast flying of the transitory cloud but the great motion of the heavens and stars themselves  thus in his highest power he corresponds to the primo mobile of the later italian philosophy and in his simplest is the guide of all mysterious and cloudy movement and of all successful subtleties  perhaps the prettiest minor recognition of his character is when on the night foray of ulysses and diomed ulysses wear the helmet stolen by autolycus the son of hermes  29  the position in the greek mind of hermes as the lord of cloud is however more mystic and ideal than that of any other deity just on account of the constant and real presence of the cloud itself under different forms giving rise to all kinds of minor fables  the play of the greek imagination in this direction is so wide and complex that i cannot give you an outline of its range in my present limits  there is first a great series of stormlegends connected with the family of the historic Æolus centralized by the story of athamas with his two wives the cloud and the white goddess ending in that of phrixus and helle and of the golden fleece which is only the cloudburden of hermes eriophoros  with this there is the fate of salmoneus and the destruction of the glaucus by his own horses all these minor myths of storm concentrating themselves darkly into the legend of bellerophon and the chimæra in which there is an under story about the vain subduing of passion and treachery and the end of life in fading melancholywhich i hope not many of you could understand even were i to show it you the merely physical meaning of the chimæra is the cloud of volcanic lightning connected wholly with earthfire but resembling the heavenly cloud in its height and its thunder  finally in the Æolic group there is the legend of sisypus which i mean to work out thoroughly by itself its root is in the position of corinth as ruling the isthmus and the two seas the corinthean acropolis two thousand feet high being the centre of the crossing currents of the winds and of the commerce of greece therefore athena and the fountaincloud pegasus are more closely connected with corinth than even with athens in their material though not in their moral power and sisyphus founds the isthmian games in connection with a melancholy story about the sea gods but he himself is kerdotos andron the most gaining and subtle of men who having the key of the isthmus becomes the type of transit transfer or trade as such and of the apparent gain from it which is not gain and this is the real meaning of his punishment in helleternal toil and recoil the modern idol of capital being indeed the stone of sisyphus with a vengeance crushing in its recoil  but throughout the old ideas of the cloud power and cloud feeblenessthe deceit of its hidingand the emptiness of its banishingthe autolycus enchantment of making black seem whiteand the disappointed fury of ixion taking shadow for power mingle in the moral meaning of this and its collateral legends and give an aspect at last not only of foolish cunning but of impiety or literal idolatry imagination worship to the dreams of avarice and injustice until this notion of atheism and insolent blindness becomes principal and the clouds of aristophanes with the personified just and unjust sayings in the latter part of the play foreshadow almost feature by feature in all that they were written to mock and to chastise the worst elements of the impious dinos and tumult in mens thoughts which have followed on their avarice in the present day making them alike forsake the laws of their ancient gods and misapprehended or reject the true words of their existing teachers  30  all this we have from the legends of the historic Æolus only but besides these there is the beautiful story of semele the mother of bacchus  she is the cloud with the strength of the vine in its bosom consumed by the light which matures the fruit the melting away of the cloud into the clean air at the fringe of its edges being exquisitely rendered by pindars epithet for her semele with the stretchedout hair tauuetheira  then there is the entire tradition of the danaides and of the tower of danaë and golden shower the birth of perseus connecting this legend with that of the gorgons and graiæ who are the true clouds of thunderous ruin and tempest  i must in passing mark for you that the form of the sword or sickle of perseus with which he kills medusa is another image of the whirling harpy vortex and belongs especially to the sword of destruction or annihilation whence it is given to the two angels who gather for destruction the evil harvest and evil vintage of the earth rev xiv 15  i will collect afterwards and complete what i have already written respecting the pegasean and gorgonian legends noting here only what is necessary to explain the central myth of athena herself who represents the ambient air which included all cloud and rain and dew and darkness and peace and wrath of heaven  let me now try to give you however briefly some distinct idea of the several agencies of this great goddess  31  i  she is the air giving life and health to all animals      ii  she is the air giving vegetative power to the earth      iii  she is the air giving motion to the sea and rendering            navigation possible      iv  she is the air nourishing artificial light torch or lamplight           as opposed to that of the sun on one hand and of consuming           fire on the other      v  she is the air conveying vibration of sound    not a scientific but a very practical and expressive distinction   i will give you instances of her agency in all these functions  32  first and chiefly she is air as the spirit of life giving vitality to the blood  her psychic relation to the vital force in matter lies deeper and we will examine it afterwards but a great number of the most interesting passages in homer regard her as flying over the earth in local and transitory strength simply and merely the goddess of fresh air  it is curious that the british city which has somewhat saucily styled itself the modern athens is indeed more under her especial tutelage and favor in this respect than perhaps any other town in the island  athena is first simply what in the modern athens you practically find her the breeze of the mountain and the sea and wherever she comes there is purification and health and power  the seabeach round this isle of ours is the frieze of our parthenon every wave that breaks on it thunders with athenas voice nay wherever you throw your window wide open in the morning you let in athena as wisdom and fresh air at the same instant and whenever you draw a pure long full breath of right heaven you take athena into your heart through your blood and with the blood into the thoughts of your brain  now this giving of strength by the air observe is mechanical as well as chemical  you cannot strike a good blow but with your chest full and in hand to hand fighting it is not the muscle that fails first it is the breath the longestbreathed will on the average be the victor not the strongest  note how shakespeare always leans on this  of mortimer in changing hardiment with great glendower  three times they breathed and three times did they drink upon agreement of swift severns flood  and again hotspur sending challenge to prince harry        that none might draw short breath today       but i and harry monmouth  again of hamlet before he receives his wound        hes fat and scant of breath  again orlando in the wrestling        yes i beseech your grace       i am not yet well breathed  now of all the people that ever lived the greeks knew best what breath meant both in exercise and in battle and therefore the queen of the air becomes to them at once the queen of bodily strength in war not mere brutal muscular strengththat belongs to aresbut the strength of young lives passed in pure air and swift exercisecamillas virginal force that flies oer the unbending corn and skims along the main  33  now i will rapidly give you two or three instances of her direct agency in this function  first when she wants to make penelope bright and beautiful and to do away with the signs of her waiting and her grief  then athena thought of another thing she laid her into a deep sleep and loosed all her limbs and made her taller and made her smoother and fatter and whiter than sawn ivory and breathed ambrosial brightness over her face and so she left her and went up to heaven fresh air and sound sleep at night young ladies  you see you may have athena for ladys maid whenever you choose  next hark how she gives strength to achilles when he is broken with fasting and grief  jupiter pities him and says to her daughter mine are you forsaking your own soldier and dont you care for achilles any more  see how hungry and weak he isgo and feed him with ambrosia  so he urged the eager athena and she leaped down out of heaven like a harpy falcon shrillvoiced and she poured nectar and ambrosia full of delight into the breast of achilles that his limbs might not fail with famine then she returned to the solid dome of her strong father  and then comes the great passage about achilles armingfor which we have no time  but here is again athena giving strength to the whole greek army  she came as a falcon to achilles straight at him a sudden drift of breeze but to the army she must come widely she sweeps around them all  as when jupiter spreads the purple rainbow over heaven portending battle or cold storm so athena wrapping herself round with a purple cloud stooped to the greek soldiers and raised up each of them  note that purple in homers use of it nearly always means fiery full of light  it is the light of the rainbow not the color of it which homer means you to think of  34  but the most curious passage of all and fullest of meaning is when she gives strength to menelaus that he may stand unwearied against hector  he prays to her and blueeyed athena was glad that he prayed to her first and she gave him strength in his shoulders and in his limbs an she gave him the courageof what animal do you suppose  had it been neptune or mars they would have given him the courage of a bull or a lion but athena gives him the courage of the most fearless in attack of all creatures small or great and very small it is but wholly incapable of terrorshe gives him the courage of a fly  35  now this simile of homers is one of the best instances i can give you of the way in which great writers seize truths unconsciously which are for all time  it is only recent science which has completely shown the perfectness of this minute symbol of the power of athena proving that the insects flight and breath are coordinated that its wings are actually forcingpumps of which the stroke compels the thoracic respiration and that it thus breathes and flies simultaneously by the action of the same muscles so that respiration is carried on most vigorously during flight while the airvessels supplied by many pairs of lungs instead of one traverse the organs of flight in far greater numbers than the capillary bloodvessels of our own system and give enormous and untiring muscular power a rapidity of action measured by thousands of strokes in the minute and an endurance by miles and hours of flight    ormerod natural history of wasps   homer could not have known this neither that the buzzing of the fly was produced as in a wind instrument by a constant current of air through the trachea  but he had seen and doubtless meant us to remember the marvellous strength and swiftness of the insects flight the glance of the swallow itself is clumsy and slow compared to the darting of common houseflies at play he probably attributed its murmur to the wings but in this also there was a type of what we shall presently find recognized in the name of pallasthe vibratory power of the air to convey sound while as a purifying creature the fly holds its place beside the old symbol of athena in egypt the vulture and as a venomous and tormenting creature has more than the strength of the serpent in proportion to its size being thus entirely representative of the influence of the air both in purification and pestilence and its courage is so notable that strangely enough forgetting homers simile i happened to take the fly for an expression of the audacity of freedom in speaking of quite another subject  whether it should be called courage or mere mechanical instinct may be questioned but assuredly no other animal exposed to continual danger is so absolutely without sign of fear    see farther on §148 pp 154156   36  you will perhaps have still patience to hear two instances not of the communication as strength but of the personal agency of athena as the air  when she comes down to help diomed against ares she does not come to fight instead of him but she takes his charioteers place  she snatched the reins she lashed with all her force and full on mars impelled the foaming horse  ares is the first to cast his spear thennote thispope says        pallas opposed her hand and caused to glance       far from the car the strong immortal lance  she does not oppose her hand in the greekthe wind could not meet the lance straightshe catches it in her hand and throws it off  there is no instance in which a lance is so parried by a mortal hand in all the iliad and it is exactly the way the wind would parry it catching it and turning it aside  if there are any good rifleshots here they know something about athenas parrying and in old times the english masters of feathered artillery knew more yet  compare also the turning of hectors lance from achilles iliad xx 439  37  the last instance i will give you is as lovely as it is subtile throughout the iliad athena is herself the will or menis of achilles if he is to be calmed it is she who calms him if angered it is she who inflames him  in the first quarrel with atreides when he stands at pause with the great sword half drawn athena came from heaven and stood behind him and caught him by the yellow hair  another god would have stayed his hand upon the hilt but athena only lifts his hair  and he turned and knew her and her dreadful eyes shone upon him  there is an exquisite tenderness in this laying her hand upon his hair for it is the talisman of his life vowed to his own thessalian river if he ever returned to its shore and cast upon patroclus pile so ordaining that there should be no return  38  secondly athena is the air giving vegetative impulse to the earth she is the wind and the rain and yet more the pure air itself getting at the earth fresh turned by spade or plough and above all feeding the fresh leaves for though the greeks knew nothing about carbonic acid they did know that trees fed on the air  now note first in this the myth of the air getting at ploughed land you know i told you the lord of all labor by which man lived was hephæstus therefore athena adopts a child of his and of the earth erichthoniusliterally the tearer up of the ground who is the head though not in direct line of the kings of attica and having adopted him she gives him to be brought up by the three nymphs of the dew  of these aglauros the dweller in the fields is the envy or malice of the earth she answers nearly to the envy of cain the tiller of the ground against his shepherd brother in her own envy against her two sisters herse the cloud dew who is the beloved of the shepherd mercury and pandrosos the diffused dew or dew of heaven  literally you have in this myth the words of the blessing of esau thy dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven from above  aglauros is for her envy turned into a black stone and hers is one of the voices the other being that of cainwhich haunts the circle of envy in the purgatory        io sono aglauro chi divenne sasso  but to her two sisters with erichthonius or the hero erectheus is built the most sacred temple of athena in athens the temple to their own dearest athenato her and to the dew together so that it was divided into two parts one the temple of athena of the city and the other that of the dew  and this expression of her power as the air bringing the dew to the hill pastures in the central temple of the central city of the heathen dominant over the future intellectual world is of all the facts connected with her worship as the spirit of life perhaps the most important  i have no time now to trace for you the hundredth part of the different ways in which it bears both upon natural beauty and on the best order and happiness of mens lives  i hope to follow out some of these trains of thought in gathering together what i have to say about field herbage but i must say briefly here that the great sign to the greeks of the coming of spring in the pastures was not as with us in the primrose but in the various flowers of the asphodel tribe of which i will give you some separate account presently therefore it is that the earth answers with crocus flame to the cloud on ida and the power of athena in eternal life is written by the light of the asphodel on the elysian fields  but further athena is the air not only to the lilies of the field but to the leaves of the forest  we saw before the reason why hermes is said to be the son of maia the eldest of the sister stars of spring  those stars are called not only pleiades but vergiliæ from a word mingling the ideas of the turning or returning of springtime with the outpouring of rain  the mother of vergil bearing the name of maia vergil himself received his name from the seven stars and he forming first the mind of dante and through him that of chaucer besides whatever special minor influence came from the pastorals and georgics became the fountainhead of all the best literary power connected with the love of vegetative nature among civilized races of men  take the fact for what it is worth still it is a strange seal of coincidence in word and in reality upon the greek dream of the power over human life and its purest thoughts in the stars of spring  but the first syllable of the name of vergil has relation also to another group of words of which the english ones virtue and virgin bring down the force to modern days  it is a group containing mainly the idea of spring or increase of life in vegetationthe rising of the new branch of the tree out of the bud and of the new leaf out of the ground  it involves secondarily the idea of greenness and of strength but primarily that of living increase of a new rod from a stock stem or root there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jesse and chiefly the stem of certain plantseither of the rose tribe as in the budding of the almond rod of aaron or of the olive tribe which has triple significance in this symbolism from the use of its oil for sacred anointing for strength in the gymnasium and for light  hence in numberless divided and reflected ways it is connected with the power of hercules and athena hercules plants the wild olive for its shade on the course of olympia and it thenceforward gives the olympic crown of consummate honor and rest while the prize at the panathenaic games is a vase of its oil meaning encouragement to continuance of effort and from the paintings on these panathenaic vases we get the most precious clue to the entire character of athena  then to express its propagation by slips the trees from which the oil was to be taken were called moriai trees of division being all descendents of the sacred one in the erechtheum  and thus in one direction we get to the children like olive plants round about thy table and the olive grafting of st paul while the use of the oil for anointing gives chief name to the rod itself of the stem of jesse and to all those who were by that name signed for his disciples first in antioch  remember further since that name was first given the influence of the symbol both in extreme unction and in consecration of priests and kings to their divine right and thing if you can reach with any grasp of thought what the influence on the earth has been of those twisted branches whose leaves give gray bloom to the hillsides under every breeze that blows from the midland sea  but above and beyond all think how strange it is that the chief agonia of humanity and the chief giving of strength from heaven for its fulfilment should have been under its night shadow in palestine  39  thirdly athena is the air in its power over the sea  on the earliest panathenaic vase knownthe burgon vase in the british museumathena has a dolphin on her shield  the dolphin has two principal meanings in greek symbolism  it means first the sea secondarily the ascending and descending course of any of the heavenly bodies from one sea horizon to anotherthe dolphins arching rise and replunge in a summer evening out of calm sea their black backs roll round with exactly the slow motion of a waterwheel but i do not know how far aristotles exaggerated account of their leaping or their swiftness has any foundation being taken as a type of the emergence of the sun or stars from the sea in the east and plunging beneath in the west  hence apollo when in his personal power he crosses the sea leading his cretan colonists to pytho takes the form of a dolphin becomes apollo delphinius and names the founded colony delphi  the lovely drawing of the delphic apollo on the hydria of the vatican le normand and de witte vol ii p 6 gives the entire conception of this myth  again the beautiful coins of tarentum represent taras coming to found the city riding on a dolphin whose leaps and plunges have partly the rage of the sea in them and partly the spring of the horse because the splendid riding of the tarentines had made their name proverbial in magna græca  the story of arion is a collateral fragment of the same thought and again the plunge before their transformation of the ships of Æneas  then this idea of career upon or conquest of or by dolphinlike ships compare the merlin prophecy              they shall ride             over ocean wide       with hempen bridle ad horse of tree  connects itself with the thought of undulation and of the wavepower in the sea itself which is always expressed by the serpentine bodies either of the seagods or of the seahorse and when athena carries as she does often in later work a serpent for her shieldsign it is not so much the repetition of her own ægissnakes as the further expression of her power over the seawave which finally vergil gives in its perfect unity with her own anger in the approach of the serpents against laocoön from the sea and then finally when her own stormpower is fully put forth on the ocean also and the madness of the ægissnake is give to the wavesnake the seawave becomes the devouring hound at the waist of scylla and athena takes scylla for her helmetcrest while yet her beneficent and essential power on the ocean in making navigation possible is commemorated in the panathenaic festival by her peplus being carried to the erechtheum suspended from the mast of a ship  in plate cxv of vol ii le normand are given two sides of a vase which in rude and childish ways assembles most of the principal thoughts regarding athena in this relation  in the first the sunrise is represented by the ascending chariot of apollo foreshortened the light is supposed to blind the eyes and no face of the god is seen turner in the ulysses and polyphemus sunrise loses the form of the god in light giving the chariothorses only rendering in his own manner after 2200 years of various fall and revival of the arts precisely the same thought as the old greek potter  he ascends out of the sea but the sea itself has not yet caught the light  in the second design athena as the morning breeze and hermes as the morning cloud fly over the sea before the sun  hermes turns back his head his face is unseen in the cloud as apollos in the light the grotesque appearance of an animals face is only the cloudphantasm modifying a frequent form of the hair of hermes beneath the back of his cap  under the morning breeze the dolphins leap from the rippled sea and their sides catch the light  the coins of the lucanian heracleia give a fair representation of the helmed athena as imagined in later greek art with the embossed scylla  40  fourthly athena is the air nourishing artificial lightunconsuming fire  therefore a lamp was always kept burning in the erechtheum and the torchrace belongs chiefly to her festival of which the meaning is to show the danger of the perishing of the light even by excess of the air that nourishes it and so that the race is not to the swift but to the wise  the household use of her constant light is symbolized in the lovely passage in the odyssey where ulysses and his son move the armor while the servants are shut in their chambers and there is no one to hold the torches for them but athena herself having a golden lamp fills all the rooms with light  her presence in warstrength with her favorite heroes is always shown by the unwearied fire hovering on their helmets and shields and the image gradually becomes constant and accepted both for the maintenance of household watchfulness as in the parable of the ten virgins or as the symbol of direct inspiration in the rushing wind and divided flames of pentecost but together with this thought of unconsuming and constant fire there is always mingled in the greek mind the sense of the consuming by excess as of the flame by the air so also of the inspired creature by its own fire thus again the zeal of thine house hath eaten me upmy zeal hath consumed me because of thine enemies and the like and especially athena has this aspect towards the truly sensual and bodily strength so that to ares who is himself insane and consuming the opposite wisdom seems to be insane and consuming all we the other gods have thee against us o jove when we would give grace to men for thou hast begotten the maid without a mind the mischievous creature the doer of unseemly evil  all we obey thee and are ruled by thee  her only thou wilt not resist in anything she says or does because thou didst bear herconsuming child as she is  41  lastly athena is the air conveying vibration of sound  in all the loveliest representations in central greek art of the birth of athena apollo stands close to the sitting jupiter singing with a deep quiet joyfulness to his lyre  the sun is always thought of as the master of time and rhythm and as the origin of the composing and inventive discovery of melody but the air as the actual element and substance of the voice the prolonging and sustaining power of it and the symbol of its moral passion  whatever in music is measured and designed belongs therefore to apollo and the muses whatever is impulsive and passionate to athena hence her constant strength a voice or cry as when she aids the shout of achilles curiously opposed to the dumbness of demeter  the apolline lyre therefore is not so much the instrument producing sound as its measurer and divider by length or tension of string into given notes and i believe it is in a double connection with its office as a measurer of time or motion and its relation to the transit of the sun in the sky that hermes forms it from the tortoiseshell which is the image of the dappled concave of the cloudy sky  thenceforward all the limiting or restraining modes of music belong to the muses but the more passionate music is wind music as in the doric flute  then when this inspired music becomes degraded in its passion it sinks into the pipe of pan and the double pipe of marsyas and is then rejected by athena  the myth which represents her doing so is that she invented the double pipe from hearing the hiss of the gorgonian serpents but when she played upon it chancing to see her face reflected in water she saw that it was distorted whereupon she threw down the flute which marsyas found  then the strife of apollo and marsyas represents the enduring contest between music in which the words and thought lead and the lyre measures or melodizes them which pindar means when he calls his hymns kings over the lyre and music in which the words are lost and the wind or impulse leadsgenerally therefore between intellectual and brutal or meaningless music  therefore when apollo prevails he flays marsyas taking the limit and external bond of his shape from him which is death without touching the mere muscular strength yet shameful and dreadful in dissolution  42  and the opposition of these two kinds of sound is continually dwelt upon by the greek philosophers the real fact at the root of all music is the natural expression of a lofty passion for a right cause that in proportion to the kingliness and force of any personality the expression either of its joy or suffering becomes measured chastened calm and capable of interpretation only by the majesty of ordered beautiful and worded sound  exactly in proportion to the degree in which we become narrow in the cause and conception of our passions incontinent in the utterance of them feeble of perseverance in them sullied or shameful in the indulgence of them their expression by musical sound becomes broken mean fatuitous and at last impossible the measured waves of the air of heaven will not lend themselves to expression of ultimate vice it must be forever sunk into discordance or silence  and since as before stated every work of right art has a tendency to reproduce the ethical state which first developed it this which of all the arts is most directly in power of discipline the first the simplest the most effective of all instruments of moral instruction while in the failure and betrayal of its functions it becomes the subtlest aid of moral degradation  music is thus in her health the teacher of perfect order and is the voice of the obedience of angels and the companion of the course of the spheres of heaven and in her depravity she is also the teacher of perfect disorder and disobedience and the gloria in excelsis becomes the marseillaise  in the third section of this volume i reprint two chapters from another essay of mine the cestus of aglaia on modesty or measure and on liberty containing further reference to music in her two powers and i do this now because among the many monstrous and misbegotten fantasies which are the spawn of modern license perhaps the most impishly opposite to the truth is the conception of music which has rendered possible the writing by educated persons and more strangely yet the tolerant criticism of such words as these this so persuasive art is the only one that has no didactic efficacy that engenders no emotions save such as are without issue on the side of moral truth that expresses nothing of god nothing of reason nothing of human liberty  i will not give the authors name the passage is quoted in the westminster review for last january 1869  43  i must also anticipate something of what i have to say respecting the relation of the power of athena to organic life so far as to note that her name pallas probably refers to the quivering or vibration of the air and to its power whether as vital force or communicated wave over every kind of matter in giving it vibratory movement first and most intense in the voice and throat of the bird which is the air incarnate and so descending through the various orders of animal life to the vibrating and semivoluntary murmur of the insect and lower still to the hiss or quiver of the tail of the halflunged snake and deaf adder all these nevertheless being wholly under the rule of athena as representing either breath or vital nervous power and therefore also in their simplicity the oaten pipe and pastoral song which belong to her dominion over the asphodel meadows and breathe on their banks of violets  finally is it not strange to think of the influence of this one power of pallas in vibration we shall see a singular mechanical energy of it presently in the serpents motion in the voices of war and peace  how much of the repose how much of the wrath folly and misery of men has literally depended on this one power of the air on the sound of the trumpet and of the bell on the larks song and the bees murmur  44  such is the general conception in the greek mind of the physical power of athena  the spiritual power associated with it is of two kinds first she is the spirit of life in material organism not strength in the blood only but formative energy in the clay and secondly she is inspired and impulsive wisdom in human conduct and human art giving the instinct of infallible decision and of faultless invention  it is quite beyond the scope of my present purposeand indeed will only be possible for me at all after marking the relative intention of the apolline mythsto trace for you the greek conception of athena as the guide of moral passion  but i will at least endeavor on some near occasion to define some of the actual truths respecting the vital force in created organism and inventive fancy in the works of man which are more or less expressed by the greeks under the personality of athena you would perhaps hardly bear with me if i endeavored further to show youwhat is nevertheless perfectly truethe analogy between the spiritual power of athena in her gentle ministry yet irresistible anger with the ministry of anther spirit whom we also holding for the universal power of life are forbidden at our worst peril to quench or to grieve    i have tried to do this in mere outline in the two following sections of this volume   45  but i think tonight you should not let me close without requiring of me an answer on one vital point namely how far these imaginations of godswhich are vain to uswere vain to those who had no better trust and what real belief the greek had in these creations of his own spirit practical and helpful to him in the sorrow of earth i am able to answer you explicitly in this  the origin of his thoughts is often obscure and we may err in endeavoring to account or their form of realization but the effect of that realization on his life is not obscure at all  the greek creed was of course different in its character as our own creed is according to the class of persons who held it  the common peoples was quite literal simple and happy their idea of athena was as clear as a good roman catholic peasants idea of the madonna  in athens itself the centre of thought and refinement pisistratus obtained the reins of government through the ready belief of the populace that a beautiful woman armed like athena was the goddess herself  even at the close of the last century some of this simplicity remained among the inhabitants of the greek islands and when a pretty english lady first made her way into the grotto of antiparos she was surrounded on her return by all the women of the neighboring village believing her to be divine and praying her to heal them of their sicknesses  46  then secondly the creed of the upper classes was more refined and spiritual but quite as honest and even more forcible in its effect on the life  you might imagine that the employment of the artifice just referred to implied utter unbelief in the persons contriving it but it really meant only that the more worldly of them would play with a popular faith of their own purposes as doublyminded persons have often done since all the while sincerely holding the same ideas themselves in a more abstract form while the good and unworldly men the true greek heroes lived by their faith as firmly as st louis or the cid or the chevalier bayard  47  then thirdly the faith of the poets and artists was necessarily less definite being continually modified by the involuntary action of their own fancies and by the necessity of presenting in clear verbal or material form things of which they had no authoritative knowledge their faith was in some respects like dantes or miltons firm in general conception but not able to vouch for every detail in the forms they gave it but they went considerably farther even in that minor sincerity than subsequent poets and strove with all their might to be as near the truth as they could  pindar says quite simply i cannot think soandso of the gods  it must have been this wayit cannot have been that waythat the thing was done  and as late among the latins as the days of horace this sincerity remains  horace is just as true and simple in his religion as wordsworth but all power of understanding any of the honest classic poets has been taken away from most english gentlemen by the mechanical drill in versewriting at school  throughout the whole of their lives afterwards they never can get themselves quit of the notion that all verses were written as an exercise and that minerva was only a convenient word for the last of a hexameter and jupiter for the last but one  48  it is impossible that any notion can be more fallacious or more misleading in its consequences  all great song from the first day when human lips contrived syllables has been sincere song  with deliberate didactic purpose the tragedianswith pure and native passion the lyrists fitted their perfect words to their dearest faiths  operosa parvus carmina fingo  i little thing that i am weave my laborious songs as earnestly as the bee among the bells of thyme on the matin mountains yes and he dedicates his favorite pine to diana and he chants his autumnal hymn to the faun that guards his fields and he guides the noble youth and maids of rome in their choir to apollo and he tells the farmers little girl that the gods will love her though she has only a handful of salt and meal to give themjust as earnestly as ever english gentleman taught christian faith to english youth in englands truest days  49  then lastly the creed of the philosophers of sages varied according to the character and knowledge of each their relative acquaintance with the secrets of natural science their intellectual and sectarian egotism and their mystic or monastic tendencies for there is a classic as well as a mediæval monasticism  they end in losing the life of greece in play upon words but we owe to their early thought some of the soundest ethics and the foundation of the best practical laws yet known to mankind  50  such was the general vitality of the heathen creed in its strength of its direct influence on conduct it is as i said impossible for me to speak now only remember always in endeavoring to form a judgment of it that what of good or right the heathens did they did looking for no reward  the purest forms of our own religion have always consisted in sacrificing less things to win greater time to win eternity the world to win the skies  the order sell that thou hast is not given without the promise thou shalt have treasure in heaven and well for the modern christian if he accepts the alternative as his master left it and does not practically read the command and promise thus sell that thou hast in the best market and thou shalt have treasure in eternity also but the poor greeks of the great ages expected no reward from heaven but honor and no reward from earth but rest though when on those conditions they patiently and proudly fulfilled their task of the granted day an unreasoning instinct of an immortal benediction broke from their lips in song and they even they had sometimes a prophet to tell them of a land where there is sun alike by day and alike by night where they shall need no more to trouble the earth by strength of hands for daily bread but the ocean breezes blow around the blessed islands and golden flowers burn on their bright trees for evermore    ii  athena keramitis  athena in the earth    athena fit for being made into pottery  i coin the expression as a counterpart of ge parthenia clay intact   study supplementary to the preceding lecture of the supposed and       actual relations of athena to the vital force in material organism   51  it has been easy to decipher approximately the greek conception of the physical power of athena in cloud and sky because we know ourselves what clouds and skies are and what the force of the wind is in forming them  but it is not at all easy to trace the greek thoughts about the power of athena in giving life because we do not ourselves know clearly what life is or in what way the air is necessary to it or what there is besides the air shaping the forms that it is put into  and it is comparatively of small consequence to find out what the greeks thought or meant until we have determined what we ourselves think or mean when we translate the greek word for breathing into the latinenglish word spirit  52  but it is of great consequence that you should fix in your minds and hold against the baseness of mere materialism on the one hand and against the fallacies of controversial speculation on the otherthe certain and practical sense of this word spirit the sense in which you all know that its reality exists as the power which shaped you into your shape and by which you love and hate when you have received that shape you need not fear on the one hand that either the sculpturing or the loving power can ever be beaten down by the philosophers into a metal or evolved by them into a gas but on the other hand take care that you yourself in trying to elevate your conception of it do not lose its truth in a dream or even in a word  beware always of contending for words you will find them not easy to grasp if you know them in several languages  this very word which is so solemn in your mouths is one of the most doubtful  in latin it means little more than breathing and may mean merely accent in french it is not breath but wit and our neighbors are therefore obliged even in their most solemn expressions to say wit when we say ghost  in greek pneuma the word we translate ghost means either wind or breath and the relative word psyche has perhaps a more subtle power yet st pauls words pneumatic body and psychic body involve a difference in his mind which no words will explain  but in greek and in english and in saxon and in hebrew and in every articulate tongue of humanity the spirit of man truly means his passion and virtue and is stately according to the height of his conception and stable according to the measure of his endurance  53 endurance or patience that is the central sign of spirit a constancy against the cold and agony of death and as physically it is by the burning power of the air that the heat of the flesh is sustained so this athena spiritually is the queen of all glowing virtue the unconsuming fire and inner lamp of life  and thus as hephæstus is lord of the fire of the hand and apollo of the fire of the brain so athena of the fire of the heart and as hercules wears for his chief armor the skin of the nemean lion his chief enemy whom he slew and apollo has for his highest name the pythian from his chief enemy the python slain so athena bears always on her breast the deadly face of her chief enemy slain the gorgonian cold and venomous agony that turns living men to stone  54  and so long as you have the fire of the heart within you and know the reality of it you need to be under no alarm as to the possibility of its chemical or mechanical analysis  the philosophers are very humorous in their ecstasy of hope about it but the real interest of their discoveries in this direction is very small to humankind  it is quite true that the tympanum of the ear vibrates under sound and that the surface of the water in a ditch vibrates too but the ditch hears nothing for all that and my hearing is still to me as blessed a mystery as ever and the interval between the ditch and me quite as great  if the trembling sound in my ears was once of the marriagebell which began my happiness and is now of the passingbell which ends it the difference between those two sounds to me cannot be counted by the number of concussions  there have been some curious speculations lately as to the conveyance of mental consciousness by brainwaves  what does it matter how it is conveyed  the consciousness itself is not a wave  it may be accompanied here or there by any quantity of quivers and shakes up or down of anything you can find in the universe that is shakable what is that to me  my friend is dead and myaccording to modern views vibratory sorrow is not one whit less or less mysterious to me than my old quiet one  55  beyond and entirely unaffected by any questionings of this kind there are therefore two plain facts which we should all know first that there is a power which gives their several shapes to things or capacities of feeling and that we can increase or destroy both of these at our will  by care and tenderness we can extend the range of lovely life in plants and animals by our neglect and cruelty we can arrest it and bring pestilence in its stead  again by right discipline we can increase our strength of noble will and passion or destroy both  and whether these two forces are local conditions of the elements in which they appear or are part of a great force in the universe out of which they are taken and to which they must be restored is not of the slightest importance to us in dealing with them neither is the manner of their connection with light and air  what precise meaning we ought to attach to expressions such as that of the prophecy to the four winds that the dry bones might be breathed upon and might live or why the presence of the vital power should be dependent on the chemical action of air and its awful passing away materially signified by the rendering up of that breath or ghost we cannot at present know and need not at any time dispute  what we assuredly know is that the states of life and death are different and the first more desirable than the other and by effort attainable whether we understand being born of the spirit to signify having the breath of heaven in our flesh or its power in our hearts  56  as to its power on the body i will endeavor to tell you having been myself much led into studies involving necessary reference both to natural science and mental phenomena what at least remains to us after science has done its worst what the myth of athena as a formative and decisive power a spirit of creation and volition must eternally mean for all of us  57  it is now i believe i may use the strong word ascertained that heat and motion are fixed in quantity and measurable in the portions that we deal with  we can measure portions of power as we can measure portions of space while yet as far as we know space may be infinite and force infinite  there may be heat as much greater than the suns as the suns heat is greater than a candles and force as much greater than the force by which the world swings as that is greater than the force by which a cobweb trembles  now on hear and force life is inseparably dependent and i believe also on a form of substance which the philosophers call protoplasm  i wish they would use english instead of greek words  when i want to know why a leaf is green they tell me it is colored by chlorophyll which at first sounds very instructive but if they would only say plainly that a leaf is colored green by a thing which is called green leaf we should see more precisely how far we had got however it is a curious fact that life is connected with a cellular structure called protoplasm or in english first stuck together whence conceivably through deuteroplasms or second stickings and tritoplasms or third stickings we reach the highest plastic phase in the human pottery which differs from common chinaware primarily by a measurable degree of heat developed in breathing which it borrows from the rest of the universe while it lives and which it as certainly returns to the rest of the universe when it dies  58  again with this heat certain assimilative powers are connected which the tendency of recent discovery is to simplify more and more into modes of one force or finally into mere motion communicable in various states but not destructible  we will assume that science has done its utmost and that every chemical or animal force is demonstrably resolvable into heat or motion reciprocally changing into each other i would myself like better in order of thought to consider motion as a mode of heat than heat as a mode of motion still granting that we have got thus far we have yet to ask what is heat or what is motion  what is this primo mobile this transitional power in which all things live and move and have their being  it is by definition something different from matter and we may call it as we choose first cause or first light or first heat but we can show no scientific proof of its not being personal and coinciding with the ordinary conception of a supporting spirit in all things  59  still it is not advisable to apply the word spirit or breathing to it while it is only enforcing chemical affinities but when the chemical affinities are brought under the influence of the air and of the suns heat the formative force enters and entirely different phase it does not now merely crystallize indefinite masses but it gives to limited portions of matter the power of gathering selectively other elements proper to them and binding those elements into their own peculiar and adopted form  this force now properly called life or breathing or spirit is continually creating its own shell of definite shape out of the wreck around it and this is what i meant by saying in the ethics of the dust you may always stand by form against force  for the mere force of junction is not spirit but the power that catches out of chaos charcoal water lime or what not and fastens them down into a given form is properly called spirit and we shall not diminish but strengthen our conception of this creative energy by recognizing its presence in lower states of matter than our own such recognition being enforced upon us by delight we instinctively receive from all the forms of matter which manifest it and yet more by the glorifying of those forms in the parts of them that are most animated with the colors that are pleasantest to our senses  the most familiar instance of this is the best and also the most wonderful the blossoming of plants  60  the spirit in the plantthat is to say its power of gathering dead matter out of the wreck round it and shaping it into its own chosen shapeis of course strongest at the moment of its flowering for it then not only gathers but forms with the greatest energy  and where this life is in at full power its form becomes invested with aspects that are chiefly delightful to our own human passions namely at first with the loveliest outlines of shape and secondly with the most brilliant phases of the primary colors blue yellow and red or white the unison of all and to make it all more strange this time of peculiar and perfect glory is associated with relations of the plants or blossoms to each other correspondent to the joy of love in human creatures and having the same object in the continuance of the race only with respect to plants as animals we are wrong in speaking as if the object of this strong life were only the bequeathing of itself  the flower is the end or proper object of the seed not the seed of the flower  the reason for seeds is that flowers may be not the reason of flowers that seeds may be  the flower itself is the creature which the spirit makes only in connection with its perfectness is placed the giving birth to its successor  61  the main fact then about a flower is that it is part of the plants form developed at the moment of its intensest life and this inner rapture is usually marked externally for us by the flush of one or more of the primary colors  what the character of the flower shall be depends entirely upon the portion of the plant into which this rapture of spirit has been put  sometimes the life is put into its outer sheath and then the outer sheath becomes white and pure and full of strength and grace sometimes the life is put into the common leaves just under the blossom and they become scarlet or purple sometimes the life is put into the stalks of the flower and they flush blue sometimes into its outer enclosure or calyx mostly into its inner cup but in all cases the presence of the strongest life is asserted by characters in which the human sight takes pleasure and which seem prepared with distinct reference to us or rather bear in being delightful evidence of having been produced by the power of the same spirit as our own  62  and we are led to feel this still more strongly because all the distinctions of species both in plants and animals appear to have similar connection with human character  whatever the origin of species may be or however those species once formed may be influenced by external accident the groups into which birth or accident reduce them have distinct relation to the spirit of man  it is perfectly possible and ultimately conceivable that the crocodile and the lamb may have descended from the same ancestral atom of protoplasm and that the physical laws of the operation of calcareous slime and of meadow grass on that protoplasm may in time have developed the opposite natures and aspects of the living frames but the practically important fact for us is the existence of a power which creates that calcareous earth itself which creates that separatelyand quartz separately and gold separately and charcoal separately and then so directs the relation of these elements as that the gold shall destroy the souls of men by being yellow and the charcoal destroy their souls by being hard and bright and the quartz represent to them an ideal purity and the calcareous earth soft shall beget crocodiles and dry and hard sheep and that the aspects and qualities of these two products crocodiles and lambs shall be the one repellant to the spirit of man the other attractive to it in a quite inevitable way representing to him states of moral evil and good and becoming myths to him of destruction or redemption and in the most literal sense words of god    the facts on which i am about to dwell are in nowise antagonistic to the theories which mr darwins unwearied and unerring investigations are every day rendering more probable  the æsthetic relations of species are independent of their origin  nevertheless it has always seemed to me in what little work i have done upon organic forms as if the species mocked us by their deliberate imitation of each other when they met yet did not pass one into another   63  and the force of these facts cannot be escaped from by the thought that there are species innumerable passing into each other by regular gradations out of which we choose what we must love or dread and say they were indeed prepared for us  species are not innumerable neither are they now connected by consistent gradation  they touch at certain points only and even then are connected when we examine them deeply in a kind of reticulated way not in chains but in chequers also however connected it is but by a touch of the extremities as it were and the characteristic form of the species is entirely individual  the rose nearly sinks into a grass in the sanguisorba but the formative spirit does not the less clearly separate the ear of wheat from the dogrose and oscillate with tremulous constancy round the central forms of both having each their due relation to the mind of man  the great animal kingdoms are connected in the same way  the bird through the penguin drops towards the fish and the fish in the cetacean reascends to the mammal yet there is no confusion of thought possible between the perfect forms of an eagle a trout and a warhorse in their relations to the elements and to man  64  now we have two orders of animals to take some note of in connection with athena and one vast order of plants which will illustrate this matter very sufficiently for us  the orders of animals are the serpent and the bird the serpent in which the breath or spirit is less than in any other creature and the earthpower the greatest the bird in which the breath or spirit is more full than in any other creature and the earthpower least  65  we will take the bird first  it is little more than a drift of the air in all its quills it breathes through its whole frame and flesh and glows with air in its flying like blown flames it rests upon the air subdues it surpasses it outraces itis the air conscious of itself conquering itself ruling itself  also in the throat of the bird is given the voice of the air  all that in the wind itself is weak wild useless in sweetness is knit together in its song  as we may imagine the wild form of the birds wings so the wild voice of the cloud into its ordered and commanded voice unwearied rippling through the clear heaven in its gladness interpreting all intense passion through the soft spring nights bursting into acclaim and rapture of choir at daybreak or lisping and twittering among the boughs and hedges through heat of day like little winds that only make the cowslip bells shake and ruffle the petals of the wild rose  66  also upon the plumes of the bird are put the colors of the air on these the gold of the cloud that cannot be gathered by any covetousness the rubies of the clouds that are not the price of athena but are athena the vermillion of the cloudbar and the flame of the cloudcrest and the snow of the cloud and its shadow and the melted blue of the deep wells of the skyall these seized by the creating spirit and woven by athena herself into films and threads of plume with wave on wave following and fading along breast and throat and opened wings infinite as the dividing of the foam and the sifting of the seasand even the white down of the cloud seeming to flutter up between the stronger plumesseen but too soft for touch  and so the spirit of the air is put into and upon this created form and it becomes through twenty centuries the symbol of divine help descending as the fire to speak but as the dove to bless  67  next in the serpent we approach the source of a group of myths worldwide founded on great and common human instincts respecting which i must note one or two points which bear intimately on all our subject for it seems to me that the scholars who are at present occupied in interpretation of human myths have most of them forgotten that there are any such thing as natural myths and that the dark sayings of men may be both difficult to read and not always worth reading  and indeed all guidance to the right sense of the human and variable myths will probably depend on our first getting at the sense of the natural and invariable ones  the dead hieroglyph may have meant this or that the living hieroglyph means always the same but remember it is just as much a hieroglyph as the other nay morea sacred or reserved sculpture a thing with an inner language  the serpent crest of the kings crown or of the gods on the pillars of egypt is a mystery but the serpent itself gliding past the pillars foot is it less a mystery  is there indeed no tongue except the mute forked flash from its lips in that running brook of horror on the ground  68  why that horror  we all feel it yet how imaginative it is how disproportioned to the real strength of the creature  there is more poison in an illkept drain in a pool of dishwashing at a cottage door than in the deadliest asp of nile  every back yard which you look down into from the railway as it carries you out by vauxhall or deptford holds its coiled serpent all the walls of those ghastly suburbs are enclosures of tank temples for serpent worship yet you feel no horror in looking down into them as you would if you saw the livid scales and lifted head  there is more venom mortal inevitable in a single word sometimes or in the gliding entrance of a wordless thought than ever vanti libia con sua rena  but that horror is of the myth not of the creature  there are myriads lower than this and more loathsome in the scale of being the links between dead matter and animation drift everywhere unseen  but it is the strength of the base element that is so dreadful in the serpent it is the very omnipotence of the earth  that rivulet of smooth silver how does it flow think you  it literally rows on the earth with every scale for an oar it bites the dust with the ridges of its body  watch it when it moves slowly  a wave but without wind a current but with no fall all the body moving at the same instant yet some of it to one side some to another or some forward and the rest of the coil backwards but all with the same calm will and equal way no contraction no extension one soundless causeless march of sequent rings and spectral processions of spotted dust with dissolution in its fangs dislocation in its coils  startle it the winding stream will become a twisted arrow the wave of poisoned life will lash through the grass like a cast lance  it scarcely breathes with its one lung the other shriveled and abortive it is passive to the sun and shade and is cold or hot like a stone yet it can outclimb the monkey outswim the fish outleap the zebra outwrestle the athlete and crush the tiger  it is a divine hieroglyph of the demoniac power of the earth of the entire earthly nature  as the bird is the clothed power of the air so this is the clothed power of the dust as the bird is the symbol of the spirit of life so this is the grasp and sting of death    i cannot understand this swift forward motion of serpents  the seizure of prey by the constrictor though invisibly swift is quite simple in mechanism it is simply the return to its coil of an opened watchspring and is just as instantaneous  but the steady and continuous motion without a visible fulcrum for the whole body moves at the same instant and i have often seen even small snakes glide as fast as i could walk seems to involve a vibration of the scales quite too rapid to be conceived  the motion of the crest and dorsal fin of the hippocampus which is one of the intermediate types between serpent and fish perhaps gives some resemblance of it dimly visible for the quivering turns the fin into a mere mist  the entrance of the two barbs of a bees sting by alternate motion the teeth of one barb acting as a fulcrum for the other must be something like the serpent motion on a small scale  richard owen   69  hence the continual change in the interpretation put upon it in various religions  as the worm of corruption it is the mightiest of all adversaries of the godsthe special adversary of their light and creative powerpython against apollo  as the power of the earth against the air the giants are serpentbodied in the gigantomachia but as the power of the earth upon the seedconsuming it into new life that which thou sowest is not quickened except it dieserpents sustain the chariot of the spirit of agriculture  70  yet on the other hand there is a power in the earth to take away corruption and to purify hence the very fact of burial and many uses of earth only lately known and in this sense the serpent is a healing spiritthe representative of Æsculapius and of hygieia and is a sacred earthtype in the temple of the native earth of athens so that its departure from the temple was a sign to the athenians that they were to leave their homes  and then lastly as there is a strength and healing in the earth no less than the strength of air so there is conceived to be a wisdom of earth no less than a wisdom of the spirit and when its deadly power is killed its guiding power becomes true so that the python serpent is killed at delphi where yet the oracle is from the breath of the earth  71  you must remember however that in this as in every other instance i take the myth at its central time  this is only the meaning of the serpent to the greek mind which could conceive an athena  its first meaning to the nascent eyes of men and its continued influence over degraded races are subjects of the most fearful mystery  mr fergusson has just collected the principal evidence bearing on the matter in a work of very great value and if you read his opening chapters they will put  you in possession of the circumstances needing chiefly to be considered  i cannot touch upon any of them here except only to point out that though the doctrine of the socalled corruption of human nature asserting that there is nothing but evil in humanity is just as blasphemous and false as a doctrine of the corruption of physical nature would be asserting there was nothing but evil in the earth there is yet the clearest evidence of a disease plague or cretinous imperfection of development hitherto allowed to prevail against the greater part of the races of men and this in monstrous ways more full of mystery than the serpentbeing itself  i have gathered for you tonight only instances of what is beautiful in greek religion but even in its best time there were deep corruptions in other phases of it and degraded forms of many of its deities all originating in a misunderstood worship of lower races little less than these corrupted forms of devotion can be found all having a strange and dreadful consistency with each other and infecting christianity even at its strongest periods with fatal terror of doctrine and ghastliness of symbolic conception passing through fear into frenzied grotesque and thence into sensuality  in the psalter of st louis itself half of its letters are twisted snakes there is scarcely a wreathed ornament employed in christian dress or architecture which cannot be traced back to the serpents coil and there is rarely a piece of monkish decorated writing in the world that is not tainted with some illmeant vileness of grotesque nay the very leaves of the twisted ivypattern of the fourteenth century can be followed back to wreaths for the foreheads of bacchanalian gods and truly it seems to me as i gather in my mind the evidences of insane religion degraded art merciless war sullen toil detestable pleasure and vain or vile hope in which the nations of the world have lived since first they could bear record of themselvesit seems to me i say as if the race itself were still halfserpent not extricated yet from its clay a lacertine breed of bitternessthe glory of it emaciate with cruel hunger and blotted on the leaf a glittering slime and in the sand a useless furrow  72  there are no myths therefore by which the moral state and fineness of intelligence of different races can be so deeply tried or measured as by those of the serpent and the bird both of them having an especial relation to the kind of remorse for sin or for the grief in fate of which the national minds that spoke by them had been capable  the serpent and vulture are alike emblems of immortality and purification among races which desired to be immortal and pure and as they recognize their own misery the serpent becomes to them the scourge of the furies and the vulture finds its eternal prey in their breast  the bird long contests among the egyptians with the still received serpent symbol of power  but the draconian image of evil is established in the serpent apap while the birds wings with the globe become part of a better symbol of deity and the entire form of the vulture as an emblem of purification is associated with the earliest conception of athena  in the type of the dove with the olive branch the conception of the spirit of athena in renewed life prevailing over ruin is embodied for the whole of futurity while the greeks to whom in a happier climate and higher life than that of egypt the vulture symbol of cleansing became unintelligible took the eagle instead for their hieroglyph of supreme spiritual energy and it thenceforward retains its hold on the human imagination till it is established among christian myths as the expression of the most exalted form of evangelistic teaching  the special relation of athena to her favorite bird we will trace presently the peacock of hera and dove of aphrodite are comparatively unimportant myths but the bird power is soon made entirely human by the greeks in their flying angel of victory partially human with modified meaning of evil in the harpy and siren and thenceforward it associates itself with the hebrew cherubim and has had the most singular influence on the christian religion by giving its wings to render the conception of angels mysterious and untenable and check rational endeavor to determine the nature of subordinate spiritual agency while yet it has given to that agency a vague poetical influence of the highest value in its own imaginative way  73  but with the early serpentworship there was associated another that of the groves of which you will also find the evidence exhaustively collected in mr fergussens work  this treeworship may have taken a dark form when associated with the draconian one or opposed as in judea to a purer faith but in itself i believe it was always healthy and though it retains little definite hieroglyphic power in subsequent religion it becomes instead of symbolic real the flowers and trees are themselves beheld and beloved with a halfworshipping delight which is always noble and healthful  and it is among the most notable indications of the volition of the animating power that we find the ethical signs of good and evil set on these also as well as upon animals the venom of the serpent and in some respects its image also being associated even with the passionless growth of the leaf out of the ground while the distinctions of species seem appointed with more definite ethical address to the intelligence of man as their material products become more useful to him  74  i can easily show this and at the same time make clear the relation to other plants of the flowers which especially belong to athena by examining the natural myths in the groups of the plants which would be used at any country dinner over which athena would in her simplest household authority cheerfully rule here in england  suppose horaces favorite dish of beans with the bacon potatoes some savory stuffing of onions and herbs with the meat celery and a radish or two with the cheese nuts and apples for desert and brown bread  75  the beans are from earliest time the most important and interesting of the seeds of the great tribe of plants from which came the latin and french name for all kitchen vegetablesthings that are gathered with the handpodded seeds that cannot be reaped or beaten or shaken down but must be gathered green  leguminous plants all of them having flowers like butterflies seeds in frequently pendent pods lætum siliqua quassante legumensmooth and tender leaves divided into many minor ones strange adjuncts of tendril for climbing and sometimes of thorn exquisitely sweet yet pure scents of blossom and almost always harmless if not serviceable seeds  it is of all tribes of plants the most definite its blossoms being entirely limited in their parts and not passing into other forms  it is also the most usefully extended in range and scale familiar in the height of the forest acacia laburnum judastree familiar in the sown fieldbean and vetch and pea familiar in the pasturein every form of clustered clover and sweet trefoil tracery the most entirely serviceable and human of all orders of plants  76  next in the potato we have the scarcely innocent underground stem of one of a tribe set aside for evil having the deadly nightshade for its queen and including the henbane the witchs mandrake and the worst natural curse of modern civilizationtobacco  and the strange thing about this tribe is that though thus set aside for evil they are not a group distinctly separate from those that are happier in function  there is nothing in other tribes of plants like the form of the bean blossom but there is another family of forms and structure closely connected with this venomous one  examine the purple and yellow bloom of the common hedge nightshade you will find it constructed exactly like some of the forms of the cyclamen and getting this clue you will find at last the whole poisonous and terrible group to besisters of the primulas    it is not easy to estimate the demoralizing effect on the youth of europe of the cigar in enabling them to pass their time happily in idleness   the nightshades are in fact primroses with a curse upon them and a sign set in their petals by which the deadly and condemned flowers may always be known from the innocent onesthat the stamens of the nightshades are between the lobes and of the primulas opposite the lobes of the corolla  77  next side by side in the celery and radish you have the two great groups of unbelled and cruciferous plants alike in conditions of rank among herbs both flowering in clusters but the unbelled group flat the crucifers in spires both of them mean and poor in the blossom and losing what beauty they have by too close crowding both of them having the most curious influence on human character in the temperate zones of the earth from the days of the parsley crown and hemlock drink and mocked euripidean chervil until now but chiefly among the northern nations being especially plants that are of some humble beauty and the crucifers of endless use when they are chosen and cultivated but that run to wild waste and are the signs of neglected ground in their rank or ragged leaves and meagre stalks and pursed or podded seed clusters capable even under cultivation of no perfect beauty thought reaching some subdued delightfulness in the ladys smock and the wallflower for the most part they have every floral quality meanly and in vainthey are white without purity golden without preciousness redundant without richness divided without fineness massive without strength and slender without grace  yet think over that useful vulgarity of theirs and of the relations of german and english peasant character to its food of kraut and cabbage as of arab character to its food of palmfruit and you will begin to feel what purposes of the forming spirit are in these distinctions of species  78  next we take the nuts and applesthe nuts representing one of the groups of catkined trees whose blossoms are only tufts and dust and the other the rose tribe in which fruit and flower alike have been the types to the highest races of men of all passionate temptation or pure delight from the coveting of eve to the crowing of the madonna above the              rosa sempiterna       che si dilata rigrada e ridole       odor di lode al sol  we have no time now for these we must go on to the humblest group of all yet the most wonderful that of the grass which has given us our bread and from that we will go back to the herbs  79  the vast family of plants which under rain make the earth green for man and under sunshine give him bread and in their springing in the early year mixed with their native flowers have given us far more than the new leaves of trees the thought and word of spring divide themselves broadly into three great groupsthe grasses sedges and rushes  the grasses are essentially a clothing for healthy and pure ground watered by occasional rain but in itself dry and fit for all cultivated pasture and corn  they are distinctively plants with round and jointed stems which have long green flexible leaves and heads of seed independently emerging from them  the sedges are essentially the clothing of waste and more or less poor or uncultivated soils coarse in their structure frequently triangular in stemhence called acute by virgiland with their heads of seed not extricated from their leaves now in both the sedges and grasses the blossom has a common structure though undeveloped in the sedges but composed always of groups of double husks which have mostly a spinous process in the centre sometimes projecting into a long awn or beard this central process being characteristic also of the ordinary leaves of mosses as if a moss were a kind of ear of corn made permanently green on the ground and with a new and distinct fructification  but the rushes differ wholly from the sedge and grass in their blossom structure  it is not a dual cluster but a twice threefold one so far separate from the grasses and so closely connected with a higher order of plants that i think you will find it convenient to group the rushes at once with that higher order to which if you will for the present let me give the general name of drosidæ or dewplants it will enable me to say what i have to say of them much more shortly and clearly  80  these drosidæ then are plants delighting in interrupted moisture or at certain seasonsinto dry ground  they are not among waterplants but the signs of water resting among dry places  many of the true waterplants have triple blossoms with a small triple calyx holding them in the drosidæ the floral spirit passes into the calyx also and the entire flower becomes a sixrayed star bursting out of the stem laterally as if it were the first of flowers and had made its way to the light by force through the unwilling green  they are often required to retain moisture or nourishment for the future blossom through long times of drought and this they do in bulbs under ground of which some become a rude and simple but most wholesome food for man  81  so now observe you are to divide the whole family of the herbs of the field into three great groupsdrosidæ carices gramineæ dewplants sedges and grasses  then the drosidæ are divided into five great orders lilies asphodels amaryllids irids and rushes  no tribes of flowers have had so great so varied or so healthy an influence on man as this great group of drosidæ depending not so much on the whiteness of some of their blossoms or the radiance of others as on the strength and delicacy of the substance of their petals enabling them to take forms of faultless elastic curvature either in cups as the crocus or expanding bells as the true lily or heathlike bells as the hyacinth or bright and perfect stars like the star of bethlehem or when they are affected by the strange reflex of the serpent nature which forms the labiate group of all flowers closing into forms of exquisitely fantastic symmetry in the gladiolus  put by their side their nereid sisters the waterlilies and you have them in the origin of the loveliest forms of ornamental design and the most powerful floral myths yet recognized among human spirits born by the streams of ganges nile arno and avon    i think carex will be found ultimately better than cyperus for the generic name being the vergilian word and representing a larger subspecies   82  for consider a little what each of those five tribes has been to the spirit of man  first in their nobleness the lilies gave the lily of the annunciation the asphodels the flower of the elysian fields the irids the fleurdelys of chivalry and the amaryllids christs lily of the field while the rush trodden always under foot became the emblem of humility  then take each of the tribes and consider the extent of their lower influence  perditas the crown imperial lilies of all kinds are the first tribe which giving the type of perfect purity in the madonnas lily have by their lovely form influenced the entire decorative design of italian sacred art while ornament design of war was continually enriched by the curves of the triple petals of the florentine giglio and french fleurdelys so that it is impossible to count their influence for good in the middle ages partly as a symbol of womanly character and partly of the utmost brightness and refinement of chivalry in the city which was the flower of cities    take this rough distinction of the four tribes lilies superior ovary white seeds asphodels superior ovary black seeds irids inferior ovary style typically rising into central crest amaryllids inferior ovary stamens typically joined in central cup  then the rushes are a dark group through which they stoop to the grasses   afterwards the group of the turbanlilies or tulips did some mischief their splendid stains having made them the favorite caprice of florists but they may be pardoned all such guilt for the pleasure they have given in cottage gardens and are yet to give when lowly life may again be possible among us and the crimson bars of the tulips in their trim beds with their likeness in crimson bars of morning above them and its dew glittering heavy globed in their glossy cups may be loved better than the gray nettles of the ash heap under gray sky unveined by vermilion or by gold  83  the next great group of the asphodels divides itself also into two principal families one in which the flowers are like stars and clustered characteristically in balls though opening sometimes into looser heads and the other in which the flowers are in long bells opening suddenly at the lips and clustered in spires on a long stem or drooping from it when bent by their weight  the stargroup of the squills garlics and onions has always caused me great wonder  i cannot understand why its beauty and serviceableness should have been associated with the rank scent which has been really among the most powerful means of degrading peasant life and separating it from that of the higher classes  the belled group of the hyacinth and convallaria is as delicate as the other is coarse the unspeakable azure light along the ground of the wood hyacinth in english spring the grape hyacinth which is in south france as if a cluster of grapes and a hive of honey had been distilled and compressed together into one small boss of celled and beaded blue the lilies of the valley everywhere in each sweet and wild recess of rocky landscount the influences of these on childish and innocent life then measure the mythic power of the hyacinth and asphodel as connected with greek thoughts of immortality finally take their useful and nourishing power in ancient and modern peasant life and it will be strange if you do not feel what fixed relation exists between the agency of the creating spirit in these and in us who live by them  84  it is impossible to bring into any tenable compass for our present purpose even hints of the human influence of the two remaining orders of amaryllids and irids only note this generally that while these in northern countries share with the primulas the fields of spring it seems that in greece the primulaceæ are not an extended tribe while the crocus narcissus and amaryllis lutea the lily of the field i suspect also that the flower whose name we translate violet was in truth an iris represented to the greek the first coming of the breath of life on the renewed herbage and became in his thoughts the true embroidery of the saffron robe of athena  later in the year the dianthus which though belonging to an entirely different race of plants has yet a strange look of being made out of the grasses by turning the sheathmembrane at the root of their leaves into a flower seems to scatter in multitudinous families its crimson stars far and wide  but the golden lily and crocus together with the asphodel retain always the old greeks fondest thoughtsthey are only golden flowers that are to burn on the trees and float on the streams of paradise  85  i have but one tribe of plants more to note at our country feast the savory herbs but must go a little out of my way to come at them rightly  all flowers whose petals are fastened together and most of those whose petals are loose are best thought of first as a kind of cup or tube opening at the mouth  sometimes the opening is gradual as in the convolvulus or campanula oftener there is a distinct change of direction between the tube and expanding lip as in the primrose or even a contraction under the lip making the tube into a narrownecked phial or vase as in the heaths but the general idea of a tube expanding into a quatrefoil cinquefoil or sixfoil will embrace most of the forms  86  now it is easy to conceive that flowers of this kind growing in close clusters may in process of time have extended their outside petals rather than the interior ones as the outer flowers of the clusters of many umbellifers actually do and thus elongated and variously distorted forms have established themselves then if the stalk is attached to the side instead of the base of the tube its base becomes a spur and thus all the grotesque forms of the mints violets and larkspurs gradually might be composed  but however this may be there is one great tribe of plants separate from the rest and of which the influence seems shed upon the rest in different degrees and these would give the impression not so much of having been developed by change as of being stamped with a character of their own more or less serpentine or dragonlike  and i think you will find it convenient to call these generally draconidæ disregarding their present ugly botanical name which i do not care even to write onceyou may take for their principal types the foxglove snapdragon and calceolaria and you will find they all agree in a tendency to decorate themselves by spots and with bosses or swollen places in their leaves as if they had been touched by poison the spot of the foxglove is especially strange because it draws the color out of the tissue all around it as if it had been stung and as if the central color was really an inflamed spot with paleness round  then also they carry to its extreme the decoration by bulging or pouting out the petaloften beautifully used by other flowers in a minor degree like the beating out of bosses in hollow silver as in the kalmia beaten out apparently in each petal by the stamens instead of a hammer or the borage pouting towards but the snapdragons and calceolarias carry it to its extreme  87  then the spirit of these draconidæ seems to pass more or less into other flowers whose forms are properly pure vases but it affects some of them slightly others not at all  it never strongly affects the heaths never once the roses but it enters like an evil spirit into the buttercup and turns it into a larkspur with a black spotted grotesque centre and a strange broken blue gorgeous and intense yet impure glittering on the surface as if it were strewn with broken glass and stained or darkening irregularly into red  and then at last the serpent charm changes the ranunculus into monkshood and makes it poisonous  it enters into the forgetmenot and the star of heavenly turquoise is corrupted into the vipers bugloss darkened with the same strange red as the larkspur and fretted into a fringe of thorn it enters together with a strange insectspirit into the asphodels and though with a greater interval between the groups they change to spotted orchideæ it touches the poppy it becomes a fumaria the iris and it pouts into a gladiolus the lily and it chequers itself into a snakeshead and secretes in the deep of its bell drops not of venom indeed but honeydew as if it were a healing serpent  for there is an Æsculapian as well as an evil serpentry among the draconidæ and the fairest of them the erba della madonna of venice linaria cymbalaria descends from the ruins it delights into the herbage at their feet and touches it and behold instantly a vast group of herbs for healingall draconid in formspotted and crested and from their liplike corollas named labiatæ full of various balm and warm strength for healing yet all of them without splendid honor or perfect beauty ground ives richest when crushed under the foot the best sweetness and gentle brightness of the robes of the fieldthyme and marjoram and euphrasy  88  and observe again and again with respect to all these divisions and powers of plants it does not matter in the least by what concurrences of circumstance or necessity they may gradually have been developed the concurrence of circumstance is itself the supreme and inexplicable fact  we always come at last to a formative cause which directs the circumstance and mode of meeting it  if you ask an ordinary botanist the reason of the form of the leaf he will tell you that it is a developed tubercle and that its ultimate form is owing to the directions of its vascular threads  but what directs its vascular threads  they are seeking for something they want he will probably answer  what made them want that  what made them seek for it thus seek for it in five fibres or in three  seek for it in serration or in sweeping curves  seek for it in servile tendrils or impetuous spray  seek for it in woolen wrinkles rough with stings or in glossy surfaces green with pure strength and winterless delight  89  there is no answer  but the sum of all is that over the entire surface of the earth and its waters as influenced by the power of the air under solar light there is developed a series of changing forms in clouds plants and animals all of which have reference in their action or nature to the human intelligence that perceives them and on which in their aspects of horror and beauty and their qualities of good and evil there is engraved a series of myths or words of the forming power which according to the true passion and energy of the human race they have been enabled to read into religion  and this forming power has been by all nations partly confused with the breath or air through which it acts and partly understood as a creative wisdom proceeding from the supreme deity but entering into and inspiring all intelligences that work in harmony with him  and whatever intellectual results may be in modern days obtained by regarding this effluence only as a motion of vibration every formative human art hitherto and the best states of human happiness and order may have depended on the apprehension of its mystery which is certain and of its personality which is probable  90  of its influence on the formative arts i have a few words to say separately my present business is only to interpret as we are now sufficiently enabled to do the external symbols of the myth under which it was represented by the greeks as a goddess of counsel taken first into that breast of their supreme deity then created out of his thoughts and abiding closely beside him always sharing and consummating his power  91  and in doing this we have first to note the meaning of the principal epithet applied to athena glaukopis with eyes full of light the first syllable being connected by its root with words signifying sight not with words signifying color  as far as i can trace the color perception of the greeks i find it all founded primarily on the degree of connection between color and light the most important fact to them in the color of red being its connection with fire and sunshine so that purple is in its original sense firecolor and the scarlet or orange of dawn more than any other firecolor  i was long puzzled by homers calling the sea purple and misled into thinking he meant the color of cloud shadows on green sea whereas he really means the gleaming blaze of the waves under wide light  aristotles idea partly true is that light subdued by blackness becomes red and blackness heated or lighted also becomes red  thus a color may be called purple because it is light subdued and so death is called purple or shadowy death or else it may be called purple as being shade kindled with fire and thus said of the lighted sea or even of the sun itself when it is thought of as a red luminary opposed to the whiteness of the moon purpureos inter soles et candida lunæ sidera or of golden hair pro purpureo pnam solvens scelerata capillo while both ideas are modified by the influence of an earlier form of the word which has nothing to do with fire at all but only with mixing or staining and then to make the whole group of thoughts inextricably complex yet rich and subtle in proportion to their intricacy the various rose and crimson colors of the murex dyethe crimson and purple of the poppy and fruit of the palm and the association of all these with the hue of bloodpartly direct partly through a confusion between the word signifying slaughter and palmfruit color mingle themselves in and renew the whole nature of the old word so that in later literature it means a different color or emotion of color in almost every place where it occurs and cast forever around the reflection of all that has been dipped in its dyes  92  so that the world is really a liquid prism and stream of opal  and then last of all to keep the whole history of it in the fantastic course of a dream warped here and there into wild grotesque we moderns who have preferred to rule over coalmines instead of the sea and so have turned the everlasting lamp of athena into a davys safetylamp in the hand of britannia and athenian heavenly lightning into british subterranean damp have actually got our purple out of coal instead of the sea  and thus grotesquely we have had enforced on us the doubt that held the old word between blackness and fire and have completed the shadow and the fear of it by giving it a name from battle magenta  93  there is precisely a similar confusion between light and color in the word used for the blue of the eyes of athenaa noble confusion however brought about by the intensity of the greek sense that the heaven is light more than it is blue  i was not thinking of this when i wrote in speaking of pictorial chiaroscuro the sky is not blue color merely it is blue fire and cannot be painted mod p iv p 36 but it was this that the greeks chiefly felt of it and so glaukopis chiefly means grayeyed gray standing for a pale or luminous blue but it only means owleyed in thought of the roundness and expansion not from the color this breath and brightness being again in their moral sense typical of the breadth intensity and singleness of the sight in prudence if thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light  then the actual power of the bird to see in twilight enters into the type and perhaps its general fineness of sense  before the human form was adopted her athenas proper symbol was the owl a bird which seems to surpass all other creatures in acuteness of organic perception its eye being calculated to observe objects which to all others are enveloped in darkness its ear to hear sounds distinctly and its nostrils to discriminate effluvia with such nicety that it has been deemed prophetic from discovering the putridity of death even in the first stages of disease    payne knight in his inquiry into the symbolical language of ancient art not trustworthy being little more than a mass of conjectural memoranda but the heap is suggestive if well sifted   i cannot find anywhere an account of the first known occurrence of the type but in the early ones on attic coins the wide round eyes are clearly the principal things to be made manifest  94  there is yet however another color of great importance in the conception of athenathe dark blue of her ægis  just as the blue or gray of her eyes was conceived more as light than color so her aegis was dark blue because the greeks thought of this tint more as shade than color and while they used various materials in ornamentation lapislazuli carbonate of copper or perhaps smalt with real enjoyment of the blue tint it was yet in their minds as distinctly representative of darkness as scarlet was of light and therefore anything dark but especially the color of heavy thundercloud was described by the same term  the physical power of this darkness of the ægis fringed with lightning is given quite simply when jupiter himself uses it to overshadow ida and the plain of troy and withdraws it at the prayer of ajax for light and again when he grants it to be worn for a time by apollo who is hidden by its cloud when he strikes down patroclus but its spiritual power is chiefly expressed by a word signifying deeper shadowthe gloom of erebus or of our evening which when spoken of the ægis signifies not merely the indignation of athena but the entire hiding or withdrawal of her help and beyond even this her deadliest of all hostilitythe darkness by which she herself deceives and beguiles to final ruin those to whom she is wholly adverse this contradiction of her own glory being the uttermost judgment upon human falsehood  thus it is she who provokes pandarus to the treachery which purposed to fulfil the rape of helen by the murder of her husband in time of truce and then the greek king holding his wounded brothers hand prophesies against troy the darkness of the ægis which shall be over all and for ever    in the breastplate and shield of atrides the serpents and bosses are all of this dark color yet the serpents are said to be like rainbows but through all this splendor and opposition of hue i feel distinctly that the literal splendor with its relative shade are prevalent in the conception and that there is always a tendency to look through the hue to its cause  and in this feeling about color the greeks are separated from the eastern nations and from the best designers of christian times  i cannot find that they take pleasure in color for its own sake it may be in something more than color or better but it is not in the hue itself  when homer describes cloud breaking from a mountain summit the crags become visible in light not color he feels only their flashing out in bright edges and trenchant shadows above the infinite unspeakable æther is torn openbut not the blue of it  he has scarcely any abstract pleasure in blue or green or gold but only in their shade or flame  i have yet to trace the causes of this which will be a long task belonging to art questions not to mythological ones but it is i believe much connected with the brooding of the shadow of death over the greeks without any clear hope of immortality  the restriction of the color on their vases to dim red or yellow with black and white is  greatly connected with their sepulchral use and with all the melancholy of greek tragic thought and in this gloom the failure of colorperception is partly noble partly base noble in its earnestness which raises the design of greek vases as far above the designing of mere colorist nations like the chinese as mens thoughts are above childrens and yet it is partly base and earthly and inherently defective in one human faculty and i believe it was one cause of the perishing of their art so swiftly for indeed there is no decline so sudden or down to such utter loss and ludicrous depravity as the fall of greek design on its vases from the fifth to the third century bc  on the other hand the pure coloredgift when employed for pleasure only degrades in another direction so that among the indians chinese and japanese all intellectual progress in art has been for ages rendered impossible by the prevalence of that faculty and yet it is as i have said again and again the spiritual power of art and its true brightness is the essential characteristic of all healthy schools  eremnen aigida pasiil iv 166   95  this then finally was the perfect colorconception of athena the flesh snowwhite the hands feet and face of marble even when the statue was hewn roughly in wood the eyes of keen pale blue often in statues represented by jewels the long robe to the feet crocuscolored and the ægis thrown over it of thunderous purple the helmet golden il v 744 and i suppose its crest also as that of achilles  if you think carefully of the meaning and character which is now enough illustrated for you in each of these colors and remember that the crocuscolor and the purple were both of them developments in opposite directions of the great central idea of firecolor or scarlet you will see that this form of the creative spirit of the earth is conceived as robed in the blue and purple and scarlet the white and the gold which have been recognized for the sacred chords of colors from the day when the cloud descended on a rock more mighty than ida  96  i have spoken throughout hitherto of the conception of athena as it is traceable in the greek mind not as it was rendered by greek art it is matter of extreme difficulty requiring a sympathy at once affectionate and cautious and a knowledge reaching the earliest springs of the religion of many lands to discern through the imperfection and alas more dimly yet through the triumphs of formative art what kind of thoughts they were that appointed for it the tasks of its childhood and watched by the awakening of its strength  the religions passion is nearly always vividest when the art is weakest and the technical skill only reaches its deliberate splendor when the ecstacy which gave it birth has passed away forever  it is as vain an attempt to reason out the visionary power or guiding influence of athena in the greek heart from anything we now read or possess of the work of phidias as it would be for the disciples of some new religion to infer the spirit of christianity from titians assumption  the effective vitality of the religious conception can be traced only through the efforts of trembling hands and strange pleasures of untaught eyes and the beauty of the dream can no more be found in the first symbols by which it is expressed than a childs idea of fairyland can be gathered from its pencil scrawl or a girls love for her broken doll explained by the defaced features  on the other hand the athena of phidias was in very fact not so much the deity as the darling of the athenian people her magnificence represented their pride and fondness more than their piety and the great artist in lavishing upon her dignities which might be ended abruptly by the pillage they provoked resigned apparently without regret the awe of her ancient memory and with only the careless remonstrance of a workman too strong to be proud even the perfectness of his own art  rejoicing in the protection of their goddess and in their own hour of glory the people of athena robed her at their will with the preciousness of ivory and gems forgot or denied the darkness of the breastplate of judgment and vainly bade its unappeasable serpents relax their coils in gold  97  it will take me many a day yetif days many or few are given me to disentangle in anywise the proud and practised disguises of religious creeds from the instinctive arts which grotesquely and indecorously yet with sincerity strove to embody them or to relate  but i think the reader by help even of the imperfect indications already given to him will be able to follow with a continually increasing security the vestiges of the myth of athena and to reanimate its almost evanescent shade by connecting it with the now recognized facts of existent nature which it more or less dimly reflected and foretold  i gather these facts together in brief  98  the deep of air that surrounds the earth enters into union with the earth at its surface and with its waters so as to be the apparent cause of their ascending into life  first it warms them and shades at once staying the heat of the suns rays in its own body but warding their force with its clouds  it warms and cools at once with traffic of balm and frost so that the white wreaths are withdrawn from the field of the swiss peasant by the glow of libyan rock  it gives its own strength to the sea forms and fills every cell of its foam sustains the precipices and designs the valleys of its waves gives the gleam to their moving under the night and the white fire to their plains under sunrise lifts their voices along the rocks bears above them the spray of birds pencils through them the dimpling of unfooted sands  it gathers out of them a portion in the hollow of its hand dyes with that the hills into dark blue and their glaciers with dying rose inlays with that for sapphire the dome in which it has to set the cloud shapes out of that the heavenly flocks divides them numbers cherishes bears them on its bosom calls them to their journeys waits by their rest feeds from them the brooks that cease not and strews with them the dews that cease  it spins and weaves their fleece into wild tapestry rends it and renews and flits and flames and whispers among the golden threads thrilling them with a plectrum of strange fire that traverses them to and fro and is enclosed in them like life  it enters into the surface of the earth subdues it and falls together with it into fruitful dust from which can be moulded flesh it joins itself in dew to the substance of adamant and becomes the green leaf out of the dry ground it enters into the separated shapes of the earth it has tempered commands the ebb and flow of the current of their life fills their limbs with its own lightness measures their existence by its indwelling pulse moulds upon their lips the words by which one soul can be known to another is to them the hearing of the ear and the beating of the heart and passing away leaves them to the peace that hears and moves no more  99  this was the athena of the greatest people of the days of old  and opposite to the temple of this spirit of the breath and lifeblood of man and beast stood on the mount of justice and near the chasm which was haunted by the goddessavengers an altar to a god unknown proclaimed at last to them as one who indeed gave to all men life and breath and all things and rain from heaven filling their hearts with rain from heaven filling their hearts with food and gladness a god who had made of one blood all nations of men who dwell on the face of all the earth and had determined the times of their fate and the bounds of their habitation  100  we ourselves fretted here in our narrow days know less perhaps in very deed than they what manner of spirit we are of or what manner of spirit we ignorantly worship  have we indeed desired the desire of all nations and will the master whom we meant to seem and the messenger in whom we thought we delighted confirm when he comes to his temple or not find in its midstthe tables heavy with gold for bread and the seats that are bought with the price of the dove  or is our own land also to be left by its angered spiritleft among those where sunshine vainly sweet and passionate folly of storm waste themselves in the silent places of knowledge that has passed away and of tongues that have ceased  this only we may discern assuredly this every true light of science every mercifullygranted power every wiselyrestricted thought teach us more clearly day by day that in the heavens above and the earth beneath there is one continual and omnipotent presence of help and of peace for all men who know that they live and remember that they die     iii  athena ergane athena in the heart    athena the worker or having rule over work  the name was first give to her by the athenians   various notes relating to the conception of athena as the directress of       the imagination and will   101  i have now only a few words to say bearing on what seems to me present need respecting the third function of athena conceived as the directress of human passion resolution and labor  few words for i am not yet prepared to give accurate distinction between the intellectual rule of athena and that of the muses but broadly the muses with their king preside over meditative historical and poetic arts whose end is the discovery of light or truth and the creation of beauty but athena rules over moral passion and practically useful art she does not make men learned but prudent and subtle she does not teach them to make their work beautiful but to make it right  in different places of my writings and though many years of endeavor to define the laws of art i have insisted on this rightness in work and on its connection with virtue of character in so many partial ways that the impression left on the readers mindif indeed it was ever impressed at allhas been confused and uncertain  in beginning the series of my corrected works i wish this principle in my own mind the foundation of every other to be made plain if nothing else is and will try therefore to make it so as far as by any effort i can put it into unmistakable words  and at first here is a very simple statement of it given lately in a lecture on the architecture of the valley of the somme which will be better read in this place than in its incidental connection with my account of the porches of abbeville  102  i had used in a preceding part of the lecture the expression by what faults this gothic architecture fell  we continually speak thus of works of art  we talk of their faults and merits as of virtues and vices  what do we mean by talking of the faults of a picture or the merits of a piece of stone  the faults of a work of art are the faults of its workman and its virtues his virtues  great art is the expression of the mind of a great man and mean art that of the want of mind of a weak man  a foolish person builds foolishly and a wise one sensibly a virtuous one beautifully and a vicious one basely  if stone work is well put together it means that a thoughtful man planned it and a careful man cut it and an honest man cemented it  if it has too much ornament it means that its carver was too greedy of pleasure if too little that he was rude or insensitive or stupid and the like  so that when once you have learned how to spell these most precious of all legendspictures and buildingsyou may read the characters of men and of nations in their art as in a mirror nay as in a microscope and magnified a hundredfold for the character becomes passionate in the art and intensifies itself in all its noblest or meanest delights  nay not only as in a microscope but as under a scalpel and in dissection for a man may hide himself from you or misrepresent himself to you every other way but he cannot in his work there be sure you have him to the inmost  all that he likes all that he seesall that he can dohis imagination his affections his perseverance his impatience his clumsiness cleverness everything is there  if the work is a cobweb you know it was made by a spider if a honeycomb by a bee a wormcast is thrown up by a worm and a nest wreathed by a bird and a house built by a man worthily if he is worthy and ignobly if he is ignoble  and always from the least to the greatest as the made thing is good or bad so is the maker of it  103  you will use this faculty of judgment more or less whether you theoretically admit the principle or not  take that floral gable you dont suppose the man who built stonehenge could have built that or that the man who built that would have built stonehenge  do you think an old roman would have liked such a piece of filigree work or that michael angelo would have spent his time in twisting these stems of roses in and out  or of modern handicraftsmen do you think a burglar or a brute or a pickpocket could have carved it  could bill sykes have done it or the dodger dexterous with finger and tool  you will find in the end that no man could have done it but exactly the man who did it and by looking close at it you may if you know your letters read precisely the manner of man he was    the elaborate pendiment above the central porch at the west end of rouen cathedral pierced into a transparent web of tracery and enriched with a border of twisted eglantine   104  now i must insist on this matter for a grave reason  of all facts concerning art this is the one most necessary to be known that while manufacture is the work of hands only art is the work of the whole spirit of man and as that spirit is so is the deed of it and by whatever power of vice or virtue any art is produced the same vice or virtue it reproduces and teaches  that which is born of evil begets evil and that which is born of valor and honor teaches valor and honor all art is either infection or education  it must be one or other of these  105  this i repeat of all truths respecting art is the one of which understanding is the most precious and denial the most deadly  and i assert it the more because it has of late been repeatedly expressly and with contumely denied and that by high authority and i hold it one of the most sorrowful facts connected with the decline of the arts among us that english gentlemen of high standing as scholars and artists should have been blinded into the acceptance and betrayed into the assertion of a fallacy which only authority such as theirs could have rendered for an instant credible  for the contrary of it is written in the history of all great nations it is the one sentence always inscribed on the steps of their thrones the one concordant voice in which they speak to us out of their dust  all such nations first manifest themselves as a pure and beautiful animal race with intense energy and imagination  they live lives of hardship by choice and by grand instinct of manly discipline they become fierce and irresistible soldiers the nation is always its own army and their king or chief head of government is always their first soldier pharaoh or david or leonidas or valerius or barbarossa or coeur de lion or st louis or dandalo or frederick the greategyptian jew greek roman german english french venetianthat is inviolable law for them all their king must be their first soldier or they cannot be in progressive power  then after their great military period comes the domestic period in which without betraying the discipline of war they add to their great soldiership the delights and possessions of a delicate and tender homelife and then for all nations is the time of their perfect art which is the fruit the evidence the reward of their national idea of character developed by the finished care of the occupations of peace  that is the history of all true art that ever was or can be palpably the history of itunmistakablywritten on the forehead of it in letters of lightin tongues of fire by which the seal of virtue is branded as deep as ever iron burnt into a convicts flesh the seal of crime  but always hitherto after the great period has followed the day of luxury and pursuit of the arts for pleasure only  and all has so ended  106  thus far of abbeville building  now i have here asserted two thingsfirst the foundation of art in moral character next the foundation of moral character in war  i must make both these assertions clearer and prove them  first of the foundation of art in moral character  of course artgift and amiability of disposition are two different things for a good man is not necessarily a painter nor does an eye for color necessarily imply an honest mind  but great art implies the union of both powers it is the expression by an artgift of a pure soul  if the gift is not there we can have no art at all and if the souland a right soul too is not there the art is bad however dexterous  107  but also remember that the artgift itself is only the result of the moral character of generations  a bad woman may have a sweet voice but that sweetness of voice comes of the past morality of her race  that she can sing with it at all she owes to the determination of laws of music by the morality of the past  every act every impulse of virtue and vice affects in any creature face voice nervous power and vigor and harmony of invention at once  perseverance in rightness of human conduct renders after a certain number of generations human art possible every sin that clouds it be it ever so little a one and persistent vicious living and following of pleasure render after a certain number of generations all art impossible  men are deceived by the longsuffering of the laws of nature and mistake in a nation the reward of the virtue of its sires for the issue of its own sins  the time of their visitation will come and that inevitably for it is always true that if the fathers have eaten sour grapes the childrens teeth are set on edge  and for the individual as soon as you have learned to read you may as i said know him to the hearts core through his art  let his artgift be never so great and cultivated to the height by the schools of a great race of men and it is still but a tapestry thrown over his own being and inner soul and the bearing of it will show infallibly whether it hangs on a man or on a skeleton  if you are dimeyed you may not see the difference in the fall of the folds at first but learn how to look and the folds themselves will become transparent and you shall see through them the deaths shape or the divine one making the tissue above it as a cloud of right or as a windingsheet  108  then further observe i have said and you will find it true and that to the uttermost that as all lovely art is rooted in virtue so it bares fruit of virtue and is didactic in its own nature  it is often didactic also in actually expressed thought as giottos michael angelos dürers and hundreds more but that is not its special function it is didactic chiefly by being beautiful but beautiful with haunting thought no less than with form and full of myths that can be read only with the heart  for instance at this moment there is open beside me as i write a page of persian manuscript wrought with wreathed azure and gold and soft green and violet and ruby and scarlet into one field of pure resplendence  it is wrought to delight the eyes only and does delight them and the man who did it assuredly had eyes in his head but not much more  it is not didactic art but its author was happy and it will do the good and the harm that mere pleasure can do  but opposite me is an early turner drawing of the lake of geneva taken about two miles from geneva on the lausanne road with mont blanc in the distance  the old city is seen lying beyond the waveless waters veiled with a sweet misty veil of athenas weaving a faint light of morning peaceful exceedingly and almost colorless shed from behind the voirons increases into soft amber along the slope of the salëve and is just seen and no more on the fair warm fields of its summit between the folds of a white cloud that rests upon the grass but rises high and towerlike into the zenith of dawn above  109  there is not as much color in that low amber light upon the hillside as there is in the palest dead leaf  the lake is not blue but gray in mist passing into deep shadow beneath the voirons pines a few dark clusters of leaves a single white flowerscarcely seenare all the gladness given to the rocks of the shore  one of the ruby spots of the eastern manuscript would give color enough for all the red that is in turners entire drawing  for the mere pleasure of the eye there is not so much in all those lines of his throughout the entire landscape as in half an inch square of the persians page  what made him take pleasure in the low color that is only like the brown of a dead leaf in the cold gray of dawnin the one white flower among the rocksin theseand no more than these  110  he took pleasure in them because he had been bred among english fields and hills because the gentleness of a great race was in his heart and its powers of thought in his brain because he knew the stories of the alps and of the cities at their feet because he had read the homeric legends of the clouds and beheld the gods of dawn and the givers of dew to the fields because he knew the faces of the crags and the imagery of the passionate mountains as a man knows the face of his friend because he had in him the wonder and sorrow concerning life and death which are the inheritance of the gothic soul from the days of its first sea kings and also the compassion and the joy that are woven into the innermost fabric of every great imaginative spirit born now in countries that have lived by the christian faith with any courage or truth  and the picture contains also for us just this which its maker had in him to give and can convey it to us just so far as we are of the temper in which it must be received  it is didactic if we are worthy to be taught not otherwise  the pure heart it will make more pure the thoughtful more thoughtful  it has in it no words for the reckless or the base  111  as i myself look at it there is no fault nor folly of my lifeand both have been many and greatthat does not rise up against me and take away my joy and shorten my power of possession of sight of understanding  and every past effort of my life every gleam of rightness or good in it is with me now to help me in my grasp of this art and its vision  so far as i can rejoice in or interpret either my power is owing to what of right there is in me  i dare to say it that because through all my life i have desired good and not evil because i have been kind to many have wished to be kind to all have wilfully injured none and because i have loved much and not selfishly therefore the morning light is yet visible to me on those hills and you who read may trust my thought and word in such work as i have to do for you and you will be glad afterwards that you have trusted them  112  yet rememberi repeat it again and yet againthat i may for once if possible make this thing assuredly clear the inherited artgift must be there as well as the life in some poor measure or rescued fragment right  this artgift of mine could not have been won by any work or by any conduct it belongs to me by birthright and came by athenas will from the air of english country villages and scottish hills  i will risk whatever charge of folly may come on me for printing one of my many childish rhymes written on a frosty day in glen farg just north of loch leven  it bears date 1st january 1828  i was born on the 8th of february 1819 and al that i ever could be and all that i cannot be the weak little rhyme already shows  papa how pretty those icicles are that are seen so nearthat are seen so far those dropping waters that come from the rocks and many a hole like the haunt of a fox that silvery stream that runs babbling along making a murmuring dancing song those trees that stand waving upon the rocks side and men that like specters among them glide and waterfalls that are heard from far and come in sight when very near and the waterwheel that turns slowly round grinding the corn thatrequires to be ground  political economy of the future  and mountains at a distance seen and rivers winding through the plain and quarries with their craggy stones and the wind among them moans  so foretelling stones of venice and this essay on athena  enough now concerning myself  113  of turners life and of its good and evil both great but the good immeasurably the greater his work is in all things a perfect and transparent evidence  his biography is simply he did this nor will ever another do its like again  yet read what i have said of him as compared with the great italians in the passages taken from the cestus of aglaia farther on §158 pp 164 165  114  this then is the nature of the connection between morals and art now secondly i have asserted the foundation of both these at least hitherto in war  the reason of this too manifest fact is that until now it has been impossible for any nation except a warrior one to fix its mind wholly on its men instead of their possessions  every great soldier nation thinks necessarily first of multiplying its bodies and souls of men in good temper and strict discipline  as long as this is its political aim it does not matter what it temporarily suffers or loses either in numbers or in wealth its morality and its arts if it have national artgift advance together but so soon as it ceases to be a warrior nation it thinks of its possessions instead of its men and then the moral and poetic powers vanish together  115  it is thus however absolutely necessary to the virtue of war that it should be waged by personal strength not by money or machinery  a nation that fights with a mercenary force or with torpedoes instead of its own arms is dying  not but that there is more true courage in modern than even in ancient war but this is first because all the remaining life of european nations is with a morbid intensity thrown into their soldiers and secondly because their present heroism is the culmination of centuries of inbred and traditional valor which athena taught them by forcing them to govern the foam of the seawave and of the horsenot the steam of kettles  116  and further note this which is vital to us in the present crisis if war is to be made by money and machinery the nation which is the largest and most covetous multitude will win  you may be as scientific as you choose the mob that can pay more for sulphuric acid and gunpowder will at last poison its bullets throw acid in your faces and make an end of you of itself also in good time but of you first  and to the english people the choice of its fate is very near now  it may spasmodically defend its property with iron walls a fathom thick a few years longera very few  no walls will defend either it or its havings against the multitude that is breeding and spreading faster than the clouds over the habitable earth  we shall be allowed to live by small pedlers business and ironmongerysince we have chosen those for our line of lifeas long as we are found useful black servants to the americans and are content to dig coals and sit in the cinders and have still coals to digthey once exhausted or got cheaper elsewhere we shall be abolished  but if we think more wisely while there is yet time and set our minds again on multiplying englishmen and not on cheapening english wares if we resolve to submit to wholesome laws of labor and economy and setting our political squabbles aside try how many strong creatures friendly and faithful to each other we can crowd into every spot of english dominion neither poison nor iron will prevail against us nor traffic nor hatred the noble nation will yet by the grace of heaven rule over the ignoble and force of heart hold its own against fireballs  117  but there is yet a further reason for the dependence of the arts on war  the vice and injustice of the world are constantly springing anew and are only to be subdued by battle the keepers of order and law must always be soldiers  and now going back to the myth of athena we see that though she is first a warrior maid she detests war for its own sake she arms achilles and ulysses in just quarrels but she disarms ares  she contends herself continually against disorder and convulsion in the earth giants she stands by hercules side in victory over all monstrous evil in justice only she judges and makes war  but in this war of hers she is wholly implacable  she has little notion of converting criminals  there is no faculty of mercy in her when she has been resisted  her word is only i will mock when your fear cometh note the words that follow when your fear cometh as desolation and your destruction as a whirlwind for her wrath is of irresistible tempest once roused it is blind and deafrabiesmadness of anger darkness of the dies iræ  and that is indeed the sorrowfullest fact we have to know about our own several lives  wisdom never forgives  whatever resistance we have offered to her loaw she avenges forever the lost hour can never be redeemed and the accomplished wrong never atoned for  the best that can be done afterwards but for that had been better the falsest of all the cries of peace where there is no peace is that of the pardon of sin as the mob expect it  wisdom can put away sin but she cannot pardon it and she is apt in her haste to put away the sinner as well when the black ægis is on her breast  118  and this is also a fact we have to know about our national life that it is ended as soon as it has lost the power of noble anger  when it paints over and apologizes for its pitiful criminalities and endures its false weights and its adulterated food dares not to decide practically between good and evil and can neither honor the one nor smite the other but sneers at the good as if it were hidden evil and consoles the evil with pious sympathy and conserves it in the sugar of its leaden heartthe end is come  119  the first sign then of athenas presence with any people is that they become warriors and that the chief thought of every man of them is to stand rightly in his rank and not fail from his brothers side in battle  wealth and pleasure and even love are all under athenas orders sacrificed to this duty of standing fast in the rank of war  but further athena presides over industry as well as battle typically over womens industry that brings comfort with pleasantness  her word to us all is be well exercised and rightly clothed  clothed and in your right minds not insane and in rags nor in soiled fine clothes clutched from each others shoulders  fight and weave  then i myself will answer for the course of the lance and the colors of the loom  and now i will ask the reader to look with some care through these following passages respecting modern multitudes and their occupations written long ago but left in fragmentary form in which they must now stay and be of what use they can  120  it is not political economy to put a number of strong men down on an acre of ground with no lodging and nothing to eat  nor is it political economy to build a city on good ground and fill it with store of corn and treasure and put a score of lepers to live in it  political economy creates together the means of life and the living persons who are to use them and of both the best and the most that it can but imperatively the best not the most  a few good and healthy men rather than a multitude of diseased rogues and a little real milk and wine rather than much chalk and petroleum but the gist of the whole business is that the men and their property must both be produced togethernot one to the loss of the other  property must not be created in lands desolate by exile of their people nor multiplied and depraved humanity in lands barren of bread  121  nevertheless though the men and their possessions are to be increased at the same time the first object of thought is always to be the multiplication of a worthy people  the strength of the nation is in its multitude not in its territory but only in its sound multitude  it is one thing both in a man and a nation to gain flesh and another to be swollen with putrid humors  not that multitude ever ought to be inconsistent with virtue  two men should be wiser than one and two thousand than two nor do i know another so gross fallacy in the records of human stupidity as that excuse for neglect of crime by greatness of cities  as if the first purpose of congregation were not to devise laws and repress crimes  as if bees and wasps could live honestly in flocks men only in separate dens  as if it were easy to help one another on the opposite sides of a mountain and impossible on the opposite sides of a street  but when the men are true and good and stand shoulder to shoulder the strength of any nation is in its quantity of life not in its land nor gold  the more good men a state has in proportion to its territory the stronger the state  and as it has been the madness of economists to seek for gold instead of life so it has been the madness of kings to seek for land instead of life  they want the town on the other side of the river and seek it at the spear point it never enters their stupid heads that to double the honest souls in the town on this side of the river would make them stronger kings and that this doubling might be done by the ploughshare instead of the spear and through happiness instead of misery  therefore in brief this is the only object of all true policy and true economy utmost multitude of good men on every given space of ground imperatively always good sound honest mennot a mob of whitefaced thieves  so that on the one hand all aristocracy is wrong which is inconsistent with numbers and on the other all numbers are wrong which are inconsistent with breeding  122  then touching the accumulation of wealth for the maintenance of such men observe that you must never use the terms money and wealth as synonymous  wealth consists of the good and therefore useful things in the possession of the nation money is only the written or coined sign of the relative quantities of wealth in each persons possession  all money is a divisible titledeed of immense importance as an expression of right to property but absolutely valueless as property itself  thus supposing a nation isolated from all others the money in its possession is at its maximum value worth all the property of the nation and no more because no more can be got for it  and the money of all nations is worth at its maximum the property of all nations and no more for no more can be got for it  thus every article of property produced increases by its value the value of all the money in the world and every article of property destroyed diminishes the value of all the money in the world  if ten men are cast away on a rock with a thousand pounds in their pockets and there is on the rock neither food nor shelter their money is worth simply nothing for nothing is to be had for it  if they built ten huts and recover a cask of biscuit from the wreck then their thousand pounds at its maximum value is worth ten huts and a cask of biscuit  if they make their thousand pounds into two thousand by writing new notes their two thousand pounds are still worth ten huts and a cask of biscuit  and the law of relative value is the same for all the world and all the people in it and all their property as for ten men on a rock  therefore money is truly and finally lost in the degree in which its value is taken from it ceasing in that degree to be money at all and it is truly gained in the degree in which value is added to it  thus suppose the money coined by the nation be a fixed sum and divided very minutely say into francs and cents and neither to be added to nor diminished  then every grain of food and inch of lodging added to its possessions makes every cent in its pockets worth proportionally more and every gain of food it consumes and inch of roof it allows to fall to ruin makes every cent in its pockets worth less and this with mathematical precision  the immediate value of the money at particular times and places depends indeed on the humors of the possessors of property but the nation is in the one case gradually getting richer and will feel the pressure of poverty steadily everywhere relaxing whatever the humors of individuals may be and in the other case is gradually growing poorer and the pressure of its poverty will every day tell more and more in ways that it cannot explain but will most bitterly feel  123  the actual quantity of money which it coins in relation to its real property is therefore only of consequence for convenience of exchange but the proportion in which this quantity of money is divided among individuals expresses their various rights to greater or less proportions of the national property and must not therefore be tampered with  the government may at any time with perfect justice double its issue of coinage if it gives every man who has ten pounds in his pocket another ten pounds and every man who had ten pence another ten pence for it thus does not make any of them richer it merely divides their counters for them into twice the number  but if it gives the newlyissued coins to other people or keeps them itself it simply robs the former holders to precisely that extent  this most important function of money as a titledeed on the nonviolation of which all national soundness of commerce and peace of life depend has been never rightly distinguished by economists from the quite unimportant function of money as a means of exchange  you can exchange goodsat some inconvenience indeed but you can still contrive to do itwithout money at all but you cannot maintain your claim to the savings of your past life without a document declaring the amount of them which the nation and its government will respect  124  and as economists have lost sight of this great function of money in relation to individual rights so they have equally lost sight of its function as a representative of good things  that for every good thing produced so much money is put into everybodys pocket is the one simple and primal truth for the public to know and for economists to teach how many of them have taught it  some have but only incidentally and others will say it is a truism  if it be do the public know it  does your ordinary english householder know that every costly dinner he gives has destroyed forever as much money as it is worth  does every welleducated girldo even the women in high political positionknow that every fine dress they wear themselves or cause to be worn destroys precisely so much of the national money as the labor and material of it are worth  if this be a truism it is one that needs proclaiming somewhat louder  125  that then is the relation of money and goods  so much goods so much money so little goods so little money  but as there is this true relation between money and goods or good things so there is a false relation between money and bads or bad things  many bad things will fetch a price in exchange but they do not increase the wealth of the country  good wine is wealth drugged wine is not good meat is wealth putrid meat is not good pictures are wealth bad pictures are not  a thing is worth precisely what it can do for you not what you choose to pay for it  you may pay a thousand pounds for a cracked pipkin if you please but you do not by that transaction make the cracked pipkin worth one that will hold water nor that nor any pipkin whatsoever worth more than it was before you paid such sum for it  you may perhaps induce many potters to manufacture fissured pots and many amateurs of clay to buy them but the nation is through the whole business so encouraged rich by the addition to its wealth of so many potsherdsand there an end  the thing is worth what it can do for you not what you think it can and most national luxuries nowadays are a form of potsherd provided for the solace of a selfcomplacent job voluntary sedent on his ashheap  126  and also so far as good things already exist and have become media of exchange the variations in their prices are absolutely indifferent to the nation  whether mr a buys a titian from mr b for twenty or for two thousand pounds matters not sixpence to the national revenue that is to say it matters in nowise to the revenue whether mr a has the picture and mr b the money or mr b the picture and mr a the money  which of them will spend the money most wisely and which of them will keep the picture most carefully is indeed a matter of some importance but this cannot be known by the mere fact of exchange  127  the wealth of a nation then first and its peace and wellbeing besides depend on the number of persons it can employ in making good and useful things  i say its wellbeing also for the character of men depends more on their occupations than on any teaching we can give them or principles with which we can imbue them  the employment forms the habits of body and mind and these are the constitution of the manthe greater part of his moral or persistent nature whatever effort under special excitement he may make to change or overcome them  employment is the half and the primal half of educationit is the warp of it and the fineness or the endurance of all subsequently woven pattern depends wholly on its straightness and strength  and whatever difficulty there may be in tracing through past history the remoter connections of event and cause one chain of sequence is always clear the formation namely of the character of nations by their employments and the determination of their final fate by their character  the moment and the first direction of decisive revolutions often depend on accident but their persistent course and their consequences depend wholly on the nature of the people  the passing of the reform bill by the late english parliament may have been more or less accidental the results of the measure now rest on the character of the english people as it has been developed by their recent interests occupations and habits of life whether as a body they employ their new powers for good or evil will depend not on their facilities of knowledge nor even on the general intelligence they may possess but on the number of persons among them whom wholesome employments have rendered familiar with the duties and modest in their estimate of the promises of life  128  but especially in framing laws respecting the treatment or employment of improvident and more or less vicious persons it is to be remembered that as men are not made heroes by the performance of an act of heroism but must be brave before they can perform it so they are not made villains by the commission of a crime but were villains before they committed it and the right of public interference with their conduct begins when they begin to corrupt themselvesnot merely at the moment when they have proved themselves hopelessly corrupt  all measures of reformation are effective in exact proportion to their timeliness partial decay may be cut away and cleansed incipient error corrected but there is a point at which corruption can be no more stayed nor wandering recalled  it has been the manner of modern philanthropy to remain passive until that precise period and to leave the sick to perish and the foolish to stray while it spends itself in frantic exertions to raise the dead and reform the dust  the recent direction of a great weight of public opinion against capital punishment is i trust the sign of an awakening perception that punishment is the last and worst instrument in the hands of the legislator for the prevention of crime  the true instruments of reformation are employment and reward not punishment  aid the willing honour the virtuous and compel the idle into occupation and there will be no deed for the compelling of any into the great and last indolence of death  129  the beginning of all true reformation among the criminal classes depends on the establishment of institutions for their active employment while their criminality is still unripe and their feelings of selfrespect capacities of affection and sense of justice not altogether quenched  that those who are desirous of employment should always be able to find it will hardly at the present day be disputed but that those who are undesirous of employment should of all persons be the most strictly compelled to it the public are hardly yet convinced and they must be convinced  if the danger of the principal thoroughfares in their capital city and the multiplication of crimes more ghastly than ever yet disgraced a nominal civilization are not enough they will not have to wait long before they receive sterner lessons  for our neglect of the lower orders has reached a point at which it begins to bear its necessary fruit and every day makes the fields not whiter but more stable to harvest  130  the general principles by which employment should be regulated may be briefly stated as follows     i there being three great classes of mechanical powers at our disposal namely a vital or muscular power b natural mechanical power of wind water and electricity and c artificially produced mechanical power it is the first principle of economy to use all available vital power first then the inexpensive natural forces and only at last have recourse to artificial power  and this because it is always better for a man to work with his own hands to feed and clothe himself than to stand idle while a machine works for him and if he cannot by all the labor healthily possible to him feed and clothe himself then it is better to use an inexpensive machineas a windmill or watermillthan a costly one like a steamengine so long as we have natural force enough at our disposal  whereas at present we continually hear economists regret that the waterpower of the cascades or streams of a country should be lost but hardly ever that the muscular power of its idle inhabitants should be lost and again we see vast districts as the south of provence where a strong wind blows steadily all day long for six days out of seven throughout the year without a windmill while men are continually employed at a hundred miles to the north in digging fuel to obtain artificial power  but the principal point of all to be kept in view is that in every idle arm and shoulder throughout the country there is a certain quantity of force equivalent to the force of so much fuel and that it is mere insane waste to dig for coal for our force while the vital force is unused and not only unused but in being so corrupting and polluting itself  we waste our coal and spoil our humanity at one and the same instant  therefore wherever there is an idle arm always save coal with it and the stores of england will last all the longer  and precisely the same argument answers the common one about taking employment out of the hands of the industrious laborer why what is employment but the putting out of vital force instead of mechanical force  we are continually in search of means to pull to hammer to fetch to carry  we waste our future resources to get this strength while we leave all the living fuel to burn itself out in mere pestiferous breath and production of its variously noisome forms of ashes  clearly if we want fire for force we want men for force first the industrious hands must already have so much to do that they can do no more or else we need not use machines to help them  then use the idle hands first  instead of dragging petroleum with a steamengine put it on a canal and drag it with human arms and shoulders  petroluem cannot possibly be in a hurry to arrive anywhere  we can always order that and many other things time enough before we want it  so the carriage of everything which does not spoil by keeping may most wholesomely and safely be done by watertraction and sailingvessels and no healthier work can men be put to nor better discipline than such active porterage    in order fully to utilize this natural power we only require machinery to turn the variable into a constant velocityno insurmountable difficulty   131  2d in employing all the muscular power at our disposal we are to make the employments we choose as educational as possible for a wholesome human employment is the first and best method of education mental as well as bodily  a man taught to plough row or steer well and a woman taught to cook properly and make a dress neatly are already educated in many essential moral habits  labor considered as a discipline has hitherto been thought of only for criminals but the real and noblest function of labor is to prevent crime and not to be reformatory but formatory  132  the third great principle of employment is that whenever there is pressure of poverty to be met all enforced occupation should be directed to the production of useful articles only that is to say of food of simple clothing of lodging or of the means of conveying distributing and preserving these  it is yet little understood by economists and not at all by the public that the employment of persons in a useless business cannot relieve ultimate distress  the money given to employ ribandmakers at coventry is merely so much money withdrawn from what would have employed lacemakers at honiton or makers of something else as useless elsewhere  we must spend our money in some way at some time and it cannot at any time be spent without employing somebody  if we gamble it away the person who wins it must spend it if we lose it in a railroad speculation it has gone into some one elses pockets or merely gone to pay navies for making a useless embankment instead of to pay riband or button makers for making useless ribands or buttons we cannot lose it unless by actually destroying it without giving employment of some kind and therefore whatever quantity of money exists the relative quantity of employment must some day come out of it but the distress of the nation signifies that the employments given have produced nothing that will support its existence  men cannot live on ribands or buttons or velvet or by going quickly from place to place and every coin spent in useless ornament or useless motion is so much withdrawn from the national means of life  one of the most beautiful uses of railroads is to enable a to travel from the town of x to take away the business of b in the town of y while in the mean time b travels from the town of y to take away as business in the town of x but the national wealth is not increased by these operations  whereas every coin spent in cultivating ground in repairing lodging in making necessary and good roads in preventing danger by sea or land and in carriage of food or fuel where they are required is so much absolute and direct gain to the whole nation  to cultivate land round coventry makes living easier at honiton and every acre of sand gained from the sea in lincolnshire makes life easier all over england  4th and lastly  since for every idle person some one else must be working somewhere to provide him with clothes and food and doing therefore double the quantity of work that would be enough for his own needs it is only a matter of pure justice to compel the idle person to work for his maintenance himself  the conscription has been used in many countries to take away laborers who supported their families from their useful work and maintain them for purposes chiefly of military display at the public expense  since this has been long endured by the most civilized nations let it not be thought they would not much more gladly endure a conscription which should seize only the vicious and idle already living by criminal procedures at the public expense and which should discipline and educate them to labor which would not only maintain themselves but be serviceable to the commonwealth  the question is simply this we must feed the drunkard vagabond and thief but shall we do so by letting them steal their food and do no work for it or shall we give them their food in appointed quantity and enforce their doing work which shall be worth it and which in process of time will redeem their own characters and make them happy and serviceable members of society  i find by me a violent little fragment of undelivered lecture which puts this perhaps still more clearly  your idle people it says as they are now are not merely waste coalbeds  they are explosive coalbeds which you pay a high annual rent for  you are keeping all these idle persons remember at far greater cost than if they were busy  do you think a vicious person eats less than an honest one or that it is cheaper to keep a bad man drunk than a good man sober  there is i suppose a dim idea in the mind of the public that they dont pay for the maintenance of people they dont employ  those staggering rascals at the street corner grouped around its splendid angle of publichouse we fancy that they are no servants of ours that we pay them no wages that no cash out of our pockets is spent over that beerstained counter  whose cash is it then they are spending  it is not got honestly by work you know that much  where do they get it from  who has paid for their dinner and their pot  those fellows can only live in one of two waysby pillage or beggary  their annual income by thieving comes out of the public pocket you will admit  they are not cheaply fed so far as they are fed by theft  but the rest of their livingall that they dont stealthey must beg  not with success from you you think  wise as benevolent you never gave a penny in indiscriminate charity  well i congratulate you on the freedom of your conscience from that sin mine being bitterly burdened with the memory of many a sixpence given to beggars of whom i knew nothing but that they had pale faces and thin waists  but it is not that kind of street beggary that is the worst beggars trade  home alms which it is their worst degradation to receive  those scamps know well enough that you and your wisdom are worth nothing to them  they wont beg of you  they will beg of their sisters and mothers and wives and children and of any one else who is enough ashamed of being of the same blood with them to pay to keep them out of sight  every one of those blackguards is the bane of a family that is the deadly indiscriminate charitythe charity which each household pays to maintain its own private curse  133  and you think that is no affair of yours and that every family ought to watch over and subdue its own living plague  put it to yourselves this way then suppose you knew every one of those families kept an idol in an inner rooma bigbellied bronze figure to which daily sacrifice and oblation was made at whose feet so much beer and brandy was poured out every morning on the ground and before which every night good meat enough for two mens keep was set and left till it was putrid and then carried out and thrown on the dunghill you would put an end to that form of idolatry with your best diligence i suppose  you would understand then that the beer and brandy and meat were wasted and that the burden imposed by each household on itself lay heavily through them on the whole community  but suppose further that this idol were not of silent and quiet bronze only but an ingenious mechanism wound up every morning to run itself down into automatic blasphemies that it struck and tore with its hands the people who set food before it that it was anointed with poisonous unguents and infected the air for miles round  you would interfere with the idolatry then straightway  will you not interfere with it now when the infection that they venomous idol spreads is not merely death but sin  134  so far the old lecture  returning to cool english the end of the matter is that sooner or later we shall have to register our people and to know how they live and to make sure if they are capable of work that right work is given them to do  the different classes of work for which bodies of men could be consistently organized might ultimately become numerous these following divisions of occupation may all at once be suggested     i  roadmakinggood roads to be made wherever needed and kept in repair and the annual loss on unfrequented roads in spoiled horses strained wheels and time done away with     ii  bringing in of waste landall waste lands not necessary for public health to be made accessible and gradually reclaimed chiefly our wide and waste seashores  not our mountains nor moorland  our life depends on them more than on the best arable we have     iii  harbormakingthe deficiencies of safe or convenient harborage in our smaller ports to be remedied other harbors built at dangerous points of coast and a disciplined body of men always kept in connection with the pilot and lifeboat services  there is room for every order of intelligence in this work and for a large body of superior officers     iv  porterageall heavy goods not requiring speed in transit to be carried under preventative duty on transit by railroad by canalboats employing men for draught and the merchantshipping service extended by sea so that no ships may be wrecked for want of hands while there are idle ones in mischief on shore     v  repair of buildingsa body of men in various trades to be kept at the disposal of the authorities in every large town for repair of buildings especially the houses of the poorer orders who if no such provision were made could not employ workmen on their own houses but would simply live with rent walls and roofs     vi  dressmakingsubstantial dress of standard material and kind strong shoes and stout bedding to be manufactured for the poor so as to render it unnecessary for them unless by extremity of improvidence to wear cast clothes or be without sufficiency of clothing     vii  works of artschools to be established on thoroughly sound principles of manufacture and use of materials and with sample and for given periods unalterable modes of work first in pottery and embracing gradually metal work sculpture and decorative painting the two points insisted upon in distinction from ordinary commercial establishments being perfectness of material to the utmost attainable degree and the production of everything by handwork for the special purpose of developing personal power and skill in the workman  the last two departments and some subordinate branches of others would include the service of women and children  i give now for such further illustrations as they contain of the points i desire most to insist upon with respect both to education and employment a portion of the series of notes published some time ago in the art journal on the opposition of modesty and liberty and the unescapable law of wise restraint  i am sorry that they are written obscurelyand it may be thought affectedly but the fact is i have always had three different ways of writing one with the single view of making myself understood in which i necessarily omit a great deal of what comes into my head another in which i say what i think ought to be said in what i suppose to be the best words i can find for it which is in reality an affected stylebe it good or bad and my third way of writing is to say all that comes into my head for my own pleasure in the first words that come retouching them afterward into approximate grammar  these notes for the art journal were so written and i like them myself of course but ask the readers pardon for their confusedness  135  sir it cannot be better done  we will insist with the readers permission on this comfortful saying of albert dürers in order to find out if we may what modesty is which it will be well for painters readers and especially critics to know before going farther  what it is or rather who she is her fingers being among the deftest in laying the groundthreads of aglaias cestus  for this same opinion of alberts is entertained by many other people respecting their own doingsa very prevalent opinion indeed i find it and the answer itself though rarely made with the nurembergers crushing decision is nevertheless often enough intimated with delicacy by artists of all countries in their various dialects  neither can it always be held an entirely modest one as it assuredly was in the man who would sometimes estimate a piece of his unconquerable work at only the worth of a plate of fruit or a flask of winewould have taken even one fig for it kindly offered or given it royally for nothing to show his hand to a fellowking of his own or any other craftas gainsborough gave the boy at the stile for a solo on the violin  an entirely modest saying i repeat in himnot always in us  for modesty is the measuring virtue the virtue of modes or limits  she is indeed said to be only the third or youngest of the children of the cardinal virtue temperance and apt to be despised being more given to arithmetic and other vulgar studies cinderellalike than her elder sisters but she is useful in the household and arrives at great results with her yardmeasure and slatepencila pretty little marchande des modes cutting her dress always according to the silk if this be the proper feminine reading of coat according to the cloth so that consulting with her carefully of a morning men get to know not only their income but their in beingto know themselves that is in a gaugers manner round and up and downsurface and contents what is in them and what may be got out of them and in fine their entire canon of weight and capacity  that yardmeasure of modestys lent to those who will use it is a curious musical reed and will go round and round waists that are slender enough with latent melody in every joint of it the dark root only being soundless moist from the wave wherein        null altra pianta che facesse fronda          o che n durasse vi puote aver vita    purgatorio i 108 109   but when the little sister herself takes it in hand to measure things outside of us with the joints shoot out in an amazing manner the foursquare walls even of celestial cities being measurable enough by that reed and the way pointed to them though only to be followed or even seen in the dim starlight shed down from worlds amidst which there is no name of measure any more though the reality of it always  for indeed to all true modesty the necessary business is not inlook but outlook and especially uplook it is only her sister shamefacedness who is known by the drooping lashesmodesty quite otherwise by her large eyes full of wonder for she never contemns herself nor is ashamed of herself but forgets herselfat least until she has done something worth memory  it is easy to peep and potter about ones own deficiencies in a quiet immodest discontent but modesty is so pleased with other peoples doings that she has no leisure to lament her own and thus knowing the fresh feeling of contentment unstained with thought of self she does not fear being pleased when there is cause with her own rightness as with anothers as with anothers saying calmly be it mine or yours or whose elses it may it is no matter this also is well  but the right to say such a thing depends on continual reverence and manifold sense of failure  if you have known yourself to have failed you may trust when it comes the strange consciousness of success if you have faithfully loved the noble work of others you need not fear to speak with respect of things duly done of your own  136  but the principal good that comes of art being followed in this reverent feeling is of it  men who know their place can take it and keep it be it low or high contentedly and firmly neither yielding nor grasping and the harmony of hand and thought follows rendering all great deeds of art possibledeeds in which the souls of men meet like the jewels in the windows of aladdins palace the little gems and the large all equally pure needing no cement but the fitting of facets while the associative work of immodest men is all jointless and astir with wormy ambition putridly dissolute and forever on the crawl so that if it come together for a time it can only be by metamorphosis through a flash of volcanic fire out of the vale of siddim vitrifying the clay of it and fastening the slime only to end in wilder scattering according to the fate of those oldest mightiest immodestest of builders of whom it is told in scorn they had brick for stone and slime had they for mortar  137  the first function of modesty then being this recognition of place her second is the recognition of law and delight in it for the sake of law itself whether her part be to assert it or obey  for as it belongs to all immodesty to defy or deny law and assert privilege and license according to its own pleasure it being therefore rightly called insolent that is custombreaking violating some usual and appointed order to attain for itself greater forwardness or power so it is the habit of all modesty to love the constancy and solemnity or literally accustomedness of law seeking first what are the solemn appointed inviolable customs and general orders of nature and of the master of nature touching the matter in hand and striving to put itself as habitually and inviolably in compliance with them  out of which habit once established arises what is rightly called conscience nor science merely but withscience a science with us such as only modest creatures can havewith or within themand within all creation besides every member of it strong or weak witnessing together and joining in the happy consciousness that each ones work is good the bee also being profoundly of that opinion and the lark and the swallow in that noisy but modestly upsidedown babel of hers under the eaves with its unvolcanic slime for mortar and the two ants who are asking of each other at the turn of that little antsfootworn bath through the moss lor via e lor fortuna and the builders also who built yonder pile of cloudmarble in the west and the gilder who gilded it and is gone down behind it  138  but i think we shall better understand what we ought of the nature of modesty and of her opposite by taking a simple instance of both in the practice of that art of music which the wisest have agreed in thinking the first element of education only i must ask the readers patience with me through a parenthesis  among the foremost men whose power has had to assert itself though with conquest yet with countless loss through peculiarly english disadvantages of circumstance are assuredly to be ranked together both for honor and for mourning thomas bewick and george cruikshank  there is however less cause for regret in the instance of bewick  we may understand that it was well for us once to see what an entirely keen and true mans temper could achieve together unhelped but also unharmed among the black bans and wolds of tyne  but the genius of cruikshank has been cast away in an utterly ghastly and lamentable manner his superb linework worthy of any class of subject and his powers of conception and composition of which i cannot venture to estimate the range in their degraded application having been condemned by his fate to be spent either in rude jesting or in vain war with conditions of vice too low alike for record or rebuke among the dregs of the british populace  yet perhaps i am wrong in regretting even this it may be an appointed lesson for futurity that the art of the best english etcher in the nineteenth century spent on illustrations of the lives of burglars and drunkards should one day be seen in museums beneath greek vases fretted with drawings of the wars of troy or side by side with dürers knight and death  139  be that as it may i am at present glad to be able to refer to one of these perpetuations by his strong hand of such human character as our faultless british constitution occasionally produces in outoftheway corners  it is among his illustrations of the irish rebellion and represents the pillage and destruction of a gentlemans house by the mob  they have made a heap in the drawingroom of the furniture and books to set first fire to and are tearing up the floor for its more easily kindled planks the less busilydisposed meanwhile hacking round in rage with axes and smashing what they can with buttends of guns  i do not care to follow with words the ghastly truth of the picture into its detail but the most expressive incident of the whole and the one immediately to my purpose is this that one fellow has sat himself at the piano on which hitting down fiercely with his clenched fists he plays grinning such tune as may be so producible to which melody two of his companions flourishing knotted sticks dance after their manner on the top of the instrument  140  i think we have in this conception as perfect an instance as we require of the lowest supposable phase of immodest or licentious art in music the inner consciousness of good being dim even in the musician and his audience and wholly unsympathized with and unacknowledged by the delphian vestal and all other prophetic and cosmic powers  this represented scene came into my mind suddenly one evening a few weeks ago in contrast with another which i was watching in its reality namely a group of gentle schoolgirls leaning over mr charles hallê as he was playing a variation on home sweet home  they had sustained with unwonted courage the glance of subdued indignation with which having just closed a rippling melody of sebastian bachs much like what one might fancy the singing of nightingales would be if they fed on honey instead of flies he turned to the slight popular air  but they had their own associations with it and besought for and obtained it and pressed close at first in vain to see what no glance could follow the traversing of the fingers  they soon thought no more of seeing  the wet eyes roundopen and the little scarlet upper lips lifted and drawn slightly together in passionate glow of utter wonder became picturelike porcelainlike in motionless joy as the sweet multitude of low notes fell in their timely infinities like summer rain  only la robbia himself nor even he unless with tenderer use of color than is usual in his work could have rendered some image of that listening  141  but if the reader can give due vitality in his fancy to these two scenes he will have in them representative types clear enough for all future purpose of the several agencies of debased and perfect art  and the interval may easily and continuously be filled by mediate gradations between the entirely immodeset unmeasured and in evil sense unmannered execution with the fist and the entirely modest measured and in the noblest sense mannered or morald execution with the finger between the impatient and unpractised doing containing in itself the witness of lasting impatience and idleness through all previous life and the patient and practised doing containing in itself the witness of selfrestraint and unwearied toil through all previous life between the expressed subject and sentiment of home violation and the expressed subject and sentiment of home love between the sympathy of audience given in irreverent and contemptuous rage joyless as the rabidness of a dog and the sympathy of audience given in an almost appalled humility of intense rapturous and yet entirely reasoning and reasonable pleasure between these two limits of octave the reader will find he can class according to its modesty usefulness and grace or becomingness all other musical art  for although purity of purpose and fineness of execution by no means go together degree to degree since fine and indeed all but the finest work is often spent in the most wanton purpose as in all our modern operaand the rudest execution is again often joined with purest purpose as in a mothers song to her child still the entire accomplishment of music is only in the union of both  for the difference between that all but finest and finest is an infinite one and besides this however the power of the performer once attained may be afterwards misdirected in slavery to popular passion or childishness and spend itself at its sweetest in idle melodies cold and ephemeral like michael angelos snow statue in the other art or else in vicious difficulty and miserable noisecrackling of thorns under the pot of public sensualitystill the attainment of this power and the maintenance of it involve always in the executant some virtue or courage of high kind the understanding of which and of the difference between the discipline which develops it and the disorderly efforts of the amateur it will be one of our first businesses to estimate rightly  and though not indeed by degree to degree yet in essential relation as of winds to waves the one being always the true cause of the other though they are not necessarily of equal force at the same time we shall find vice in its varieties with artfailureand virtue in its varieties with artsuccessfall and rise together the peasantgirls song at her spinningwheel the peasant laborers to the oaks and rillsdomestic music feebly yet sensitively skilfulmusic for the multitude of beneficent or of traitorous powerdancemelodies pure and orderly or foul and franticmarchmusic blatant in mere fever of animal pugnacity or majestic with force of national duty and memory songmusic reckless sensual sickly slovenly forgetful even of the foolish words it effaces with foolish noiseor thoughtful sacred healthful artful forever sanctifying noble thought with separately distinguished loveliness of belonging soundall these families and graduations of good or evil however mingled follow in so far as they are good one constant law of virtue or lifestrength which is the literal meaning of the word and its intended one in wise mens mouths and in so far as they are evil are evil by outlawry and unvirtue or deathweakness  then passing wholly beyond the domain of death we may still imagine the ascendant nobleness of the art through all the concordant life of incorrupt creatures and a continually deeper harmony of puissant words and murmurs made to bless until we reach        the undisturbed song of pure consent       aye sung before the sapphirecolored throne  142  and so far as the sister arts can be conceived to have place or office their virtues are subject to a law absolutely the same as that of music only extending its authority into more various conditions owing to the introduction of a distinctly representative and historical power which acts under logical as well as mathematical restrictions and is capable of endlessly changeful fault fallacy and defeat as well as of endlessly manifold victory  143  next to modesty and her delight in measures let us reflect a little on the character of her adversary the goddess of liberty and her delight in absence of measures or in false ones  it is true that there are liberties and liberties  yonder torrent crystalclear and arrowswift with its spray leaping into the air like white troops of fawns is free enough  lost presently amidst bankless boundless marsh soaking in slow shallowness as it will hither and thither listless among the poisonous reeds and unresisting slimeit is free also  we may choose which liberty we likethe restraint of voiceful rock or the dumb and edgeless shore of darkened sand  of that evil liberty which men are now glorifying and proclaiming as essence of gospel to all the earth and will presently i suppose proclaim also to the stars with invitation to them out of their coursesand of its opposite continence which is the clasp and chrusee perone of aglaias cestus we must try to find out something true  for no quality of art has been more powerful in its influence on public mind none is more frequently the subject of popular praise or the end of vulgar effort than what we call freedom it is necessary to determine the justice or injustice of this popular praise  144  i said a little while ago that the practical teaching of the masters of art was summed by the o of giotto  you may judge my masterhood of craft giotto tells us by seeing that i can draw a circle unerringly  and we may safely believe him understanding him to mean that though more may be necessary to an artist than such a power at least this power is necessary  the qualities of hand and eye needful to do this are the first conditions of artistic craft  145  try to draw a circle yourself with the free hand and with a single line  you cannot do it if your hand trembles nor if it is in the common sense of the word free  so far from being free it must be as if it were fastened to an inflexible bar of steel  and yet it must move under this necessary control with perfect untormented serenity of ease  146  that is the condition of all good work whatsoever  all freedom is error  every line you lay down is either right or wrong it may be timidly and awkwardly wrong or fearlessly and impudently wrong  the aspect of the impudent wrongness is pleasurable to vulgar persons and is what they commonly call free execution the timid tottering hesitating wrongness is rarely so attractive yet sometimes if accompanied with good qualities and right aims in other directions it becomes in a manner charming like the inarticulateness of a child but whatever the charm or manner of the error there is but one question ultimately to be asked respecting every line you draw is it right or wrong  if right it most assuredly is not a free line but an intensely continent restrained and considered line and the action of the hand in laying it is just as decisive and just as free as the hand of a firstrate surgeon in a critical incision  a great operator told me that his hand could check itself within about the twohundredth of an inch in penetrating a membrane and this of course without the help of sight by sensation only  with help of sight and in action on a substance which does not quiver or yield a fine artists line is measurable in its proposed direction to considerably less than the thousandth of an inch  a wide freedom truly  147  the conditions of popular art which most foster the common ideas about freedom are merely results of irregularly energetic effort by men imperfectly educated these conditions being variously mingled with cruder mannerisms resulting from timidity or actual imperfection of body  northern hands and eyes are of course never so subtle as southern and in very cold countries artistic execution is palsied  the effort to break through this timidity or to refine the bluntness may lead to a licentious impetuosity or an ostentatious minuteness  every mans manner has this kind of relation to some defect in his physical powers or modes of thought so that in the greatest work there is no manner visible  it is at first uninteresting from its quietness the majesty of restrained power only dawns gradually upon us as we walk towards its horizon  there is indeed often great delightfulness in the innocent manners of artists who have real power and honesty and draw in this way or that as best they can under such and such untoward circumstances of life  but the greater part of the looseness flimsiness or audacity of modern work is the expression of an inner spirit of license in mind and heart connected as i said with the peculiar folly of this age its hope of and trust in liberty of which we must reason a little in more general terms  148  i believe we can nowhere find a better type of a perfectly free creature than in the common housefly  nor free only but brave and irreverent to a degree which i think no human republican could by any philosophy exalt himself to  there is no courtesy in him he does not care whether it is king or clown whom he teases and in every step of his swift mechanical march and in every pause of his resolute observation there is one and the same expression of perfect egotism perfect independence and selfconfidence and conviction of the worlds having been made for flies  strike at him with your hand and to him the mechanical fact and external aspect of the matter is what to you it would be if an acre of red clay ten feet thick tore itself up from the ground in one massive field hovered over you in the air for a second and came crashing down with an aim  that is the external aspect of it the inner aspect to his flys mind is of a quite natural and unimportant occurrenceone of the momentary conditions of his active life  he steps out of the way of your hand and alights on the back of it  you cannot terrify him nor govern him nor persuade him nor convince him  he has his own positive opinion on all matters not an unwise one usually for his own ends and will ask no advice of yours he has no work to dono tyrannical instinct to obey  the earthworm has his digging the bee her gathering and building the spider her cunning network the ant her treasury and accounts  all these are comparatively slaves or people of vulgar business  but your fly free in the air free in the chambera black incarnation of caprice wandering investigating flitting flirting feasting at his will with rich variety of choice in feast from the heaped sweets in the grocers window to those of the butchers backyard and from the galled place on your cabhorses back to the brown spot in the road from which as the hoof disturbs him he rises with angry republican buzzwhat freedom is like his  149  for captivity again perhaps your poor watchdog is as sorrowful a type as you will easily find  mine certainly is  the day is lovely but i must write this and cannot go out with him  he is chained in the yard because i do not like dogs in rooms and the gardener does not like dogs in gardens  he has no booksnothing but his own weary thoughts for company and a group of those free flies whom he snaps at with sullen ill success  such dim hope as he may have that i may take him out with me will be hour by hour wearily disappointed or worse darkened at once into a leaden despair by an authoritative notoo well understood  his fidelity only seals his fate if he would not watch for me he would be sent away and go hunting with some happier master but he watches and is wise and faithful and miserable and his high animal intellect only gives him the wistful powers of wonder and sorrow and desire and affection which embitter his captivity  yet of the two would we rather be watchdog or fly  150  indeed the first point we have all to determine is not how free we are but what kind of creatures we are  it is of small importance to any of us whether we get liberty but of the greatest that we deserve it whether we can win it fate must determine but that we will be worthy of it we may ourselves determine and the sorrowfullest fate of all that we can suffer is to have it without deserving it  151  i have hardly patience to hold my pen and go on writing as i remember i would that it were possible for a few consecutive instants to forget the infinite follies of modern thought in this matter centred in the notion that liberty is good for a man irrespectively of the use he is likely to make of it  folly unfathomable unspeakable unendurable to look in the full face of as the laugh of a cretin  you will send your child will you into a room where the table is loaded with sweet wine and fruitsome poisoned some notyou will say to him choose freely my little child  it is so good for you to have freedom of choice it forms your characteryour individuality  if you take the wrong cup or the wrong berry you will die before the day is over but you will have acquired the dignity of a free child  152  you think that puts the case too sharply  i tell you lover of liberty there is no choice offered to you but it is similarly between life and death  there is no act nor option of act possible but the wrong deed or option has poison in it which will stay in your veins thereafter forever  never more to all eternity can you be as you might have been had you not done thatchosen that  you have formed your character forsooth  no if you have chosen ill you have deformed it and that for ever  in some choices it had been better for you that a redhot iron bar struck you aside scarred and helpless than that you had so chosen  you will know better next time  no  next time will never come  next time the choice will be in quite another aspect between quite different thingsyou weaker than you were by the evil into which you have fallen it more doubtful than it was by the increased dimness of your sight  no one ever gets wiser by doing wrong nor stronger  you will get wiser and stronger only by doing right whether forced or not the prime the one need is to do that under whatever compulsion until you can do it without compulsion  and then you are a man  153  what a wayward youth might perhaps answer incredulously no one ever gets wiser by doing wrong  shall i not know the world best by trying the wrong of it and repenting  have i not even as it is learned much by many of my errors  indeed the effort by which partially you recovered yourself was precious that part of your thought by which you discerned the error was precious  what wisdom and strength you kept and rightly used are rewarded and in the pain and the repentance and in the acquaintance with the aspects of folly and sin you have learned something how much less than you would have learned in right paths can never be told but that it is less is certain  your liberty of choice has simply destroyed for you so much life and strength never regainable  it is true you now know the habits of swine and the taste of husks do you think your father could not have taught you to know better habits and pleasanter tastes if you had stayed in his house and that the knowledge you have lost would not have been more as well as sweeter than that you have gained  but it so forms my individuality to be free  your individuality was given you by god and in your race and if you have any to speak of you will want no liberty  you will want a den to work in and peace and lightno morein absolute need if more in anywise it will still not be liberty but direction instruction reproof and sympathy  but if you have no individuality if there is no true character nor true desire in you then you will indeed want to be free  you will begin early and as a boy desire to be a man and as a man think yourself as good as every other  you will choose freely to eat freely to drink freely to stagger and fall freely at last to curse yourself and die  death is the only real freedom possible to us and that is consummate freedom permission for every particle in the rotting body to leave its neighbor particle and shift for itself  you call it corruption in the flesh but before it comes to that all liberty is an equal corruption in mind  you ask for freedom of thought but if you have not sufficient grounds for thought you have no business to think and if you have sufficient grounds you have no business to think wrong  only one thought is possible to you if you are wiseyour liberty is geometrically proportionate to your folly  154  but all this glory and activity of our age what are they owing to but to freedom of thought  in a measure they are owingwhat good is in themto the discovery of many lies and the escape from the power of evil  not to liberty but to the deliverance from evil or cruel masters  brave men have dared to examine lies which had long been taught not because they were freethinkers but because they were such stern and close thinkers that the lie could no longer escape them  of course the restriction of thought or of its expression by persecution is merely a form of violence justifiable or not as other violence is according to the character of the persons against whom it is exercised and the divine and eternal laws which it vindicates or violates  we must not burn a man alive for saying that the athanasian creed is ungrammatical nor stop a bishops salary because we are getting the worst of an argument with him neither must we let drunken men howl in the public streets at night  there is much that is true in the part of mr mills essay on liberty which treats of freedom of thought some important truths are there beautifully expressed but many quite vital are omitted and the balance therefore is wrongly struck  the liberty of expression with a great nation would become like that in a welleducated company in which there is indeed freedom of speech but not of clamor or like that in an orderly senate in which men who deserve to be heard are heard in due time and under determined restrictions  the degree of liberty you can rightly grant to a number of men is in the inverse ratio of their desire for it and a general hush or call to order would be often very desirable in this england of ours  for the rest of any good or evil extent it is impossible to say what measure is owing to restraint and what to license where the right is balanced between them  i was not a little provoked one day a summer or two since in scotland because the duke of athol hindered me from examining the gneiss and slate junctions in glen tilt at the hour convenient to me but i saw them at last and in quietness and to the very restriction that annoyed me owed probably the fact of their being in existence instead of being blasted away by a mobcompany while the free paths and inlets of loch katrine and the lake of geneva are forever trampled down and destroyed not by one duke but by tens of thousands of ignorant tyrants  155  so a dean and chapter may perhaps unjustifiably charge me twopence for seeing a cathedral but your free mob pulls spire and all down about my ears and i can see it no more forever  and even if i cannot get up to the granite junctions in the glen the stream comes down from them pure to the garry but in beddington park i am stopped by the newlyerected fence of a building speculator and the bright wandel divine of waters as castaly is filled by the free public with old shoes obscene crockery and ashes  156  in fine the arguments for liberty may in general be summed in a few very simple forms as follows  misguiding is mischievous therefore guiding is  if the blind lead the blind both fall into the ditch therefore nobody should lead anybody  lambs and fawns should be left free in the fields much more bears and wolves  if a mans gun and shot are his own he may fire in any direction he pleases  a fence across a road is inconvenient much more one at the side of it  babes should not be swaddled with their hands bound down to their sides therefore they should be thrown out to roll in the kennels naked  none of these arguments are good and the practical issues of them are worse  for there are certain eternal laws for human conduct which are quite clearly discernible by human reason  so far as these are discovered and obeyed by whatever machinery or authority the obedience is procured there follow life and strength  so far as they are disobeyed by whatever good intention the disobedience is brought about there follow ruin and sorrow  and the first duty of every man in the world is to find his true master and for his own good submit to him and to find his true inferior and for that inferiors good conquer him  the punishment is sure if we either refuse the reverence or are too cowardly and indolent to enforce the compulsion  a base nation crucifies or poisons its wise men and lets its fools rave and rot in the streets  a wise nation obeys the one restrains the other and cherishes all  157  the best examples of the results of wise normal evidence in art will be found in whatever evidence remains respecting the lives of great italian painters though unhappily in eras of progress but just in proportion to the admirableness and efficiency of the life will be usually the scantiness of its history  the individualities and liberties which are causes of destruction may be recorded but the loyal conditions of daily breath are never told  because leonardo made models of machines dug canals built fortifications and dissipated half his artpower in capricious ingenuities we have many anecdotes of himbut no picture of importance on canvas and only a few withered stains of one upon a wall  but because his pupil or reputed pupil luini labored in constant and successful simplicity we have no anecdotes of himonly hundreds of noble works  luini is perhaps the best central type of the highlytrained italian painter  he is the only man who entirely united the religious temper which was the spiritlife of art with the physical power which was its bodily life  he joins the purity and passion of angelico to the strength of veronese the two elements poised in perfect balance are so calmed and restrained each by the other that most of us lose the sense of both  the artist does not see the strength by reason of the chastened spirit in which it is used and the religious visionary does not recognize the passion by reason of the frank human truth with which it is rendered  he is a man ten times greater than leonardoa mighty colorist while leonardo was only a fine draughtsman in black staining the chiaroscuro drawing like a colored print he perceived and rendered the delicatest types of human beauty that have been painted since the days of the greeks while leonardo depraved his finer instincts by caricature and remained to the end of his days the slave of an archaic smile and he is a designer as frank instinctive and exhaustless as tintoret while leonardos design is only an agony of science admired chiefly because it is painful and capable of analysis in its best accomplishment  luini has left nothing behind him that is not lovely but of his life i believe hardly anything is known beyond remnants of tradition which murmur about lugano and saronno and which remain ungleaned  this only is certain that he was born in the loveliest district of north italy where hills and streams and air meet in softest harmonies  child of the alps and of their divinest lake he is taught without doubt or dismay a lofty religious creed and a sufficient law of life and of its mechanical arts  whether lessoned by leonardo himself or merely one of many disciplined in the system of the milanese school he learns unerringly to draw unerringly and enduringly to paint  his tasks are set him without question day by day by men who are justly satisfied with his work and who accept it without any harmful praise or senseless blame  place scale and subject are determined for him on the cloister wall or the church dome as he is required and for sufficient daily bread and little more he paints what he has been taught to design wisely and has passion to realize gloriously every touch he lays is eternal every thought he conceives is beautiful and pure his hand moves always in radiance of blessing from day to day his life enlarges in power and peace it passes away cloudlessly the starry twilight remaining arched far against the night  158  oppose to such a life as this that of a great painter amidst the elements of modern english liberty  take the life of turner in whom the artistic energy and inherent love of beauty were at least as strong as in luini but amidst the disorder and ghastliness of the lower streets of london his instincts in early infancy were warped into toleration of evil or even into delight in it  he gathers what he can of instruction by questioning and prying among halfinformed masters spells out some knowledge of classical fable educates himself by an admirable force to the production of wildly majestic or pathetically tender and pure pictures by which he cannot live  there is no one to judge them or to command him only some of the english upper classes hire him to paint their houses and parks and destroy the drawings afterwards by the most wanton neglect  tired of laboring carefully without either reward or praise he dashes out into various experimental and popular worksmakes himself the servant of the lower public and is dragged hither and thither at their will while yet helpless and guideless he indulges his idiosyncrasies till they change into insanities the strength of his soul increasing its sufferings and giving force to its errors all the purpose of life degenerating into instinct and the web of his work wrought at last of beauties too subtle to be understood his liberty with vices too singular to be forgivenall useless because magnificent idiosyncrasy had become solitude or contention in the midst of a reckless populace instead of submitting itself in loyal harmony to the artlaws of an understanding nation  and the life passed away in darkness and its final work in all the best beauty of it has already perished only enough remaining to teach us what we have lost  159  these are the opposite effects of law and of liberty on men of the highest powers  in the case of inferiors the contrast is still more fatal under strict law they become the subordinate workers in great schools healthily aiding echoing or supplying with multitudinous force of hand the mind of the leading masters they are the nameless carvers of great architecturestainers of glasshammerers of iron helpful scholars whose work ranks round if not with their masters and never disgraces it  but the inferiors under a system of license for the most part perish in miserable effort a few struggle into pernicious eminenceharmful alike to themselves and to all who admire them many die of starvation many insane either in weakness of insolent egotism like haydon or in a conscientious agony of beautiful purpose and warped power like blake  there is no probability of the persistence of a licentious school in any good accidentally discovered by them there is an approximate certainty of their gathering with acclaim round any shadow of evil and following it to whatever quarter of destruction it may lead    as i correct this sheet for press my pall mall gazette of last saturday april 17 is lying on the table by me  i print a few lines out of it     an artists deatha sad story was told at an inquest held in st pancras last night by dr lankester on the body of    aged fiftynine a french artist who was found dead in his bed at his rooms in    street  m    also an artist said he had known the deceased for fifteen years  he once held a high position and being anxious to make a name in the world he five years ago commenced a large picture which he hoped when completed to have in the gallery at versailles and with that view he sent a photograph of it to the french emperor  he also had an idea of sending it to the english royal academy  he labored on this picture neglecting other work which would have paid him well and gradually sank lower and lower into poverty  his friends assisted him but being absorbed in his great work he did not heed their advice and they left him  he was however assisted by the french ambassador and last saturday he the witness saw deceased who was much depressed in spirits as he expected the brokers to be put in possession for rent  he said his troubles were so great that he feared his brain would give way the witness gave him a shilling for which he appeared very thankful  on monday the witness called upon him but received no answer to his knock he went again on tuesday and entered the deceaseds bedroom and found him dead  dr george ross said that when called into the deceased he had been dead at least two days  the room was in a filthy dirty condition and the picture referred tocertainly a very fine onewas in that room the postmortem examination showed that the cause of death was fatty degeneration of the heart the latter probably having ceased its action through the mental excitement of the deceased   160  thus far the notes of freedom  now lastly here is some talk which i tried at the time to make intelligible and with which i close this volume because it will serve sufficiently to express the practical relation in which i think the art and imagination of the greeks stand to our own and will show the reader that my view of that relation is unchanged from the first day on which i began to write until now      the hercules of camarina  address to the students of the art school of south lambert march 15 1869   161  among the photographers of greek coins which present so many admirable subjects for your study i must speak for the present of one only the hercules of camarina  you have represented by a greek workman in that coin the face of a man and the skin of a lions head and the mans face is like a mans face but the lions skin is not like a lions skin  162  now there are some people who will tell you that greek art is fine because it is true and because it carves mens faces as like mens as it can  and there are other people who will tell you that greek art is fine because it is not true and carves a lions skin so as to look not at all like a lions skin  and you fancy that one or the other of these sets of people must be wrong and are perhaps much puzzled to find out which you should believe  but neither of them are wrong and you will have eventually to believe or rather to understand and know in reconciliation the truths taught by each but for the present the teachers of the first group are those you must follow  it is they who tell you the deepest and usefullest truth which involves all others in time  greek art and all other art is fine when it makes a mans face as like a mans face as it can  hold to that  all kinds of nonsense are talked to you nowadays ingeniously and irrelevantly about art  therefore for the most part of the day shut your ears and keep your eyes open and understand primarily what you may i fancy easily understand that the greatest masters of all greatest schoolsphidias donatello titian velasquez or sir joshua reynoldsall tried to make human creatures as like human creatures as they could and that anything less like humanity than their work is not so good as theirs  get that well driven into your heads and dont let it out again at your peril  163  having got it well in you may then further understand safely that three is a great deal of secondary work in pots and pans and floors and carpets and shawls and architectural ornament which ought essentially to be unlike reality and to depend for its charm on quite other qualities than imitative ones  but all such art is inferior and secondarymuch of it more or less instinctive and animal and a civilized human creature can only learn those principles rightly by knowing those of great civilized art firstwhich is always the representation to the utmost of its power of whatever it has got to showmade to look as like the thing as possible  go into the national gallery and look at the foot of correggios venus there  correggio made it as like a foot as he could and you wont easily find anything liker  now you will find on any greek vase something meant for a foot or a hand which is not at all like one  the greek vase is a good thing in its way but correggios picture is the best work  164  so again go into the turner room of the national gallery and look at turners drawing of ivy bridge  you will find the water in it is like real water and the ducks in it are like real ducks  then go into the british museum and look for an egyptian landscape and you will find the water in that constituted of blue zigzags not at all like water and ducks in the middle of it made of blue lines looking not in the least as if they could stand stuffing with sage and onions  they are very good in their way but turners are better  165  i will not pause to fence my general principle against what you perfectly well know of the due contradictionthat a thing may be painted very like yet painted ill  rest content with knowing that it must be like if it is painted well and take this further general law imitation is like charity  when it is done for love it is lovely when it is done for show hateful  166  well then this greek coin is fine first because the face is like a face  perhaps you think there is something particularly handsome in the face which you cant see in the photograph or cant at present appreciate  but there is nothing of the kind  it is a very regular quiet commonplace sort of face and any average english gentlemans of good descent would be far handsomer  167  fix that in your heads also therefore that greek faces are not particularly beautiful  of that much nonsense against which you are to keep your ears shut that which is talked to you of the greek ideal of beauty is the absolutest  there is not a single instance of a very beautiful head left by the highest school of greek art  on coins there is even no approximately beautiful one  the juno of argos is a virago the athena of athens grotesque the athena of corinth is insipid and of thurium sensual  the siren ligeia and fountain of arethusa on the coins of terina and syracuse are prettier but totally without expression and chiefly set off by their wellcurled hair  you might have expected something subtle in mercuries but the mercury of Ænus is a very stupidlooking fellow in a cap like a bowl with a knob on the top of it  the bacchus of thasos is a drayman with his hair pomatumd the jupiter of syracurse is however calm and refined and the apollo of clazomenæ would have been impressive if he had not come down to us much flattened by friction  but on the whole the merit of greek coins does not primarily depend on beauty of features nor even in the period of highest art that of the statues  you make take the venus of melos as a standard of beauty of the central greek type  she has tranquil regular and lofty features but could not hold her own for a moment against the beauty of a simple english girl of pure race and kind heart  168  and the reason that greek art on the whole bores you and you know it does is that you are always forced to look in it for something that is not there but which may be seen every day in real life all round you and which you are naturally disposed to delight in and ought to delight in  for the greek race was not at all one of exalted beauty but only of general and healthy completeness of form  they were only and could be only beautiful in body to the degree that they were beautiful in soul for you will find when you read deeply into the matter that the body is only the soul made visible  and the greeks were indeed very good people much better people than most of us think or than many of us are but there are better people alive now than the best of them and lovelier people to be seen now than the loveliest of them  169  then what are the merits of this greek art which make it so exemplary for you  well not that it is beautiful but that it is right  all that it desires to do it does and all that it does does well  you will find as you advance in the knowledge of art that its laws of selfrestraint are very marvelous that its peace of heart and contentment in doing a simple thing with only one or two qualities restrictedly desired and sufficiently attained are a most wholesome element of education for you as opposed to the wild writhing and wrestling and longing for the moon and tilting at windmills and agony of eyes and torturing of fingers and general spinning out of ones soul into fiddlestrings which constitute the ideal life of a modern artist    compare above §101   also observe there is an entire masterhood of its business up to the required point  a greek does not reach after other peoples strength nor outreach his own  he never tries to paint before he can draw he never tries to lay on flesh where there are no bones and he never expects to find the bones of anything in his inner consciousness  those are his first meritssincere and innocent purpose strong commonsense and principle and all the strength that follows on that strength  170  but secondly greek art is always exemplary in disposition of masses which is a thing that in modern days students rarely look for artists not enough and the public never  but whatever else greek work may fail of you may always be sure its masses are well placed and their placing has been the object of the most subtle care  look for instance at the inscription in front of this hercules of the name of the town camarina  you cant read it even though you may know greek without some pains for the sculptor knew well enough that it mattered very little whether you read it or not for the camarina hercules could tell his own story but what did above all things matter was that no k or a or m should come in a wrong place with respect to the outline of the head and divert the eye from it or spoil any of its lines  so the whole inscription is thrown into a sweeping curve of gradually diminishing size continuing from the lions paws round the neck up to the forehead and answering a decorative purpose as completely as the curls of the mane opposite  of these again you cannot change or displace one without mischief they are almost as even in reticulation as a piece of basketwork but each has a different form and a due relation to the rest and if you set to work to draw that mane rightly you will find that whatever time you give to it you cant get the tresses quite into their places and that every tress out of its place does an injury if you want to test your powers of accurate drawing you may make that lions mane your pons asinorum i have never yet met with a student who didnt make an ass in a lions skin of himself when he tried it  171  granted however that these tresses may be finely placed still they are not like a lions mane  so we come back to the questionif the face is to be like a mans face why is not the lions mane to be like a lions mane  well because it cant be like a lions mane without too much troubleand inconvenience after that and poor success after all  too much trouble in cutting the die into fine fringes and jags inconvenience after thatbecause though you can easily stamp cheeks and foreheads smooth at a blow you cant stamp projecting tresses fine at a blow whatever pains you take with your die  so your greek uses his common sense wastes no time uses no skill and says to you here is beautifully set tresses which i have carefully designed and easily stamped  enjoy them and if you cannot understand that they mean lions mane heaven mend your wits  172  see then you have in this work wellfounded knowledge simple and right aims thorough mastery of handicraft splendid invention in arrangement unerring common sense in treatmentmerits these i think exemplary enough to justify our tormenting you a little with greek art but it has one merit more than these the greatest of all  it always means something worth saying  not merely worth saying for that time only but for all time  what do you think this helmet of lions hide is always given to hercules for  you cant suppose it means only that he once killed a lion and always carried its skin afterwards to show that he had as indian sportsmen sent home stuffed rugs with claws at the corners and a lump in the middle which one tumbles over every time one stirs the fire  what was this nemean lion whose spoils were evermore to cover hercules from the cold  not merely a large specimen of felis leo ranging the fields of nemea be sure of that  this nemean cub was one of a bad litter  born of typhon and echidnaof the whirlwind and the snakecerberus his brother the hydra of lerna his sisterit must have been difficult to get his hide off him  he had to be found in darkness too and dealt upon without weapons by grip at the throat arrows and club of no avail against him  what does all that mean  173  it means that the nemean lion is the first great adversary of life whatever that may beto hercules or to any of us then or now  the first monster we have to strangle or be destroyed by fighting in the dark and with none to help us only athena standing by to encourage with her smile  every mans nemean lion lies in wait for him somewhere  the slothful man says there is a lion in the path  he says well  the quiet unslothful man says the same and knows it too  but they differ in their further reading of the text  the slothful man says i shall be slain and the unslothful it shall be  it is the first ugly and strong enemy that rises against us all future victory depending on victory over that kill it and through all the rest of your life what was once dreadful is your armor and you are clothed with that conquest for every other and helmed with its crest of fortitude for evermore  alas we have most of us to walk bareheaded but that is the meaning of the story of nemeaworth laying to heart and thinking of sometimes when you see a dish garnished with parsley which was the crown at the nemean games  174  how far then have we got in our list of the merits of greek art now        sound knowledge       simple aims       mastered craft       vivid invention       strong common sense       and eternally true and wise meaning  are these not enough  here is one more then which will find favor i should think with the british lion  greek art is never frightened at anything it is always cool  175  it differs essentially from all other art past or present in this incapability of being frightened  half the power and imagination of every other school depend on a certain feverish terror mingling with their  sense of beautythe feeling that a child has in a dark room or a sick person in seeing ugly dreams  but the greeks never have ugly dreams  they cannot draw anything ugly when they try  sometimes they put themselves to their witsend to draw an ugly thingthe medusas head for instancebut they cant do it not they because nothing frightens them  they widen the mouth and grind the teeth and puff the cheeks and set the eyes a goggling and the thing is only ridiculous after all not the least dreadful for there is no dread in their hearts pensiveness amazement often deepest grief and desolateness  all these but terror never  everlasting calm in the presence of all fate and joy such as they could win not indeed in a perfect beauty but in beauty at perfect rest  a kind of art this surely to be looked at and thought upon sometimes with profit even in these latter days  176  to be looked at sometimes  not continually and never as a model for imitation  for you are not greeks but for better or worse english creatures and cannot do even if it were a thousand times better worth doing anything well except what your english hearts shall prompt and your english skies teach you  for all good art is the natural utterance of its own people in its own day  but also your own art is a better and brighter one than ever this greek art was  many motives powers and insights have been added to those elder ones  the very corruptions into which we have fallen are signs of a subtle life higher than theirs was and therefore more fearful in its faults and death  christianity has neither superceded nor by itself excelled heathenism but it has added its own good won also by many a nemean contest in dark valleys to all that was good and noble in heathenism and our present thoughts and work when they are right are nobler than the heathens  and we are not reverent enough to them because we possess too much of them  that sketch of four cherub heads from and english girl by sir joshua reynolds at kensington is an incomparably finer thing than ever the greeks did  ineffably tender in the touch yet herculean in power innocent yet exalted in feeling pure in color as a pearl reserved and decisive in design as this lion crest if it alone existed of suchif it were a picture by zeuxis the only one left in the world and you build a shrine for it and were allowed to see it only seven days in a year it alone would teach you all of art that you ever needed to know  but you do not learn from this or any other such work because you have not reverence enough for them and are trying to learn from all at once and from a hundred other masters besides  177  here then is the practical advice which i would venture to deduce from what i have tried to show you  use greek art as a first not a final teacher  learn to draw carefully from greek work above all to place forms correctly and to use light and shade tenderly  never allow yourselves black shadows  it is easy to make things look round and projecting but the things to exercise yourselves in are the placing of the masses and the modelling of the lights  it is an admirable exercise to take a pale wash of color for all the shadows never reinforcing it everywhere but drawing the statue as if it were in far distance making all the darks one flat pale tint  then model from those into the lights rounding as well as you can on those subtle conditions  in your chalk drawings separate the lights from the darks at once all over then reinforce the darks slightly where absolutely necessary and put your whole strength on the lights and their limits  then when you have learned to draw thoroughly take one master for your painting as you would have done necessarily in old times by being put into his school were i to choose for you it should be among six men onlytitian correggio paul veronese velasquez reynolds or holbein  if you are a landscapist turner must be your only guide for no other great landscape painter has yet lived and having chosen do your best to understand your own chosen master and obey him and no one else till you have strength to deal with the nature itself round you and then be your own master and see with your own eyes  if you have got masterhood or sight in you that is the way to make the most of them and if you have neither you will at least be sound in your work prevented from immodest and useless effort and protected from vulgar and fantastic error  and so i wish you all good speed and the favor of hercules and of the muses and to those who shall best deserve them the crown of parsley first and then of the laurel
