84264986	the mysterious key and what it opened  by l m alcott       chapter i  the prophecy    trevlyn lands and trevlyn gold   heir nor heiress eer shall hold   undisturbed till spite of rust   truth is found in trevlyn dust   this is the third time ive found you poring over that old rhyme what is the charm richard not its poetry i fancy and the young wife laid a slender hand on the yellow timeworn page where in old english text appeared the lines she laughed at  richard trevlyn looked up with a smile and threw by the book as if annoyed at being discovered reading it drawing his wifes hand through his own he led her back to her couch folded the soft shawls about her and sitting in a low chair beside her said in a cheerful tone though his eyes betrayed some hidden care my love that book is a history of our family for centuries and that old prophecy has never yet been fulfilled except the heir and heiress line i am the last trevlyn and as the time draws near when my child shall be born i naturally think of his future and hope he will enjoy his heritage in peace  god grant it softly echoed lady trevlyn adding with a look askance at the old book i read that history once and fancied it must be a romance such dreadful things are recorded in it is it all true richard  yes dear i wish it was not ours has been a wild unhappy race till the last generation or two the stormy nature came in with old sir ralph the fierce norman knight who killed his only son in a fit of wrath by a blow with his steel gauntlet because the boys strong will would not yield to his  yes i remember and his daughter clotilde held the castle during a siege and married her cousin count hugo tis a warlike race and i like it in spite of the mad deeds  married her cousin that has been the bane of our family in times past being too proud to mate elsewhere we have kept to ourselves till idiots and lunatics began to appear my father was the first who broke the law among us and i followed his example choosing the freshest sturdiest flower i could find to transplant into our exhausted soil  i hope it will do you honor by blossoming bravely i never forget that you took me from a very humble home and have made me the happiest wife in england  and i never forget that you a girl of eighteen consented to leave your hills and come to cheer the longdeserted house of an old man like me returned her husband fondly  nay dont call yourself old richard you are only fortyfive the boldest handsomest man in warwickshire but lately you look worried what is it tell me and let me advise or comfort you  it is nothing alice except my natural anxiety for youwell kingston what do you want  trevlyns tender tones grew sharp as he addressed the entering servant and the smile on his lips vanished leaving them dry and white as he glanced at the card he handed him an instant he stood staring at it then asked is the man here  in the library sir  ill come  flinging the card into the fire he watched it turn to ashes before he spoke with averted eyes only some annoying business love i shall soon be with you again lie and rest till i come  with a hasty caress he left her but as he passed a mirror his wife saw an expression of intense excitement in his face she said nothing and lay motionless for several minutes evidently struggling with some strong impulse  he is ill and anxious but hides it from me i have a right to know and hell forgive me when i prove that it does no harm  as she spoke to herself she rose glided noiselessly through the hall entered a small closet built in the thickness of the wall and bending to the keyhole of a narrow door listened with a halfsmile on her lips at the trespass she was committing a murmur of voices met her ear her husband spoke oftenest and suddenly some word of his dashed the smile from her face as if with a blow she started shrank and shivered bending lower with set teeth white cheeks and panicstricken heart paler and paler grew her lips wilder and wilder her eyes fainter and fainter her breath till with a long sigh a vain effort to save herself she sank prone upon the threshold of the door as if struck down by death  mercy on us my lady are you ill cried hester the maid as her mistress glided into the room looking like a ghost half an hour later  i am faint and cold help me to my bed but do not disturb sir richard  a shiver crept over her as she spoke and casting a wild woeful look about her she laid her head upon the pillow like one who never cared to lift it up again hester a sharpeyed middleaged woman watched the pale creature for a moment then left the room muttering something is wrong and sir richard must know it that blackbearded man came for no good ill warrant  at the door of the library she paused no sound of voices came from within a stifled groan was all she heard and without waiting to knock she went in fearing she knew not what sir richard sat at his writing table pen in hand but his face was hidden on his arm and his whole attitude betrayed the presence of some overwhelming despair  please sir my lady is ill shall i send for anyone  no answer hester repeated her words but sir richard never stirred much alarmed the woman raised his head saw that he was unconscious and rang for help but richard trevlyn was past help though he lingered for some hours he spoke but once murmuring faintly will alice come to say goodbye  bring her if she can come said the physician  hester went found her mistress lying as she left her like a figure carved in stone when she gave the message lady trevlyn answered sternly tell him i will not come and turned her face to the wall with an expression which daunted the woman too much for another word  hester whispered the hard answer to the physician fearing to utter it aloud but sir richard heard it and died with a despairing prayer for pardon on his lips  when day dawned sir richard lay in his shroud and his little daughter in her cradle the one unwept the other unwelcomed by the wife and mother who twelve hours before had called herself the happiest woman in england they thought her dying and at her own command gave her the sealed letter bearing her address which her husband left behind him she read it laid it in her bosom and waking from the trance which seemed to have so strongly chilled and changed her besought those about her with passionate earnestness to save her life  for two days she hovered on the brink of the grave and nothing but the indomitable will to live saved her the doctors said on the third day she rallied wonderfully and some purpose seemed to gift her with unnatural strength evening came and the house was very still for all the sad bustle of preparation for sir richards funeral was over and he lay for the last night under his own roof hester sat in the darkened chamber of her mistress and no sound broke the hush but the low lullaby the nurse was singing to the fatherless baby in the adjoining room lady trevlyn seemed to sleep but suddenly put back the curtain saying abruptly where does he lie  in the state chamber my lady replied hester anxiously watching the feverish glitter of her mistresss eye the flush on her cheek and the unnatural calmness of her manner  help me to go there i must see him  it would be your death my lady i beseech you dont think of it began the woman but lady trevlyn seemed not to hear her and something in the stern pallor of her face awed the woman into submission  wrapping the slight form of her mistress in a warm cloak hester halfled halfcarried her to the state room and left her on the threshold  i must go in alone fear nothing but wait for me here she said and closed the door behind her  five minutes had not elapsed when she reappeared with no sign of grief on her rigid face  take me to my bed and bring my jewel box she said with a shuddering sigh as the faithful servant received her with an exclamation of thankfulness  when her orders had been obeyed she drew from her bosom the portrait of sir richard which she always wore and removing the ivory oval from the gold case she locked the former in a tiny drawer of the casket replaced the empty locket in her breast and bade hester give the jewels to watson her lawyer who would see them put in a safe place till the child was grown  dear heart my lady youll wear them yet for youre too young to grieve all your days even for so good a man as my blessed master take comfort and cheer up for the dear childs sake if no more  i shall never wear them again was all the answer as lady trevlyn drew the curtains as if to shut out hope  sir richard was buried and the nine days gossip over the mystery of his death died for want of food for the only person who could have explained it was in a state which forbade all allusion to that tragic day  for a year lady trevlyns reason was in danger a long fever left her so weak in mind and body that there was little hope of recovery and her days were passed in a state of apathy sad to witness she seemed to have forgotten everything even the shock which had so sorely stricken her the sight of her child failed to rouse her and month after month slipped by leaving no trace of their passage on her mind and but slightly renovating her feeble body  who the stranger was what his aim in coming or why he never reappeared no one discovered the contents of the letter left by sir richard were unknown for the paper had been destroyed by lady trevlyn and no clue could be got from her sir richard had died of heart disease the physicians said though he might have lived years had no sudden shock assailed him there were few relatives to make investigations and friends soon forgot the sad young widow so the years rolled on and lillian the heiress grew from infancy to childhood in the shadow of this mystery     chapter ii  paul   come child the dew is falling and it is time we went in  no no mamma is not rested yet so i may run down to the spring if i like and lillian as willful as winsome vanished among the tall ferns where deer couched and rabbits hid  hester leisurely followed looking as unchanged as if a day instead of twelve years had passed since her arms received the little mistress who now ruled her like a tyrant she had taken but a few steps when the child came flying back exclaiming in an excited tone oh come quick theres a man there a dead man i saw him and im frightened  nonsense child its one of the keepers asleep or some stroller who has no business here take my hand and well see who it is  somewhat reassured lillian led her nurse to one of the old oaks beside the path and pointed to a figure lying half hidden in the fern a slender swarthy boy of sixteen with curly black hair dark brows and thick lashes a singularly stern mouth and a general expression of strength and pride which added character to his boyish face and dignified his poverty his dress betrayed that being dusty and threadbare his shoes much worn and his possessions contained in the little bundle on which he pillowed his head he was sleeping like one quite spent with weariness and never stirred though hester bent away the ferns and examined him closely  hes not dead my deary hes asleep poor lad worn out with his days tramp i dare say im glad hes alive and i wish hed wake up hes a pretty boy isnt he see what nice hands hes got and his hair is more curly than mine make him open his eyes hester commanded the little lady whose fear had given place to interest  hush hes stirring i wonder how he got in and what he wants whispered hester  ill ask him and before her nurse could arrest her lillian drew a tall fern softly over the sleepers face laughing aloud as she did so  the boy woke at the sound and without stirring lay looking up at the lovely little face bent over him as if still in a dream  bella cara he said in a musical voice then as the child drew back abashed at the glance of his large bright eyes he seemed to wake entirely and springing to his feet looked at hester with a quick searching glance something in his face and air caused the woman to soften her tone a little as she said gravely did you wish to see any one at the hall  yes is lady trevlyn here was the boys answer as he stood cap in hand with the smile fading already from his face  she is but unless your business is very urgent you had better see parks the keeper we dont trouble my lady with trifles  ive a note for her from colonel daventry and as it is not a trifle ill deliver it myself if you please  hester hesitated an instant but lillian cried out mamma is close by come and see her and led the way beckoning as she ran  the lad followed with a composed air and hester brought up the rear taking notes as she went with a womans keen eye  lady trevlyn a beautiful pale woman delicate in health and melancholy in spirit sat on a rustic seat with a book in her hand not reading but musing with an absent mind as the child approached she held out her hand to welcome her but neither smiled nor spoke  mamma here is aa person to see you cried lillian rather at a loss how to designate the stranger whose height and gravity now awed her  a note from colonel daventry my lady and with a bow the boy delivered the missive  scarcely glancing at him she opened it and read  my dear friend  the bearer of this paul jex has been with me some months and has served me well i brought him from paris but he is english born and though friendless prefers to remain here even after we leave as we do in a week when i last saw you you mentioned wanting a lad to help in the garden paul is accustomed to that employment though my wife used him as a sort of page in the house hoping you may be able to give him shelter i venture to send him he is honest capable and trustworthy in all respects pray try him and oblige  yours sincerely  j r daventry  the place is still vacant and i shall be very glad to give it to you if you incline to take it said lady trevlyn lifting her eyes from the note and scanning the boys face  i do madam he answered respectfully  the colonel says you are english added the lady in a tone of surprise  the boy smiled showing a faultless set of teeth as he replied i am my lady though just now i may not look it being much tanned and very dusty my father was an englishman but ive lived abroad a good deal since he died and got foreign ways perhaps  as he spoke without any accent and looked full in her face with a pair of honest blue eyes under the dark lashes lady trevlyns momentary doubt vanished  your age paul  sixteen my lady  you understand gardening  yes my lady  and what else  i can break horses serve at table do errands read aloud ride after a young lady as groom illuminate on parchment train flowers and make myself useful in any way  the tone half modest half eager in which the boy spoke as well as the odd list of his accomplishments brought a smile to lady trevlyns lips and the general air of the lad prepossessed her  i want lillian to ride soon and roger is rather old for an escort to such a little horsewoman dont you think we might try paul she said turning to hester  the woman gravely eyed the lad from head to foot and shook her head but an imploring little gesture and a glance of the handsome eyes softened her heart in spite of herself  yes my lady if he does well about the place and parks thinks hes steady enough we might try it byandby  lillian clapped her hands and drawing nearer exclaimed confidingly as she looked up at her new groom i know hell do mamma i like him very much and i hope youll let him train my pony for me will you paul  yes  as he spoke very low and hastily the boy looked away from the eager little face before him and a sudden flush of color crossed his dark cheek  hester saw it and said within herself that boy has good blood in his veins hes no clodhoppers son i can tell by his hands and feet his air and walk poor lad its hard for him ill warrant but hes not too proud for honest work and i like that  you may stay paul and we will try you for a month hester take him to parks and see that he is made comfortable tomorrow we will see what he can do come darling i am rested now  as she spoke lady trevlyn dismissed the boy with a gracious gesture and led her little daughter away paul stood watching her as if forgetful of his companion till she said rather tartly young man youd better have thanked my lady while she was here than stare after her now its too late if you want to see parks youd best come for im going  is that the family tomb yonder where you found me asleep was the unexpected reply to her speech as the boy quietly followed her not at all daunted by her manner  yes and that reminds me to ask how you got in and why you were napping there instead of doing your errand properly  i leaped the fence and stopped to rest before presenting myself miss hester was the cool answer accompanied by a short laugh as he confessed his trespass  you look as if youd had a long walk where are you from  london  bless the boy its fifty miles away  so my shoes show but its a pleasant trip in summer time  but why did you walk child had you no money  plenty but not for wasting on coaches when my own stout legs could carry me i took a two days holiday and saved my money for better things  i like that said hester with an approving nod youll get on my lad if thats your way and ill lend a hand for laziness is my abomination and one sees plenty nowadays  thank you thats friendly and ill prove that i am grateful please tell me is my lady ill  always delicate since sir richard died  how long ago was that  ten years or more  are there no young gentlemen in the family  no miss lillian is an only child and a sweet one bless her  a proud little lady i should say  and well she may be for theres no better blood in england than the trevlyns and shes heiress to a noble fortune  is that the trevlyn coat of arms asked the boy abruptly pointing to a stone falcon with the motto me and mine carved over the gate through which they were passing  yes why do you ask  mere curiosity i know something of heraldry and often paint these things for my own pleasure one learns odd amusements abroad he added seeing an expression of surprise on the womans face  youll have little time for such matters here come in and report yourself to the keeper and if youll take my advice ask no questions of him for youll get no answers  i seldom ask questions of men as they are not fond of gossip and the boy nodded with a smile of mischievous significance as he entered the keepers lodge  a sharp lad and a saucy if he likes ill keep my eye on him for my lady takes no more thought of such things than a child and lillian cares for nothing but her own will he has a taking way with him though and knows how to flatter its well he does poor lad for lifes a hard matter to a friendless soul like him  as she thought these thoughts hester went on to the house leaving paul to win the good graces of the keeper which he speedily did by assuming an utterly different manner from that he had worn with the woman  that night when the boy was alone in his own room he wrote a long letter in italian describing the events of the day enclosed a sketch of the falcon and motto directed it to father cosmo carmela genoa and lay down to sleep muttering with a grim look and a heavy sigh so far so well ill not let my heart be softened by pity or my purpose change till my promise is kept pretty child i wish i had never seen her     chapter iii  secret service   in a week paul was a favorite with the household even prudent hester felt the charm of his presence and owned that lillian was happier for a young companion in her walks hitherto the child had led a solitary life with no playmates of her own age such being the will of my lady therefore she welcomed paul as a new and delightful amusement considering him her private property and soon transferring his duties from the garden to the house satisfied of his merits my lady yielded to lillians demands and paul was installed as page to the young lady always respectful and obedient he never forgot his place yet seemed unconsciously to influence all who approached him and win the goodwill of everyone  my lady showed unusual interest in the lad and lillian openly displayed her admiration for his accomplishments and her affection for her devoted young servitor hester was much flattered by the confidence he reposed in her for to her alone did he tell his story and of her alone asked advice and comfort in his various small straits it was as she suspected paul was a gentlemans son but misfortune had robbed him of home friends and parents and thrown him upon the world to shift for himself this sad story touched the womans heart and the boys manly spirit won respect she had lost a son years ago and her empty heart yearned over the motherless lad ashamed to confess the tender feeling she wore her usual severe manner to him in public but in private softened wonderfully and enjoyed the boys regard heartily  paul come in i want to speak with you a moment said my lady from the long window of the library to the boy who was training vines outside  dropping his tools and pulling off his hat paul obeyed looking a little anxious for the month of trial expired that day lady trevlyn saw and answered the look with a gracious smile  have no fears you are to stay if you will for lillian is happy and i am satisfied with you  thank you my lady and an odd glance of mingled pride and pain shone in the boys downcast eyes  that is settled then now let me say what i called you in for you spoke of being able to illuminate on parchment can you restore this old book for me  she put into his hand the ancient volume sir richard had been reading the day he died it had lain neglected in a damp nook for years till my lady discovered it and sad as were the associations connected with it she desired to preserve it for the sake of the weird prophecy if nothing else paul examined it and as he turned it to and fro in his hands it opened at the page oftenest read by its late master his eye kindled as he looked and with a quick gesture he turned as if toward the light in truth to hide the flash of triumph that passed across his face carefully controlling his voice he answered in a moment as he looked up quite composed yes my lady i can retouch the faded colors on these margins and darken the pale ink of the old english text i like the work and will gladly do it if you like  do it then but be very careful of the book while in your hands provide what is needful and name your own price for the work said his mistress  nay my lady i am already paid  how so she asked surprised  paul had spoken hastily and for an instant looked embarrassed but answered with a sudden flush on his dark cheeks you have been kind to me and i am glad to show my gratitude in any way my lady  let that pass my boy do this little service for me and we will see about the recompense afterward and with a smile lady trevlyn left him to begin his work  the moment the door closed behind her a total change passed over paul he shook his clenched hand after her with a gesture of menace then tossed up the old book and caught it with an exclamation of delight as he reopened it at the worn page and reread the inexplicable verse  another proof another proof the work goes bravely on father cosmo and boy as i am ill keep my word in spite of everything he muttered  what is that youll keep lad said a voice behind him  ill keep my word to my lady and do my best to restore this book mrs hester he answered quickly recovering himself  ah thats the last book poor master read i hid it away but my lady found it in spite of me said hester with a doleful sigh  did he die suddenly then asked the boy  dear heart yes i found him dying in this room with the ink scarce dry on the letter he left for my lady a mysterious business and a sad one  tell me about it i like sad stories and i already feel as if i belonged to the family a loyal retainer as in the old times while you dust the books and i rub the mold off this old cover tell me the tale please mrs hester  she shook her head but yielded to the persuasive look and tone of the boy telling the story more fully than she intended for she loved talking and had come to regard paul as her own almost  and the letter what was in it asked the boy as she paused at the catastrophe  no one ever knew but my lady  she destroyed it then  i thought so till a long time afterward one of the lawyers came pestering me with questions and made me ask her she was ill at the time but answered with a look i shall never forget no its not burnt but no one shall ever see it i dared ask no more but i fancy she has it safe somewhere and if its ever needed shell bring it out it was only some private matters i fancy  and the stranger  oh he vanished as oddly as he came and has never been found a strange story lad keep silent and let it rest  no fear of my tattling and the boy smiled curiously to himself as he bent over the book polishing the brassbound cover  what are you doing with that pretty white wax asked lillian the next day as she came upon paul in a quiet corner of the garden and found him absorbed in some mysterious occupation  with a quick gesture he destroyed his work and banishing a momentary expression of annoyance he answered in his accustomed tone as he began to work anew i am molding a little deer for you miss lillian see here is a rabbit already done and ill soon have a stag also  its very pretty how many nice things you can do and how kind you are to think of my liking something new was this wax what you went to get this morning when you rode away so early asked the child  yes miss lillian i was ordered to exercise your pony and i made him useful as well would you like to try this its very easy  lillian was charmed and for several days wax modeling was her favorite play then she tired of it and paul invented a new amusement smiling his inexplicable smile as he threw away the broken toys of wax  you are getting pale and thin keeping such late hours paul go to bed boy go to bed and get your sleep early said hester a week afterward with a motherly air as paul passed her one morning  and how do you know i dont go to bed he asked wheeling about  my lady has been restless lately and i sit up with her till she sleeps as i go to my room i see your lamp burning and last night i got as far as your door meaning to speak to you but didnt thinking youd take it amiss but really you are the worse for late hours child  i shall soon finish restoring the book and then ill sleep i hope i dont disturb you i have to grind my colors and often make more noise than i mean to  paul fixed his eyes sharply on the woman as he spoke but she seemed unconscious of it and turned to go on saying indifferently oh thats the odd sound is it no it doesnt trouble me so grind away and make an end of it as soon as may be  an anxious fold in the boys forehead smoothed itself away as he left her saying to himself with a sigh of relief a narrow escape its well i keep the door locked  the boys light burned no more after that and hester was content till a new worry came to trouble her on her way to her room late one night she saw a tall shadow flit down one of the side corridors that branched from the main one for a moment she was startled but being a woman of courage she followed noiselessly till the shadow seemed to vanish in the gloom of the great hall  if the house ever owned a ghost id say thats it but it never did so i suspect some deviltry ill step to paul hes not asleep i dare say hes a brave and a sensible lad and with him ill quietly search the house  away she went more nervous than she would own and tapped at the boys door no one answered and seeing that it was ajar hester whisked in so hurriedly that her candle went out with an impatient exclamation at her carelessness she glided to the bed drew the curtain and put forth her hand to touch the sleeper the bed was empty a disagreeable thrill shot through her as she assured herself of the fact by groping along the narrow bed standing in the shadow of the curtain she stared about the dusky room in which objects were visible by the light of a new moon  lord bless me what is the boy about i do believe it was him i saw in the she got no further in her mental exclamation for the sound of light approaching footsteps neared her slipping around the bed she waited in the shadow and a moment after paul appeared looking pale and ghostly with dark disheveled hair wideopen eyes and a cloak thrown over his shoulders without a pause he flung it off laid himself in bed and seemed to sleep at once  paul paul whispered hester shaking him after a pause of astonishment at the whole proceeding  hey what is it and he sat up looking drowsily about him  come come no tricks boy what are you doing trailing about the house at this hour and in such trim  why hester is it you he exclaimed with a laugh as he shook off her grip and looked up at her in surprise  yes and well it is me if it had been any of those silly girls the house would have been roused by this time what mischief is afoot that you leave your bed and play ghost in this wild fashion  leave my bed why my good soul i havent stirred but have been dreaming with all my might these two hours what do you mean hester  she told him as she relit her lamp and stood eyeing him sharply the while when she finished he was silent a minute then said looking half vexed and half ashamed i see how it is and im glad you alone have found me out i walk in my sleep sometimes hester thats the truth i thought id got over it but its come back you see and im sorry for it dont be troubled i never do any mischief or come to any harm i just take a quiet promenade and march back to bed again did i frighten you  just a trifle but its nothing poor lad youll have to have a bedfellow or be locked up its dangerous to go roaming about in this way said hester anxiously  it wont last long for ill get more tired and then i shall sleep sounder dont tell anyone please else theyll laugh at me and thats not pleasant i dont mind your knowing for you seem almost like a mother and i thank you for it with all my heart  he held out his hand with the look that was irresistible to hester remembering only that he was a motherless boy she stroked the curly hair off his forehead and kissed him with the thought of her own son warm at her heart  good night dear ill say nothing but give you something that will ensure quiet sleep hereafter  with that she left him but would have been annoyed could she have seen the convulsion of boyish merriment which took possession of him when alone for he laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks     chapter iv  vanished   hes a handsome lad and one any woman might be proud to call her son said hester to bedford the stately butler as they lingered at the hall door one autumn morning to watch their young ladys departure on her daily ride  you are right mrs hester hes a fine lad and yet he seems above his place though he does look the very picture of a ladys groom replied bedford approvingly  so he did as he stood holding the white pony of his little mistress for the boy gave an air to whatever he wore and looked like a gentleman even in his livery the darkblue coat with silver buttons the silver band about his hat his whitetopped boots and bright spurs spotless gloves and tightly drawn belt were all in perfect order all becoming and his handsome dark face caused many a susceptible maid to blush and simper as they passed him gentleman paul as the servants called him was rather lofty and reserved among his mates but they liked him nonetheless for hester had dropped hints of his story and quite a little romance had sprung up about him he stood leaning against the docile creature sunk in thought and quite unconscious of the watchers and whisperers close by but as lillian appeared he woke up attended to his duties like a welltrained groom and lingered over his task as if he liked it down the avenue he rode behind her but as they turned into a shady lane lillian beckoned saying in the imperious tone habitual to her ride near me i wish to talk  paul obeyed and amused her with the chat she liked till they reached a hazel copse here he drew rein and leaping down gathered a handful of ripe nuts for her  how nice let us rest a minute here and while i eat a few please pull some of those flowers for mamma she likes a wild nosegay better than any i can bring her from the garden  lillian ate her nuts till paul came to her with a hatful of late flowers and standing by her held the impromptu basket while she made up a bouquet to suit her taste  you shall have a posy too i like you to wear one in your buttonhole as the ladies grooms do in the park said the child settling a scarlet poppy in the blue coat  thanks miss lillian ill wear your colors with all my heart especially today for it is my birthday and paul looked up at the blooming little face with unusual softness in his keen blue eyes  is it why then youre seventeen almost a man arent you  yes thank heaven muttered the boy half to himself  i wish i was as old i shant be in my teens till autumn i must give you something paul because i like you very much and you are always doing kind things for me what shall it be and the child held out her hand with a cordial look and gesture that touched the boy  with one of the foreign fashions which sometimes appeared when he forgot himself he kissed the small hand saying impulsively my dear little mistress i want nothing but your goodwilland your forgiveness he added under his breath  you have that already paul and i shall find something to add to it but what is that and she laid hold of a little locket which had slipped into sight as paul bent forward in his salute  he thrust it back coloring so deeply that the child observed it and exclaimed with a mischievous laugh it is your sweetheart paul i heard bessy my maid tell hester she was sure you had one because you took no notice of them let me see it is she pretty  very pretty answered the boy without showing the picture  do you like her very much questioned lillian getting interested in the little romance  very much and pauls black eyelashes fell  would you die for her as they say in the old songs asked the girl melodramatically  yes miss lillian or live for her which is harder  dear me how very nice it must be to have anyone care for one so much said the child innocently i wonder if anybody ever will for me    love comes to all soon or late     and maketh gay or sad   for every bird will find its mate     and every lass a lad  sang paul quoting one of hesters songs and looking relieved that lillians thoughts had strayed from him but he was mistaken  shall you marry this sweetheart of yours someday asked lillian turning to him with a curious yet wistful look  perhaps  you look as if there was no perhaps about it said the child quick to read the kindling of the eye and the change in the voice that accompanied the boys reply  she is very young and i must wait and while i wait many things may happen to part us  is she a lady  yes a wellborn lovely little lady and ill marry her if i live paul spoke with a look of decision and a proud lift of the head that contrasted curiously with the badge of servitude he wore  lillian felt this and asked with a sudden shyness coming over her but you are a gentleman and so no one will mind even if you are not rich  how do you know what i am he asked quickly  i heard hester tell the housekeeper that you were not what you seemed and one day she hoped youd get your right place again i asked mamma about it and she said she would not let me be with you so much if you were not a fit companion for me i was not to speak of it but she means to be your friend and help you byandby  does she  and the boy laughed an odd short laugh that jarred on lillians ear and made her say reprovingly you are proud i know but youll let us help you because we like to do it and i have no brother to share my money with  would you like one or a sister asked paul looking straight into her face with his piercing eyes  yes indeed i long for someone to be with me and love me as mamma cant  would you be willing to share everything with another personperhaps have to give them a great many things you like and now have all to yourself  i think i should im selfish i know because everyone pets and spoils me but if i loved a person dearly id give up anything to them indeed i would paul pray believe me  she spoke earnestly and leaned on his shoulder as if to enforce her words the boys arm stole around the little figure in the saddle and a beautiful bright smile broke over his face as he answered warmly i do believe it dear and it makes me happy to hear you say so dont be afraid im your equal but ill not forget that you are my little mistress till i can change from groom to gentleman  he added the last sentence as he withdrew his arm for lillian had shrunk a little and blushed with surprise not anger at this first breach of respect on the part of her companion both were silent for a moment paul looking down and lillian busy with her nosegay she spoke first assuming an air of satisfaction as she surveyed her work  that will please mamma im sure and make her quite forget my naughty prank of yesterday do you know i offended her dreadfully by peeping into the gold case she wears on her neck she was asleep and i was sitting by her in her sleep she pulled it out and said something about a letter and papa i wanted to see papas face for i never did because the big picture of him is gone from the gallery where the others are so i peeped into the case when she let it drop and was so disappointed to find nothing but a key  a key what sort of a key cried paul in an eager tone  oh a little silver one like the key of my piano or the black cabinet she woke and was very angry to find me meddling  what did it belong to asked paul  her treasure box she said but i dont know where or what that is and i dare not ask any more for she forbade my speaking to her about it poor mamma im always troubling her in some way or other  with a penitent sigh lillian tied up her flowers and handed them to paul to carry as she did so the change in his face struck her  how grim and old you look she exclaimed have i said anything that troubles you  no miss lillian im only thinking  then i wish you wouldnt think for you get a great wrinkle in your forehead your eyes grow almost black and your mouth looks fierce you are a very odd person paul one minute as gay as any boy and the next as grave and stern as a man with a deal of work to do  i have got a deal of work to do so no wonder i look old and grim  what work paul  to make my fortune and win my lady  when paul spoke in that tone and wore that look lillian felt as if they had changed places and he was the master and she the servant she wondered over this in her childish mind but proud and willful as she was she liked it and obeyed him with unusual meekness when he suggested that it was time to return as he rode silently beside her she stole covert glances at him from under her wide hat brim and studied his unconscious face as she had never done before his lips moved now and then but uttered no audible sound his black brows were knit and once his hand went to his breast as if he thought of the little sweetheart whose picture lay there  hes got a trouble i wish hed tell me and let me help him if i can ill make him show me that miniature someday for im interested in that girl thought lillian with a pensive sigh  as he held his hand for her little foot in dismounting her at the hall door paul seemed to have shaken off his grave mood for he looked up and smiled at her with his blithest expression but lillian appeared to be the thoughtful one now and with an air of dignity very pretty and becoming thanked her young squire in a stately manner and swept into the house looking tall and womanly in her flowing skirts  paul laughed as he glanced after her and flinging himself onto his horse rode away to the stables at a reckless pace as if to work off some emotion for which he could find no other vent  heres a letter for you lad all the way from some place in italy who do you know there said bedford as the boy came back  with a hasty thank you paul caught the letter and darted away to his own room there to tear it open and after reading a single line to drop into a chair as if he had received a sudden blow growing paler and paler he read on and when the letter fell from his hands he exclaimed in a tone of despair how could he die at such a time  for an hour the boy sat thinking intently with locked door curtained window and several papers strewn before him letters memoranda plans drawings and bits of parchment all of which he took from a small locked portfolio always worn about him over these he pored with a face in which hope despondency resolve and regret alternated rapidly taking the locket out he examined a ring which lay in one side and the childish face which smiled on him from the other his eyes filled as he locked and put it by saying tenderly dear little heart ill not forget or desert her whatever happens time must help me and to time i must leave my work one more attempt and then im off                                       ill go to bed now hester but while you get my things ready ill take a turn in the corridor the air will refresh me  as she spoke lady trevlyn drew her wrapper about her and paced softly down the long hall lighted only by fitful gleams of moonlight and the ruddy glow of the fire at the far end was the state chamber never used now and never visited except by hester who occasionally went in to dust and air it and my lady who always passed the anniversary of sir richards death alone there the gallery was very dark and she seldom went farther than the last window in her restless walks but as she now approached she was startled to see a streak of yellow light under the door she kept the key herself and neither she nor hester had been there that day a cold shiver passed over her for as she looked the shadow of a foot darkened the light for a moment and vanished as if someone had noiselessly passed obeying a sudden impulse my lady sprang forward and tried to open the door it was locked but as her hand turned the silver knob a sound as if a drawer softly closed met her ear she stooped to the keyhole but it was dark a key evidently being in the lock she drew back and flew to her room snatched the key from her dressing table and bidding hester follow returned to the hall  what is it my lady cried the woman alarmed at the agitation of her mistress  a light a sound a shadow in the state chamber come quick cried lady trevlyn adding as she pointed to the door there there the light shines underneath do you see it  no my lady its dark returned hester  it was but never pausing my lady thrust in the key and to her surprise it turned the door flew open and the dim still room was before them hester boldly entered and while her mistress slowly followed she searched the room looking behind the tall screen by the hearth up the wide chimney in the great wardrobe and under the ebony cabinet where all the relics of sir richard were kept nothing appeared not even a mouse and hester turned to my lady with an air of relief but her mistress pointed to the bed shrouded in dark velvet hangings and whispered breathlessly you forgot to look there  hester had not forgotten but in spite of her courage and good sense she shrank a little from looking at the spot where she had last seen her masters dead face she believed the light and sound to be phantoms of my ladys distempered fancy and searched merely to satisfy her the mystery of sir richards death still haunted the minds of all who remembered it and even hester felt a superstitious dread of that room with a nervous laugh she looked under the bed and drawing back the heavy curtains said soothingly you see my lady theres nothing there  but the words died on her lips for as the pale glimmer of the candle pierced the gloom of that funeral couch both saw a face upon the pillow a pale face framed in dark hair and beard with closed eyes and the stony look the dead wear a loud long shriek that roused the house broke from lady trevlyn as she fell senseless at the bedside and dropping both curtain and candle hester caught up her mistress and fled from the haunted room locking the door behind her  in a moment a dozen servants were about them and into their astonished ears hester poured her story while vainly trying to restore her lady great was the dismay and intense the unwillingness of anyone to obey when hester ordered the men to search the room again for she was the first to regain her selfpossession  wheres paul hes the heart of a man boy though he is she said angrily as the men hung back  hes not here lord maybe it was him aplaying tricks though it aint like him cried bessy lillians little maid  no it cant be him for i locked him in myself he walks in his sleep sometimes and i was afraid hed startle my lady let him sleep this would only excite him and set him to marching again follow me bedford and james im not afraid of ghosts or rogues  with a face that belied her words hester led the way to the awful room and flinging back the curtain resolutely looked in the bed was empty but on the pillow was plainly visible the mark of a head and a single scarlet stain as of blood at that sight hester turned pale and caught the butlers arm whispering with a shudder do you remember the night we put him in his coffin the drop of blood that fell from his white lips sir richard has been here  good lord maam dont say that we can never rest in our beds if such things are to happen gasped bedford backing to the door  its no use to look weve found all we shall find so go your ways and tell no one of this said the woman in a gloomy tone and having assured herself that the windows were fast hester locked the room and ordered everyone but bedford and the housekeeper to bed do you sit outside my ladys door till morning she said to the butler and you mrs price help me to tend my poor lady for if im not mistaken this nights work will bring on the old trouble  morning came and with it a new alarm for though his door was fast locked and no foothold for even a sparrow outside the window pauls room was empty and the boy nowhere to be found     chapter v  a hero   four years had passed and lillian was fast blooming into a lovely woman proud and willful as ever but very charming and already a belle in the little world where she still reigned a queen owing to her mothers ill health she was allowed more freedom than is usually permitted to an english girl of her age and during the season often went into company with a friend of lady trevlyns who was chaperoning two young daughters of her own to the world lillian seemed a gay freehearted girl and no one not even her mother knew how well she remembered and how much she missed the lost paul no tidings of him had ever come and no trace of him was found after his flight nothing was missed he went without his wages and no reason could be divined for his departure except the foreign letter bedford remembered it but forgot what postmark it bore for he had only been able to decipher italy my lady made many inquiries and often spoke of him but when month after month passed and no news came she gave him up and on lillians account feigned to forget him contrary to hesters fear she did not seem the worse for the nocturnal fright but evidently connected the strange visitor with paul or after a day or two of nervous exhaustion returned to her usual state of health hester had her own misgivings but being forbidden to allude to the subject she held her peace after emphatically declaring that paul would yet appear to set her mind at rest  lillian lillian ive such news for you come and hear a charming little romance and prepare to see the hero of it cried maud churchill rushing into her friends pretty boudoir one day in the height of the season  lillian lay on a couch rather languid after a ball and listlessly begged maud to tell her story for she was dying to be amused  well my dear just listen and youll be as enthusiastic as i am cried maud and throwing her bonnet on one chair her parasol on another and her gloves anywhere she settled herself on the couch and began you remember reading in the papers some time ago that fine account of the young man who took part in the italian revolution and did that heroic thing with the bombshell  yes what of him asked lillian sitting up  he is my hero and we are to see him tonight  go on go on tell all and tell it quickly she cried  you know the officers were sitting somewhere holding a council while the city i forget the name was being bombarded and how a shell came into the midst of them how they sat paralyzed expecting it to burst and how this young man caught it up and ran out with it risking his own life to save theirs  yes yes i remember and lillians listless face kindled at the recollection  well an englishman who was there was so charmed by the act that finding the young man was poor and an orphan he adopted him mr talbot was old and lonely and rich and when he died a year after he left his name and fortune to this paolo  im glad im glad cried lillian clapping her hands with a joyful face how romantic and charming it is  isnt it but my dear creature the most romantic part is to come young talbot served in the war and then came to england to take possession of his property its somewhere down in kent a fine place and good income all his and he deserves it mamma heard a deal about him from mrs langdon who knew old talbot and has seen the young man of course all the girls are wild to behold him for he is very handsome and accomplished and a gentleman by birth but the dreadful part is that he is already betrothed to a lovely greek girl who came over at the same time and is living in london with a companion quite elegantly mrs langdon says for she called and was charmed this girl has been seen by some of our gentlemen friends and they already rave about the fair helene for thats her name  here maud was forced to stop for breath and lillian had a chance to question her  how old is she  about eighteen or nineteen they say  very pretty  ravishing regularly greek and divine fred raleigh says  when is she to be married  dont know when talbot gets settled i fancy  and he is he as charming as she  quite im told hes just of age and is in appearance as in everything else a hero of romance  how came your mother to secure him for tonight  mrs langdon is dying to make a lion of him and begged to bring him he is very indifferent on such things and seems intent on his own affairs is grave and old for his years and doesnt seem to care much for pleasure and admiration as most men would after a youth like his for he has had a hard time i believe for a wonder he consented to come when mrs langdon asked him and i flew off at once to tell you and secure you for tonight  a thousand thanks i meant to rest for mamma frets about my being so gay but she wont object to a quiet evening with you what shall we wear and here the conversation branched off on the allabsorbing topic of dress  when lillian joined her friend that evening the hero had already arrived and stepping into a recess she waited to catch a glimpse of him maud was called away and she was alone when the crowd about the inner room thinned and permitted young talbot to be seen well for lillian that no one observed her at that moment for she grew pale and sank into a chair exclaiming below her breath it is paulmy paul  she recognized him instantly in spite of increased height a dark moustache and martial bearing it was paul older graver handsomer but still her paul as she called him with a flush of pride and delight as she watched him and felt that of all there she knew him best and loved him most for the childish affection still existed and this discovery added a tinge of romance that made it doubly dangerous as well as doubly pleasant  will he know me she thought glancing at a mirror which reflected a slender figure with bright hair white arms and brilliant eyes a graceful little head proudly carried and a sweet mouth just then very charming as it smiled till pearly teeth shone between the ruddy lips  im glad im not ugly and i hope hell like me she thought as she smoothed the golden ripples on her forehead settled her sash and shook out the folds of her airy dress in a flutter of girlish excitement ill pretend not to know him when we meet and see what he will do she said with a wicked sense of power for being forewarned she was forearmed and fearing no betrayal of surprise on her own part was eager to enjoy any of which he might be guilty  leaving her nook she joined a group of young friends and held herself prepared for the meeting presently she saw maud and mrs langdon approaching evidently intent on presenting the hero to the heiress  mr talbot miss trevlyn said the lady and looking up with a wellassumed air of indifference lillian returned the gentlemans bow with her eyes fixed full upon his face  not a feature of that face changed and so severely unconscious of any recognition was it that the girl was bewildered for a moment she fancied she had been mistaken in his identity and a pang of disappointment troubled her but as he moved a chair for maud she saw on the one ungloved hand a little scar which she remembered well for he received it in saving her from a dangerous fall at the sight all the happy past rose before her and if her telltale eyes had not been averted they would have betrayed her a sudden flush of maidenly shame dyed her cheek as she remembered that last ride and the childish confidences then interchanged this helen was the little sweetheart whose picture he wore and now in spite of all obstacles he had won both fortune and ladylove the sound of his voice recalled her thoughts and glancing up she met the deep eyes fixed on her with the same steady look they used to wear he had addressed her but what he said she knew not beyond a vague idea that it was some slight allusion to the music going on in the next room with a smile which would serve for an answer to almost any remark she hastily plunged into conversation with a composure that did her credit in the eyes of her friends who stood in awe of the young hero for all were but just out  mr talbot hardly needs an introduction here for his name is wellknown among us though this is perhaps his first visit to england she said flattering herself that this artful speech would entrap him into the reply she wanted  with a slight frown as if the allusion to his adventure rather annoyed him and a smile that puzzled all but lillian he answered very simply it is not my first visit to this hospitable island i was here a few years ago for a short time and left with regret  then you have old friends here and lillian watched him as she spoke  i had they had doubtless forgotten me now he said with a sudden shadow marring the tranquillity of his face  why doubt them if they were true friends they will not forget  the words were uttered impulsively almost warmly but talbot made no response except a polite inclination and an abrupt change in the conversation  that remains to be proved do you sing miss trevlyn  a little and lillians tone was both cold and proud  a great deal and very charmingly added maud who took pride in her friends gifts both of voice and beauty come dear there are so few of us you will sing i know mamma desired me to ask you when edith had done  to her surprise lillian complied and allowed talbot to lead her to the instrument still hoping to win some sign of recognition from him the girl chose an air he taught her and sang it with a spirit and skill that surprised the listeners who possessed no key to her mood at the last verse her voice suddenly faltered but talbot took up the song and carried her safely through it with his welltuned voice  you know the air then she said in a low tone as a hum of commendation followed the music  all italians sing it though few do it like yourself he answered quietly restoring the fan he had held while standing beside her  provoking boy why wont he know me thought lillian and her tone was almost petulant as she refused to sing again  talbot offered his arm and led her to a seat behind which stood a little statuette of a child holding a fawn by a daisy chain  pretty isnt it she said as he paused to look at it instead of taking the chair before her i used to enjoy modeling tiny deer and hinds in wax as well as making daisy chains is sculpture among the many accomplishments which rumor tells us you possess  no those who like me have their own fortunes to mold find time for little else he answered gravely still examining the marble group  lillian broke her fan with an angry flirt for she was tired of her trial and wished she had openly greeted him at the beginning feeling now how pleasant it would have been to sit chatting of old times while her friends dared hardly address him at all she was on the point of calling him by his former name when the remembrance of what he had been arrested the words on her lips he was proud would he not dread to have it known that in his days of adversity he had been a servant for if she betrayed her knowledge of his past she would be forced to tell where and how that knowledge was gained no better wait till they met alone she thought he would thank her for her delicacy and she could easily explain her motive he evidently wished to seem a stranger for once she caught a gleam of the old mirthful mischief in his eye as she glanced up unexpectedly he did remember her she was sure yet was trying her perhaps as she tried him well she would stand the test and enjoy the joke byandby with this fancy in her head she assumed a gracious air and chatted away in her most charming style feeling both gay and excited so anxious was she to please and so glad to recover her early friend a naughty whim seized her as her eye fell on a portfolio of classical engravings which someone had left in disorder on a table near her tossing them over she asked his opinion of several and then handed him one in which helen of troy was represented as giving her hand to the irresistible paris  do you think her worth so much bloodshed and deserving so much praise she asked vainly trying to conceal the significant smile that would break loose on her lips and sparkle in her eyes  talbot laughed the short boyish laugh so familiar to her ears as he glanced from the picture to the arch questioner and answered in a tone that made her heart beat with a nameless pain and pleasure so full of suppressed ardor was it  yes all for love or the world well lost is a saying i heartily agree to la belle helene is my favorite heroine and i regard paris as the most enviable of men  i should like to see her  the wish broke from lillian involuntarily and she was too much confused to turn it off by any general expression of interest in the classical lady  you may sometime answered talbot with an air of amusement adding as if to relieve her i have a poetical belief that all the lovely women of history or romance will meet and know and love each other in some charming hereafter  but im no heroine and no beauty so i shall never enter your poetical paradise said lillian with a pretty affectation of regret  some women are beauties without knowing it and the heroines of romances never given to the world i think you and helen will yet meet miss trevlyn  as he spoke mrs langdon beckoned and he left her pondering over his last words and conscious of a secret satisfaction in his implied promise that she should see his betrothed  how do you like him whispered maud slipping into the empty chair  very well was the composed reply for lillian enjoyed her little mystery too much to spoil it yet  what did you say to him i longed to hear for you seemed to enjoy yourselves very much but i didnt like to be a marplot  lillian repeated a part of the conversation and maud professed to be consumed with jealousy at the impression her friend had evidently made  it is folly to try to win the hero for he is already won you know answered lillian shutting the cover on the pictured helen with a sudden motion as if glad to extinguish her  oh dear no mrs langdon just told mamma that she was mistaken about their being engaged for she asked him and he shook his head saying helen was his ward  but that is absurd for hes only a boy himself its very odd isnt it never mind i shall soon know all about it  how cried maud amazed at lillians assured manner  wait a day or two and ill tell you a romance in return for yours your mother beckons to me so i know hester has come good night ive had a charming time  and with this tantalizing adieu lillian slipped away hester was waiting in the carriage but as lillian appeared talbot put aside the footman and handed her in saying very low in the wellremembered tone  good night my little mistress     chapter vi  fair helen   to no one but her mother and hester did lillian confide the discovery she had made none of the former servants but old bedford remained with them and till paul chose to renew the old friendship it was best to remain silent great was the surprise and delight of our lady and hester at the good fortune of their protege and many the conjectures as to how he would explain his hasty flight  you will go and see him wont you mamma or at least inquire about him said lillian eager to assure the wanderer of a welcome for those few words of his had satisfied her entirely  no dear it is for him to seek us and till he does i shall make no sign he knows where we are and if he chooses he can renew the acquaintance so strangely broken off be patient and above all things remember lillian that you are no longer a child replied my lady rather disturbed by her daughters enthusiastic praises of paul  i wish i was for then i might act as i feel and not be afraid of shocking the proprieties and lillian went to bed to dream of her hero  for three days she stayed at home expecting paul but he did not come and she went out for her usual ride in the park hoping to meet him an elderly groom now rode behind her and she surveyed him with extreme disgust as she remembered the handsome lad who had once filled that place nowhere did paul appear but in the ladies mile she passed an elegant brougham in which sat a very lovely girl and a mild old lady  that is talbots fiancee said maud churchill who had joined her isnt she beautiful  not at allyes very was lillians somewhat peculiar reply for jealousy and truth had a conflict just then hes so perfectly absorbed and devoted that i am sure that story is true so adieu to our hopes laughed maud  did you have any goodbye i must go and lillian rode home at a pace which caused the stout groom great distress  mamma ive seen pauls betrothed she cried running into her mothers boudoir  and i have seen paul himself replied my lady with a warning look for there he stood with halfextended hand as if waiting to be acknowledged  lillian forgot her embarrassment in her pleasure and made him an elaborate curtsy saying with a halfmerry halfreproachful glance mr talbot is welcome in whatever guise he appears  i choose to appear as paul then and offer you a seat miss lillian he said assuming as much of his boyish manner as he could  lillian took it and tried to feel at ease but the difference between the lad she remembered and the man she now saw was too great to be forgotten  now tell us your adventures and why you vanished away so mysteriously four years ago she said with a touch of the childish imperiousness in her voice though her frank eyes fell before his  i was about to do so when you appeared with news concerning my cousin he began  your cousin exclaimed lillian  yes helens mother and my own were sisters both married englishmen both died young leaving us to care for each other we were like a brother and sister and always together till i left her to serve colonel daventry the death of the old priest to whom i entrusted her recalled me to genoa for i was then her only guardian i meant to have taken leave of you my lady properly but the consequences of that foolish trick of mine frightened me away in the most unmannerly fashion  ah it was you then in the state chamber i always thought so and lady trevlyn drew a long breath of relief  yes i heard it whispered among the servants that the room was haunted and i felt a wish to prove the truth of the story and my own courage hester locked me in for fear of my sleepwalking but i lowered myself by a rope and then climbed in at the closet window of the state chamber when you came my lady i thought it was hester and slipped into the bed meaning to give her a fright in return for her turning the key on me but when your cry showed me what i had done i was filled with remorse and escaped as quickly and quietly as possible i should have asked pardon before i do now most humbly my lady for it was sacrilege to play pranks there  during the first part of his story pauls manner had been frank and composed but in telling the latter part his demeanor underwent a curious change he fixed his eyes on the ground and spoke as if repeating a lesson while his color varied and a halfproud halfsubmissive expression replaced the former candid one lillian observed this and it disturbed her but my lady took it for shame at his boyish freak and received his confession kindly granting a free pardon and expressing sincere pleasure at his amended fortunes as he listened lillian saw him clench his hand hard and knit his brows assuming the grim look she had often seen as if trying to steel himself against some importunate emotion or rebellious thought  yes half my work is done and i have a home thanks to my generous benefactor and i hope to enjoy it well and wisely he said in a grave tone as if the fortune had not yet brought him his hearts desire  and when is the other half of the work to be accomplished paul that depends on your cousin perhaps and lady trevlyn regarded him with a gleam of womanly curiosity in her melancholy eyes  it does but not in the way you fancy my lady whatever helen may be she is not my fiancee yet miss lillian and the shadow lifted as he laughed looking at the young lady who was decidedly abashed in spite of a sense of relief caused by his words  i merely accepted the worlds report she said affecting a nonchalant air  the world is a liar as you will find in time was his abrupt reply  i hope to see this beautiful cousin paul will she receive us as old friends of yours  thanks not yet my lady she is still too much a stranger here to enjoy new faces even kind ones i have promised perfect rest and freedom for a time but you shall be the first whom she receives  again lillian detected the secret disquiet which possessed him and her curiosity was roused it piqued her that this helen felt no desire to meet her and chose to seclude herself as if regardless of the interest and admiration she excited i will see her in spite of her refusal for i only caught a glimpse in the park something is wrong and ill discover it for it evidently worries paul and perhaps i can help him  as this purpose sprang up in the warm but willful heart of the girl she regained her spirits and was her most charming self while the young man stayed they talked of many things in a pleasant confidential manner though when lillian recalled that hour she was surprised to find how little paul had really told them of his past life or future plans it was agreed among them to say nothing of their former relations except to old bedford who was discretion itself but to appear to the world as newmade friendsthus avoiding unpleasant and unnecessary explanations which would only excite gossip my lady asked him to dine but he had business out of town and declined taking his leave with a lingering look which made lillian steal away to study her face in the mirror and wonder if she looked her best for in pauls eyes she had read undisguised admiration  lady trevlyn went to her room to rest leaving the girl free to ride drive or amuse herself as she liked as if fearing her courage would fail if she delayed lillian ordered the carriage and bidding hester mount guard over her she drove away to st johns wood  now hester dont lecture or be prim when i tell you that we are going on a frolic she began after getting the old woman into an amiable mood by every winning wile she could devise i think youll like it and if its found out ill take the blame there is some mystery about pauls cousin and im going to find it out  bless you child how  she lives alone here is seldom seen and wont go anywhere or receive anyone thats not natural in a pretty girl paul wont talk about her and though hes fond of her he always looks grave and grim when i ask questions thats provoking and i wont hear it maud is engaged to raleigh you know well he confided to her that he and a friend had found out where helen was had gone to the next villa which is empty and under pretense of looking at it got a peep at the girl in her garden im going to do the same  and what am i to do asked hester secretly relishing the prank for she was dying with curiosity to behold pauls cousin  you are to do the talking with the old woman and give me a chance to look now say you will and ill behave myself like an angel in return  hester yielded after a few discreet scruples and when they reached laburnum lodge played her part so well that lillian soon managed to stray away into one of the upper rooms which overlooked the neighboring garden helen was there and with eager eyes the girl scrutinized her she was very beautiful in the classical style as fair and finely molded as a statue with magnificent dark hair and eyes and possessed of that perfect grace which is as effective as beauty she was alone and when first seen was bending over a flower which she caressed and seemed to examine with great interest as she stood a long time motionless before it then she began to pace slowly around and around the little grass plot her hands hanging loosely clasped before her and her eyes fixed on vacancy as if absorbed in thought but as the first effect of her beauty passed away lillian found something peculiar about her it was not the somewhat foreign dress and ornaments she wore it was in her face her movements and the tone of her voice for as she walked she sang a low monotonous song as if unconsciously lillian watched her keenly marking the aimless motions of the little hands the apathy of the lovely face and the mirthless accent of the voice but most of all the vacant fixture of the great dark eyes around and around she went with an elastic step and a mechanical regularity wearisome to witness  what is the matter with her thought lillian anxiously as this painful impression increased with every scrutiny of the unconscious girl so abashed was she that hesters call was unheard and hester was unseen as she came and stood beside her both looked a moment and as they looked an old lady came from the house and led helen in still murmuring her monotonous song and moving her hands as if to catch and hold the sunshine  poor dear poor dear no wonder paul turns sad and wont talk of her and that she dont see anyone sighed hester pitifully  what is it i see but dont understand whispered lillian  shes an innocent deary an idiot though thats a hard word for a pretty creature like her  how terrible come away hester and never breathe to anyone what we have seen and with a shudder and sense of pain and pity lying heavy at her heart she hurried away feeling doubly guilty in the discovery of this affliction the thought of it haunted her continually the memory of the lonely girl gave her no peace and a consciousness of deceit burdened her unspeakably especially in pauls presence this lasted for a week then lillian resolved to confess hoping that when he found she knew the truth he would let her share his cross and help to lighten it waiting her opportunity she seized a moment when her mother was absent and with her usual frankness spoke out impetuously  paul ive done wrong and i can have no peace till i am pardoned i have seen helen  where when and how he asked looking disturbed and yet relieved  she told him rapidly and as she ended she looked up at him with her sweet face so full of pity shame and grief it would have been impossible to deny her anything  can you forgive me for discovering this affliction  i think i could forgive you a far greater fault lillian he answered in a tone that said many things  but deceit is so mean so dishonorable and contemptible how can you so easily pardon it in me she asked quite overcome by this forgiveness granted without any reproach  then you would find it hard to pardon such a thing in another he said with the expression that always puzzled her  yes it would be hard but in those i loved i could forgive much for loves sake  with a sudden gesture he took her hand saying impulsively how little changed you are do you remember that last ride of ours nearly five years ago  yes paul she answered with averted eyes  and what we talked of  a part of that childish gossip i remember well  which part  the pretty little romance you told me and lillian looked up now longing to ask if helens childhood had been blighted like her youth  paul dropped her hand as if he read her thoughts and his own hand went involuntarily toward his breast betraying that the locket still hung there  what did i say he asked smiling at her sudden shyness  you vowed youd win and wed your fair little ladylove if you lived  and so i will he cried with sudden fire in his eyes  what marry her  aye that i will  oh paul will you tie yourself for life to a the word died on her lips but a gesture of repugnance finished the speech  a what he demanded excitedly  an innocent one bereft of reason stammered lillian entirely forgetting herself in her interest for him  of whom do you speak asked paul looking utterly bewildered  of poor helen  good heavens who told you that base lie and his voice deepened with indignant pain  i saw her you did not deny her affliction hester said so and i believed it have i wronged her paul  yes cruelly she is blind but no idiot thank god  there was such earnestness in his voice such reproach in his words and such ardor in his eye that lillians pride gave way and with a broken entreaty for pardon she covered up her face weeping the bitterest tears she ever shed for in that moment and the sharp pang it brought her she felt how much she loved paul and how hard it was to lose him the childish affection had blossomed into a womans passion and in a few short weeks had passed through many phases of jealousy hope despair and selfdelusion the joy she felt on seeing him again the pride she took in him the disgust helen caused her the relief she had not dared to own even to herself when she fancied fate had put an insurmountable barrier between paul and his cousin the despair at finding it only a fancy and the anguish of hearing him declare his unshaken purpose to marry his first loveall these conflicting emotions had led to this hard moment and now selfcontrol deserted her in her need in spite of her efforts the passionate tears would have their way though paul soothed her with assurances of entire forgiveness promises of helens friendship and every gentle device he could imagine she commanded herself at last by a strong effort murmuring eagerly as she shrank from the hand that put back her fallen hair and the face so full of tender sympathy bending over her  i am so grieved and ashamed at what i have said and done i shall never dare to see helen forgive me and forget this folly im sad and heavyhearted just now its the anniversary of papas death and mamma always suffers so much at such times that i get nervous  it is your birthday also i remembered it and ventured to bring a little token in return for the one you gave me long ago this is a talisman and tomorrow i will tell you the legend concerning it wear it for my sake and god bless you dear  the last words were whispered hurriedly lillian saw the glitter of an antique ring felt the touch of bearded lips on her hand and paul was gone  but as he left the house he set his teeth exclaiming low to himself yes tomorrow there shall be an end of this we must risk everything and abide the consequences now ill have no more torment for any of us     chapter vii  the secret key   is lady trevlyn at home bedford asked paul as he presented himself at an early hour next day wearing the keen stern expression which made him look ten years older than he was  no sir my lady and miss lillian went down to the hall last night  no ill news i hope and the young mans eye kindled as if he felt a crisis at hand  not that i heard sir miss lillian took one of her sudden whims and would have gone alone if my lady hadnt given in much against her will this being a time when she is better away from the place  did they leave no message for me  yes sir will you step in and read the note at your ease we are in sad confusion but this room is in order  leading the way to lillians boudoir the man presented the note and retired a few hasty lines from my lady regretting the necessity of this abrupt departure yet giving no reason for it hoping they might meet next season but making no allusion to seeing him at the hall desiring lillians thanks and regards but closing with no hint of helen except compliments paul smiled as he threw it into the fire saying to himself poor lady she thinks she has escaped the danger by flying and lillian tries to hide her trouble from me tender little heart ill comfort it without delay  he sat looking about the dainty room still full of tokens of her presence the piano stood open with a song he liked upon the rack a bit of embroidery whose progress he had often watched lay in her basket with the little thimble near it there was a strew of papers on the writing table torn notes scraps of drawing and ball cards a pearlcolored glove lay on the floor and in the grate the faded flowers he had brought two days before as his eye roved to and fro he seemed to enjoy some happy dream broken too soon by the sound of servants shutting up the house he arose but lingered near the table as if longing to search for some forgotten hint of himself  no there has been enough lock picking and stealthy work ill do no more for her sake this theft will harm no one and tell no tales and snatching up the glove paul departed  helen the time has come are you ready he asked entering her room an hour later  i am ready and rising she stretched her hand to him with a proud expression contrasting painfully with her helpless gesture  they have gone to the hall and we must follow it is useless to wait longer we gain nothing by it and the claim must stand on such proof as we have or fall for want of that one link i am tired of disguise i want to be myself and enjoy what i have won unless i lose it all  paul whatever happens remember we cling together and share good or evil fortune as we always have done i am a burden but i cannot live without you for you are my world do not desert me  she groped her way to him and clung to his strong arm as if it was her only stay paul drew her close saying wistfully as he caressed the beautiful sightless face leaning on his shoulder mia cara would it break your heart if at the last hour i gave up all and let the word remain unspoken my courage fails me and in spite of the hard past i would gladly leave them in peace  no no you shall not give it up cried helen almost fiercely while the slumbering fire of her southern nature flashed into her face you have waited so long worked so hard suffered so much you must not lose your reward you promised and you must keep the promise  but it is so beautiful so noble to forgive and return a blessing for a curse let us bury the old feud and right the old wrong in a new way those two are so blameless it is cruel to visit the sins of the dead on their innocent heads my lady has suffered enough already and lillian is so young so happy so unfit to meet a storm like this oh helen mercy is more divine than justice  something moved paul deeply and helen seemed about to yield when the name of lillian wrought a subtle change in her the color died out of her face her black eyes burned with a gloomy fire and her voice was relentless as she answered while her frail hands held him fast i will not let you give it up we are as innocent as they we have suffered more and we deserve our rights for we have no sin to expiate go on paul and forget the sentimental folly that unmans you  something in her words seemed to sting or wound him his face darkened and he put her away saying briefly let it be so then in an hour we must go  on the evening of the same day lady trevlyn and her daughter sat together in the octagon room at the hall twilight was falling and candles were not yet brought but a cheery fire blazed in the wide chimney filling the apartment with a ruddy glow turning lillians bright hair to gold and lending a tinge of color to my ladys pallid cheeks the girl sat on a low lounging chair before the fire her head on her hand her eyes on the red embers her thoughtswhere my lady lay on her couch a little in the shadow regarding her daughter with an anxious air for over the young face a somber change had passed which filled her with disquiet  you are out of spirits love she said at last breaking the long silence as lillian gave an unconscious sigh and leaned wearily into the depths of her chair  yes mamma a little  what is it are you ill  no mamma i think london gaiety is rather too much for me im too young for it as you often say and ive found it out  then it is only weariness that makes you so pale and grave and so bent on coming back here  lillian was the soul of truth and with a moments hesitation answered slowly not that alone mamma im worried about other things dont ask me what please  but i must ask tell me child what things have you seen any one had letters or been annoyed in any way aboutanything  my lady spoke with sudden energy and rose on her arm eyeing the girl with unmistakable suspicion and excitement  no mamma its only a foolish trouble of my own answered lillian with a glance of surprise and a shamefaced look as the words reluctantly left her lips  ah a love trouble nothing more thank god for that and my lady sank back as if a load was off her mind tell me all my darling there is no confidante like a mother  you are very kind and perhaps you can cure my folly if i tell it and yet i am ashamed murmured the girl then yielding to an irresistible impulse to ask help and sympathy she added in an almost inaudible tone i came away to escape from paul  because he loves you lillian asked my lady with a frown and a half smile  because he does not love me mamma and the poor girl hid her burning cheeks in her hands as if overwhelmed with maidenly shame at the implied confession of her own affection  my child how is this i cannot but be glad that he does not love you yet it fills me with grief to see that this pains you he is not a mate for you lillian remember this and forget the transient regard that has sprung up from that early intimacy of yours  he is wellborn and now my equal in fortune and oh so much my superior in all gifts of mind and heart sighed the girl still with hidden face for tears were dropping through her slender fingers  it may be but there is a mystery about him and i have a vague dislike to him in spite of all that has passed but darling are you sure he does not care for you i fancied i read a different story in his face and when you begged to leave town so suddenly i believed that you had seen this also and kindly wished to spare him any pain  it was to spare myself oh mamma he loves helen and will marry her although she is blind he told me this with a look i could not doubt and so i came away to hide my sorrow sobbed poor lillian in despair  lady trevlyn went to her and laying the bright head on her motherly bosom said soothingly as she caressed it my little girl it is too soon for you to know these troubles and i am punished for yielding to your entreaties for a peep at the gay world it is now too late to spare you this you have had your wish and must pay its price dear but lillian call pride to aid you and conquer this fruitless love it cannot be very deep as yet for you have known paul the man too short a time to be hopelessly enamored remember there are others better braver more worthy of you that life is long and full of pleasure yet untried  have no fears for me mamma ill not disgrace you or myself by any sentimental folly i do love paul but i can conquer it and i will give me a little time and you shall see me quite myself again  lillian lifted her head with an air of proud resolve that satisfied her mother and with a grateful kiss stole away to ease her full heart alone as she disappeared lady trevlyn drew a long breath and clasping her hands with a gesture of thanksgiving murmured to herself in an accent of relief only a love sorrow i feared it was some new terror like the old one seventeen years of silence seventeen years of secret dread and remorse for me she said pacing the room with tightly locked hands and eyes full of unspeakable anguish oh richard richard i forgave you long ago and surely i have expiated my innocent offense by these years of suffering for her sake i did it and for her sake i still keep dumb god knows i ask nothing for myself but rest and oblivion by your side  half an hour later paul stood at the hall door it was ajar for the family had returned unexpectedly as was evident from the open doors and empty halls entering unseen he ascended to the room my lady usually occupied the fire burned low lillians chair was empty and my lady lay asleep as if lulled by the sighing winds without and the deep silence that reigned within paul stood regarding her with a great pity softening his face as he marked the sunken eyes pallid cheeks locks too early gray and restless lips muttering in dreams  i wish i could spare her this he sighed stooping to wake her with a word but he did not speak for suddenly clutching the chain about her neck she seemed to struggle with some invisible foe and beat it off muttering audibly as she clenched her thin hands on the golden case paul leaned and listened as if the first word had turned him to stone till the paroxysm had passed and with a heavy sigh my lady sank into a calmer sleep then with a quick glance over his shoulder paul skillfully opened the locket drew out the silver key replaced it with one from the piano close by and stole from the house noiselessly as he had entered it  that night in the darkest hour before the dawn a figure went gliding through the shadowy park to its most solitary corner here stood the tomb of the trevlyns and here the figure paused a dull spark of light woke in its hand there was a clank of bars the creak of rusty hinges then light and figure both seemed swallowed up  standing in the tomb where the air was close and heavy the pale glimmer of the lantern showed piles of moldering coffins in the niches and everywhere lay tokens of decay and death the man drew his hat lower over his eyes pulled the muffler closer about his mouth and surveyed the spot with an undaunted aspect though the beating of his heart was heard in the deep silence nearest the door stood a long casket covered with black velvet and richly decorated with silver ornaments tarnished now the trevlyns had been a stalwart race and the last sleeper brought there had evidently been of goodly stature for the modern coffin was as ponderous as the great oaken beds where lay the bones of generations lifting the lantern the intruder brushed the dust from the shieldshaped plate read the name richard trevlyn and a date and as if satisfied placed a key in the lock halfraised the lid and averting his head that he might not see the ruin seventeen long years had made he laid his hand on the dead breast and from the folded shroud drew a mildewed paper one glance sufficed the casket was relocked the door rebarred the light extinguished and the man vanished like a ghost in the darkness of the wild october night     chapter viii  which   a gentleman my lady  taking a card from the silver salver on which the servant offered it lady trevlyn read paul talbot and below the name these penciled words i beseech you to see me lillian stood beside her and saw the line their eyes met and in the girls face was such a sudden glow of hope and love and longing that the mother could not doubt or disappoint her wish  i will see him she said  oh mamma how kind you are cried the girl with a passionate embrace adding breathlessly he did not ask for me i cannot see him yet ill hide in the alcove and can appear or run away as i like when we know why he comes  they were in the library for knowing lillians fondness for the room which held no dark memories for her my lady conquered her dislike and often sat there as she spoke the girl glided into the deep recess of a bay window and drew the heavy curtains just as pauls step sounded at the door  hiding her agitation with a womans skill my lady rose with outstretched hand to welcome him he bowed but did not take the hand saying in a voice of grave respect in which was audible an undertone of strong emotion pardon me lady trevlyn hear what i have to say and then if you offer me your hand i shall gratefully receive it  she glanced at him and saw that he was very pale that his eye glittered with suppressed excitement and his whole manner was that of a man who had nerved himself up to the performance of a difficult but intensely interesting task fancying these signs of agitation only natural in a young lover coming to woo my lady smiled reseated herself and calmly answered i will listen patiently speak freely paul and remember i am an old friend  i wish i could forget it then my task would be easier he murmured in a voice of mingled regret and resolution as he leaned on a tall chair opposite and wiped his damp forehead with a look of such deep compassion that her heart sank with a nameless fear  i must tell you a long story and ask your forgiveness for the offenses i committed against you when a boy a mistaken sense of duty guided me and i obeyed it blindly now i see my error and regret it he said earnestly  go on replied my lady while the vague dread grew stronger and she braced her nerves as for some approaching shock she forgot lillian forgot everything but the strange aspect of the man before her and the words to which she listened like a statue still standing pale and steady paul spoke rapidly while his eyes were full of mingled sternness pity and remorse  twenty years ago an english gentleman met a friend in a little italian town where he had married a beautiful wife the wife had a sister as lovely as herself and the young man during that brief stay loved and married herin a very private manner lest his father should disinherit him a few months passed and the englishman was called home to take possession of his title and estates the father being dead he went alone promising to send for the wife when all was ready he told no one of his marriage meaning to surprise his english friends by producing the lovely woman unexpectedly he had been in england but a short time when he received a letter from the old priest of the italian town saying the cholera had swept through it carrying off half its inhabitants his wife and friend among others this blow prostrated the young man and when he recovered he hid his grief shut himself up in his country house and tried to forget accident threw in his way another lovely woman and he married again before the first year was out the friend whom he supposed was dead appeared and told him that his wife still lived and had borne him a child in the terror and confusion of the plague the priest had mistaken one sister for the other as the elder did die  yes yes i know go on gasped my lady with white lips and eyes that never left the narrators face  this friend had met with misfortune after flying from the doomed village with the surviving sister they had waited long for letters had written and when no answer came had been delayed by illness and poverty from reaching england at this time the child was born and the friend urged by the wife and his own interest came here learned that sir richard was married and hurried to him in much distress we can imagine the grief and horror of the unhappy man in that interview the friend promised to leave all to sir richard to preserve the secret till some means of relief could be found and with this promise he returned to guard and comfort the forsaken wife sir richard wrote the truth to lady trevlyn meaning to kill himself as the only way of escape from the terrible situation between two women both so beloved both so innocently wronged the pistol lay ready but death came without its aid and sir richard was spared the sin of suicide  paul paused for breath but lady trevlyn motioned him to go on still sitting rigid and white as the marble image near her  the friend only lived to reach home and tell the story it killed the wife and she died imploring the old priest to see her child righted and its fathers name secured to it he promised but he was poor the child was a frail baby and he waited years passed and when the child was old enough to ask for its parents and demand its due the proofs of the marriage were lost and nothing remained but a ring a bit of writing and the name the priest was very old had neither friends money nor proofs to help him but i was strong and hopeful and though a mere boy i resolved to do the work i made my way to england to trevlyn hall and by various stratagems among which i am ashamed to say were false keys and feigned sleepwalking i collected many proofs but nothing which would satisfy a court for no one but you knew where sir richards confession was i searched every nook and corner of the hall but in vain and began to despair when news of the death of father cosmo recalled me to italy for helen was left to my care then the old man had faithfully recorded the facts and left witnesses to prove the truth of his story but for four years i never used it never made any effort to secure the title or estates  why not breathed my lady in a faint whisper as hope suddenly revived  because i was grateful and for the first time pauls voice faltered i was a stranger and you took me in i never could forget that nor tie many kindnesses bestowed upon the friendless boy this afflicted me even while i was acting a false part and when i was away my heart failed me but helen gave me no peace for my sake she urged me to keep the vow made to that poor mother and threatened to tell the story herself talbots benefaction left me no excuse for delaying longer and i came to finish the hardest task i can ever undertake i feared that a long dispute would follow any appeal to law and meant to appeal first to you but fate befriended me and the last proof was found  found where cried lady trevlyn springing up aghast  in sir richards coffin where you hid it not daring to destroy yet fearing to keep it  who has betrayed me and her eye glanced wildly about the room as if she feared to see some spectral accuser  your own lips my lady last night i came to speak of this you lay asleep and in some troubled dream spoke of the paper safe in its writers keeping and your strange treasure here the key of which you guarded day and night i divined the truth remembering hesters stories i took the key from your helpless hand found the paper on sir richards dead breast and now demand that you confess your part in this tragedy  i do i do i confess i yield i relinquish everything and ask pity only for my child  lady trevlyn fell upon her knees before him with a submissive gesture but imploring eyes for amid the wreck of womanly pride and worldly fortune the mothers heart still clung to its idol  who should pity her if not i god knows i would have spared her this blow if i could but helen would not keep silent and i was driven to finish what i had begun tell lillian this and do not let her hate me  as paul spoke tenderly eagerly the curtain parted and lillian appeared trembling with the excitement of that interview but conscious of only one emotion as she threw herself into his arms crying in a tone of passionate delight brother brother now i may love you  paul held her close and for a moment forgot everything but the joy of that moment lillian spoke first looking up through tears of tenderness her little hand laid caressingly against his cheek as she whispered with sudden bloom in her own now i know why i loved you so well and now i can see you marry helen without breaking my heart oh paul you are still mine and i care for nothing else  but lillian i am not your brother  then in heavens name who are you she cried tearing herself from his arms  your lover dear  who then is the heir demanded lady trevlyn springing up as lillian turned to seek shelter with her mother  i am  helen spoke and helen stood on the threshold of the door with a hard haughty look upon her beautiful face  you told your story badly paul she said in a bitter tone you forgot me forgot my affliction my loneliness my wrongs and the natural desire of a child to clear her mothers honor and claim her fathers name i am sir richards eldest daughter i can prove my birth and i demand my right with his own words to sustain me  she paused but no one spoke and with a slight tremor in her proud voice she added paul has done the work he shall have the reward i only want my fathers name title and fortune are nothing to one like me i coveted and claimed them that i might give them to you paul my one friend always so tender and so true  ill have none of it he answered almost fiercely i have kept my promise and am free you chose to claim your own although i offered all i had to buy your silence it is yours by righttake it and enjoy it if you can ill have no reward for work like this  he turned from her with a look that would have stricken her to the heart could she have seen it she felt it and it seemed to augment some secret anguish for she pressed her hands against her bosom with an expression of deep suffering exclaiming passionately yes i will keep it since i am to lose all else i am tired of pity power is sweet and i will use it go paul and be happy if you can with a nameless wife and the worlds compassion or contempt to sting your pride  oh lillian where shall we go this is no longer our home but who will receive us now cried lady trevlyn in a tone of despair for her spirit was utterly broken by the thought of the shame and sorrow in store for this beloved and innocent child  i will and pauls face shone with a love and loyalty they could not doubt my lady you gave me a home when i was homeless now let me pay my debt lillian i have loved you from the time when a romantic boy i wore your little picture in my breast and vowed to win you if i lived i dared not speak before but now when other hearts may be shut against you mine stands wide open to welcome you come both let me protect and cherish you and so atone for the sorrow i have brought you  it was impossible to resist the sincere urgency of his voice the tender reverence of his manner as he took the two forlorn yet innocent creatures into the shelter of his strength and love they clung to him instinctively feeling that there still remained to them one staunch friend whom adversity could not estrange  an eloquent silence fell upon the room broken only by sobs grateful whispers and the voiceless vows that lovers plight with eyes and hands and tender lips helen was forgotten till lillian whose elastic spirit threw off sorrow as a flower sheds the rain looked up to thank paul with smiles as well as tears and saw the lonely figure in the shadow her attitude was full of pathetic significance she still stood on the threshold for no one had welcomed her and in the strange room she knew not where to go her hands were clasped before her face as if those sightless eyes had seen the joy she could not share and at her feet lay the timestained paper that gave her a barren title but no love had lillian known how sharp a conflict between passion and pride jealousy and generosity was going on in that young heart she could not have spoken in a tone of truer pity or sincerer goodwill than that in which she softly said poor girl we must not forget her for with all her wealth she is poor compared to us we both had one father and should love each other in spite of this misfortune helen may i call you sister  not yet wait till i deserve it  as if that sweet voice had kindled an answering spark of nobleness in her own heart helens face changed beautifully as she tore the paper to shreds saying in a glad impetuous tone while the white flakes fluttered from her hands i too can be generous i too can forgive i bury the sad past see i yield my claim i destroy my proofs i promise eternal silence and keep pauls cousin for my only title yes you are happy for you love one another she cried with a sudden passion of tears oh forgive me pity me and take me in for i am all alone and in the dark  there could be but one reply to an appeal like that and they gave it as they welcomed her with words that sealed a household league of mutual secrecy and sacrifice  they were happy for the world never knew the hidden tie that bound them so faithfully together never learned how well the old prophecy had been fulfilled or guessed what a tragedy of life and death the silver key unlocked
