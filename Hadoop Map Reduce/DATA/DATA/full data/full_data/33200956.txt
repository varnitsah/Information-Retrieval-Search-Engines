33200956	on the decay of the art of lying  by mark twain sameul clemens     essay for discussion read at a meeting of the historical and antiquarian club of hartford and offered for the thirtydollar prize   did not take the prize    observe i do not mean to suggest that the custom of lying has suffered any decay or interruptionno for the lie as a virtue a principle is eternal the lie as a recreation a solace a refuge in time of need the fourth grace the tenth muse mans best and surest friend is immortal and cannot perish from the earth while this club remains my complaint simply concerns the decay of the art of lying no highminded man no man of right feeling can contemplate the lumbering and slovenly lying of the present day without grieving to see a noble art so prostituted in this veteran presence i naturally enter upon this theme with diffidence it is like an old maid trying to teach nursery matters to the mothers in israel it would not become to me to criticise you gentlemenwho are nearly all my eldersand my superiors in this thingif i should here and there seem to do it i trust it will in most cases be more in a spirit of admiration than faultfinding indeed if this finest of the fine arts had everywhere received the attention the encouragement and conscientious practice and development which this club has devoted to it i should not need to utter this lament or shred a single tear i do not say this to flatter i say it in a spirit of just and appreciative recognition it had been my intention at this point to mention names and to give illustrative specimens but indications observable about me admonished me to beware of the particulars and confine myself to generalities  no fact is more firmly established than that lying is a necessity of our circumstancesthe deduction that it is then a virtue goes without saying no virtue can reach its highest usefulness without careful and diligent cultivationtherefore it goes without saying that this one ought to be taught in the public schoolseven in the newspapers what chance has the ignorant uncultivated liar against the educated expert what chance have i against mr peragainst a lawyer judicious lying is what the world needs i sometimes think it were even better and safer not to lie at all than to lie injudiciously an awkward unscientific lie is often as ineffectual as the truth  now let us see what the philosophers say note that venerable proverb children and fools always speak the truth the deduction is plain adults and wise persons never speak it parkman the historian says the principle of truth may itself be carried into an absurdity in another place in the same chapters he says the saying is old that truth should not be spoken at all times and those whom a sick conscience worries into habitual violation of the maxim are imbeciles and nuisances it is strong language but true none of us could live with an habitual truthteller but thank goodness none of us has to an habitual truthteller is simply an impossible creature he does not exist he never has existed of course there are people who think they never lie but it is not soand this ignorance is one of the very things that shame our socalled civilization everybody liesevery day every hour awake asleep in his dreams in his joy in his mourning if he keeps his tongue still his hands his feet his eyes his attitude will convey deceptionand purposely even in sermonsbut that is a platitude  in a far country where i once lived the ladies used to go around paying calls under the humane and kindly pretence of wanting to see each other and when they returned home they would cry out with a glad voice saying we made sixteen calls and found fourteen of them out not meaning that they found out anything important against the fourteenno that was only a colloquial phrase to signify that they were not at homeand their manner of saying it expressed their lively satisfaction in that fact now their pretence of wanting to see the fourteenand the other two whom they had been less lucky withwas that commonest and mildest form of lying which is sufficiently described as a deflection from the truth is it justifiable most certainly it is beautiful it is noble for its object is not to reap profit but to convey a pleasure to the sixteen the ironsouled truthmonger would plainly manifest or even utter the fact that he didnt want to see those peopleand he would be an ass and inflict totally unnecessary pain and next those ladies in that far countrybut never mind they had a thousand pleasant ways of lying that grew out of gentle impulses and were a credit to their intelligence and an honor to their hearts let the particulars go  the men in that far country were liars every one their mere howdydo was a lie because they didnt care how you did except they were undertakers to the ordinary inquirer you lied in return for you made no conscientious diagnostic of your case but answered at random and usually missed it considerably you lied to the undertaker and said your health was failinga wholly commendable lie since it cost you nothing and pleased the other man if a stranger called and interrupted you you said with your hearty tongue im glad to see you and said with your heartier soul i wish you were with the cannibals and it was dinnertime when he went you said regretfully must you go and followed it with a call again but you did no harm for you did not deceive anybody nor inflict any hurt whereas the truth would have made you both unhappy  i think that all this courteous lying is a sweet and loving art and should be cultivated the highest perfection of politeness is only a beautiful edifice built from the base to the dome of graceful and gilded forms of charitable and unselfish lying  what i bemoan is the growing prevalence of the brutal truth let us do what we can to eradicate it an injurious truth has no merit over an injurious lie neither should ever be uttered the man who speaks an injurious truth lest his soul be not saved if he do otherwise should reflect that that sort of a soul is not strictly worth saving the man who tells a lie to help a poor devil out of trouble is one of whom the angels doubtless say lo here is an heroic soul who casts his own welfare in jeopardy to succor his neighbors let us exalt this magnanimous liar  an injurious lie is an uncommendable thing and so also and in the same degree is an injurious trutha fact that is recognized by the law of libel  among other common lies we have the silent liethe deception which one conveys by simply keeping still and concealing the truth many obstinate truthmongers indulge in this dissipation imagining that if they speak no lie they lie not at all in that far country where i once lived there was a lovely spirit a lady whose impulses were always high and pure and whose character answered to them one day i was there at dinner and remarked in a general way that we are all liars she was amazed and said not all it was before pinafores time so i did not make the response which would naturally follow in our day but frankly said yes allwe are all liars there are no exceptions she looked almost offended why do you include me certainly i said i think you even rank as an expert she said shsh the children so the subject was changed in deference to the childrens presence and we went on talking about other things but as soon as the young people were out of the way the lady came warmly back to the matter and said i have made a rule of my life to never tell a lie and i have never departed from it in a single instance i said i dont mean the least harm or disrespect but really you have been lying like smoke ever since ive been sitting here it has caused me a good deal of pain because im not used to it she required of me an instancejust a single instance so i said  well here is the unfilled duplicate of the blank which the oakland hospital people sent to you by the hand of the sicknurse when she came here to nurse your little nephew through his dangerous illness this blank asks all manners of questions as to the conduct of that sicknurse did she ever sleep on her watch did she ever forget to give the medicine and so forth and so on you are warned to be very careful and explicit in your answers for the welfare of the service requires that the nurses be promptly fined or otherwise punished for derelictions you told me you were perfectly delighted with this nurse that she had a thousand perfections and only one fault you found you never could depend on her wrapping johnny up half sufficiently while he waited in a chilly chair for her to rearrange the warm bed you filled up the duplicate of this paper and sent it back to the hospital by the hand of the nurse how did you answer this questionwas the nurse at any time guilty of a negligence which was likely to result in the patients taking cold comeeverything is decided by a bet here in california ten dollars to ten cents you lied when you answered that question she said i didnt i left it blank just soyou have told a silent lie you have left it to be inferred that you had no fault to find in that matter she said oh was that a lie and how could i mention her one single fault and she is so goodit would have been cruel i said one ought always to lie when one can do good by it your impulse was right but your judgment was crude this comes of unintelligent practice now observe the results of this inexpert deflection of yours you know mr joness willie is lying very low with scarletfever well your recommendation was so enthusiastic that that girl is there nursing him and the wornout family have all been trustingly sound asleep for the last fourteen hours leaving their darling with full confidence in those fatal hands because you like young george washington have a reputahowever if you are not going to have anything to do i will come around tomorrow and well attend the funeral together for of course youll naturally feel a peculiar interest in willies caseas personal a one in fact as the undertaker  but that was not all lost before i was halfway through she was in a carriage and making thirty miles an hour toward the jones mansion to save what was left of willie and tell all she knew about the deadly nurse all of which was unnecessary as willie wasnt sick i had been lying myself but that same day all the same she sent a line to the hospital which filled up the neglected blank and stated the facts too in the squarest possible manner  now you see this ladys fault was not in lying but in lying injudiciously she should have told the truth there and made it up to the nurse with a fraudulent compliment further along in the paper she could have said in one respect this sicknurse is perfectionwhen she is on the watch she never snores almost any little pleasant lie would have taken the sting out of that troublesome but necessary expression of the truth  lying is universalwe all do it therefore the wise thing is for us diligently to train ourselves to lie thoughtfully judiciously to lie with a good object and not an evil one to lie for others advantage and not our own to lie healingly charitably humanely not cruelly hurtfully maliciously to lie gracefully and graciously not awkwardly and clumsily to lie firmly frankly squarely with head erect not haltingly tortuously with pusillanimous mien as being ashamed of our high calling then shall we be rid of the rank and pestilent truth that is rotting the land then shall we be great and good and beautiful and worthy dwellers in a world where even benign nature habitually lies except when she promises execrable weather thenbut am i but a new and feeble student in this gracious art i cannot instruct this club  joking aside i think there is much need of wise examination into what sorts of lies are best and wholesomest to be indulged seeing we must all lie and we do all lie and what sorts it may be best to avoidand this is a thing which i feel i can confidently put into the hands of this experienced cluba ripe body who may be termed in this regard and without undue flattery old masters
