time for aros  a boat had put me ashore the night before at grisapol i had such breakfast as the little inn afforded and leaving all my baggage till i had an occasion to come round for it by sea struck right across the promontory with a cheerful heart  i was far from being a native of these parts springing as i did from an unmixed lowland stock  but an uncle of mine gordon darnaway after a poor rough youth and some years at sea had married a young wife in the islands mary maclean she was called the last of her family and when she died in giving birth to a daughter aros the seagirt farm had remained in his possession  it brought him in nothing but the means of life as i was well aware but he was a man whom illfortune had pursued he feared cumbered as he was with the young child to make a fresh adventure upon life and remained in aros biting his nails at destiny years passed over his head in that isolation and brought neither help nor contentment  meantime our family was dying out in the lowlands there is little luck for any of that race and perhaps my father was the luckiest of all for not only was he one of the last to die but he left a son to his name and a little money to support it  i was a student of edinburgh university living well enough at my own charges but without kith or kin when some news of me found its way to uncle gordon on the ross of grisapol and he as he was a man who held blood thicker than water wrote to me the day he heard of my existence and taught me to count aros as my home  thus it was that i came to spend my vacations in that part of the country so far from all society and comfort between the codfish and the moorcocks and thus it was that now when i had done with my classes i was returning thither with so light a heart that july day  the ross as we call it is a promontory neither wide nor high but as rough as god made it to this day the deep sea on either hand of it full of rugged isles and reefs most perilous to seamenall overlooked from the eastward by some very high cliffs and the great peals of ben kyaw the mountain of the mist they say the words signify in the gaelic tongue and it is well named  for that hilltop which is more than three thousand feet in height catches all the clouds that come blowing from the seaward and indeed i used often to think that it must make them for itself since when all heaven was clear to the sea level there would ever be a streamer on ben kyaw  it brought water too and was mossy 5 to the top in consequence  i have seen us sitting in broad sunshine on the ross and the rain falling black like crape upon the mountain  but the wetness of it made it often appear more beautiful to my eyes for when the sun struck upon the hill sides there were many wet rocks and watercourses that shone like jewels even as far as aros fifteen miles away  the road that i followed was a cattletrack  it twisted so as nearly to double the length of my journey it went over rough boulders so that a man had to leap from one to another and through soft bottoms where the moss came nearly to the knee  there was no cultivation anywhere and not one house in the ten miles from grisapol to aros  houses of course there werethree at least but they lay so far on the one side or the other that no stranger could have found them from the track  a large part of the ross is covered with big granite rocks some of them larger than a tworoomed house one beside another with fern and deep heather in between them where the vipers breed  anyway the wind was it was always sea air as salt as on a ship the gulls were as free as moorfowl over all the ross and whenever the way rose a little your eye would kindle with the brightness of the sea  from the very midst of the land on a day of wind and a high spring i have heard the roost roaring like a battle where it runs by aros and the great and fearful voices of the breakers that we call the merry men  aros itselfaros jay i have heard the natives call it and they say it means the house of godaros itself was not properly a piece of the ross nor was it quite an islet  it formed the southwest corner of the land fitted close to it and was in one place only separated from the coast by a little gut of the sea not forty feet across the narrowest when the tide was full this was clear and still like a pool on a land river only there was a difference in the weeds and fishes and the water itself was green instead of brown but when the tide went out in the bottom of the ebb there was a day or two in every month when you could pass dryshod from aros to the mainland  there was some good pasture where my uncle fed the sheep he lived on perhaps the feed was better because the ground rose higher on the islet than the main level of the ross but this i am not skilled enough to settle  the house was a good one for that country two storeys high  it looked westward over a bay with a pier hard by for a boat and from the door you could watch the vapours blowing on ben kyaw  on all this part of the coast and especially near aros these great granite rocks that i have spoken of go down together in troops into the sea like cattle on a summers day  there they stand for all the world like their neighbours ashore only the salt water sobbing between them instead of the quiet earth and clots of seapink blooming on their sides instead of heather and the great sea conger to wreathe about the base of them instead of the poisonous viper of the land  on calm days you can go wandering between them in a boat for hours echoes following you about the labyrinth but when the sea is up heaven help the man that hears that cauldron boiling  off the southwest end of aros these blocks are very many and much greater in size  indeed they must grow monstrously bigger out to sea for there must be ten sea miles of open water sown with them as thick as a country place with houses some standing thirty feet above the tides some covered but all perilous to ships so that on a clear westerly blowing day i have counted from the top of aros the great rollers breaking white and heavy over as many as sixandforty buried reefs  but it is nearer in shore that the danger is worst for the tide here running like a mill race makes a long belt of broken watera roost we call itat the tail of the land  i have often been out there in a dead calm at the slack of the tide and a strange place it is with the sea swirling and combing up and boiling like the cauldrons of a linn and now and again a little dancing mutter of sound as though the roost were talking to itself  but when the tide begins to run again and above all in heavy weather there is no man could take a boat within half a mile of it nor a ship afloat that could either steer or live in such a place you can hear the roaring of it six miles away  at the seaward end there comes the strongest of the bubble and its here that these big breakers dance togetherthe dance of death it may be calledthat have got the name in these parts of the merry men  i have heard it said that they run fifty feet high but that must be the green water only for the spray runs twice as high as that  whether they got the name from their movements which are swift and antic or from the shouting they make about the turn of the tide so that all aros shakes with it is more than i can tell  the truth is that in a southwesterly wind that part of our archipelago is no better than a trap  if a ship got through the reefs and weathered the merry men it would be to come ashore on the south coast of aros in sandag bay where so many dismal things befell our family as i propose to tell  the thought of all these dangers in the place i knew so long makes me particularly welcome the works now going forward to set lights upon the headlands and buoys along the channels of our ironbound inhospitable islands  the country people had many a story about aros as i used to hear from my uncles man rorie an old servant of the macleans who had transferred his services without afterthought on the occasion of the marriage  there was some tale of an unlucky creature a seakelpie that dwelt and did business in some fearful manner of his own among the boiling breakers of the roost  a mermaid had once met a piper on sandag beach and there sang to him a long bright midsummers night so that in the morning he was found stricken crazy and from thenceforward till the day he died said only one form of words what they were in the original gaelic i cannot tell but they were thus translated ah the sweet singing out of the sea  seals that haunted on that coast have been known to speak to man in his own tongue presaging great disasters  it was here that a certain saint first landed on his voyage out of ireland to convert the hebrideans  and indeed i think he had some claim to be called saint for with the boats of that past age to make so rough a passage and land on such a ticklish coast was surely not far short of the miraculous  it was to him or to some of his monkish underlings who had a cell there that the islet owes its holy and beautiful name the house of god  among these old wives stories there was one which i was inclined to hear with more credulity  as i was told in that tempest which scattered the ships of the invincible armada over all the north and west of scotland one great vessel came ashore on aros and before the eyes of some solitary people on a hilltop went down in a moment with all hands her colours flying even as she sank  there was some likelihood in this tale for another of that fleet lay sunk on the north side twenty miles from grisapol  it was told i thought with more detail and gravity than its companion stories and there was one particularity which went far to convince me of its truth the name that is of the ship was still remembered and sounded in my ears spanishly  the espirito santo they called it a great ship of many decks of guns laden with treasure and grandees of spain and fierce soldadoes that now lay fathom deep to all eternity done with her wars and voyages in sandag bay upon the west of aros  no more salvos of ordnance for that tall ship the holy spirit no more fair winds or happy ventures only to rot there deep in the seatangle and hear the shoutings of the merry men as the tide ran high about the island  it was a strange thought to me first and last and only grew stranger as i learned the more of spain from which she had set sail with so proud a company and king philip the wealthy king that sent her on that voyage  and now i must tell you as i walked from grisapol that day the espirito santo was very much in my reflections  i had been favourably remarked by our then principal in edinburgh college that famous writer dr robertson and by him had been set to work on some papers of an ancient date to rearrange and sift of what was worthless and in one of these to my great wonder i found a note of this very ship the espirito santo with her captains name and how she carried a great part of the spaniards treasure and had been lost upon the ross of grisapol but in what particular spot the wild tribes of that place and period would give no information to the kings inquiries  putting one thing with another and taking our island tradition together with this note of old king jamies perquisitions after wealth it had come strongly on my mind that the spot for which he sought in vain could be no other than the small bay of sandag on my uncles land and being a fellow of a mechanical turn i had ever since been plotting how to weigh that good ship up again with all her ingots ounces and doubloons and bring back our house of darnaway to its longforgotten dignity and wealth  this was a design of which i soon had reason to repent  my mind was sharply turned on different reflections and since i became the witness of a strange judgment of gods the thought of dead mens treasures has been intolerable to my conscience  but even at that time i must acquit myself of sordid greed for if i desired riches it was not for their own sake but for the sake of a person who was dear to my heartmy uncles daughter mary ellen  she had been educated well and had been a time to school upon the mainland which poor girl she would have been happier without  for aros was no place for her with old rorie the servant and her father who was one of the unhappiest men in scotland plainly bred up in a country place among cameronians long a skipper sailing out of the clyde about the islands and now with infinite discontent managing his sheep and a little long shore fishing for the necessary bread  if it was sometimes weariful to me who was there but a month or two you may fancy what it was to her who dwelt in that same desert all the year round with the sheep and flying seagulls and the merry men singing and dancing in the roost    chapter ii  what the wreck had brought to aros   it was halfflood when i got the length of aros and there was nothing for it but to stand on the far shore and whistle for rorie with the boat i had no need to repeat the signal  at the first sound mary was at the door flying a handkerchief by way of answer and the old longlegged servingman was shambling down the gravel to the pier  for all his hurry it took him a long while to pull across the bay and i observed him several times to pause go into the stern and look over curiously into the wake  as he came nearer he seemed to me aged and haggard and i thought he avoided my eye  the coble had been repaired with two new thwarts and several patches of some rare and beautiful foreign wood the name of it unknown to me  why rorie said i as we began the return voyage this is fine wood how came you by that  it will be hard to cheesel rorie opined reluctantly and just then dropping the oars he made another of those dives into the stern which i had remarked as he came across to fetch me and leaning his hand on my shoulder stared with an awful look into the waters of the bay  what is wrong i asked a good deal startled  it will be a great feesh said the old man returning to his oars and nothing more could i get out of him but strange glances and an ominous nodding of the head  in spite of myself i was infected with a measure of uneasiness i turned also and studied the wake  the water was still and transparent but out here in the middle of the bay exceeding deep for some time i could see naught but at last it did seem to me as if something darka great fish or perhaps only a shadowfollowed studiously in the track of the moving coble  and then i remembered one of rories superstitions how in a ferry in morven in some great exterminating feud among the clans a fish the like of it unknown in all our waters followed for some years the passage of the ferryboat until no man dared to make the crossing  he will be waiting for the right man said rorie  mary met me on the beach and led me up the brae and into the house of aros  outside and inside there were many changes  the garden was fenced with the same wood that i had noted in the boat there were chairs in the kitchen covered with strange brocade curtains of brocade hung from the window a clock stood silent on the dresser a lamp of brass was swinging from the roof the table was set for dinner with the finest of linen and silver and all these new riches were displayed in the plain old kitchen that i knew so well with the highbacked settle and the stools and the closet bed for rorie with the wide chimney the sun shone into and the clearsmouldering peats with the pipes on the mantelshelf and the three cornered spittoons filled with seashells instead of sand on the floor with the bare stone walls and the bare wooden floor and the three patchwork rugs that were of yore its sole adornmentpoor mans patchwork the like of it unknown in cities woven with homespun and sunday black and seacloth polished on the bench of rowing  the room like the house had been a sort of wonder in that countryside it was so neat and habitable and to see it now shamed by these incongruous additions filled me with indignation and a kind of anger  in view of the errand i had come upon to aros the feeling was baseless and unjust but it burned high at the first moment in my heart  mary girl said i this is the place i had learned to call my home and i do not know it  it is my home by nature not by the learning she replied the place i was born and the place im like to die in and i neither like these changes nor the way they came nor that which came with them  i would have liked better under gods pleasure they had gone down into the sea and the merry men were dancing on them now  mary was always serious it was perhaps the only trait that she shared with her father but the tone with which she uttered these words was even graver than of custom  ay said i i feared it came by wreck and thats by death yet when my father died i took his goods without remorse  your father died a clean strae death as the folk say said mary  true i returned and a wreck is like a judgment  what was she called  they cad her the christanna said a voice behind me and turning round i saw my uncle standing in the doorway  he was a sour small bilious man with a long face and very dark eyes fiftysix years old sound and active in body and with an air somewhat between that of a shepherd and that of a man following the sea  he never laughed that i heard read long at the bible prayed much like the cameronians he had been brought up among and indeed in many ways used to remind me of one of the hillpreachers in the killing times before the revolution  but he never got much comfort nor even as i used to think much guidance by his piety  he had his black fits when he was afraid of hell but he had led a rough life to which he would look back with envy and was still a rough cold gloomy man  as he came in at the door out of the sunlight with his bonnet on his head and a pipe hanging in his buttonhole he seemed like rorie to have grown older and paler the lines were deeplier ploughed upon his face and the whites of his eyes were yellow like old stained ivory or the bones of the dead  ay he repeated dwelling upon the first part of the word the christ anna  its an awfu name  i made him my salutations and complimented him upon his look of health for i feared he had perhaps been ill  im in the body he replied ungraciously enough aye in the body and the sins of the body like yoursel  denner he said abruptly to mary and then ran on to me theyre grand braws thir that we hae gotten are they no  yons a bonny knock 15 but itll no gang and the naperys by ordnar  bonny bairnly braws its for the like o them folk sells the peace of god that passeth understanding its for the like o them an maybe no even sae muckle worth folk daunton god to his face and burn in muckle hell and its for that reason the scripture cas them as i read the passage the accursed thing  mary ye girzie he interrupted himself to cry with some asperity what for hae ye no put out the twa candlesticks  why should we need them at high noon she asked  but my uncle was not to be turned from his idea  well bruik 16 them while we may he said and so two massive candlesticks of wrought silver were added to the table equipage already so unsuited to that rough sea side farm  she cam ashore februar 10 about ten at nicht he went on to me there was nae wind and a sair run o sea and she was in the sook o the roost as i jaloose  we had seen her a day rorie and me beating to the wind  she wasnae a handy craft im thinking that christanna for she would neither steer nor stey wi them  a sair day they had of it their hands was never aff the sheets and it perishin cauldower cauld to snaw and aye they would get a bit nip o wind and awa again to pit the empy hope into them  eh man but they had a sair day for the last ot  he would have had a prood prood heart that won ashore upon the back o that  and were all lost i cried  god held them  wheesht he said sternly  nane shall pray for the deid on my hearth stane  i disclaimed a popish sense for my ejaculation and he seemed to accept my disclaimer with unusual facility and ran on once more upon what had evidently become a favourite subject  we fand her in sandag bay rorie an me and a thae braws in the inside of her  theres a kittle bit ye see about sandag whiles the sook rins strong for the merry men an whiles again when the tides makin hard an ye can hear the roost blawin at the farend of aros there comes a backspang of current straucht into sandag bay  weel theres the thing that got the grip on the christanna  she but to have come in ramstam an stern forrit for the bows of her are aften under and the backside of her is clear at hiewater o neaps  but man the dunt that she cam doon wi when she struck  lord save us a but its an unco life to be a sailora cauld wanchancy life  monys the gliff i got mysel in the great deep and why the lord should hae made yon unco water is mair than ever i could win to understand  he made the vales and the pastures the bonny green yaird the halesome canty land     and now they shout and sing to thee    for thou hast made them glad  as the psalms say in the metrical version  no that i would preen my faith to that clink neither but its bonny and easier to mind  who go to sea in ships they haet again              and in       great waters trading be    within the deep these men gods works       and his great wonders see  weel its easy sayin sae  maybe dauvit wasnae very weel acquant wi the sea  but troth if it wasnae prentit in the bible i wad whiles be tempit to think it wasnae the lord but the muckle black deil that made the sea  theres naething good comes oot ot but the fish an the spentacle o god riding on the tempest to be shure whilk would be what dauvit was likely ettling at  but man they were sair wonders that god showed to the christannawonders do i ca them  judgments rather judgments in the mirk nicht among the draygons o the deep  and their soulsto think o thattheir souls man maybe no prepared  the seaa muckle yett to hell  i observed as my uncle spoke that his voice was unnaturally moved and his manner unwontedly demonstrative  he leaned forward at these last words for example and touched me on the knee with his spread fingers looking up into my face with a certain pallor and i could see that his eyes shone with a deepseated fire and that the lines about his mouth were drawn and tremulous  even the entrance of rorie and the beginning of our meal did not detach him from his train of thought beyond a moment  he condescended indeed to ask me some questions as to my success at college but i thought it was with half his mind and even in his extempore grace which was as usual long and wandering i could find the trace of his preoccupation praying as he did that god would remember in mercy fower puir feckless fiddling sinful creatures here by their leelane beside the great and dowie waters  soon there came an interchange of speeches between him and rorie  was it there asked my uncle  ou ay said rorie  i observed that they both spoke in a manner of aside and with some show of embarrassment and that mary herself appeared to colour and looked down on her plate  partly to show my knowledge and so relieve the party from an awkward strain partly because i was curious i pursued the subject  you mean the fish i asked  whatten fish cried my uncle  fish quo he  fish  your een are fu o fatness man your heid dozened wi carnal leir  fish its a bogle  he spoke with great vehemence as though angry and perhaps i was not very willing to be put down so shortly for young men are disputatious at least i remember i retorted hotly crying out upon childish superstitions  and ye come frae the college sneered uncle gordon  gude kens what they learn folk there its no muckle service onyway  do ye think man that theres naething in a yon saut wilderness o a world oot wast there wi the sea grasses growin an the sea beasts fechtin an the sun glintin down into it day by day  na the seas like the land but fearsomer  if theres folk ashore theres folk in the seadeid they may be but theyre folk whatever and as for deils theres nane thats like the sea deils  theres no sae muckle harm in the land deils when as said and done  lang syne when i was a callant in the south country i mind there was an auld bald bogle in the peewie moss  i got a glisk o him mysel sittin on his hunkers in a hag as grays a tombstane an troth he was a fearsomelike taed  but he steered naebody  nae doobt if ane that was a reprobate ane the lord hated had gane by there wi his sin still upon his stamach nae doobt the creature would hae lowped upo the likes o him  but theres deils in the deep sea would yoke on a communicant  eh sirs if ye had gane doon wi the puir lads in the christanna ye would ken by now the mercy o the seas  if ye had sailed it for as lang as me ye would hate the thocht of it as i do if ye had but used the een god gave ye ye would hae learned the wickedness o that fause saut cauld bullering creature and of a thats in it by the lords permission labsters an partans an sic like howking in the deid muckle gutsy blawing whales an fishthe hale clan o themcauldwamed blindeed uncanny ferlies  o sirs he cried the horrorthe horror o the sea  we were all somewhat staggered by this outburst and the speaker himself after that last hoarse apostrophe appeared to sink gloomily into his own thoughts  but rorie who was greedy of superstitious lore recalled him to the subject by a question  you will not ever have seen a teevil of the sea he asked  no clearly replied the other  i misdoobt if a mere man could see ane clearly and conteenue in the body  i hae sailed wi a ladthey cad him sandy gabart he saw ane shure eneueh an shure eneueh it was the end of him  we were seeven days oot frae the clydea sair wark we had hadgaun north wi seeds an braws an things for the macleod  we had got in ower near under the cutchullns an had just gane about by soa an were off on a lang

i luffed for my life for i thocht we were ower near soa but na it wasnae that it was puir sandy gabarts deid skreigh or near hand for he was deid in half an hour  at he could tell was that a sea deil

uskevagh an the cocks were crawin in benbecula  it will have been a merman rorie said  a merman screamed my uncle with immeasurable scorn  auld wives clavers  theres nae sic things as mermen  but what was the creature like i asked  what like was it  gude forbid that we suld ken what like it was  it had a kind of a heid upon itman could say nae mair  then rorie smarting under the affront told several tales of mermen mermaids and seahorses that had come ashore upon the islands and attacked the crews of boats upon the sea and my uncle in spite of his incredulity listened with uneasy interest  aweel aweel he said it may be sae i may be wrang but i find nae word o mermen in the scriptures  and you will find nae word of aros roost maybe objected rorie and his argument appeared to carry weight  when dinner was over my uncle carried me forth with him to a bank behind the house  it was a very hot and quiet afternoon scarce a ripple anywhere upon the sea nor any voice but the familiar voice of sheep and gulls and perhaps in consequence of this repose in nature my kinsman showed himself more rational and tranquil than before  he spoke evenly and almost cheerfully of my career with every now and then a reference to the lost ship or the treasures it had brought to aros  for my part i listened to him in a sort of trance gazing with all my heart on that remembered scene and drinking gladly the seaair and the smoke of peats that had been lit by mary  perhaps an hour had passed when my uncle who had all the while been covertly gazing on the surface of the little bay rose to his feet and bade me follow his example  now i should say that the great run of tide at the southwest end of aros exercises a perturbing influence round all the coast  in sandag bay to the south a strong current runs at certain periods of the flood and ebb respectively but in this northern bayaros bay as it is calledwhere the house stands and on which my uncle was now gazing the only sign of disturbance is towards the end of the ebb and even then it is too slight to be remarkable  when there is any swell nothing can be seen at all but when it is calm as it often is there appear certain strange undecipherable markssearunes as we may name themon the glassy surface of the bay  the like is common in a thousand places on the coast and many a boy must have amused himself as i did seeking to read in them some reference to himself or those he loved  it was to these marks that my uncle now directed my attention struggling as he did so with an evident reluctance  do ye see yon scart upo the water he inquired yon ane wast the gray stane  ay  weel itll no be like a letter wull it  certainly it is i replied  i have often remarked it  it is like a c  he heaved a sigh as if heavily disappointed with my answer and then added below his breath ay for the christanna  i used to suppose sir it was for myself said i for my name is charles  and so ye sawt afore he ran on not heeding my remark  weel weel but thats unco strange  maybe its been there waitin as a man wad say through a the weary ages  man but thats awfu  and then breaking off yell no see anither will ye he asked  yes said i  i see another very plainly near the ross side where the road comes downan m  an m he repeated very low and then again after another pause an what wad ye make o that he inquired  i had always thought it to mean mary sir i answered growing somewhat red convinced as i was in my own mind that i was on the threshold of a decisive explanation  but we were each following his own train of thought to the exclusion of the others  my uncle once more paid no attention to my words only hung his head and held his peace and i might have been led to fancy that he had not heard me if his next speech had not contained a kind of echo from my own  i would say naething o thae clavers to mary he observed and began to walk forward  there is a belt of turf along the side of aros bay where walking is easy and it was along this that i silently followed my silent kinsman  i was perhaps a little disappointed at having lost so good an opportunity to declare my love but i was at the same time far more deeply exercised at the change that had befallen my uncle  he was never an ordinary never in the strict sense an amiable man but there was nothing in even the worst that i had known of him before to prepare me for so strange a transformation  it was impossible to close the eyes against one fact that he had as the saying goes something on his mind and as i mentally ran over the different words which might be represented by the letter mmisery mercy marriage money and the likei was arrested with a sort of start by the word murder  i was still considering the ugly sound and fatal meaning of the word when the direction of our walk brought us to a point from which a view was to be had to either side back towards aros bay and homestead and forward on the ocean dotted to the north with isles and lying to the southward blue and open to the sky  there my guide came to a halt and stood staring for awhile on that expanse  then he turned to me and laid a hand on my arm  ye think theres naething there he said pointing with his pipe and then cried out aloud with a kind of exultation ill tell ye man  the deid are down therethick like rattons  he turned at once and without another word we retraced our steps to the house of aros  i was eager to be alone with mary yet it was not till after supper and then but for a short while that i could have a word with her  i lost no time beating about the bush but spoke out plainly what was on my mind  mary i said i have not come to aros without a hope  if that should prove well founded we may all leave and go somewhere else secure of daily bread and comfort secure perhaps of something far beyond that which it would seem extravagant in me to promise  but theres a hope that lies nearer to my heart than money  and at that i paused  you can guess fine what that is mary i said  she looked away from me in silence and that was small encouragement but i was not to be put off all my days i have thought the world of you i continued the time goes on and i think always the more of you i could not think to be happy or hearty in my life without you you are the apple of my eye  still she looked away and said never a word but i thought i saw that her hands shook  mary i cried in fear do ye no like me  o charlie man she said is this a time to speak of it  let me be a while let me be the way i am itll not be you that loses by the waiting  i made out by her voice that she was nearly weeping and this put me out of any thought but to compose her  mary ellen i said say no more i did not come to trouble you your way shall be mine and your time too and you have told me all i wanted  only just this one thing more what ails you  she owned it was her father but would enter into no particulars only shook her head and said he was not well and not like himself and it was a great pity  she knew nothing of the wreck  i havenae been near it said she  what for would i go near it charlie lad  the poor souls are gone to their account long syne and i would just have wished they had taen their gear with thempoor souls  this was scarcely any great encouragement for me to tell her of the espirito santo yet i did so and at the very first word she cried out in surprise  there was a man at grisapol she said in the month of maya little yellow blackavised body they tell me with gold rings upon his fingers and a beard and he was speiring high and low for that same ship  it was towards the end of april that i had been given these papers to sort out by dr robertson and it came suddenly back upon my mind that they were thus prepared for a spanish historian or a man calling himself such who had come with high recommendations to the principal on a mission of inquiry as to the dispersion of the great armada  putting one thing with another i fancied that the visitor with the gold rings upon his fingers might be the same with dr robertsons historian from madrid  if that were so he would be more likely after treasure for himself than information for a learned society  i made up my mind i should lose no time over my undertaking and if the ship lay sunk in sandag bay as perhaps both he and i supposed it should not be for the advantage of this ringed adventurer but for mary and myself and for the good old honest kindly family of the darnaways    chapter iii  land and sea in sandag bay   i was early afoot next morning and as soon as i had a bite to eat set forth upon a tour of exploration  something in my heart distinctly told me that i should find the ship of the armada and although i did not give way entirely to such hopeful thoughts i was still very light in spirits and walked upon air  aros is a very rough islet its surface strewn with great rocks and shaggy with fernland heather and my way lay almost north and south across the highest knoll and though the whole distance was inside of two miles it took more time and exertion than four upon a level road  upon the summit i paused  although not very highnot three hundred feet as i thinkit yet outtops all the neighbouring lowlands of the ross and commands a great view of sea and islands  the sun which had been up some time was already hot upon my neck the air was listless and thundery although purely clear away over the northwest where the isles lie thickliest congregated some halfadozen small and ragged clouds hung together in a covey and the head of ben kyaw wore not merely a few streamers but a solid hood of vapour  there was a threat in the weather  the sea it is true was smooth like glass even the roost was but a seam on that wide mirror and the merry men no more than caps of foam but to my eye and ear so long familiar with these places the sea also seemed to lie uneasily a sound of it like a long sigh mounted to me where i stood and quiet as it was the roost itself appeared to be revolving mischief  for i ought to say that all we dwellers in these parts attributed if not prescience at least a quality of warning to that strange and dangerous creature of the tides  i hurried on then with the greater speed and had soon descended the slope of aros to the part that we call sandag bay  it is a pretty large piece of water compared with the size of the isle well sheltered from all but the prevailing wind sandy and shoal and bounded by low sandhills to the west but to the eastward lying several fathoms deep along a ledge of rocks  it is upon that side that at a certain time each flood the current mentioned by my uncle sets so strong into the bay a little later when the roost begins to work higher an undertow runs still more strongly in the reverse direction and it is the action of this last as i suppose that has scoured that part so deep  nothing is to be seen out of sandag bay but one small segment of the horizon and in heavy weather the breakers flying high over a deep sea reef  from halfway down the hill i had perceived the wreck of february last a brig of considerable tonnage lying with her back broken high and dry on the east corner of the sands and i was making directly towards it and already almost on the margin of the turf when my eyes were suddenly arrested by a spot cleared of fern and heather and marked by one of those long low and almost humanlooking mounds that we see so commonly in graveyards  i stopped like a man shot  nothing had been said to me of any dead man or interment on the island rorie mary and my uncle had all equally held their peace of her at least i was certain that she must be ignorant and yet here before my eyes was proof indubitable of the fact  here was a grave and i had to ask myself with a chill what manner of man lay there in his last sleep awaiting the signal of the lord in that solitary seabeat restingplace  my mind supplied no answer but what i feared to entertain  shipwrecked at least he must have been perhaps like the old armada mariners from some far and rich land oversea or perhaps one of my own race perishing within eyesight of the smoke of home  i stood awhile uncovered by his side and i could have desired that it had lain in our religion to put up some prayer for that unhappy stranger or in the old classic way outwardly to honour his misfortune  i knew although his bones lay there a part of aros till the trumpet sounded his imperishable soul was forth and far away among the raptures of the everlasting sabbath or the pangs of hell and yet my mind misgave me even with a fear that perhaps he was near me where i stood guarding his sepulchre and lingering on the scene of his unhappy fate  certainly it was with a spirit somewhat overshadowed that i turned away from the grave to the hardly less melancholy spectacle of the wreck  her stem was above the first arc of the flood she was broken in two a little abaft the foremastthough indeed she had none both masts having broken short in her disaster and as the pitch of the beach was very sharp and sudden and the bows lay many feet below the stern the fracture gaped widely open and you could see right through her poor hull upon the farther side  her name was much defaced and i could not make out clearly whether she was called christiania after the norwegian city or christiana after the good woman christians wife in that old book the pilgrims progress  by her build she was a foreign ship but i was not certain of her nationality  she had been painted green but the colour was faded and weathered and the paint peeling off in strips  the wreck of the mainmast lay alongside half buried in sand  she was a forlorn sight indeed and i could not look without emotion at the bits of rope that still hung about her so often handled of yore by shouting seamen or the little scuttle where they had passed up and down to their affairs or that poor noseless angel of a figurehead that had dipped into so many running billows  i do not know whether it came most from the ship or from the grave but i fell into some melancholy scruples as i stood there leaning with one hand against the battered timbers  the homelessness of men and even of inanimate vessels cast away upon strange shores came strongly in upon my mind  to make a profit of such pitiful misadventures seemed an unmanly and a sordid act and i began to think of my then quest as of something sacrilegious in its nature  but when i remembered mary i took heart again  my uncle would never consent to an imprudent marriage nor would she as i was persuaded wed without his full approval  it behoved me then to be up and doing for my wife and i thought with a laugh how long it was since that great seacastle the espirito santo had left her bones in sandag bay and how weak it would be to consider rights so long extinguished and misfortunes so long forgotten in the process of time  i had my theory of where to seek for her remains  the set of the current and the soundings both pointed to the east side of the bay under the ledge of rocks  if she had been lost in sandag bay and if after these centuries any portion of her held together it was there that i should find it  the water deepens as i have said with great rapidity and even close alongside the rocks several fathoms may be found  as i walked upon the edge i could see far and wide over the sandy bottom of the bay the sun shone clear and green and steady in the deeps the bay seemed rather like a great transparent crystal as one sees them in a lapidarys shop there was naught to show that it was water but an internal trembling a hovering within of sunglints and netted shadows and now and then a faint lap and a dying bubble round the edge  the shadows of the rocks lay out for some distance at their feet so that my own shadow moving pausing and stooping on the top of that reached sometimes half across the bay  it was above all in this belt of shadows that i hunted for the espirito santo since it was there the undertow ran strongest whether in or out  cool as the whole water seemed this broiling day it looked in that part yet cooler and had a mysterious invitation for the eyes  peer as i pleased however i could see nothing but a few fishes or a bush of seatangle and here and there a lump of rock that had fallen from above and now lay separate on the sandy floor twice did i pass from one end to the other of the rocks and in the whole distance i could see nothing of the wreck nor any place but one where it was possible for it to be  this was a large terrace in five fathoms of water raised off the surface of the sand to a considerable height and looking from above like a mere outgrowth of the rocks on which i walked it was one mass of great seatangles like a grove which prevented me judging of its nature but in shape and size it bore some likeness to a vessels hull  at least it was my best chance  if the espirito santo lay not there under the tangles it lay nowhere at all in sandag bay and i prepared to put the question to the proof once and for all and either go back to aros a rich man or cured for ever of my dreams of wealth  i stripped to the skin and stood on the extreme margin with my hands clasped irresolute  the bay at that time was utterly quiet there was no sound but from a school of porpoises somewhere out of sight behind the point yet a certain fear withheld me on the threshold of my venture  sad seafeelings scraps of my uncles superstitions thoughts of the dead of the grave of the old broken ships drifted through my mind  but the strong sun upon my shoulders warmed me to the heart and i stooped forward and plunged into the sea  it was all that i could do to catch a trail of the seatangle that grew so thickly on the terrace but once so far anchored i secured myself by grasping a whole armful of these thick and slimy stalks and planting my feet against the edge i looked around me  on all sides the clear sand stretched forth unbroken it came to the foot of the rocks scoured into the likeness of an alley in a garden by the action of the tides and before me for as far as i could see nothing was visible but the same manyfolded sand upon the sunbright bottom of the bay  yet the terrace to which i was then holding was as thick with strong seagrowths as a tuft of heather and the cliff from which it bulged hung draped below the waterline with brown lianas  in this complexity of forms all swaying together in the current things were hard to be distinguished and i was still uncertain whether my feet were pressed upon the natural rock or upon the timbers of the armada treasureship when the whole tuft of tangle came away in my hand and in an instant i was on the surface and the shores of the bay and the bright water swam before my eyes in a glory of crimson  i clambered back upon the rocks and threw the plant of tangle at my feet  something at the same moment rang sharply like a falling coin  i stooped and there sure enough crusted with the red rust there lay an iron shoebuckle  the sight of this poor human relic thrilled me to the heart but not with hope nor fear only with a desolate melancholy  i held it in my hand and the thought of its owner appeared before me like the presence of an actual man  his weatherbeaten face his sailors hands his seavoice hoarse with singing at the capstan the very foot that had once worn that buckle and trod so much along the swerving decksthe whole human fact of him as a creature like myself with hair and blood and seeing eyes haunted me in that sunny solitary place not like a spectre but like some friend whom i had basely injured  was the great treasure ship indeed below there with her guns and chain and treasure as she had sailed from spain her decks a garden for the seaweed her cabin a breeding place for fish soundless but for the dredging water motionless but for the waving of the tangle upon her battlementsthat old populous seariding castle now a reef in sandag bay  or as i thought it likelier was this a waif from the disaster of the foreign brigwas this shoebuckle bought but the other day and worn by a man of my own period in the worlds history hearing the same news from day to day thinking the same thoughts praying perhaps in the same temple with myself  however it was i was assailed with dreary thoughts my uncles words the dead are down there echoed in my ears and though i determined to dive once more it was with a strong repugnance that i stepped forward to the margin of the rocks  a great change passed at that moment over the appearance of the bay  it was no more that clear visible interior like a house roofed with glass where the green submarine sunshine slept so stilly  a breeze i suppose had flawed the surface and a sort of trouble and blackness filled its bosom where flashes of light and clouds of shadow tossed confusedly together  even the terrace below obscurely rocked and quivered  it seemed a graver thing to venture on this place of ambushes and when i leaped into the sea the second time it was with a quaking in my soul  i secured myself as at first and groped among the waving tangle  all that met my touch was cold and soft and gluey  the thicket was alive with crabs and lobsters trundling to and fro lopsidedly and i had to harden my heart against the horror of their carrion neighbourhood  on all sides i could feel the grain and the clefts of hard living stone no planks no iron not a sign of any wreck the espirito santo was not there  i remember i had almost a sense of relief in my disappointment and i was about ready to leave go when something happened that sent me to the surface with my heart in my mouth  i had already stayed somewhat late over my explorations the current was freshening with the change of the tide and sandag bay was no longer a safe place for a single swimmer well just at the last moment there came a sudden flush of current dredging through the tangles like a wave  i lost one hold was flung sprawling on my side and instinctively grasping for a fresh support my fingers closed on something hard and cold  i think i knew at that moment what it was  at least i instantly left hold of the tangle leaped for the surface and clambered out next moment on the friendly rocks with the bone of a mans leg in my grasp  mankind is a material creature slow to think and dull to perceive connections  the grave the wreck of the brig and the rusty shoebuckle were surely plain advertisements  a child might have read their dismal story and yet it was not until i touched that actual piece of mankind that the full horror of the charnel ocean burst upon my spirit  i laid the bone beside the buckle picked up my clothes and ran as i was along the rocks towards the human shore  i could not be far enough from the spot no fortune was vast enough to tempt me back again  the bones of the drowned dead should henceforth roll undisturbed by me whether on tangle or minted gold  but as soon as i trod the good earth again and had covered my nakedness against the sun i knelt down over against the ruins of the brig and out of the fulness of my heart prayed long and passionately for all poor souls upon the sea  a generous prayer is never presented in vain the petition may be refused but the petitioner is always i believe rewarded by some gracious visitation  the horror at least was lifted from my mind i could look with calm of spirit on that great bright creature gods ocean and as i set off homeward up the rough sides of aros nothing remained of my concern beyond a deep determination to meddle no more with the spoils of wrecked vessels or the treasures of the dead  i was already some way up the hill before i paused to breathe and look behind me  the sight that met my eyes was doubly strange  for first the storm that i had foreseen was now advancing with almost tropical rapidity  the whole surface of the sea had been dulled from its conspicuous brightness to an ugly hue of corrugated lead already in the distance the white waves the skippers daughters had begun to flee before a breeze that was still insensible on aros and already along the curve of sandag bay there was a splashing run of sea that i could hear from where i stood  the change upon the sky was even more remarkable there had begun to arise out of the southwest a huge and solid continent of scowling cloud here and there through rents in its contexture the sun still poured a sheaf of spreading rays and here and there from all its edges vast inky streamers lay forth along the yet unclouded sky  the menace was express and imminent  even as i gazed the sun was blotted out  at any moment the tempest might fall upon aros in its might  the suddenness of this change of weather so fixed my eyes on heaven that it was some seconds before they alighted on the bay mapped out below my feet and robbed a moment later of the sun  the knoll which i had just surmounted overflanked a little amphitheatre of lower hillocks sloping towards the sea and beyond that the yellow arc of beach and the whole extent of sandag bay  it was a scene on which i had often looked down but where i had never before beheld a human figure  i had but just turned my back upon it and left it empty and my wonder may be fancied when i saw a boat and several men in that deserted spot  the boat was lying by the rocks  a pair of fellows bareheaded with their sleeves rolled up and one with a boathook kept her with difficulty to her moorings for the current was growing brisker every moment  a little way off upon the ledge two men in black clothes whom i judged to be superior in rank laid their heads together over some task which at first i did not understand but a second after i had made it outthey were taking bearings with the compass and just then i saw one of them unroll a sheet of paper and lay his finger down as though identifying features in a map  meanwhile a third was walking to and fro polling among the rocks and peering over the edge into the water  while i was still watching them with the stupefaction of surprise my mind hardly yet able to work on what my eyes reported this third person suddenly stooped and summoned his companions with a cry so loud that it reached my ears upon the hill the others ran to him even dropping the compass in their hurry and i could see the bone and the shoebuckle going from hand to hand causing the most unusual gesticulations of surprise and interest  just then i could hear the seamen crying from the boat and saw them point westward to that cloud continent which was ever the more rapidly unfurling its blackness over heaven  the others seemed to consult but the danger was too pressing to be braved and they bundled into the boat carrying my relies with them and set forth out of the bay with all speed of oars  i made no more ado about the matter but turned and ran for the house whoever these men were it was fit my uncle should be instantly informed it was not then altogether too late in the day for a descent of the jacobites and may be prince charlie whom i knew my uncle to detest was one of the three superiors whom i had seen upon the rock  yet as i ran leaping from rock to rock and turned the matter loosely in my mind this theory grew ever the longer the less welcome to my reason  the compass the map the interest awakened by the buckle and the conduct of that one among the strangers who had looked so often below him in the water all seemed to point to a different explanation of their presence on that outlying obscure islet of the western sea  the madrid historian the search instituted by dr robertson the bearded stranger with the rings my own fruitless search that very morning in the deep water of sandag bay ran together piece by piece in my memory and i made sure that these strangers must be spaniards in quest of ancient treasure and the lost ship of the armada  but the people living in outlying islands such as aros are answerable for their own security there is none near by to protect or even to help them and the presence in such a spot of a crew of foreign adventurerspoor greedy and most likely lawlessfilled me with apprehensions for my uncles money and even for the safety of his daughter  i was still wondering how we were to get rid of them when i came all breathless to the top of aros  the whole world was shadowed over only in the extreme east on a hill of the mainland one last gleam of sunshine lingered like a jewel rain had begun to fall not heavily but in great drops the sea was rising with each moment and already a band of white encircled aros and the nearer coasts of grisapol  the boat was still pulling seaward but i now became aware of what had been hidden from me lower downa large heavily sparred handsome schooner lying to at the south end of aros  since i had not seen her in the morning when i had looked around so closely at the signs of the weather and upon these lone waters where a sail was rarely visible it was clear she must have lain last night behind the uninhabited eilean gour and this proved conclusively that she was manned by strangers to our coast for that anchorage though good enough to look at is little better than a trap for ships  with such ignorant sailors upon so wild a coast the coming gale was not unlikely to bring death upon its wings    chapter iv  the gale   i found my uncle at the gable end watching the signs of the weather with a pipe in his fingers  uncle said i there were men ashore at sandag bay  i had no time to go further indeed i not only forgot my words but even my weariness so strange was the effect on uncle gordon  he dropped his pipe and fell back against the end of the house with his jaw fallen his eyes staring and his long face as white as paper  we must have looked at one another silently for a quarter of a minute before he made answer in this extraordinary fashion had he a hair kep on  i knew as well as if i had been there that the man who now lay buried at sandag had worn a hairy cap and that he had come ashore alive  for the first and only time i lost toleration for the man who was my benefactor and the father of the woman i hoped to call my wife  these were living men said i perhaps jacobites perhaps the french perhaps pirates perhaps adventurers come here to seek the spanish treasure ship but whatever they may be dangerous at least to your daughter and my cousin  as for your own guilty terrors man the dead sleeps well where you have laid him  i stood this morning by his grave he will not wake before the trump of doom  my kinsman looked upon me blinking while i spoke then he fixed his eyes for a little on the ground and pulled his fingers foolishly but it was plain that he was past the power of speech  come said i  you must think for others  you must come up the hill with me and see this ship  he obeyed without a word or a look following slowly after my impatient strides  the spring seemed to have gone out of his body and he scrambled heavily up and down the rocks instead of leaping as he was wont from one to another  nor could i for all my cries induce him to make better haste  only once he replied to me complainingly and like one in bodily pain ay ay man im coming  long before we had reached the top i had no other thought for him but pity  if the crime had been monstrous the punishment was in proportion  at last we emerged above the skyline of the hill and could see around us  all was black and stormy to the eye the last gleam of sun had vanished a wind had sprung up not yet high but gusty and unsteady to the point the rain on the other hand had ceased  short as was the interval the sea already ran vastly higher than when i had stood there last already it had begun to break over some of the outward reefs and already it moaned aloud in the seacaves of aros  i looked at first in vain for the schooner  there she is i said at last  but her new position and the course she was now lying puzzled me  they cannot mean to beat to sea i cried  thats what they mean said my uncle with something like joy and just then the schooner went about and stood upon another tack which put the question beyond the reach of doubt  these strangers seeing a gale on hand had thought first of searoom  with the wind that threatened in these reefsown waters and contending against so violent a stream of tide their course was certain death  good god said i they are all lost  ay returned my uncle aa lost  they hadnae a chance but to rin for kyle dona  the gate theyre gaun the noo they couldnae win through an the muckle deil were there to pilot them  eh man he continued touching me on the sleeve its a braw nicht for a shipwreck  twa in ae twalmonth  eh but the merry menll dance bonny  i looked at him and it was then that i began to fancy him no longer in his right mind  he was peering up to me as if for sympathy a timid joy in his eyes  all that had passed between us was already forgotten in the prospect of this fresh disaster  if it were not too late i cried with indignation i would take the coble and go out to warn them  na na he protested ye maunnae interfere ye maunnae meddle wi the like o that  its hisdoffing his bonnethis wull  and eh man but its a braw nicht fort  something like fear began to creep into my soul and reminding him that i had not yet dined i proposed we should return to the house  but no nothing would tear him from his place of outlook  i maun see the hail thing man cherlie he explainedand then as the schooner went about a second time eh but they hanle her bonny he cried  the christanna was naething to this  already the men on board the schooner must have begun to realise some part but not yet the twentieth of the dangers that environed their doomed ship  at every lull of the capricious wind they must have seen how fast the current swept them back  each tack was made shorter as they saw how little it prevailed  every moment the rising swell began to boom and foam upon another sunken reef and ever and again a breaker would fall in sounding ruin under the very bows of her and the brown reef and streaming tangle appear in the hollow of the wave  i tell you they had to stand to their tackle there was no idle men aboard that ship god knows  it was upon the progress of a scene so horrible to any humanhearted man that my misguided uncle now pored and gloated like a connoisseur  as i turned to go down the hill he was lying on his belly on the summit with his hands stretched forth and clutching in the heather  he seemed rejuvenated mind and body  when i got back to the house already dismally affected i was still more sadly downcast at the sight of mary  she had her sleeves rolled up over her strong arms and was quietly making bread  i got a bannock from the dresser and sat down to eat it in silence  are ye wearied lad she asked after a while  i am not so much wearied mary i replied getting on my feet as i am weary of delay and perhaps of aros too  you know me well enough to judge me fairly say what i like  well mary you may be sure of this you had better be anywhere but here  ill be sure of one thing she returned ill be where my duty is  you forget you have a duty to yourself i said  ay man she replied pounding at the dough will you have found that in the bible now  mary i said solemnly you must not laugh at me just now  god knows i am in no heart for laughing  if we could get your father with us it would be best but with him or without him i want you far away from here my girl for your own sake and for mine ay and for your fathers too i want you farfar away from here  i came with other thoughts i came here as a man comes home now it is all changed and i have no desire nor hope but to fleefor thats the wordflee like a bird out of the fowlers snare from this accursed island  she had stopped her work by this time  and do you think now said she do you think now i have neither eyes nor ears  do ye think i havenae broken my heart to have these braws as he calls them god forgive him thrown into the sea  do ye think i have lived with him day in day out and not seen what you saw in an hour or two  no she said i know theres wrong in it what wrong i neither know nor want to know  there was never an ill thing made better by meddling that i could hear of  but my lad you must never ask me to leave my father  while the breath is in his body ill be with him  and hes not long for here either that i can tell you charliehes not long for here  the mark is on his brow and better somaybe better so  i was a while silent not knowing what to say and when i roused my head at last to speak she got before me  charlie she said whats right for me neednae be right for you theres sin upon this house and trouble you are a stranger take your things upon your back and go your ways to better places and to better folk and if you were ever minded to come back though it were twenty years syne you would find me aye waiting  mary ellen i said i asked you to be my wife and you said as good as yes  thats done for good  wherever you are i am as i shall answer to my god  as i said the words the wind suddenly burst out raving and then seemed to stand still and shudder round the house of aros  it was the first squall or prologue of the coming tempest and as we started and looked about us we found that a gloom like the approach of evening had settled round the house  god pity all poor folks at sea she said  well see no more of my father till the morrows morning  and then she told me as we sat by the fire and hearkened to the rising gusts of how this change had fallen upon my uncle  all last winter he had been dark and fitful in his mind  whenever the roost ran high or as mary said whenever the merry men were dancing he would lie out for hours together on the head if it were at night or on the top of aros by day watching the tumult of the sea and sweeping the horizon for a sail after february the tenth when the wealthbringing wreck was cast ashore at sandag he had been at first unnaturally gay and his excitement had never fallen in degree but only changed in kind from dark to darker  he neglected his work and kept rorie idle  they two would speak together by the hour at the gable end in guarded tones and with an air of secrecy and almost of guilt and if she questioned either as at first she sometimes did her inquiries were put aside with confusion  since rorie had first remarked the fish that hung about the ferry his master had never set foot but once upon the mainland of the ross  that onceit was in the height of the springshe had passed dryshod while the tide was out but having lingered overlong on the far side found himself cut off from aros by the returning waters  it was with a shriek of agony that he had leaped across the gut and he had reached home thereafter in a fever fit of fear  a fear of the sea a constant haunting thought of the sea appeared in his talk and devotions and even in his looks when he was silent  rorie alone came in to supper but a little later my uncle appeared took a bottle under his arm put some bread in his pocket and set forth again to his outlook followed this time by rorie  i heard that the schooner was losing ground but the crew were still fighting every inch with hopeless ingenuity and course and the news filled my mind with blackness  a little after sundown the full fury of the gale broke forth such a gale as i have never seen in summer nor seeing how swiftly it had come even in winter  mary and i sat in silence the house quaking overhead the tempest howling without the fire between us sputtering with raindrops our thoughts were far away with the poor fellows on the schooner or my not less unhappy uncle houseless on the promontory and yet ever and again we were startled back to ourselves when the wind would rise and strike the gable like a solid body or suddenly fall and draw away so that the fire leaped into flame and our hearts bounded in our sides  now the storm in its might would seize and shake the four corners of the roof roaring like leviathan in anger  anon in a lull cold eddies of tempest moved shudderingly in the room lifting the hair upon our heads and passing between us as we sat  and again the wind would break forth in a chorus of melancholy sounds hooting low in the chimney wailing with flutelike softness round the house  it was perhaps eight oclock when rorie came in and pulled me mysteriously to the door  my uncle it appeared had frightened even his constant comrade and rorie uneasy at his extravagance prayed me to come out and share the watch  i hastened to do as i was asked the more readily as what with fear and horror and the electrical tension of the night i was myself restless and disposed for action  i told mary to be under no alarm for i should be a safeguard on her father and wrapping myself warmly in a plaid i followed rorie into the open air  the night though we were so little past midsummer was as dark as january  intervals of a groping twilight alternated with spells of utter blackness and it was impossible to trace the reason of these changes in the flying horror of the sky  the wind blew the breath out of a mans nostrils all heaven seemed to thunder overhead like one huge sail and when there fell a momentary lull on aros we could hear the gusts dismally sweeping in the distance  over all the lowlands of the ross the wind must have blown as fierce as on the open sea and god only knows the uproar that was raging around the head of ben kyaw  sheets of mingled spray and rain were driven in our faces  all round the isle of aros the surf with an incessant hammering thunder beat upon the reefs and beaches  now louder in one place now lower in another like the combinations of orchestral music the constant mass of sound was hardly varied for a moment  and loud above all this hurlyburly i could hear the changeful voices of the roost and the intermittent roaring of the merry men  at that hour there flashed into my mind the reason of the name that they were called  for the noise of them seemed almost mirthful as it outtopped the other noises of the night or if not mirthful yet instinct with a portentous joviality  nay and it seemed even human  as when savage men have drunk away their reason and discarding speech bawl together in their madness by the hour so to my ears these deadly breakers shouted by aros in the night  arm in arm and staggering against the wind rorie and i won every yard of ground with conscious effort  we slipped on the wet sod we fell together sprawling on the rocks  bruised drenched beaten and breathless it must have taken us near half an hour to get from the house down to the head that overlooks the roost  there it seemed was my uncles favourite observatory  right in the face of it where the cliff is highest and most sheer a hump of earth like a parapet makes a place of shelter from the common winds where a man may sit in quiet and see the tide and the mad billows contending at his feet  as he might look down from the window of a house upon some street disturbance so from this post he looks down upon the tumbling of the merry men  on such a night of course he peers upon a world of blackness where the waters wheel and boil where the waves joust together with the noise of an explosion and the foam towers and vanishes in the twinkling of an eye never before had i seen the merry men thus violent  the fury height and transiency of their spoutings was a thing to be seen and not recounted  high over our heads on the cliff rose their white columns in the darkness and the same instant like phantoms they were gone sometimes three at a time would thus aspire and vanish sometimes a gust took them and the spray would fall about us heavy as a wave  and yet the spectacle was rather maddening in its levity than impressive by its force  thought was beaten down by the confounding uproara gleeful vacancy possessed the brains of men a state akin to madness and i found myself at times following the dance of the merry men as it were a tune upon a jigging instrument  i first caught sight of my uncle when we were still some yards away in one of the flying glimpses of twilight that chequered the pitch darkness of the night  he was standing up behind the parapet his head thrown back and the bottle to his mouth  as he put it down he saw and recognised us with a toss of one hand fleeringly above his head  has he been drinking shouted i to rorie  he will aye be drunk when the wind blaws returned rorie in the same high key and it was all that i could do to hear him  thenwas he soin february i inquired  rories ay was a cause of joy to me  the murder then had not sprung in cold blood from calculation it was an act of madness no more to be condemned than to be pardoned  my uncle was a dangerous madman if you will but he was not cruel and base as i had feared  yet what a scene for a carouse what an incredible vice was this that the poor man had chosen  i have always thought drunkenness a wild and almost fearful pleasure rather demoniacal than human but drunkenness out here in the roaring blackness on the edge of a cliff above that hell of waters the mans head spinning like the roost his foot tottering on the edge of death his ear watching for the signs of shipwreck surely that if it were credible in any one was morally impossible in a man like my uncle whose mind was set upon a damnatory creed and haunted by the darkest superstitions  yet so it was and as we reached the bight of shelter and could breathe again i saw the mans eyes shining in the night with an unholy glimmer  eh charlie man its grand he cried  see to them he continued dragging me to the edge of the abyss from whence arose that deafening clamour and those clouds of spray see to them dancin man  is that no wicked  he pronounced the word with gusto and i thought it suited with the scene  theyre yowlin for thon schooner he went on his thin insane voice clearly audible in the shelter of the bank an shes comin aye nearer aye nearer aye nearer an nearer an nearer an they kent the folk kens it they ken wool its by wi them  charlie lad theyre a drunk in yon schooner a dozened wi drink  they were a drunk in the christ anna at the hinder end  theres nane could droon at sea wantin the brandy  hoot awa what do you ken with a sudden blast of anger  i tell ye it cannae be they droon withoot it  hae holding out the bottle tak a sowp  i was about to refuse but rorie touched me as if in warning and indeed i had already thought better of the movement  i took the bottle therefore and not only drank freely myself but contrived to spill even more as i was doing so  it was pure spirit and almost strangled me to swallow  my kinsman did not observe the loss but once more throwing back his head drained the remainder to the dregs  then with a loud laugh he cast the bottle forth among the merry men who seemed to leap up shouting to receive it  hae bairns he cried theres your hansel  yell get bonnier nor that or morning  suddenly out in the black night before us and not two hundred yards away we heard at a moment when the wind was silent the clear note of a human voice  instantly the wind swept howling down upon the head and the roost bellowed and churned and danced with a new fury  but we had heard the sound and we knew with agony that this was the doomed ship now close on ruin and that what we had heard was the voice of her master issuing his last command  crouching together on the edge we waited straining every sense for the inevitable end  it was long however and to us it seemed like ages ere the schooner suddenly appeared for one brief instant relieved against a tower of glimmering foam  i still see her reefed mainsail flapping loose as the boom fell heavily across the deck i still see the black outline of the hull and still think i can distinguish the figure of a man stretched upon the tiller  yet the whole sight we had of her passed swifter than lightning the very wave that disclosed her fell burying her for ever the mingled cry of many voices at the point of death rose and was quenched in the roaring of the merry men  and with that the tragedy was at an end  the strong ship with all her gear and the lamp perhaps still burning in the cabin the lives of so many men precious surely to others dear at least as heaven to themselves had all in that one moment gone down into the surging waters  they were gone like a dream  and the wind still ran and shouted and the senseless waters in the roost still leaped and tumbled as before  how long we lay there together we three speechless and motionless is more than i can tell but it must have been for long  at length one by one and almost mechanically we crawled back into the shelter of the bank  as i lay against the parapet wholly wretched and not entirely master of my mind i could hear my kinsman maundering to himself in an altered and melancholy mood  now he would repeat to himself with maudlin iteration sic a fecht as they hadsic a sair fecht as they had puir lads puir lads and anon he would bewail that a the gear was as gudes tint because the ship had gone down among the merry men instead of stranding on the shore and throughout the namethe christannawould come and go in his divagations pronounced with shuddering awe  the storm all this time was rapidly abating  in half an hour the wind had fallen to a breeze and the change was accompanied or caused by a heavy cold and plumping rain  i must then have fallen asleep and when i came to myself drenched stiff and unrefreshed day had already broken grey wet discomfortable day the wind blew in faint and shifting capfuls the tide was out the roost was at its lowest and only the strong beating surf round all the coasts of aros remained to witness of the furies of the night    chapter v  a man out of the sea   rorie set out for the house in search of warmth and breakfast but my uncle was bent upon examining the shores of aros and i felt it a part of duty to accompany him throughout  he was now docile and quiet but tremulous and weak in mind and body and it was with the eagerness of a child that he pursued his exploration  he climbed far down upon the rocks on the beaches he pursued the retreating breakers  the merest broken plank or rag of cordage was a treasure in his eyes to be secured at the peril of his life  to see him with weak and stumbling footsteps expose himself to the pursuit of the surf or the snares and pitfalls of the weedy rock kept me in a perpetual terror  my arm was ready to support him my hand clutched him by the skirt i helped him to draw his pitiful discoveries beyond the reach of the returning wave a nurse accompanying a child of seven would have had no different experience  yet weakened as he was by the reaction from his madness of the night before the passions that smouldered in his nature were those of a strong man  his terror of the sea although conquered for the moment was still undiminished had the sea been a lake of living flames he could not have shrunk more panically from its touch and once when his foot slipped and he plunged to the midleg into a pool of water the shriek that came up out of his soul was like the cry of death  he sat still for a while panting like a dog after that but his desire for the spoils of shipwreck triumphed once more over his fears once more he tottered among the curded foam once more he crawled upon the rocks among the bursting bubbles once more his whole heart seemed to be set on driftwood fit if it was fit for anything to throw upon the fire  pleased as he was with what he found he still incessantly grumbled at his illfortune  aros he said is no a place for wrecks avano ava  a the years ive dwalt here this ane maks the second and the best o the gear clean tint  uncle said i for we were now on a stretch of open sand where there was nothing to divert his mind i saw you last night as i never thought to see youyou were drunk  na na he said no as bad as that  i had been drinking though  and to tell ye the gods truth its a thing i cannae mend  theres nae soberer man than me in my ordnar but when i hear the wind blaw in my lug its my belief that i gang gyte  you are a religious man i replied and this is sin  ou he returned if it wasnae sin i dinnae ken that i would care fort  ye see man its defiance  theres a sair spang o the auld sin o the warld in you sea its an unchristian business at the best ot an whiles when it gets up an the wind skreightsthe wind an her are a kind of sib im thinkinan thae merry men the daft callants blawin and lauchin and puir souls in the deid thraws warstlin the leelang nicht wi their bit shipsweel it comes ower me like a glamour im a deil i kent  but i think naething o the puir sailor lads im wi the sea im just like ane o her ain merry men  i thought i should touch him in a joint of his harness  i turned me towards the sea the surf was running gaily wave after wave with their manes blowing behind them riding one after another up the beach towering curving falling one upon another on the trampled sand without the salt air the scared gulls the widespread army of the sea chargers neighing to each other as they gathered together to the assault of aros and close before us that line on the flat sands that with all their number and their fury they might never pass  thus far shalt thou go said i and no farther  and then i quoted as solemnly as i was able a verse that i had often before fitted to the chorus of the breakers     but yet the lord that is on high       is more of might by far    than noise of many waters is       as great sea billows are  ay said my kinsinan at the hinder end the lord will triumph i dinnae misdoobt that  but here on earth even silly menfolk daur him to his face  it is nae wise i am nae sayin that its wise but its the pride of the eye and its the lust o life an its the wale o pleesures  i said no more for we had now begun to cross a neck of land that lay between us and sandag and i withheld my last appeal to the mans better reason till we should stand upon the spot associated with his crime  nor did he pursue the subject but he walked beside me with a firmer step the call that i had made upon his mind acted like a stimulant and i could see that he had forgotten his search for worthless jetsam in a profound gloomy and yet stirring train of thought  in three or four minutes we had topped the brae and begun to go down upon sandag  the wreck had been roughly handled by the sea the stem had been spun round and dragged a little lower down and perhaps the stern had been forced a little higher for the two parts now lay entirely separate on the beach when we came to the grave i stopped uncovered my head in the thick rain and looking my kinsman in the face addressed him  a man said i was in gods providence suffered to escape from mortal dangers he was poor he was naked he was wet he was weary he was a stranger he had every claim upon the bowels of your compassion it may be that he was the salt of the earth holy helpful and kind it may be he was a man laden with iniquities to whom death was the beginning of torment  i ask you in the sight of heaven gordon darnaway where is the man for whom christ died  he started visibly at the last words but there came no answer and his face expressed no feeling but a vague alarm  you were my fathers brother i continued you have taught me to count your house as if it were my fathers house and we are both sinful men walking before the lord among the sins and dangers of this life  it is by our evil that god leads us into good we sin i dare not say by his temptation but i must say with his consent and to any but the brutish man his sins are the beginning of wisdom  god has warned you by this crime he warns you still by the bloody grave between our feet and if there shall follow no repentance no improvement no return to him what can we look for but the following of some memorable judgment  even as i spoke the words the eyes of my uncle wandered from my face  a change fell upon his looks that cannot be described his features seemed to dwindle in size the colour faded from his cheeks one hand rose waveringly and pointed over my shoulder into the distance and the oft repeated name fell once more from his lips the christanna  i turned and if i was not appalled to the same degree as i return thanks to heaven that i had not the cause i was still startled by the sight that met my eyes  the form of a man stood upright on the cabin hutch of the wrecked ship his back was towards us he appeared to be scanning the offing with shaded eyes and his figure was relieved to its full height which was plainly very great against the sea and sky  i have said a thousand times that i am not superstitious but at that moment with my mind running upon death and sin the unexplained appearance of a stranger on that seagirt solitary island filled me with a surprise that bordered close on terror  it seemed scarce possible that any human soul should have come ashore alive in such a sea as had rated last night along the coasts of aros and the only vessel within miles had gone down before our eyes among the merry men  i was assailed with doubts that made suspense unbearable and to put the matter to the touch at once stepped forward and hailed the figure like a ship  he turned about and i thought he started to behold us  at this my courage instantly revived and i called and signed to him to draw near and he on his part dropped immediately to the sands and began slowly to approach with many stops and hesitations  at each repeated mark of the mans uneasiness i grew the more confident myself and i advanced another step encouraging him as i did so with my head and hand  it was plain the castaway had heard indifferent accounts of our island hospitality and indeed about this time the people farther north had a sorry reputation  why i said the man is black  and just at that moment in a voice that i could scarce have recognised my kinsman began swearing and praying in a mingled stream  i looked at him he had fallen on his knees his face was agonised at each step of the castaways the pitch of his voice rose the volubility of his utterance and the fervour of his language redoubled  i call it prayer for it was addressed to god but surely no such ranting incongruities were ever before addressed to the creator by a creature surely if prayer can be a sin this mad harangue was sinful  i ran to my kinsman i seized him by the shoulders i dragged him to his feet  silence man said i respect your god in words if not in action here on the very scene of your transgressions he sends you an occasion of atonement  forward and embrace it welcome like a father yon creature who comes trembling to your mercy  with that i tried to force him towards the black but he felled me to the ground burst from my grasp leaving the shoulder of his jacket and fled up the hillside towards the top of aros like a deer  i staggered to my feet again bruised and somewhat stunned the negro had paused in surprise perhaps in terror some halfway between me and the wreck my uncle was already far away bounding from rock to rock and i thus found myself torn for a time between two duties  but i judged and i pray heaven that i judged rightly in favour of the poor wretch upon the sands his misfortune was at least not plainly of his own creation it was one besides that i could certainly relieve and i had begun by that time to regard my uncle as an incurable and dismal lunatic  i advanced accordingly towards the black who now awaited my approach with folded arms like one prepared for either destiny  as i came nearer he reached forth his hand with a great gesture such as i had seen from the pulpit and spoke to me in something of a pulpit voice but not a word was comprehensible  i tried him first in english then in gaelic both in vain so that it was clear we must rely upon the tongue of looks and gestures  thereupon i signed to him to follow me which he did readily and with a grave obeisance like a fallen king all the while there had come no shade of alteration in his face neither of anxiety while he was still waiting nor of relief now that he was reassured if he were a slave as i supposed i could not but judge he must have fallen from some high place in his own country and fallen as he was i could not but admire his bearing  as we passed the grave i paused and raised my hands and eyes to heaven in token of respect and sorrow for the dead and he as if in answer bowed low and spread his hands abroad it was a strange motion but done like a thing of common custom and i supposed it was ceremonial in the land from which he came  at the same time he pointed to my uncle whom we could just see perched upon a knoll and touched his head to indicate that he was mad  we took the long way round the shore for i feared to excite my uncle if we struck across the island and as we walked i had time enough to mature the little dramatic exhibition by which i hoped to satisfy my doubts  accordingly pausing on a rock i proceeded to imitate before the negro the action of the man whom i had seen the day before taking bearings with the compass at sandag  he understood me at once and taking the imitation out of my hands showed me where the boat was pointed out seaward as if to indicate the position of the schooner and then down along the edge of the rock with the words espirito santo strangely pronounced but clear enough for recognition  i had thus been right in my conjecture the pretended historical inquiry had been but a cloak for treasurehunting the man who had played on dr robertson was the same as the foreigner who visited grisapol in spring and now with many others lay dead under the roost of aros there had their greed brought them there should their bones be tossed for evermore  in the meantime the black continued his imitation of the scene now looking up skyward as though watching the approach of the storm now in the character of a seaman waving the rest to come aboard now as an officer running along the rock and entering the boat and anon bending over imaginary oars with the air of a hurried boatman but all with the same solemnity of manner so that i was never even moved to smile  lastly he indicated to me by a pantomime not to be described in words how he himself had gone up to examine the stranded wreck and to his grief and indignation had been deserted by his comrades and thereupon folded his arms once more and stooped his head like one accepting fate  the mystery of his presence being thus solved for me i explained to him by means of a sketch the fate of the vessel and of all aboard her  he showed no surprise nor sorrow and with a sudden lifting of his open hand seemed to dismiss his former friends or masters whichever they had been into gods pleasure  respect came upon me and grew stronger the more i observed him i saw he had a powerful mind and a sober and severe character such as i loved to commune with and before we reached the house of aros i had almost forgotten and wholly forgiven him his uncanny colour  to mary i told all that had passed without suppression though i own my heart failed me but i did wrong to doubt her sense of justice  you did the right she said  gods will be done  and she set out meat for us at once  as soon as i was satisfied i bade rorie keep an eye upon the castaway who was still eating and set forth again myself to find my uncle  i had not gone far before i saw him sitting in the same place upon the very topmost knoll and seemingly in the same attitude as when i had last observed him  from that point as i have said the most of aros and the neighbouring ross would be spread below him like a map and it was plain that he kept a bright lookout in all directions for my head had scarcely risen above the summit of the first ascent before he had leaped to his feet and turned as if to face me  i hailed him at once as well as i was able in the same tones and words as i had often used before when i had come to summon him to dinner  he made not so much as a movement in reply  i passed on a little farther and again tried parley with the same result  but when i began a second time to advance his insane fears blazed up again and still in dead silence but with incredible speed he began to flee from before me along the rocky summit of the hill  an hour before he had been dead weary and i had been comparatively active  but now his strength was recruited by the fervour of insanity and it would have been vain for me to dream of pursuit  nay the very attempt i thought might have inflamed his terrors and thus increased the miseries of our position  and i had nothing left but to turn homeward and make my sad report to mary  she heard it as she had heard the first with a concerned composure and bidding me lie down and take that rest of which i stood so much in need set forth herself in quest of her misguided father  at that age it would have been a strange thing that put me from either meat or sleep i slept long and deep and it was already long past noon before i awoke and came downstairs into the kitchen  mary rorie and the black castaway were seated about the fire in silence and i could see that mary had been weeping  there was cause enough as i soon learned for tears  first she and then rorie had been forth to seek my uncle each in turn had found him perched upon the hilltop and from each in turn he had silently and swiftly fled  rorie had tried to chase him but in vain madness lent a new vigour to his bounds he sprang from rock to rock over the widest gullies he scoured like the wind along the hilltops he doubled and twisted like a hare before the dogs and rorie at length gave in and the last that he saw my uncle was seated as before upon the crest of aros  even during the hottest excitement of the chase even when the fleetfooted servant had come for a moment very near to capture him the poor lunatic had uttered not a sound  he fled and he was silent like a beast and this silence had terrified his pursuer  there was something heartbreaking in the situation  how to capture the madman how to feed him in the meanwhile and what to do with him when he was captured were the three difficulties that we had to solve  the black said i is the cause of this attack  it may even be his presence in the house that keeps my uncle on the hill  we have done the fair thing he has been fed and warmed under this roof now i propose that rorie put him across the bay in the coble and take him through the ross as far as grisapol  in this proposal mary heartily concurred and bidding the black follow us we all three descended to the pier  certainly heavens will was declared against gordon darnaway a thing had happened never paralleled before in aros during the storm the coble had broken loose and striking on the rough splinters of the pier now lay in four feet of water with one side stove in  three days of work at least would be required to make her float  but i was not to be beaten  i led the whole party round to where the gut was narrowest swam to the other side and called to the black to follow me  he signed with the same clearness and quiet as before that he knew not the art and there was truth apparent in his signals it would have occurred to none of us to doubt his truth and that hope being over we must all go back even as we came to the house of aros the negro walking in our midst without embarrassment  all we could do that day was to make one more attempt to communicate with the unhappy madman  again he was visible on his perch again he fled in silence  but food and a great cloak were at least left for his comfort the rain besides had cleared away and the night promised to be even warm  we might compose ourselves we thought until the morrow rest was the chief requisite that we might be strengthened for unusual exertions and as none cared to talk we separated at an early hour  i lay long awake planning a campaign for the morrow  i was to place the black on the side of sandag whence he should head my uncle towards the house rorie in the west i on the east were to complete the cordon as best we might  it seemed to me the more i recalled the configuration of the island that it should be possible though hard to force him down upon the low ground along aros bay and once there even with the strength of his madness ultimate escape was hardly to be feared  it was on his terror of the black that i relied for i made sure however he might run it would not be in the direction of the man whom he supposed to have returned from the dead and thus one point of the compass at least would be secure  when at length i fell asleep it was to be awakened shortly after by a dream of wrecks black men and submarine adventure and i found myself so shaken and fevered that i arose descended the stair and stepped out before the house  within rorie and the black were asleep together in the kitchen outside was a wonderful clear night of stars with here and there a cloud still hanging last stragglers of the tempest  it was near the top of the flood and the merry men were roaring in the windless quiet of the night  never not even in the height of the tempest had i heard their song with greater awe  now when the winds were gathered home when the deep was dandling itself back into its summer slumber and when the stars rained their gentle light over land and sea the voice of these tidebreakers was still raised for havoc  they seemed indeed to be a part of the worlds evil and the tragic side of life  nor were their meaningless vociferations the only sounds that broke the silence of the night  for i could hear now shrill and thrilling and now almost drowned the note of a human voice that accompanied the uproar of the roost  i knew it for my kinsmans and a great fear fell upon me of gods judgments and the evil in the world  i went back again into the darkness of the house as into a place of shelter and lay long upon my bed pondering these mysteries  it was late when i again woke and i leaped into my clothes and hurried to the kitchen  no one was there rorie and the black had both stealthily departed long before and my heart stood still at the discovery  i could rely on rories heart but i placed no trust in his discretion  if he had thus set out without a word he was plainly bent upon some service to my uncle  but what service could he hope to render even alone far less in the company of the man in whom my uncle found his fears incarnated  even if i were not already too late to prevent some deadly mischief it was plain i must delay no longer  with the thought i was out of the house and often as i have run on the rough sides of aros i never ran as i did that fatal morning  i do not believe i put twelve minutes to the whole ascent  my uncle was gone from his perch  the basket had indeed been torn open and the meat scattered on the turf but as we found afterwards no mouthful had been tasted and there was not another trace of human existence in that wide field of view  day had already filled the clear heavens the sun already lighted in a rosy bloom upon the crest of ben kyaw but all below me the rude knolls of aros and the shield of sea lay steeped in the clear darkling twilight of the dawn  rorie i cried and again rorie  my voice died in the silence but there came no answer back  if there were indeed an enterprise afoot to catch my uncle it was plainly not in fleetness of foot but in dexterity of stalking that the hunters placed their trust  i ran on farther keeping the higher spurs and looking right and left nor did i pause again till i was on the mount above sandag  i could see the wreck the uncovered belt of sand the waves idly beating the long ledge of rocks and on either hand the tumbled knolls boulders and gullies of the island  but still no human thing  at a stride the sunshine fell on aros and the shadows and colours leaped into being  not half a moment later below me to the west sheep began to scatter as in a panic  there came a cry  i saw my uncle running  i saw the black jump up in hot pursuit and before i had time to understand rorie also had appeared calling directions in gaelic as to a dog herding sheep  i took to my heels to interfere and perhaps i had done better to have waited where i was for i was the means of cutting off the madmans last escape  there was nothing before him from that moment but the grave the wreck and the sea in sandag bay  and yet heaven knows that what i did was for the best  my uncle gordon saw in what direction horrible to him the chase was driving him  he doubled darting to the right and left but high as the fever ran in his veins the black was still the swifter  turn where he would he was still forestalled still driven toward the scene of his crime  suddenly he began to shriek aloud so that the coast reechoed and now both i and rorie were calling on the black to stop  but all was vain for it was written otherwise  the pursuer still ran the chase still sped before him screaming they avoided the grave and skimmed close past the timbers of the wreck in a breath they had cleared the sand and still my kinsman did not pause but dashed straight into the surf and the black now almost within reach still followed swiftly behind him  rorie and i both stopped for the thing was now beyond the hands of men and these were the decrees of god that came to pass before our eyes  there was never a sharper ending  on that steep beach they were beyond their depth at a bound neither could swim the black rose once for a moment with a throttling cry but the current had them racing seaward and if ever they came up again which god alone can tell it would be ten minutes after at the far end of aros roost where the seabirds hover fishing     will o the mill   chapter i  the plain and the stars   the mill here will lived with his adopted parents stood in a falling valley between pinewoods and great mountains  above hill after hill soared upwards until they soared out of the depth of the hardiest timber and stood naked against the sky  some way up a long grey village lay like a seam or a ray of vapour on a wooded hillside and when the wind was favourable the sound of the church bells would drop down thin and silvery to will  below the valley grew ever steeper and steeper and at the same time widened out on either hand and from an eminence beside the mill it was possible to see its whole length and away beyond it over a wide plain where the river turned and shone and moved on from city to city on its voyage towards the sea  it chanced that over this valley there lay a pass into a neighbouring kingdom so that quiet and rural as it was the road that ran along beside the river was a high thoroughfare between two splendid and powerful societies  all through the summer travellingcarriages came crawling up or went plunging briskly downwards past the mill and as it happened that the other side was very much easier of ascent the path was not much frequented except by people going in one direction and of all the carriages that will saw go by fivesixths were plunging briskly downwards and only onesixth crawling up  much more was this the case with footpassengers  all the light footed tourists all the pedlars laden with strange wares were tending downward like the river that accompanied their path  nor was this all for when will was yet a child a disastrous war arose over a great part of the world  the newspapers were full of defeats and victories the earth rang with cavalry hoofs and often for days together and for miles around the coil of battle terrified good people from their labours in the field of all this nothing was heard for a long time in the valley but at last one of the commanders pushed an army over the pass by forced marches and for three days horse and foot cannon and tumbril drum and standard kept pouring downward past the mill  all day the child stood and watched them on their passagethe rhythmical stride the pale unshaven faces tanned about the eyes the discoloured regimentals and the tattered flags filled him with a sense of weariness pity and wonder and all night long after he was in bed he could hear the cannon pounding and the feet trampling and the great armament sweeping onward and downward past the mill  no one in the valley ever heard the fate of the expedition for they lay out of the way of gossip in those troublous times but will saw one thing plainly that not a man returned  whither had they all gone  whither went all the tourists and pedlars with strange wares whither all the brisk barouches with servants in the dicky whither the water of the stream ever coursing downward and ever renewed from above  even the wind blew oftener down the valley and carried the dead leaves along with it in the fall  it seemed like a great conspiracy of things animate and inanimate they all went downward fleetly and gaily downward and only he it seemed remained behind like a stock upon the wayside  it sometimes made him glad when he noticed how the fishes kept their heads up stream  they at least stood faithfully by him while all else were posting downward to the unknown world  one evening he asked the miller where the river went  it goes down the valley answered he and turns a power of millssix score mills they say from here to unterdeckand is none the wearier after all  and then it goes out into the lowlands and waters the great corn country and runs through a sight of fine cities so they say where kings live all alone in great palaces with a sentry walling up and down before the door  and it goes under bridges with stone men upon them looking down and smiling so curious it the water and living folks leaning their elbows on the wall and looking over too  and then it goes on and on and down through marshes and sands until at last it falls into the sea where the ships are that bring parrots and tobacco from the indies  ay it has a long trot before it as it goes singing over our weir bless its heart  and what is the sea asked will  the sea cried the miller  lord help us all it is the greatest thing god made  that is where all the water in the world runs down into a great salt lake  there it lies as flat as my hand and as innocentlike as a child but they do say when the wind blows it gets up into water mountains bigger than any of ours and swallows down great ships bigger than our mill and makes such a roaring that you can hear it miles away upon the land  there are great fish in it five times bigger than a bull and one old serpent as lone as our river and as old as all the world with whiskers like a man and a crown of silver on her head  will thought he had never heard anything like this and he kept on asking question after question about the world that lay away down the river with all its perils and marvels until the old miller became quite interested himself and at last took him by the hand and led him to the hilltop that overlooks the valley and the plain  the sun was near setting and hung low down in a cloudless sky  everything was defined and glorified in golden light  will had never seen so great an expanse of country in his life he stood and gazed with all his eyes  he could see the cities and the woods and fields and the bright curves of the river and far away to where the rim of the plain trenched along the shining heavens  an overmastering emotion seized upon the boy soul and body his heart beat so thickly that he could not breathe the scene swam before his eyes the sun seemed to wheel round and round and throw off as it turned strange shapes which disappeared with the rapidity of thought and were succeeded by others  will covered his face with his hands and burst into a violent fit of tears and the poor miller sadly disappointed and perplexed saw nothing better for it than to take him up in his arms and carry him home in silence  from that day forward will was full of new hopes and longings  something kept tugging at his heartstrings the running water carried his desires along with it as he dreamed over its fleeting surface the wind as it ran over innumerable treetops hailed him with encouraging words branches beckoned downward the open road as it shouldered round the angles and went turning and vanishing fast and faster down the valley tortured him with its solicitations  he spent long whiles on the eminence looking down the rivershed and abroad on the fat lowlands and watched the clouds that travelled forth upon the sluggish wind and trailed their purple shadows on the plain or he would linger by the wayside and follow the carriages with his eyes as they rattled downward by the river  it did not matter what it was everything that went that way were it cloud or carriage bird or brown water in the stream he felt his heart flow out after it in an ecstasy of longing  we are told by men of science that all the ventures of mariners on the sea all that countermarching of tribes and races that confounds old history with its dust and rumour sprang from nothing more abstruse than the laws of supply and demand and a certain natural instinct for cheap rations  to any one thinking deeply this will seem a dull and pitiful explanation  the tribes that came swarming out of the north and east if they were indeed pressed onward from behind by others were drawn at the same time by the magnetic influence of the south and west  the fame of other lands had reached them the name of the eternal city rang in their ears they were not colonists but pilgrims they travelled towards wine and gold and sunshine but their hearts were set on something higher that divine unrest that old stinging trouble of humanity that makes all high achievements and all miserable failure the same that spread wings with icarus the same that sent columbus into the desolate atlantic inspired and supported these barbarians on their perilous march  there is one legend which profoundly represents their spirit of how a flying party of these wanderers encountered a very old man shod with iron  the old man asked them whither they were going and they answered with one voice to the eternal city  he looked upon them gravely  i have sought it he said over the most part of the world  three such pairs as i now carry on my feet have i worn out upon this pilgrimage and now the fourth is growing slender underneath my steps  and all this while i have not found the city  and he turned and went his own way alone leaving them astonished  and yet this would scarcely parallel the intensity of wills feeling for the plain  if he could only go far enough out there he felt as if his eyesight would be purged and clarified as if his hearing would grow more delicate and his very breath would come and go with luxury  he was transplanted and withering where he was he lay in a strange country and was sick for home  bit by bit he pieced together broken notions of the world below of the river ever moving and growing until it sailed forth into the majestic ocean of the cities full of brisk and beautiful people playing fountains bands of music and marble palaces and lighted up at night from end to end with artificial stars of gold of the great churches wise universities brave armies and untold money lying stored in vaults of the highflying vice that moved in the sunshine and the stealth and swiftness of midnight murder  i have said he was sick as if for home the figure halts  he was like some one lying in twilit formless preexistence and stretching out his hands lovingly towards many coloured manysounding life  it was no wonder he was unhappy he would go and tell the fish they were made for their life wished for no more than worms and running water and a hole below a falling bank but he was differently designed full of desires and aspirations itching at the fingers lusting with the eyes whom the whole variegated world could not satisfy with aspects  the true life the true bright sunshine lay far out upon the plain  and o to see this sunlight once before he died to move with a jocund spirit in a golden land to hear the trained singers and sweet church bells and see the holiday gardens  and o fish he would cry if you would only turn your noses down stream you could swim so easily into the fabled waters and see the vast ships passing over your head like clouds and hear the great waterhills making music over you all day long  but the fish kept looking patiently in their own direction until will hardly knew whether to laugh or cry  hitherto the traffic on the road had passed by will like something seen in a picture he had perhaps exchanged salutations with a tourist or caught sight of an old gentleman in a travelling cap at a carriage window but for the most part it had been a mere symbol which he contemplated from apart and with something of a superstitious feeling  a time came at last when this was to be changed  the miller who was a greedy man in his way and never forewent an opportunity of honest profit turned the millhouse into a little wayside inn and several pieces of good fortune falling in opportunely built stables and got the position of post master on the road  it now became wills duty to wait upon people as they sat to break their fasts in the little arbour at the top of the mill garden and you may be sure that he kept his ears open and learned many new things about the outside world as he brought the omelette or the wine  nay he would often get into conversation with single guests and by adroit questions and polite attention not only gratify his own curiosity but win the goodwill of the travellers  many complimented the old couple on their servingboy and a professor was eager to take him away with him and have him properly educated in the plain  the miller and his wife were mightily astonished and even more pleased  they thought it a very good thing that they should have opened their inn  you see the old man would remark he has a kind of talent for a publican he never would have made anything else  and so life wagged on in the valley with high satisfaction to all concerned but will  every carriage that left the inndoor seemed to take a part of him away with it and when people jestingly offered him a lift he could with difficulty command his emotion  night after night he would dream that he was awakened by flustered servants and that a splendid equipage waited at the door to carry him down into the plain night after night until the dream which had seemed all jollity to him at first began to take on a colour of gravity and the nocturnal summons and waiting equipage occupied a place in his mind as something to be both feared and hoped for  one day when will was about sixteen a fat young man arrived at sunset to pass the night  he was a contentedlooking fellow with a jolly eye and carried a knapsack  while dinner was preparing he sat in the arbour to read a book but as soon as he had begun to observe will the book was laid aside he was plainly one of those who prefer living people to people made of ink and paper  will on his part although he had not been much interested in the stranger at first sight soon began to take a great deal of pleasure in his talk which was full of good nature and good sense and at last conceived a great respect for his character and wisdom  they sat far into the night and about two in the morning will opened his heart to the young man and told him how he longed to leave the valley and what bright hopes he had connected with the cities of the plain  the young man whistled and then broke into a smile  my young friend he remarked you are a very curious little fellow to be sure and wish a great many things which you will never get  why you would feel quite ashamed if you knew how the little fellows in these fairy cities of yours are all after the same sort of nonsense and keep breaking their hearts to get up into the mountains  and let me tell you those who go down into the plains are a very short while there before they wish themselves heartily back again  the air is not so light nor so pure nor is the sun any brighter  as for the beautiful men and women you would see many of them in rags and many of them deformed with horrible disorders and a city is so hard a place for people who are poor and sensitive that many choose to die by their own hand  you must think me very simple answered will  although i have never been out of this valley believe me i have used my eyes  i know how one thing lives on another for instance how the fish hangs in the eddy to catch his fellows and the shepherd who makes so pretty a picture carrying home the lamb is only carrying it home for dinner  i do not expect to find all things right in your cities  that is not what troubles me it might have been that once upon a time but although i live here always i have asked many questions and learned a great deal in these last years and certainly enough to cure me of my old fancies  but you would not have me die like a dog and not see all that is to be seen and do all that a man can do let it be good or evil you would not have me spend all my days between this road here and the river and not so much as make a motion to be up and live my lifei would rather die out of hand he cried than linger on as i am doing  thousands of people said the young man live and die like you and are none the less happy  ah said will if there are thousands who would like why should not one of them have my place  it was quite dark there was a hanging lamp in the arbour which lit up the table and the faces of the speakers and along the arch the leaves upon the trellis stood out illuminated against the night sky a pattern of transparent green upon a dusky purple  the fat young man rose and taking will by the arm led him out under the open heavens  did you ever look at the stars he asked pointing upwards  often and often answered will  and do you know what they are  i have fancied many things  they are worlds like ours said the young man  some of them less many of them a million times greater and some of the least sparkles that you see are not only worlds but whole clusters of worlds turning about each other in the midst of space  we do not know what there may be in any of them perhaps the answer to all our difficulties or the cure of all our sufferings and yet we can never reach them not all the skill of the craftiest of men can fit out a ship for the nearest of these our neighbours nor would the life of the most aged suffice for such a journey  when a great battle has been lost or a dear friend is dead when we are hipped or in high spirits there they are unweariedly shining overhead  we may stand down here a whole army of us together and shout until we break our hearts and not a whisper reaches them  we may climb the highest mountain and we are no nearer them  all we can do is to stand down here in the garden and take off our hats the starshine lights upon our heads and where mine is a little bald i dare say you can see it glisten in the darkness  the mountain and the mouse  that is like to be all we shall ever have to do with arcturus or aldebaran  can you apply a parable he added laying his hand upon wills shoulder  it is not the same thing as a reason but usually vastly more convincing  will hung his head a little and then raised it once more to heaven  the stars seemed to expand and emit a sharper brilliancy and as he kept turning his eyes higher and higher they seemed to increase in multitude under his gaze  i see he said turning to the young man  we are in a rattrap  something of that size  did you ever see a squirrel turning in a cage and another squirrel sitting philosophically over his nuts  i neednt ask you which of them looked more of a fool    chapter ii  the parsons marjory   after some years the old people died both in one winter very carefully tended by their adopted son and very quietly mourned when they were gone  people who had heard of his roving fancies supposed he would hasten to sell the property and go down the river to push his fortunes but there was never any sign of such in intention on the part of will  on the contrary he had the inn set on a better footing and hired a couple of servants to assist him in carrying it on and there he settled down a kind talkative inscrutable young man six feet three in his stockings with an iron constitution and a friendly voice  he soon began to take rank in the district as a bit of an oddity it was not much to be wondered at from the first for he was always full of notions and kept calling the plainest commonsense in question but what most raised the report upon him was the odd circumstance of his courtship with the parsons marjory  the parsons marjory was a lass about nineteen when will would be about thirty well enough looking and much better educated than any other girl in that part of the country as became her parentage  she held her head very high and had already refused several offers of marriage with a grand air which had got her hard names among the neighbours  for all that she was a good girl and one that would have made any man well contented  will had never seen much of her for although the church and parsonage were only two miles from his own door he was never known to go there but on sundays  it chanced however that the parsonage fell into disrepair and had to be dismantled and the parson and his daughter took lodgings for a month or so on very much reduced terms at wills inn  now what with the inn and the mill and the old millers savings our friend was a man of substance and besides that he had a name for good temper and shrewdness which make a capital portion in marriage and so it was currently gossiped among their illwishers that the parson and his daughter had not chosen their temporary lodging with their eyes shut will was about the last man in the world to be cajoled or frightened into marriage  you had only to look into his eyes limpid and still like pools of water and yet with a sort of clear light that seemed to come from within and you would understand at once that here was one who knew his own mind and would stand to it immovably  marjory herself was no weakling by her looks with strong steady eyes and a resolute and quiet bearing  it might be a question whether she was not wills match in stedfastness after all or which of them would rule the roast in marriage  but marjory had never given it a thought and accompanied her father with the most unshaken innocence and unconcern  the season was still so early that wills customers were few and far between but the lilacs were already flowering and the weather was so mild that the party took dinner under the trellice with the noise of the river in their ears and the woods ringing about them with the songs of birds  will soon began to take a particular pleasure in these dinners the parson was rather a dull companion with a habit of dozing at table but nothing rude or cruel ever fell from his lips  and as for the parsons daughter she suited her surroundings with the best grace imaginable and whatever she said seemed so pat and pretty that will conceived a great idea of her talents  he could see her face as she leaned forward against a background of rising pinewoods her eyes shone peaceably the light lay around her hair like a kerchief something that was hardly a smile rippled her pale cheeks and will could not contain himself from gazing on her in an agreeable dismay  she looked even in her quietest moments so complete in herself and so quick with life down to her finger tips and the very skirts of her dress that the remainder of created things became no more than a blot by comparison and if will glanced away from her to her surroundings the trees looked inanimate and senseless the clouds hung in heaven like dead things and even the mountain tops were disenchanted  the whole valley could not compare in looks with this one girl  will was always observant in the society of his fellowcreatures but his observation became almost painfully eager in the case of marjory  he listened to all she uttered and read her eyes at the same time for the unspoken commentary  many kind simple and sincere speeches found an echo in his heart  he became conscious of a soul beautifully poised upon itself nothing doubting nothing desiring clothed in peace  it was not possible to separate her thoughts from her appearance  the turn of her wrist the still sound of her voice the light in her eyes the lines of her body fell in tune with her grave and gentle words like the accompaniment that sustains and harmonises the voice of the singer  her influence was one thing not to be divided or discussed only to be felt with gratitude and joy  to will her presence recalled something of his childhood and the thought of her took its place in his mind beside that of dawn of running water and of the earliest violets and lilacs  it is the property of things seen for the first time or for the first time after long like the flowers in spring to reawaken in us the sharp edge of sense and that impression of mystic strangeness which otherwise passes out of life with the coming of years but the sight of a loved face is what renews a mans character from the fountain upwards  one day after dinner will took a stroll among the firs a grave beatitude possessed him from top to toe and he kept smiling to himself and the landscape as he went  the river ran between the steppingstones with a pretty wimple a bird sang loudly in the wood the hilltops looked immeasurably high and as he glanced at them from time to time seemed to contemplate his movements with a beneficent but awful curiosity  his way took him to the eminence which overlooked the plain and there he sat down upon a stone and fell into deep and pleasant thought  the plain lay abroad with its cities and silver river everything was asleep except a great eddy of birds which kept rising and falling and going round and round in the blue air  he repeated marjorys name aloud and the sound of it gratified his ear  he shut his eyes and her image sprang up before him quietly luminous and attended with good thoughts the river might run for ever the birds fly higher and higher till they touched the stars  he saw it was empty bustle after all for here without stirring a feet waiting patiently in his own narrow valley he also had attained the better sunlight  the next day will made a sort of declaration across the dinnertable while the parson was filling his pipe  miss marjory he said i never knew any one i liked so well as you  i am mostly a cold unkindly sort of man not from want of heart but out of strangeness in my way of thinking and people seem far away from me tis as if there were a circle round me which kept every one out but you i can hear the others talking and laughing but you come quite close  maybe this is disagreeable to you he asked  marjory made no answer  speak up girl said the parson  nay now returned will i wouldnt press her parson  i feel tongue tied myself who am not used to it and shes a woman and little more than a child when all is said  but for my part as far as i can understand what people mean by it i fancy i must be what they call in love  i do not wish to be held as committing myself for i may be wrong but that is how i believe things are with me  and if miss marjory should feel any otherwise on her part mayhap she would be so kind as shake her head  marjory was silent and gave no sign that she had heard  how is that parson asked will  the girl must speak replied the parson laying down his pipe  heres our neighbour who says he loves you madge  do you love him ay or no  i think i do said marjory faintly  well then thats all that could be wished cried will heartily  and he took her hand across the table and held it a moment in both of his with great satisfaction  you must marry observed the parson replacing his pipe in his mouth  is that the right thing to do think you demanded will  it is indispensable said the parson  very well replied the wooer  two or three days passed away with great delight to will although a bystander might scarce have found it out  he continued to take his meals opposite marjory and to talk with her and gaze upon her in her fathers presence but he made no attempt to see her alone nor in any other way changed his conduct towards her from what it had been since the beginning  perhaps the girl was a little disappointed and perhaps not unjustly and yet if it had been enough to be always in the thoughts of another person and so pervade and alter his whole life she might have been thoroughly contented  for she was never out of wills mind for an instant  he sat over the stream and watched the dust of the eddy and the poised fish and straining weeds he wandered out alone into the purple even with all the blackbirds piping round him in the wood he rose early in the morning and saw the sky turn from grey to gold and the light leap upon the hilltops and all the while he kept wondering if he had never seen such things before or how it was that they should look so different now  the sound of his own millwheel or of the wind among the trees confounded and charmed his heart  the most enchanting thoughts presented themselves unbidden in his mind  he was so happy that he could not sleep at night and so restless that he could hardly sit still out of her company  and yet it seemed as if he avoided her rather than sought her out  one day as he was coming home from a ramble will found marjory in the garden picking flowers and as he came up with her slackened his pace and continued walking by her side  you like flowers he said  indeed i love them dearly she replied  do you  why no said he not so much  they are a very small affair when all is done  i can fancy people caring for them greatly but not doing as you are just now  how she asked pausing and looking up at him  plucking them said he  they are a deal better off where they are and look a deal prettier if you go to that  i wish to have them for my own she answered to carry them near my heart and keep them in my room  they tempt me when they grow here they seem to say come and do something with us but once i have cut them and put them by the charm is laid and i can look at them with quite an easy heart  you wish to possess them replied will in order to think no more about them  its a bit like killing the goose with the golden eggs  its a bit like what i wished to do when i was a boy  because i had a fancy for looking out over the plain i wished to go down therewhere i couldnt look out over it any longer  was not that fine reasoning  dear dear if they only thought of it all the world would do like me and you would let your flowers alone just as i stay up here in the mountains suddenly he broke off sharp  by the lord he cried  and when she asked him what was wrong he turned the question off and walked away into the house with rather a humorous expression of face  he was silent at table and after the night hid fallen and the stars had come out overhead he walked up and down for hours in the courtyard and garden with an uneven pace  there was still a light in the window of marjorys room one little oblong patch of orange in a world of dark blue hills and silver starlight  wills mind ran a great deal on the window but his thoughts were not very loverlike  there she is in her room he thought and there are the stars overheada blessing upon both both were good influences in his life both soothed and braced him in his profound contentment with the world  and what more should he desire with either  the fat young man and his councils were so present to his mind that he threw back his head and putting his hands before his mouth shouted aloud to the populous heavens  whether from the position of his head or the sudden strain of the exertion he seemed to see a momentary shock among the stars and a diffusion of frosty light pass from one to another along the sky  at the same instant a corner of the blind was lifted and lowered again at once  he laughed a loud hoho  one and another thought will  the stars tremble and the blind goes up  why before heaven what a great magician i must be  now if i were only a fool should not i be in a pretty way  and he went off to bed chuckling to himself if i were only a fool  the next morning pretty early he saw her once more in the garden and sought her out  i have been thinking about getting married he began abruptly and after having turned it all over i have made up my mind its not worthwhile  she turned upon him for a single moment but his radiant kindly appearance would under the circumstances have disconcerted an angel and she looked down again upon the ground in silence  he could see her tremble  i hope you dont mind he went on a little taken aback  you ought not  i have turned it all over and upon my soul theres nothing in it we should never be one whit nearer than we are just now and if i am a wise man nothing like so happy  it is unnecessary to go round about with me she said  i very well remember that you refused to commit yourself and now that i see you were mistaken and in reality have never cared for me i can only feel sad that i have been so far misled  i ask your pardon said will stoutly you do not understand my meaning  as to whether i have ever loved you or not i must leave that to others  but for one thing my feeling is not changed and for another you may make it your boast that you have made my whole life and character something different from what they were  i mean what i say no less  i do not think getting married is worth while  i would rather you went on living with your father so that i could walk over and see you once or maybe twice a week as people go to church and then we should both be all the happier between whiles  thats my notion  but ill marry you if you will he added  do you know that you are insulting me she broke out  not i marjory said he if there is anything in a clear conscience not i  i offer all my hearts best affection you can take it or want it though i suspect its beyond either your power or mine to change what has once been done and set me fancyfree  ill marry you if you like but i tell you again and again its not worth while and we had best stay friends  though i am a quiet man i have noticed a heap of things in my life  trust in me and take things as i propose or if you dont like that say the word and ill marry you out of hand  there was a considerable pause and will who began to feel uneasy began to grow angry in consequence  it seems you are too proud to say your mind he said  believe me thats a pity  a clean shrift makes simple living  can a man be more downright or honourable to a woman than i have been  i have said my say and given you your choice  do you want me to marry you or will you take my friendship as i think best or have you had enough of me for good  speak out for the dear gods sake  you know your father told you a girl should speak her mind in these affairs  she seemed to recover herself at that turned without a word walked rapidly through the garden and disappeared into the house leaving will in some confusion as to the result  he walked up and down the garden whistling softly to himself  sometimes he stopped and contemplated the sky and hilltops sometimes he went down to the tail of the weir and sat there looking foolishly in the water  all this dubiety and perturbation was so foreign to his nature and the life which he had resolutely chosen for himself that he began to regret marjorys arrival  after all he thought i was as happy as a man need be  i could come down here and watch my fishes all day long if i wanted i was as settled and contented as my old mill  marjory came down to dinner looking very trim and quiet and no sooner were all three at table than she made her father a speech with her eyes fixed upon her plate but showing no other sign of embarrassment or distress  father she began mr will and i have been talking things over  we see that we have each made a mistake about our feelings and he has agreed at my request to give up all idea of marriage and be no more than my very good friend as in the past  you see there is no shadow of a quarrel and indeed i hope we shall see a great deal of him in the future for his visits will always be welcome in our house  of course father you will know best but perhaps we should do better to leave mr wills house for the present  i believe after what has passed we should hardly be agreeable inmates for some days  will who had commanded himself with difficulty from the first broke out upon this into an inarticulate noise and raised one hand with an appearance of real dismay as if he were about to interfere and contradict  but she checked him at once looking up at him with a swift glance and an angry flush upon her cheek  you will perhaps have the good grace she said to let me explain these matters for myself  will was put entirely out of countenance by her expression and the ring of her voice  he held his peace concluding that there were some things about this girl beyond his comprehension in which he was exactly right  the poor parson was quite crestfallen  he tried to prove that this was no more than a true lovers tiff which would pass off before night and when he was dislodged from that position he went on to argue that where there was no quarrel there could be no call for a separation for the good man liked both his entertainment and his host  it was curious to see how the girl managed them saying little all the time and that very quietly and yet twisting them round her finger and insensibly leading them wherever she would by feminine tact and generalship  it scarcely seemed to have been her doingit seemed as if things had merely so fallen outthat she and her father took their departure that same afternoon in a farmcart and went farther down the valley to wait until their own house was ready for them in another hamlet  but will had been observing closely and was well aware of her dexterity and resolution  when he found himself alone he had a great many curious matters to turn over in his mind  he was very sad and solitary to begin with  all the interest had gone out of his life and he might look up at the stars as long as he pleased he somehow failed to find support or consolation  and then he was in such a turmoil of spirit about marjory he had been puzzled and irritated at her behaviour and yet he could not keep himself from admiring it  he thought he recognised a fine perverse angel in that still soul which he had never hitherto suspected and though he saw it was an influence that would fit but ill with his own life of artificial calm he could not keep himself from ardently desiring to possess it  like a man who has lived among shadows and now meets the sun he was both pained and delighted  as the days went forward he passed from one extreme to another now pluming himself on the strength of his determination now despising his timid and silly caution  the former was perhaps the true thought of his heart and represented the regular tenor of the mans reflections but the latter burst forth from time to time with an unruly violence and then he would forget all consideration and go up and down his house and garden or walk among the firwoods like one who is beside himself with remorse  to equable steadyminded will this state of matters was intolerable and he determined at whatever cost to bring it to an end so one warm summer afternoon he put on his best clothes took a thorn switch in his hand and set out down the valley by the river  as soon as he had taken his determination he had regained at a bound his customary peace of heart and he enjoyed the bright weather and the variety of the scene without any admixture of alarm or unpleasant eagerness  it was nearly the same to him how the matter turned out  if she accepted him he would have to marry her this time which perhaps was all for the best if she refused him he would have done his utmost and might follow his own way in the future with an untroubled conscience  he hoped on the whole she would refuse him and then again as he saw the brown roof which sheltered her peeping through some willows at an angle of the stream he was half inclined to reverse the wish and more than half ashamed of himself for this infirmity of purpose  marjory seemed glad to see him and gave him her hand without affectation or delay  i have been thinking about this marriage he began  so have i she answered  and i respect you more and more for a very wise man  you understood me better than i understood myself and i am now quite certain that things are all for the best as they are  at the same time ventured will  you must be tired she interrupted  take a seat and let me fetch you a glass of wine  the afternoon is so warm and i wish you not to be displeased with your visit  you must come quite often once a week if you can spare the time i am always so glad to see my friends  o very well thought will to himself  it appears i was right after all  and he paid a very agreeable visit walked home again in capital spirits and gave himself no further concern about the matter  for nearly three years will and marjory continued on these terms seeing each other once or twice a week without any word of love between them and for all that time i believe will was nearly as happy as a man can be he rather stinted himself the pleasure of seeing her and he would often walk halfway over to the parsonage and then back again as if to whet his appetite  indeed there was one corner of the road whence he could see the churchspire wedged into a crevice of the valley between sloping firwoods with a triangular snatch of plain by way of background which he greatly affected as a place to sit and moralise in before returning homewards and the peasants got so much into the habit of finding him there in the twilight that they gave it the name of will o the mills corner  at the end of the three years marjory played him a sad trick by suddenly marrying somebody else  will kept his countenance bravely and merely remarked that for as little as he knew of women he had acted very prudently in not marrying her himself three years before  she plainly knew very little of her own mind and in spite of a deceptive manner was as fickle and flighty as the rest of them  he had to congratulate himself on an escape he said and would take a higher opinion of his own wisdom in consequence  but at heart he was reasonably displeased moped a good deal for a month or two and fell away in flesh to the astonishment of his servinglads  it was perhaps a year after this marriage that will was awakened late one night by the sound of a horse galloping on the road followed by precipitate knocking at the inndoor  he opened his window and saw a farm servant mounted and holding a led horse by the bridle who told him to make what haste he could and go along with him for marjory was dying and had sent urgently to fetch him to her bedside  will was no horseman and made so little speed upon the way that the poor young wife was very near her end before he arrived  but they had some minutes talk in private and he was present and wept very bitterly while she breathed her last    chapter iii  death   year after year went away into nothing with great explosions and outcries in the cities on the plain red revolt springing up and being suppressed in blood battle swaying hither and thither patient astronomers in observatory towers picking out and christening new stars plays being performed in lighted theatres people being carried into hospital on stretchers and all the usual turmoil and agitation of mens lives in crowded centres  up in wills valley only the winds and seasons made an epoch the fish hung in the swift stream the birds circled overhead the pinetops rustled underneath the stars the tall hills stood over all and will went to and fro minding his wayside inn until the snow began to thicken on his head  his heart was young and vigorous and if his pulses kept a sober time they still beat strong and steady in his wrists  he carried a ruddy stain on either cheek like a ripe apple he stooped a little but his step was still firm and his sinewy hands were reached out to all men with a friendly pressure  his face was covered with those wrinkles which are got in open air and which rightly looked at are no more than a sort of permanent sunburning such wrinkles heighten the stupidity of stupid faces but to a person like will with his clear eyes and smiling mouth only give another charm by testifying to a simple and easy life  his talk was full of wise sayings  he had a taste for other people and other people had a taste for him  when the valley was full of tourists in the season there were merry nights in wills arbour and his views which seemed whimsical to his neighbours were often enough admired by learned people out of towns and colleges indeed he had a very noble old age and grew daily better known so that his fame was heard of in the cities of the plain and young men who had been summer travellers spoke together in cafes of will o the mill and his rough philosophy  many and many an invitation you may be sure he had but nothing could tempt him from his upland valley  he would shake his head and smile over his tobaccopipe with a deal of meaning  you come too late he would answer  i am a dead man now i have lived and died already  fifty years ago you would have brought my heart into my mouth and now you do not even tempt me  but that is the object of long living that man should cease to care about life  and again there is only one difference between a long life and a good dinner that in the dinner the sweets come last  or once more when i was a boy i was a bit puzzled and hardly knew whether it was myself or the world that was curious and worth looking into  now i know it is myself and stick to that  he never showed any symptom of frailty but kept stalwart and firm to the last but they say he grew less talkative towards the end and would listen to other people by the hour in an amused and sympathetic silence only when he did speak it was more to the point and more charged with old experience  he drank a bottle of wine gladly above all at sunset on the hilltop or quite late at night under the stars in the arbour  the sight of something attractive and unatttainable seasoned his enjoyment he would say and he professed he had lived long enough to admire a candle all the more when he could compare it with a planet  one night in his seventysecond year he awoke in bed in such uneasiness of body and mind that he arose and dressed himself and went out to meditate in the arbour  it was pitch dark without a star the river was swollen and the wet woods and meadows loaded the air with perfume  it had thundered during the day and it promised more thunder for the morrow  a murky stifling night for a man of seventytwo  whether it was the weather or the wakefulness or some little touch of fever in his old limbs wills mind was besieged by tumultuous and crying memories his boyhood the night with the fat young man the death of his adopted parents the summer days with marjory and many of those small circumstances which seem nothing to another and are yet the very gist of a mans own life to himselfthings seen words heard looks misconstruedarose from their forgotten corners and usurped his attention  the dead themselves were with him not merely taking part in this thin show of memory that defiled before his brain but revisiting his bodily senses as they do in profound and vivid dreams  the fat young man leaned his elbows on the table opposite marjory came and went with an apronful of flowers between the garden and the arbour he could hear the old parson knocking out his pipe or blowing his resonant nose  the tide of his consciousness ebbed and flowed he was sometimes halfasleep and drowned in his recollections of the past and sometimes he was broad awake wondering at himself  but about the middle of the night he was startled by the voice of the dead miller calling to him out of the house as he used to do on the arrival of custom  the hallucination was so perfect that will sprang from his seat and stood listening for the summons to be repeated and as he listened he became conscious of another noise besides the brawling of the river and the ringing in his feverish ears  it was like the stir of horses and the creaking of harness as though a carriage with an impatient team had been brought up upon the road before the courtyard gate  at such an hour upon this rough and dangerous pass the supposition was no better than absurd and will dismissed it from his mind and resumed his seat upon the arbour chair and sleep closed over him again like running water  he was once again awakened by the dead millers call thinner and more spectral than before and once again he heard the noise of an equipage upon the road and so thrice and four times the same dream or the same fancy presented itself to his senses until at length smiling to himself as when one humours a nervous child he proceeded towards the gate to set his uncertainty at rest  from the arbour to the gate was no great distance and yet it took will some time it seemed as if the dead thickened around him in the court and crossed his path at every step  for first he was suddenly surprised by an overpowering sweetness of heliotropes it was as if his garden had been planted with this flower from end to end and the hot damp night had drawn forth all their perfumes in a breath  now the heliotrope had been marjorys favourite flower and since her death not one of them had ever been planted in wills ground  i must be going crazy he thought  poor marjory and her heliotropes  and with that he raised his eyes towards the window that had once been hers  if he had been bewildered before he was now almost terrified for there was a light in the room the window was an orange oblong as of yore and the corner of the blind was lifted and let fall as on the night when he stood and shouted to the stars in his perplexity  the illusion only endured an instant but it left him somewhat unmanned rubbing his eyes and staring at the outline of the house and the black night behind it  while he thus stood and it seemed as if he must have stood there quite a long time there came a renewal of the noises on the road and he turned in time to meet a stranger who was advancing to meet him across the court  there was something like the outline of a great carriage discernible on the road behind the stranger and above that a few black pinetops like so many plumes  master will asked the newcomer in brief military fashion  that same sir answered will  can i do anything to serve you  i have heard you much spoken of master will returned the other much spoken of and well  and though i have both hands full of business i wish to drink a bottle of wine with you in your arbour  before i go i shall introduce myself  will led the way to the trellis and got a lamp lighted and a bottle uncorked  he was not altogether unused to such complimentary interviews and hoped little enough from this one being schooled by many disappointments  a sort of cloud had settled on his wits and prevented him from remembering the strangeness of the hour  he moved like a person in his sleep and it seemed as if the lamp caught fire and the bottle came uncorked with the facility of thought  still he had some curiosity about the appearance of his visitor and tried in vain to turn the light into his face either he handled the lamp clumsily or there was a dimness over his eyes but he could make out little more than a shadow at table with him  he stared and stared at this shadow as he wiped out the glasses and began to feel cold and strange about the heart  the silence weighed upon him for he could hear nothing now not even the river but the drumming of his own arteries in his ears  heres to you said the stranger roughly  here is my service sir replied will sipping his wine which somehow tasted oddly  i understand you are a very positive fellow pursued the stranger  will made answer with a smile of some satisfaction and a little nod  so am i continued the other and it is the delight of my heart to tramp on peoples corns  i will have nobody positive but myself not one  i have crossed the whims in my time of kings and generals and great artists  and what would you say he went on if i had come up here on purpose to cross yours  will had it on his tongue to make a sharp rejoinder but the politeness of an old innkeeper prevailed and he held his peace and made answer with a civil gesture of the hand  i have said the stranger  and if i did not hold you in a particular esteem i should make no words about the matter  it appears you pride yourself on staying where you are  you mean to stick by your inn  now i mean you shall come for a turn with me in my barouche and before this bottles empty so you shall  that would be an odd thing to be sure replied will with a chuckle why sir i have grown here like an old oaktree the devil himself could hardly root me up and for all i perceive you are a very entertaining old gentleman i would wager you another bottle you lose your pains with me  the dimness of wills eyesight had been increasing all this while but he was somehow conscious of a sharp and chilling scrutiny which irritated and yet overmastered him  you need not think he broke out suddenly in an explosive febrile manner that startled and alarmed himself that i am a stayathome because i fear anything under god  god knows i am tired enough of it all and when the time comes for a longer journey than ever you dream of i reckon i shall find myself prepared  the stranger emptied his glass and pushed it away from him  he looked down for a little and then leaning over the table tapped will three times upon the forearm with a single finger  the time has come he said solemnly  an ugly thrill spread from the spot he touched  the tones of his voice were dull and startling and echoed strangely in wills heart  i beg your pardon he said with some discomposure  what do you mean  look at me and you will find your eyesight swim  raise your hand it is deadheavy  this is your last bottle of wine master will and your last night upon the earth  you are a doctor quavered will  the best that ever was replied the other for i cure both mind and body with the same prescription  i take away all plain and i forgive all sins and where my patients have gone wrong in life i smooth out all complications and set them free again upon their feet  i have no need of you said will  a time comes for all men master will replied the doctor when the helm is taken out of their hands  for you because you were prudent and quiet it has been long of coming and you have had long to discipline yourself for its reception  you have seen what is to be seen about your mill you have sat close all your days like a hare in its form but now that is at an end and added the doctor getting on his feet you must arise and come with me  you are a strange physician said will looking steadfastly upon his guest  i am a natural law he replied and people call me death  why did you not tell me so at first cried will  i have been waiting for you these many years  give me your hand and welcome  lean upon my arm said the stranger for already your strength abates lean on me as heavily as you need for though i am old i am very strong it is but three steps to my carriage and there all your trouble ends why will he added i have been yearning for you as if you were my own son and of all the men that ever i came for in my long days i have come for you most gladly  i am caustic and sometimes offend people at first sight but i am a good friend at heart to such as you  since marjory was taken returned will i declare before god you were the only friend i had to look for  so the pair went arminarm across the courtyard  one of the servants awoke about this time and heard the noise of horses pawing before he dropped asleep again all down the valley that night there was a rushing as of a smooth and steady wind descending towards the plain and when the world rose next morning sure enough will o the mill had gone at last upon his travels     markheim   yes said the dealer our windfalls are of various kinds  some customers are ignorant and then i touch a dividend on my superior knowledge  some are dishonest and here he held up the candle so that the light fell strongly on his visitor and in that case he continued i profit by my virtue  markheim had but just entered from the daylight streets and his eyes had not yet grown familiar with the mingled shine and darkness in the shop at these pointed words and before the near presence of the flame he blinked painfully and looked aside  the dealer chuckled  you come to me on christmas day he resumed when you know that i am alone in my house put up my shutters and make a point of refusing business  well you will have to pay for that you will have to pay for my loss of time when i should be balancing my books you will have to pay besides for a kind of manner that i remark in you today very strongly  i am the essence of discretion and ask no awkward questions but when a customer cannot look me in the eye he has to pay for it  the dealer once more chuckled and then changing to his usual business voice though still with a note of irony you can give as usual a clear account of how you came into the possession of the object he continued  still your uncles cabinet  a remarkable collector sir  and the little pale roundshouldered dealer stood almost on tiptoe looking over the top of his gold spectacles and nodding his head with every mark of disbelief  markheim returned his gaze with one of infinite pity and a touch of horror  this time said he you are in error  i have not come to sell but to buy  i have no curios to dispose of my uncles cabinet is bare to the wainscot even were it still intact i have done well on the stock exchange and should more likely add to it than otherwise and my errand today is simplicity itself  i seek a christmas present for a lady he continued waxing more fluent as he struck into the speech he had prepared and certainly i owe you every excuse for thus disturbing you upon so small a matter  but the thing was neglected yesterday i must produce my little compliment at dinner and as you very well know a rich marriage is not a thing to be neglected  there followed a pause during which the dealer seemed to weigh this statement incredulously  the ticking of many clocks among the curious lumber of the shop and the faint rushing of the cabs in a near thoroughfare filled up the interval of silence  well sir said the dealer be it so  you are an old customer after all and if as you say you have the chance of a good marriage far be it from me to be an obstacle  here is a nice thing for a lady now he went on this hand glassfifteenth century warranted comes from a good collection too but i reserve the name in the interests of my customer who was just like yourself my dear sir the nephew and sole heir of a remarkable collector  the dealer while he thus ran on in his dry and biting voice had stooped to take the object from its place and as he had done so a shock had passed through markheim a start both of hand and foot a sudden leap of many tumultuous passions to the face  it passed as swiftly as it came and left no trace beyond a certain trembling of the hand that now received the glass  a glass he said hoarsely and then paused and repeated it more clearly  a glass  for christmas  surely not  and why not cried the dealer  why not a glass  markheim was looking upon him with an indefinable expression  you ask me why not he said  why look herelook in itlook at yourself  do you like to see it  no nor inor any man  the little man had jumped back when markheim had so suddenly confronted him with the mirror but now perceiving there was nothing worse on hand he chuckled  your future lady sir must be pretty hard favoured said he  i ask you said markheim for a christmas present and you give me thisthis damned reminder of years and sins and folliesthis handconscience  did you mean it  had you a thought in your mind  tell me  it will be better for you if you do  come tell me about yourself i hazard a guess now that you are in secret a very charitable man  the dealer looked closely at his companion  it was very odd markheim did not appear to be laughing there was something in his face like an eager sparkle of hope but nothing of mirth  what are you driving at the dealer asked  not charitable returned the other gloomily  not charitable not pious not scrupulous unloving unbeloved a hand to get money a safe to keep it  is that all  dear god man is that all  i will tell you what it is began the dealer with some sharpness and then broke off again into a chuckle  but i see this is a love match of yours and you have been drinking the ladys health  ah cried markheim with a strange curiosity  ah have you been in love  tell me about that  i cried the dealer  i in love  i never had the time nor have i the time today for all this nonsense  will you take the glass  where is the hurry returned markheim  it is very pleasant to stand here talking and life is so short and insecure that i would not hurry away from any pleasureno not even from so mild a one as this  we should rather cling cling to what little we can get like a man at a cliffs edge  every second is a cliff if you think upon ita cliff a mile highhigh enough if we fall to dash us out of every feature of humanity  hence it is best to talk pleasantly  let us talk of each other why should we wear this mask  let us be confidential  who knows we might become friends  i have just one word to say to you said the dealer  either make your purchase or walk out of my shop  true true said markheim  enough fooling  to business  show me something else  the dealer stooped once more this time to replace the glass upon the shelf his thin blond hair falling over his eyes as he did so  markheim moved a little nearer with one hand in the pocket of his greatcoat he drew himself up and filled his lungs at the same time many different emotions were depicted together on his faceterror horror and resolve fascination and a physical repulsion and through a haggard lift of his upper lip his teeth looked out  this perhaps may suit observed the dealer and then as he began to rearise markheim bounded from behind upon his victim  the long skewerlike dagger flashed and fell  the dealer struggled like a hen striking his temple on the shelf and then tumbled on the floor in a heap  time had some score of small voices in that shop some stately and slow as was becoming to their great age others garrulous and hurried  all these told out the seconds in an intricate chorus of tickings  then the passage of a lads feet heavily running on the pavement broke in upon these smaller voices and startled markheim into the consciousness of his surroundings  he looked about him awfully  the candle stood on the counter its flame solemnly wagging in a draught and by that inconsiderable movement the whole room was filled with noiseless bustle and kept heaving like a sea the tall shadows nodding the gross blots of darkness swelling and dwindling as with respiration the faces of the portraits and the china gods changing and wavering like images in water the inner door stood ajar and peered into that leaguer of shadows with a long slit of daylight like a pointing finger  from these fearstricken rovings markheims eyes returned to the body of his victim where it lay both humped and sprawling incredibly small and strangely meaner than in life  in these poor miserly clothes in that ungainly attitude the dealer lay like so much sawdust  markheim had feared to see it and lo it was nothing  and yet as he gazed this bundle of old clothes and pool of blood began to find eloquent voices there it must lie there was none to work the cunning hinges or direct the miracle of locomotionthere it must lie till it was found  found ay and then  then would this dead flesh lift up a cry that would ring over england and fill the world with the echoes of pursuit  ay dead or not this was still the enemy  time was that when the brains were out he thought and the first word struck into his mind  time now that the deed was accomplishedtime which had closed for the victim had become instant and momentous for the slayer  the thought was yet in his mind when first one and then another with every variety of pace and voiceone deep as the bell from a cathedral turret another ringing on its treble notes the prelude of a waltzthe clocks began to strike the hour of three in the afternoon  the sudden outbreak of so many tongues in that dumb chamber staggered him  he began to bestir himself going to and fro with the candle beleaguered by moving shadows and startled to the soul by chance reflections  in many rich mirrors some of home design some from venice or amsterdam he saw his face repeated and repeated as it were an army of spies his own eyes met and detected him and the sound of his own steps lightly as they fell vexed the surrounding quiet  and still as he continued to fill his pockets his mind accused him with a sickening iteration of the thousand faults of his design  he should have chosen a more quiet hour he should have prepared an alibi he should not have used a knife he should have been more cautious and only bound and gagged the dealer and not killed him he should have been more bold and killed the servant also he should have done all things otherwise poignant regrets weary incessant toiling of the mind to change what was unchangeable to plan what was now useless to be the architect of the irrevocable past  meanwhile and behind all this activity brute terrors like the scurrying of rats in a deserted attic filled the more remote chambers of his brain with riot the hand of the constable would fall heavy on his shoulder and his nerves would jerk like a hooked fish or he beheld in galloping defile the dock the prison the gallows and the black coffin  terror of the people in the street sat down before his mind like a besieging army  it was impossible he thought but that some rumour of the struggle must have reached their ears and set on edge their curiosity and now in all the neighbouring houses he divined them sitting motionless and with uplifted earsolitary people condemned to spend christmas dwelling alone on memories of the past and now startingly recalled from that tender exercise happy family parties struck into silence round the table the mother still with raised finger every degree and age and humour but all by their own hearths prying and hearkening and weaving the rope that was to hang him  sometimes it seemed to him he could not move too softly the clink of the tall bohemian goblets rang out loudly like a bell and alarmed by the bigness of the ticking he was tempted to stop the clocks  and then again with a swift transition of his terrors the very silence of the place appeared a source of peril and a thing to strike and freeze the passerby and he would step more boldly and bustle aloud among the contents of the shop and imitate with elaborate bravado the movements of a busy man at ease in his own house  but he was now so pulled about by different alarms that while one portion of his mind was still alert and cunning another trembled on the brink of lunacy  one hallucination in particular took a strong hold on his credulity  the neighbour hearkening with white face beside his window the passerby arrested by a horrible surmise on the pavementthese could at worst suspect they could not know through the brick walls and shuttered windows only sounds could penetrate  but here within the house was he alone  he knew he was he had watched the servant set forth sweethearting in her poor best out for the day written in every ribbon and smile  yes he was alone of course and yet in the bulk of empty house above him he could surely hear a stir of delicate footinghe was surely conscious inexplicably conscious of some presence  ay surely to every room and corner of the house his imagination followed it and now it was a faceless thing and yet had eyes to see with and again it was a shadow of himself and yet again behold the image of the dead dealer reinspired with cunning and hatred  at times with a strong effort he would glance at the open door which still seemed to repel his eyes  the house was tall the skylight small and dirty the day blind with fog and the light that filtered down to the ground story was exceedingly faint and showed dimly on the threshold of the shop  and yet in that strip of doubtful brightness did there not hang wavering a shadow  suddenly from the street outside a very jovial gentleman began to beat with a staff on the shopdoor accompanying his blows with shouts and railleries in which the dealer was continually called upon by name markheim smitten into ice glanced at the dead man  but no he lay quite still he was fled away far beyond earshot of these blows and shoutings he was sunk beneath seas of silence and his name which would once have caught his notice above the howling of a storm had become an empty sound  and presently the jovial gentleman desisted from his knocking and departed  here was a broad hint to hurry what remained to be done to get forth from this accusing neighbourhood to plunge into a bath of london multitudes and to reach on the other side of day that haven of safety and apparent innocencehis bed  one visitor had come at any moment another might follow and be more obstinate  to have done the deed and yet not to reap the profit would be too abhorrent a failure  the money that was now markheims concern and as a means to that the keys  he glanced over his shoulder at the open door where the shadow was still lingering and shivering and with no conscious repugnance of the mind yet with a tremor of the belly he drew near the body of his victim  the human character had quite departed  like a suit halfstuffed with bran the limbs lay scattered the trunk doubled on the floor and yet the thing repelled him  although so dingy and inconsiderable to the eye he feared it might have more significance to the touch  he took the body by the shoulders and turned it on its back  it was strangely light and supple and the limbs as if they had been broken fell into the oddest postures  the face was robbed of all expression but it was as pale as wax and shockingly smeared with blood about one temple  that was for markheim the one displeasing circumstance  it carried him back upon the instant to a certain fairday in a fishers village a gray day a piping wind a crowd upon the street the blare of brasses the booming of drums the nasal voice of a ballad singer and a boy going to and fro buried over head in the crowd and divided between interest and fear until coming out upon the chief place of concourse he beheld a booth and a great screen with pictures dismally designed garishly coloured brownrigg with her apprentice the mannings with their murdered guest weare in the deathgrip of thurtell and a score besides of famous crimes  the thing was as clear as an illusion he was once again that little boy he was looking once again and with the same sense of physical revolt at these vile pictures he was still stunned by the thumping of the drums  a bar of that days music returned upon his memory and at that for the first time a qualm came over him a breath of nausea a sudden weakness of the joints which he must instantly resist and conquer  he judged it more prudent to confront than to flee from these considerations looking the more hardily in the dead face bending his mind to realise the nature and greatness of his crime  so little a while ago that face had moved with every change of sentiment that pale mouth had spoken that body had been all on fire with governable energies and now and by his act that piece of life had been arrested as the horologist with interjected finger arrests the beating of the clock  so he reasoned in vain he could rise to no more remorseful consciousness the same heart which had shuddered before the painted effigies of crime looked on its reality unmoved  at best he felt a gleam of pity for one who had been endowed in vain with all those faculties that can make the world a garden of enchantment one who had never lived and who was now dead  but of penitence no not a tremor  with that shaking himself clear of these considerations he found the keys and advanced towards the open door of the shop  outside it had begun to rain smartly and the sound of the shower upon the roof had banished silence  like some dripping cavern the chambers of the house were haunted by an incessant echoing which filled the ear and mingled with the ticking of the clocks  and as markheim approached the door he seemed to hear in answer to his own cautious tread the steps of another foot withdrawing up the stair  the shadow still palpitated loosely on the threshold  he threw a tons weight of resolve upon his muscles and drew back the door  the faint foggy daylight glimmered dimly on the bare floor and stairs on the bright suit of armour posted halbert in hand upon the landing and on the dark woodcarvings and framed pictures that hung against the yellow panels of the wainscot  so loud was the beating of the rain through all the house that in markheims ears it began to be distinguished into many different sounds  footsteps and sighs the tread of regiments marching in the distance the chink of money in the counting and the creaking of doors held stealthily ajar appeared to mingle with the patter of the drops upon the cupola and the gushing of the water in the pipes  the sense that he was not alone grew upon him to the verge of madness  on every side he was haunted and begirt by presences  he heard them moving in the upper chambers from the shop he heard the dead man getting to his legs and as he began with a great effort to mount the stairs feet fled quietly before him and followed stealthily behind  if he were but deaf he thought how tranquilly he would possess his soul  and then again and hearkening with ever fresh attention he blessed himself for that unresting sense which held the outposts and stood a trusty sentinel upon his life  his head turned continually on his neck his eyes which seemed starting from their orbits scouted on every side and on every side were halfrewarded as with the tail of something nameless vanishing  the fourandtwenty steps to the first floor were fourandtwenty agonies  on that first storey the doors stood ajar three of them like three ambushes shaking his nerves like the throats of cannon  he could never again he felt be sufficiently immured and fortified from mens observing eyes he longed to be home girt in by walls buried among bedclothes and invisible to all but god  and at that thought he wondered a little recollecting tales of other murderers and the fear they were said to entertain of heavenly avengers  it was not so at least with him  he feared the laws of nature lest in their callous and immutable procedure they should preserve some damning evidence of his crime  he feared tenfold more with a slavish superstitions terror some scission in the continuity of mans experience some wilful illegality of nature  he played a game of skill depending on the rules calculating consequence from cause and what if nature as the defeated tyrant overthrew the chessboard should break the mould of their succession  the like had befallen napoleon so writers said when the winter changed the time of its appearance  the like might befall markheim the solid walls might become transparent and reveal his doings like those of bees in a glass hive the stout planks might yield under his foot like quicksands and detain him in their clutch ay and there were soberer accidents that might destroy him if for instance the house should fall and imprison him beside the body of his victim or the house next door should fly on fire and the firemen invade him from all sides  these things he feared and in a sense these things might be called the hands of god reached forth against sin  but about god himself he was at ease his act was doubtless exceptional but so were his excuses which god knew it was there and not among men that he felt sure of justice  when he had got safe into the drawingroom and shut the door behind him he was aware of a respite from alarms  the room was quite dismantled uncarpeted besides and strewn with packing cases and incongruous furniture several great pierglasses in which he beheld himself at various angles like an actor on a stage many pictures framed and unframed standing with their faces to the wall a fine sheraton sideboard a cabinet of marquetry and a great old bed with tapestry hangings  the windows opened to the floor but by great good fortune the lower part of the shutters had been closed and this concealed him from the neighbours  here then markheim drew in a packing case before the cabinet and began to search among the keys  it was a long business for there were many and it was irksome besides for after all there might be nothing in the cabinet and time was on the wing  but the closeness of the occupation sobered him  with the tail of his eye he saw the dooreven glanced at it from time to time directly like a besieged commander pleased to verify the good estate of his defences  but in truth he was at peace  the rain falling in the street sounded natural and pleasant  presently on the other side the notes of a piano were wakened to the music of a hymn and the voices of many children took up the air and words  how stately how comfortable was the melody  how fresh the youthful voices  markheim gave ear to it smilingly as he sorted out the keys and his mind was thronged with answerable ideas and images churchgoing children and the pealing of the high organ children afield bathers by the brookside ramblers on the brambly common kite flyers in the windy and cloudnavigated sky and then at another cadence of the hymn back again to church and the somnolence of summer sundays and the high genteel voice of the parson which he smiled a little to recall and the painted jacobean tombs and the dim lettering of the ten commandments in the chancel  and as he sat thus at once busy and absent he was startled to his feet a flash of ice a flash of fire a bursting gush of blood went over him and then he stood transfixed and thrilling  a step mounted the stair slowly and steadily and presently a hand was laid upon the knob and the lock clicked and the door opened  fear held markheim in a vice  what to expect he knew not whether the dead man walking or the official ministers of human justice or some chance witness blindly stumbling in to consign him to the gallows  but when a face was thrust into the aperture glanced round the room looked at him nodded and smiled as if in friendly recognition and then withdrew again and the door closed behind it his fear broke loose from his control in a hoarse cry  at the sound of this the visitant returned  did you call me he asked pleasantly and with that he entered the room and closed the door behind him  markheim stood and gazed at him with all his eyes  perhaps there was a film upon his sight but the outlines of the new comer seemed to change and waver like those of the idols in the wavering candlelight of the shop and at times he thought he knew him and at times he thought he bore a likeness to himself and always like a lump of living terror there lay in his bosom the conviction that this thing was not of the earth and not of god  and yet the creature had a strange air of the commonplace as he stood looking on markheim with a smile and when he added you are looking for the money i believe it was in the tones of everyday politeness  markheim made no answer  i should warn you resumed the other that the maid has left her sweetheart earlier than usual and will soon be here  if mr markheim be found in this house i need not describe to him the consequences  you know me cried the murderer  the visitor smiled  you have long been a favourite of mine he said and i have long observed and often sought to help you  what are you cried markheim the devil  what i may be returned the other cannot affect the service i propose to render you  it can cried markheim it does  be helped by you  no never not by you  you do not know me yet thank god you do not know me  i know you replied the visitant with a sort of kind severity or rather firmness  i know you to the soul  know me cried markheim  who can do so  my life is but a travesty and slander on myself  i have lived to belie my nature  all men do all men are better than this disguise that grows about and stifles them  you see each dragged away by life like one whom bravos have seized and muffled in a cloak  if they had their own controlif you could see their faces they would be altogether different they would shine out for heroes and saints  i am worse than most myself is more overlaid my excuse is known to me and god  but had i the time i could disclose myself  to me inquired the visitant  to you before all returned the murderer  i supposed you were intelligent  i thoughtsince you existyou would prove a reader of the heart  and yet you would propose to judge me by my acts  think of it my acts  i was born and i have lived in a land of giants giants have dragged me by the wrists since i was born out of my motherthe giants of circumstance  and you would judge me by my acts  but can you not look within  can you not understand that evil is hateful to me  can you not see within me the clear writing of conscience never blurred by any wilful sophistry although too often disregarded  can you not read me for a thing that surely must be common as humanitythe unwilling sinner  all this is very feelingly expressed was the reply but it regards me not  these points of consistency are beyond my province and i care not in the least by what compulsion you may have been dragged away so as you are but carried in the right direction  but time flies the servant delays looking in the faces of the crowd and at the pictures on the hoardings but still she keeps moving nearer and remember it is as if the gallows itself was striding towards you through the christmas streets  shall i help you i who know all  shall i tell you where to find the money  for what price asked markheim  i offer you the service for a christmas gift returned the other  markheim could not refrain from smiling with a kind of bitter triumph no said he i will take nothing at your hands if i were dying of thirst and it was your hand that put the pitcher to my lips i should find the courage to refuse  it may be credulous but i will do nothing to commit myself to evil  i have no objection to a deathbed repentance observed the visitant  because you disbelieve their efficacy markheim cried  i do not say so returned the other but i look on these things from a different side and when the life is done my interest falls  the man has lived to serve me to spread black looks under colour of religion or to sow tares in the wheatfield as you do in a course of weak compliance with desire  now that he draws so near to his deliverance he can add but one act of serviceto repent to die smiling and thus to build up in confidence and hope the more timorous of my surviving followers  i am not so hard a master  try me  accept my help  please yourself in life as you have done hitherto please yourself more amply spread your elbows at the board and when the night begins to fall and the curtains to be drawn i tell you for your greater comfort that you will find it even easy to compound your quarrel with your conscience and to make a truckling peace with god  i came but now from such a deathbed and the room was full of sincere mourners listening to the mans last words and when i looked into that face which had been set as a flint against mercy i found it smiling with hope  and do you then suppose me such a creature asked markheim  do you think i have no more generous aspirations than to sin and sin and sin and at the last sneak into heaven  my heart rises at the thought  is this then your experience of mankind or is it because you find me with red hands that you presume such baseness and is this crime of murder indeed so impious as to dry up the very springs of good  murder is to me no special category replied the other  all sins are murder even as all life is war  i behold your race like starving mariners on a raft plucking crusts out of the hands of famine and feeding on each others lives  i follow sins beyond the moment of their acting i find in all that the last consequence is death and to my eyes the pretty maid who thwarts her mother with such taking graces on a question of a ball drips no less visibly with human gore than such a murderer as yourself  do i say that i follow sins  i follow virtues also they differ not by the thickness of a nail they are both scythes for the reaping angel of death  evil for which i live consists not in action but in character  the bad man is dear to me not the bad act whose fruits if we could follow them far enough down the hurtling cataract of the ages might yet be found more blessed than those of the rarest virtues  and it is not because you have killed a dealer but because you are markheim that i offer to forward your escape  i will lay my heart open to you answered markheim  this crime on which you find me is my last  on my way to it i have learned many lessons itself is a lesson a momentous lesson  hitherto i have been driven with revolt to what i would not i was a bondslave to poverty driven and scourged  there are robust virtues that can stand in these temptations mine was not so i had a thirst of pleasure  but today and out of this deed i pluck both warning and richesboth the power and a fresh resolve to be myself  i become in all things a free actor in the world i begin to see myself all changed these hands the agents of good this heart at peace  something comes over me out of the past something of what i have dreamed on sabbath evenings to the sound of the church organ of what i forecast when i shed tears over noble books or talked an innocent child with my mother  there lies my life i have wandered a few years but now i see once more my city of destination  you are to use this money on the stock exchange i think remarked the visitor and there if i mistake not you have already lost some thousands  ah said markheim but this time i have a sure thing  this time again you will lose replied the visitor quietly  ah but i keep back the half cried markheim  that also you will lose said the other  the sweat started upon markheims brow  well then what matter he exclaimed  say it be lost say i am plunged again in poverty shall one part of me and that the worse continue until the end to override the better  evil and good run strong in me haling me both ways  i do not love the one thing i love all  i can conceive great deeds renunciations martyrdoms and though i be fallen to such a crime as murder pity is no stranger to my thoughts  i pity the poor who knows their trials better than myself  i pity and help them i prize love i love honest laughter there is no good thing nor true thing on earth but i love it from my heart  and are my vices only to direct my life and my virtues to lie without effect like some passive lumber of the mind  not so good also is a spring of acts  but the visitant raised his finger  for sixandthirty years that you have been in this world said be through many changes of fortune and varieties of humour i have watched you steadily fall  fifteen years ago you would have started at a theft  three years back you would have blenched at the name of murder  is there any crime is there any cruelty or meanness from which you still recoilfive years from now i shall detect you in the fact  downward downward lies your way nor can anything but death avail to stop you  it is true markheim said huskily i have in some degree complied with evil  but it is so with all the very saints in the mere exercise of living grow less dainty and take on the tone of their surroundings  i will propound to you one simple question said the other and as you answer i shall read to you your moral horoscope  you have grown in many things more lax possibly you do right to be soand at any account it is the same with all men  but granting that are you in any one particular however trifling more difficult to please with your own conduct or do you go in all things with a looser rein  in any one repeated markheim with an anguish of consideration  no he added with despair in none  i have gone down in all  then said the visitor content yourself with what you are for you will never change and the words of your part on this stage are irrevocably written down  markheim stood for a long while silent and indeed it was the visitor who first broke the silence  that being so he said shall i show you the money  and grace cried markheim  have you not tried it returned the other  two or three years ago did i not see you on the platform of revival meetings and was not your voice the loudest in the hymn  it is true said markheim and i see clearly what remains for me by way of duty  i thank you for these lessons from my soul my eyes are opened and i behold myself at last for what i am  at this moment the sharp note of the doorbell rang through the house and the visitant as though this were some concerted signal for which he had been waiting changed at once in his demeanour  the maid he cried  she has returned as i forewarned you and there is now before you one more difficult passage  her master you must say is ill you must let her in with an assured but rather serious countenanceno smiles no overacting and i promise you success  once the girl within and the door closed the same dexterity that has already rid you of the dealer will relieve you of this last danger in your path thenceforward you have the whole eveningthe whole night if needfulto ransack the treasures of the house and to make good your safety  this is help that comes to you with the mask of danger  up he cried up friend your life hangs trembling in the scales up and act  markheim steadily regarded his counsellor  if i be condemned to evil acts he said there is still one door of freedom openi can cease from action  if my life be an ill thing i can lay it down  though i be as you say truly at the beck of every small temptation i can yet by one decisive gesture place myself beyond the reach of all  my love of good is damned to barrenness it may and let it be  but i have still my hatred of evil and from that to your galling disappointment you shall see that i can draw both energy and courage  the features of the visitor began to undergo a wonderful and lovely change they brightened and softened with a tender triumph and even as they brightened faded and dislimned  but markheim did not pause to watch or understand the transformation  he opened the door and went downstairs very slowly thinking to himself  his past went soberly before him he beheld it as it was ugly and strenuous like a dream random as chancemedleya scene of defeat  life as he thus reviewed it tempted him no longer but on the further side he perceived a quiet haven for his bark  he paused in the passage and looked into the shop where the candle still burned by the dead body  it was strangely silent thoughts of the dealer swarmed into his mind as he stood gazing  and then the bell once more broke out into impatient clamour  he confronted the maid upon the threshold with something like a smile  you had better go for the police said he i have killed your master     thrawn janet   the reverend murdoch soulis was long minister of the moorland parish of balweary in the vale of dule  a severe bleakfaced old man dreadful to his hearers he dwelt in the last years of his life without relative or servant or any human company in the small and lonely manse under the hanging shaw  in spite of the iron composure of his features his eye was wild scared and uncertain and when he dwelt in private admonitions on the future of the impenitent it seemed as if his eye pierced through the storms of time to the terrors of eternity  many young persons coming to prepare themselves against the season of the holy communion were dreadfully affected by his talk  he had a sermon on lst peter v and 8th the devil as a roaring lion on the sunday after every seventeenth of august and he was accustomed to surpass himself upon that text both by the appalling nature of the matter and the terror of his bearing in the pulpit  the children were frightened into fits and the old looked more than usually oracular and were all that day full of those hints that hamlet deprecated  the manse itself where it stood by the water of dule among some thick trees with the shaw overhanging it on the one side and on the other many cold moorish hilltops rising towards the sky had begun at a very early period of mr souliss ministry to be avoided in the dusk hours by all who valued themselves upon their prudence and guidmen sitting at the clachan alehouse shook their heads together at the thought of passing late by that uncanny neighbourhood  there was one spot to be more particular which was regarded with especial awe  the manse stood between the high road and the water of dule with a gable to each its back was towards the kirktown of balweary nearly half a mile away in front of it a bare garden hedged with thorn occupied the land between the river and the road  the house was two stories high with two large rooms on each it opened not directly on the garden but on a causewayed path or passage giving on the road on the one hand and closed on the other by the tall willows and elders that bordered on the stream  and it was this strip of causeway that enjoyed among the young parishioners of balweary so infamous a reputation  the minister walked there often after dark sometimes groaning aloud in the instancy of his unspoken prayers and when he was from home and the manse door was locked the more daring schoolboys ventured with beating hearts to follow my leader across that legendary spot  this atmosphere of terror surrounding as it did a man of god of spotless character and orthodoxy was a common cause of wonder and subject of inquiry among the few strangers who were led by chance or business into that unknown outlying country  but many even of the people of the parish were ignorant of the strange events which had marked the first year of mr souliss ministrations and among those who were better informed some were naturally reticent and others shy of that particular topic  now and again only one of the older folk would warm into courage over his third tumbler and recount the cause of the ministers strange looks and solitary life        fifty years syne when mr soulis cam first into baweary he was still a young mana callant the folk saidfu o book learnin and grand at the exposition but as was natural in sae young a man wi nae leevin experience in religion  the younger sort were greatly taken wi his gifts and his gab but auld concerned serious men and women were moved even to prayer for the young man whom they took to be a selfdeceiver and the parish that was like to be sae illsupplied  it was before the days o the moderatesweary fa them but ill things are like guidthey baith come bit by bit a pickle at a time and there were folk even then that said the lord had left the college professors to their ain devices an the lads that went to study wi them wad hae done mair and better sittin in a peatbog like their forbears of the persecution wi a bible under their oxter and a speerit o prayer in their heart  there was nae doubt onyway but that mr soulis had been ower lang at the college  he was careful and troubled for mony things besides the ae thing needful  he had a feck o books wi himmair than had ever been seen before in a that presbytery and a sair wark the carrier had wi them for they were a like to have smoored in the deils hag between this and kilmackerlie  they were books o divinity to be sure or so they cad them but the serious were o opinion there was little service for sae mony when the hail o gods word would gang in the neuk of a plaid  then he wad sit half the day and half the nicht forbye which was scant decentwritin nae less and first they were feared he wad read his sermons and syne it proved he was writin a book himsel which was surely no fittin for ane of his years an sma experience  onyway it behoved him to get an auld decent wife to keep the manse for him an see to his bit denners and he was recommended to an auld limmerjanet mclour they cad herand sae far left to himsel as to be ower persuaded  there was mony advised him to the contrar for janet was mair than suspeckit by the best folk in baweary  lang or that she had had a wean to a dragoon she hadnae come forrit 140 for maybe thretty year and bairns had seen her mumblin to hersel up on keys loan in the gloamin whilk was an unco time an place for a godfearin woman  howsoever it was the laird himsel that had first tauld the minister o janet and in thae days he wad have gane a far gate to pleesure the laird  when folk tauld him that janet was sib to the deil it was a superstition by his way of it an when they cast up the bible to him an the witch of endor he wad threep it doun their thrapples that thir days were a gane by and the deil was mercifully restrained  weel when it got about the clachan that janet mclour was to be servant at the manse the folk were fair mad wi her an him thegether and some o the guidwives had nae better to dae than get round her door cheeks and chairge her wi a that was kent again her frae the sodgers bairn to john tamsons twa kye  she was nae great speaker folk usually let her gang her ain gate an she let them gang theirs wi neither fairguid een nor fairguidday but when she buckled to she had a tongue to deave the miller  up she got an there wasnae an auld story in baweary but she gart somebody lowp for it that day they couldnae say ae thing but she could say twa to it till at the hinder end the guidwives up and claught haud of her and clawed the coats aff her back and pud her doun the clachan to the water o dule to see if she were a witch or no soum or droun  the carline skirled till ye could hear her at the hangin shaw and she focht like ten there was mony a guidwife bure the mark of her neist day an mony a lang day after and just in the hettest o the collieshangie wha suld come up for his sins but the new minister  women said he and he had a grand voice i charge you in the lords name to let her go  janet ran to himshe was fair wud wi terroran clang to him an prayed him for christs sake save her frae the cummers an they for their pairt tauld him a that was kent and maybe mair  woman says he to janet is this true  as the lord sees me says she as the lord made me no a word ot forbye the bairn says she ive been a decent woman a my days  will you says mr soulis in the name of god and before me his unworthy minister renounce the devil and his works  weel it wad appear that when he askit that she gave a girn that fairly frichtit them that saw her an they could hear her teeth play dirl thegether in her chafts but there was naething for it but the ae way or the ither an janet lifted up her hand and renounced the deil before them a  and now says mr soulis to the guidwives home with ye one and all and pray to god for his forgiveness  and he gied janet his arm though she had little on her but a sark and took her up the clachan to her ain door like a leddy of the land an her scrieghin and laughin as was a scandal to be heard  there were mony grave folk lang ower their prayers that nicht but when the morn cam there was sic a fear fell upon a baweary that the bairns hid theirsels and even the men folk stood and keekit frae their doors for there was janet comin doun the clachanher or her likeness nane could tellwi her neck thrawn and her heid on ae side like a body that has been hangit and a girn on her face like an unstreakit corp  by an by they got used wi it and even speered at her to ken what was wrang but frae that day forth she couldnae speak like a christian woman but slavered and played click wi her teeth like a pair o shears and frae that day forth the name o god cam never on her lips  whiles she wad try to say it but it michtnae be  them that kenned best said least but they never gied that thing the name o janet mclour for the auld janet by their way ot was in muckle hell that day  but the minister was neither to haud nor to bind he preached about naething but the folks cruelty that had gien her a stroke of the palsy he skelpt the bairns that meddled her and he had her up to the manse that same nicht and dwalled there a his lane wi her under the hangin shaw  weel time gaed by and the idler sort commenced to think mair lichtly o that black business  the minister was weel thocht o he was aye late at the writing folk wad see his canle doon by the dule water after twal at een and he seemed pleased wi himsel and upsitten as at first though a body could see that he was dwining  as for janet she cam an she gaed if she didnae speak muckle afore it was reason she should speak less then she meddled naebody but she was an eldritch thing to see an nane wad hae mistrysted wi her for baweary glebe  about the end o july there cam a spell o weather the like ot never was in that country side it was lown an het an heartless the herds couldnae win up the black hill the bairns were ower weariet to play an yet it was gousty too wi claps o het wund that rummled in the glens and bits o shouers that slockened naething  we aye thocht it but to thuner on the morn but the morn cam an the morns morning and it was aye the same uncanny weather sair on folks and bestial  of a that were the waur nane suffered like mr soulis he could neither sleep nor eat he tauld his elders an when he wasnae writin at his weary book he wad be stravaguin ower a the countryside like a man possessed when a body else was blythe to keep caller ben the house  abune hangin shaw in the bield o the black hill theres a bit enclosed grund wi an iron yett and it seems in the auld days that was the kirkyaird o baweary and consecrated by the papists before the blessed licht shone upon the kingdom  it was a great howff o mr souliss onyway there he would sit an consider his sermons and indeed its a bieldy bit  weel as he cam ower the wast end o the black hill ae day he saw first twa an syne fower an syne seeven corbie craws fleein round an round abune the auld kirkyaird  they flew laigh and heavy an squawked to ither as they gaed and it was clear to mr soulis that something had put them frae their ordinar  he wasnae easy fleyed an gaed straucht up to the was an what suld he find there but a man or the appearance of a man sittin in the inside upon a grave  he was of a great stature an black as hell and his een were singular to see 144  mr soulis had heard tell o black men monys the time but there was something unco about this black man that daunted him  het as he was he took a kind o cauld grue in the marrow o his banes but up he spak for a that an says he my friend are you a stranger in this place the black man answered never a word he got upon his feet an begude to hirsle to the wa on the far side but he aye lookit at the minister an the minister stood an lookit back till a in a meenute the black man was ower the wa an rinnin for the bield o the trees  mr soulis he hardly kenned why ran after him but he was sair forjaskit wi his walk an the het unhalesome weather and rin as he likit he got nae mair than a glisk o the black man amang the birks till he won doun to the foot o the hillside an there he saw him ance mair gaun hap step an lowp ower dule water to the manse  mr soulis wasnae weel pleased that this fearsome gangrel suld mak sae free wi baweary manse an he ran the harder an wet shoon ower the burn an up the walk but the deil a black man was there to see  he stepped out upon the road but there was naebody there he gaed a ower the gairden but na nae black man  at the hinder end and a bit feared as was but natural he lifted the hasp and into the manse and there was janet mclour before his een wi her thrawn craig and nane sae pleased to see him  and he aye minded sinsyne when first he set his een upon her he had the same cauld and deidly grue  janet says he have you seen a black man  a black man quo she  save us a  yere no wise minister  theres nae black man in a baweary  but she didnae speak plain ye maun understand but yamyammered like a powney wi the bit in its moo  weel says he janet if there was nae black man i have spoken with the accuser of the brethren  and he sat down like ane wi a fever an his teeth chittered in his heid  hoots says she think shame to yoursel minister an gied him a drap brandy that she keept aye by her  syne mr soulis gaed into his study amang a his books  its a lang laigh mirk chalmer perishin cauld in winter an no very dry even in the tap o the simmer for the manse stands near the burn  sae doun he sat and thocht of a that had come an gane since he was in baweary an his hame an the days when he was a bairn an ran daffin on the braes and that black man aye ran in his heid like the owercome of a sang  aye the mair he thocht the mair he thocht o the black man  he tried the prayer an the words wouldnae come to him an he tried they say to write at his book but he could nae mak nae mair o that  there was whiles he thocht the black man was at his oxter an the swat stood upon him cauld as wellwater and there was other whiles when he cam to himsel like a christened bairn and minded naething  the upshot was that he gaed to the window an stood glowrin at dule water  the trees are unco thick an the water lies deep an black under the manse an there was janct washin the claes wi her coats kilted she had her back to the minister an he for his pairt hardly kenned what he was lookin at  syne she turned round an shawed her face mr soulis had the same cauld grue as twice that day afore an it was borne in upon him what folk said that janet was deid lang syne an this was a bogle in her claycauld flesh  he drew back a pickle and he scanned her narrowly  she was tramptrampin in the claes croonin to hersel and eh  gude guide us but it was a fearsome face  whiles she sang louder but there was nae man born o woman that could tell the words o her sang an whiles she lookit sidelang doun but there was naething there for her to look at  there gaed a scunner through the flesh upon his banes and that was heevens advertisement  but mr soulis just blamed himsel he said to think sae ill of a puir auld afflicted wife that hadnae a freend forbye himsel an he put up a bit prayer for him and her an drank a little caller waterfor his heart rose again the meatan gaed up to his naked bed in the gloaming  that was a nicht that has never been forgotten in baweary the nicht o the seeventeenth of august seventeen huner an twal  it had been het afore as i hae said but that nicht it was hetter than ever  the sun gaed doun amang uncolookin clouds it fell as mirk as the pit no a star no a breath o wund ye couldnae see your han afore your face and even the auld folk cuist the covers frae their beds and lay pechin for their breath  wi a that he had upon his mind it was gey and unlikely mr soulis wad get muckle sleep  he lay an he tummled the gude caller bed that he got into brunt his very banes whiles he slept and whiles he waukened whiles he heard the time o nicht and whiles a tyke yowlin up the muir as if somebody was deid whiles he thocht he heard bogles claverin in his lug an whiles he saw spunkies in the room  he behoved he judged to be sick an sick he waslittle he jaloosed the sickness  at the hinder end he got a clearness in his mind sat up in his sark on the bedside and fell thinkin ance mair o the black man an janet  he couldnae weel tell howmaybe it was the cauld to his feetbut it cam in upon him wi a spate that there was some connection between thir twa an that either or baith o them were bogles  and just at that moment in janets room which was neist to his there cam a stramp o feet as if men were warslin an then a loud bang an then a wund gaed reishling round the fower quarters of the house an then a was aince mair as seelent as the grave  mr soulis was feared for neither man nor deevil  he got his tinderbox an lit a canle an made three steps ot ower to janets door  it was on the hasp an he pushed it open an keeked bauldly in  it was a big room as big as the ministers ain an plenished wi grand auld solid gear for he had naething else  there was a fowerposted bed wi auld tapestry and a braw cabinet of aik that was fu o the ministers divinity books an put there to be out o the gate an a wheen duds o janets lying here and there about the floor  but nae janet could mr soulis see nor ony sign of a contention  in he gaed an theres few that wad hae followed him an lookit a round an listened  but there was naethin to be heard neither inside the manse nor in a baweary parish an naethin to be seen but the muckle shadows turnin round the canle  an then a at aince the ministers heart played dunt an stood stockstill an a cauld wund blew amang the hairs o his heid  whaten a weary sicht was that for the puir mans een  for there was janat hangin frae a nail beside the auld aik cabinet her heid aye lay on her shoother her een were steeked the tongue projekit frae her mouth and her heels were twa feet clear abune the floor  god forgive us all thocht mr soulis poor janets dead  he cam a step nearer to the corp an then his heart fair whammled in his inside  for by what cantrip it wad illbeseem a man to judge she was hingin frae a single nail an by a single wursted thread for darnin hose  its an awfu thing to be your lane at nicht wi siccan prodigies o darkness but mr soulis was strong in the lord  he turned an gaed his ways oot o that room and lockit the door ahint him and step by step doon the stairs as heavy as leed and set doon the canle on the table at the stairfoot  he couldnae pray he couldnae think he was dreepin wi caul swat an naething could he hear but the duntduntduntin o his ain heart  he micht maybe have stood there an hour or maybe twa he minded sae little when a o a sudden he heard a laigh uncanny steer upstairs a foot gaed to an fro in the chamer whaur the corp was hingin syne the door was opened though he minded weel that he had lockit it an syne there was a step upon the landin an it seemed to him as if the corp was lookin ower the rail and doun upon him whaur he stood  he took up the canle again for he couldnae want the licht and as saftly as ever he could gaed straucht out o the manse an to the far end o the causeway  it was aye pitmirk the flame o the canle when he set it on the grund brunt steedy and clear as in a room naething moved but the dule water seepin and sabbin doon the glen an yon unhaly footstep that cam ploddin doun the stairs inside the manse  he kenned the foot over weel for it was janets and at ilka step that cam a wee thing nearer the cauld got deeper in his vitals  he commanded his soul to him that made an keepit him and o lord said he give me strength this night to war against the powers of evil  by this time the foot was comin through the passage for the door he could hear a hand skirt alang the wa as if the fearsome thing was feelin for its way  the saughs tossed an maned thegether a lang sigh cam ower the hills the flame o the canle was blawn aboot an there stood the corp of thrawn janet wi her grogram goun an her black mutch wi the heid aye upon the shouther an the girn still upon the face otleevin ye wad hae saiddeid as mr soulis weel kennedupon the threshold o the manse  its a strange thing that the saul of man should be that thirled into his perishable body but the minister saw that an his heart didnae break  she didnae stand there lang she began to move again an cam slowly towards mr soulis whaur he stood under the saughs  a the life o his body a the strength o his speerit were glowerin frae his een  it seemed she was gaun to speak but wanted words an made a sign wi the left hand  there cam a clap o wund like a cats fuff oot gaed the canle the saughs skrieghed like folk an mr soulis kenned that live or die this was the end ot  witch beldame devil he cried i charge you by the power of god begoneif you be dead to the graveif you be damned to hell  an at that moment the lords ain hand out o the heevens struck the horror whaur it stood the auld deid desecrated corp o the witchwife sae lang keepit frae the grave and hirsled round by deils lowed up like a brunstane spunk and fell in ashes to the grund the thunder followed peal on dirling peal the rairing rain upon the back o that and mr soulis lowped through the garden hedge and ran wi skelloch upon skelloch for the clachan  that same mornin john christie saw the black man pass the muckle cairn as it was chappin six before eicht he gaed by the changehouse at knockdow an no lang after sandy mlellan saw him gaun linkin doun the braes frae kilmackerlie  theres little doubt but it was him that dwalled sae lang in janets body but he was awa at last and sinsyne the deil has never fashed us in baweary  but it was a sair dispensation for the minister lang lang he lay ravin in his bed and frae that hour to this he was the man ye ken the day     olalla   now said the doctor my part is done and i may say with some vanity well done  it remains only to get you out of this cold and poisonous city and to give you two months of a pure air and an easy conscience  the last is your affair  to the first i think i can help you  it fells indeed rather oddly it was but the other day the padre came in from the country and as he and i are old friends although of contrary professions he applied to me in a matter of distress among some of his parishioners  this was a familybut you are ignorant of spain and even the names of our grandees are hardly known to you suffice it then that they were once great people and are now fallen to the brink of destitution  nothing now belongs to them but the residencia and certain leagues of desert mountain in the greater part of which not even a goat could support life  but the house is a fine old place and stands at a great height among the hills and most salubriously and i had no sooner heard my friends tale than i remembered you  i told him i had a wounded officer wounded in the good cause who was now able to make a change and i proposed that his friends should take you for a lodger instantly the padres face grew dark as i had maliciously foreseen it would  it was out of the question he said  then let them starve said i for i have no sympathy with tatterdemalion pride  thereupon we separated not very content with one another but yesterday to my wonder the padre returned and made a submission the difficulty he said he had found upon enquiry to be less than he had feared or in other words these proud people had put their pride in their pocket  i closed with the offer and subject to your approval i have taken rooms for you in the residencia  the air of these mountains will renew your blood and the quiet in which you will there live is worth all the medicines in the world  doctor said i you have been throughout my good angel and your advice is a command  but tell me if you please something of the family with which i am to reside  i am coming to that replied my friend and indeed there is a difficulty in the way  these beggars are as i have said of very high descent and swollen with the most baseless vanity they have lived for some generations in a growing isolation drawing away on either hand from the rich who had now become too high for them and from the poor whom they still regarded as too low and even today when poverty forces them to unfasten their door to a guest they cannot do so without a most ungracious stipulation  you are to remain they say a stranger they will give you attendance but they refuse from the first the idea of the smallest intimacy  i will not deny that i was piqued and perhaps the feeling strengthened my desire to go for i was confident that i could break down that barrier if i desired  there is nothing offensive in such a stipulation said i and i even sympathise with the feeling that inspired it  it is true they have never seen you returned the doctor politely and if they knew you were the handsomest and the most pleasant man that ever came from england where i am told that handsome men are common but pleasant ones not so much so they would doubtless make you welcome with a better grace  but since you take the thing so well it matters not  to me indeed it seems discourteous  but you will find yourself the gainer  the family will not much tempt you  a mother a son and a daughter an old woman said to be halfwitted a country lout and a country girl who stands very high with her confessor and is therefore chuckled the physician most likely plain there is not much in that to attract the fancy of a dashing officer  and yet you say they are highborn i objected  well as to that i should distinguish returned the doctor  the mother is not so the children  the mother was the last representative of a princely stock degenerate both in parts and fortune  her father was not only poor he was mad and the girl ran wild about the residencia till his death  then much of the fortune having died with him and the family being quite extinct the girl ran wilder than ever until at last she married heaven knows whom a muleteer some say others a smuggler while there are some who uphold there was no marriage at all and that felipe and olalla are bastards  the union such as it was was tragically dissolved some years ago but they live in such seclusion and the country at that time was in so much disorder that the precise manner of the mans end is known only to the priestif even to him  i begin to think i shall have strange experiences said i  i would not romance if i were you replied the doctor you will find i fear a very grovelling and commonplace reality  felipe for instance i have seen  and what am i to say  he is very rustic very cunning very loutish and i should say an innocent the others are probably to match  no no senor commandante you must seek congenial society among the great sights of our mountains and in these at least if you are at all a lover of the works of nature i promise you will not be disappointed  the next day felipe came for me in a rough country cart drawn by a mule and a little before the stroke of noon after i had said farewell to the doctor the innkeeper and different good souls who had befriended me during my sickness we set forth out of the city by the eastern gate and began to ascend into the sierra  i had been so long a prisoner since i was left behind for dying after the loss of the convoy that the mere smell of the earth set me smiling  the country through which we went was wild and rocky partially covered with rough woods now of the corktree and now of the great spanish chestnut and frequently intersected by the beds of mountain torrents  the sun shone the wind rustled joyously and we had advanced some miles and the city had already shrunk into an inconsiderable knoll upon the plain behind us before my attention began to be diverted to the companion of my drive  to the eye he seemed but a diminutive loutish wellmade country lad such as the doctor had described mighty quick and active but devoid of any culture and this first impression was with most observers final  what began to strike me was his familiar chattering talk so strangely inconsistent with the terms on which i was to be received and partly from his imperfect enunciation partly from the sprightly incoherence of the matter so very difficult to follow clearly without an effort of the mind  it is true i had before talked with persons of a similar mental constitution persons who seemed to live as he did by the senses taken and possessed by the visual object of the moment and unable to discharge their minds of that impression  his seemed to me as i sat distantly giving ear a kind of conversation proper to drivers who pass much of their time in a great vacancy of the intellect and threading the sights of a familiar country but this was not the case of felipe by his own account he was a home keeper i wish i was there now he said and then spying a tree by the wayside he broke off to tell me that he had once seen a crow among its branches  a crow i repeated struck by the ineptitude of the remark and thinking i had heard imperfectly  but by this time he was already filled with a new idea hearkening with a rapt intentness his head on one side his face puckered and he struck me rudely to make me hold my peace  then he smiled and shook his head  what did you hear i asked  o it is all right he said and began encouraging his mule with cries that echoed unhumanly up the mountain walls  i looked at him more closely  he was superlatively wellbuilt light and lithe and strong he was wellfeatured his yellow eyes were very large though perhaps not very expressive take him altogether he was a pleasantlooking lad and i had no fault to find with him beyond that he was of a dusky hue and inclined to hairyness two characteristics that i disliked  it was his mind that puzzled and yet attracted me  the doctors phrasean innocentcame back to me and i was wondering if that were after all the true description when the road began to go down into the narrow and naked chasm of a torrent  the waters thundered tumultuously in the bottom and the ravine was filled full of the sound the thin spray and the claps of wind that accompanied their descent the scene was certainly impressive but the road was in that part very securely walled in the mule went steadily forward and i was astonished to perceive the paleness of terror in the face of my companion  the voice of that wild river was inconstant now sinking lower as if in weariness now doubling its hoarse tones momentary freshets seemed to swell its volume sweeping down the gorge raving and booming against the barrier walls and i observed it was at each of these accessions to the clamour that my driver more particularly winced and blanched  some thoughts of scottish superstition and the river kelpie passed across my mind i wondered if perchance the like were prevalent in that part of spain and turning to felipe sought to draw him out  what is the matter i asked  o i am afraid he replied  of what are you afraid i returned  this seems one of the safest places on this very dangerous road  it makes a noise he said with a simplicity of awe that set my doubts at rest  the lad was but a child in intellect his mind was like his body active and swift but stunted in development and i began from that time forth to regard him with a measure of pity and to listen at first with indulgence and at last even with pleasure to his disjointed babble  by about four in the afternoon we had crossed the summit of the mountain line said farewell to the western sunshine and began to go down upon the other side skirting the edge of many ravines and moving through the shadow of dusky woods  there rose upon all sides the voice of falling water not condensed and formidable as in the gorge of the river but scattered and sounding gaily and musically from glen to glen  here too the spirits of my driver mended and he began to sing aloud in a falsetto voice and with a singular bluntness of musical perception never true either to melody or key but wandering at will and yet somehow with an effect that was natural and pleasing like that of the of birds  as the dusk increased i fell more and more under the spell of this artless warbling listening and waiting for some articulate air and still disappointed and when at last i asked him what it was he sango cried he i am just singing  above all i was taken with a trick he had of unweariedly repeating the same note at little intervals it was not so monotonous as you would think or at least not disagreeable and it seemed to breathe a wonderful contentment with what is such as we love to fancy in the attitude of trees or the quiescence of a pool  night had fallen dark before we came out upon a plateau and drew up a little after before a certain lump of superior blackness which i could only conjecture to be the residencia  here my guide getting down from the cart hooted and whistled for a long time in vain until at last an old peasant man came towards us from somewhere in the surrounding dark carrying a candle in his hand  by the light of this i was able to perceive a great arched doorway of a moorish character it was closed by ironstudded gates in one of the leaves of which felipe opened a wicket the peasant carried off the cart to some outbuilding but my guide and i passed through the wicket which was closed again behind us and by the glimmer of the candle passed through a court up a stone stair along a section of an open gallery and up more stairs again until we came at last to the door of a great and somewhat bare apartment  this room which i understood was to be mine was pierced by three windows lined with some lustrous wood disposed in panels and carpeted with the skins of many savage animals  a bright fire burned in the chimney and shed abroad a changeful flicker close up to the blaze there was drawn a table laid for supper and in the far end a bed stood ready  i was pleased by these preparations and said so to felipe and he with the same simplicity of disposition that i held already remarked in him warmly reechoed my praises  a fine room he said a very fine room and fire too fire is good it melts out the pleasure in your bones  and the bed he continued carrying over the candle in that directionsee what fine sheetshow soft how smooth smooth and he passed his hand again and again over their texture and then laid down his head and rubbed his cheeks among them with a grossness of content that somehow offended me  i took the candle from his hand for i feared he would set the bed on fire and walked back to the suppertable where perceiving a measure of wine i poured out a cup and called to him to come and drink of it  he started to his feet at once and ran to me with a strong expression of hope but when he saw the wine he visibly shuddered  oh no he said not that that is for you  i hate it  very well senor said i then i will drink to your good health and to the prosperity of your house and family  speaking of which i added after i had drunk shall i not have the pleasure of laying my salutations in person at the feet of the senora your mother  but at these words all the childishness passed out of his face and was succeeded by a look of indescribable cunning and secrecy  he backed away from me at the same time as though i were an animal about to leap or some dangerous fellow with a weapon and when he had got near the door glowered at me sullenly with contracted pupils  no he said at last and the next moment was gone noiselessly out of the room and i heard his footing die away downstairs as light as rainfall and silence closed over the house  after i had supped i drew up the table nearer to the bed and began to prepare for rest but in the new position of the light i was struck by a picture on the wall  it represented a woman still young  to judge by her costume and the mellow unity which reigned over the canvas she had long been dead to judge by the vivacity of the attitude the eyes and the features i might have been beholding in a mirror the image of life her figure was very slim and strong and of a just proportion red tresses lay like a crown over her brow her eyes of a very golden brown held mine with a look and her face which was perfectly shaped was yet marred by a cruel sullen and sensual expression  something in both face and figure something exquisitely intangible like the echo of an echo suggested the features and bearing of my guide and i stood awhile unpleasantly attracted and wondering at the oddity of the resemblance the common carnal stock of that race which had been originally designed for such high dames as the one now looking on me from the canvas had fallen to baser uses wearing country clothes sitting on the shaft and holding the reins of a mule cart to bring home a lodger  perhaps an actual link subsisted perhaps some scruple of the delicate flesh that was once clothed upon with the satin and brocade of the dead lady now winced at the rude contact of felipes frieze  the first light of the morning shone full upon the portrait and as i lay awake my eyes continued to dwell upon it with growing complacency its beauty crept about my heart insidiously silencing my scruples one after another and while i knew that to love such a woman were to sign and seal ones own sentence of degeneration i still knew that if she were alive i should love her  day after day the double knowledge of her wickedness and of my weakness grew clearer  she came to be the heroine of many daydreams in which her eyes led on to and sufficiently rewarded crimes  she cast a dark shadow on my fancy and when i was out in the free air of heaven taking vigorous exercise and healthily renewing the current of my blood it was often a glad thought to me that my enchantress was safe in the grave her wand of beauty broken her lips closed in silence her philtre spilt  and yet i had a halflingering terror that she might not be dead after all but rearisen in the body of some descendant  felipe served my meals in my own apartment and his resemblance to the portrait haunted me  at times it was not at times upon some change of attitude or flash of expression it would leap out upon me like a ghost it was above all in his ill tempers that the likeness triumphed  he certainly liked me he was proud of my notice which he sought to engage by many simple and childlike devices he loved to sit close before my fire talking his broken talk or singing his odd endless wordless songs and sometimes drawing his hand over my clothes with an affectionate manner of caressing that never failed to cause in me an embarrassment of which i was ashamed  but for all that he was capable of flashes of causeless anger and fits of sturdy sullenness  at a word of reproof i have seen him upset the dish of which i was about to eat and this not surreptitiously but with defiance and similarly at a hint of inquisition  i was not unnaturally curious being in a strange place and surrounded by string people but at the shadow of a question he shrank back lowering and dangerous  then it was that for a fraction of a second this rough lad might have been the brother of the lady in the frame  but these humours were swift to pass and the resemblance died along with them  in these first days i saw nothing of any one but felipe unless the portrait is to be counted and since the lad was plainly of weak mind and had moments of passion it may be wondered that i bore his dangerous neighbourhood with equanimity  as a matter of fact it was for some time irksome but it happened before long that i obtained over him so complete a mastery as set my disquietude at rest  it fell in this way  he was by nature slothful and much of a vagabond and yet he kept by the house and not only waited upon my wants but laboured every day in the garden or small farm to the south of the residencia  here he would be joined by the peasant whom i had seen on the night of my arrival and who dwelt at the far end of the enclosure about half a mile away in a rude outhouse but it was plain to me that of these two it was felipe who did most and though i would sometimes see him throw down his spade and go to sleep among the very plants he had been digging his constancy and energy were admirable in themselves and still more so since i was well assured they were foreign to his disposition and the fruit of an ungrateful effort  but while i admired i wondered what had called forth in a lad so shuttlewitted this enduring sense of duty  how was it sustained  i asked myself and to what length did it prevail over his instincts  the priest was possibly his inspirer but the priest came one day to the residencia  i saw him both come and go after an interval of close upon an hour from a knoll where i was sketching and all that time felipe continued to labour undisturbed in the garden  at last in a very unworthy spirit i determined to debauch the lad from his good resolutions and waylaying him at the gate easily pursuaded him to join me in a ramble  it was a fine day and the woods to which i led him were green and pleasant and sweetsmelling and alive with the hum of insects  here he discovered himself in a fresh character mounting up to heights of gaiety that abashed me and displaying an energy and grace of movement that delighted the eye  he leaped he ran round me in mere glee he would stop and look and listen and seem to drink in the world like a cordial and then he would suddenly spring into a tree with one bound and hang and gambol there like one at home  little as he said to me and that of not much import i have rarely enjoyed more stirring company the sight of his delight was a continual feast the speed and accuracy of his movements pleased me to the heart and i might have been so thoughtlessly unkind as to make a habit of these wants had not chance prepared a very rude conclusion to my pleasure  by some swiftness or dexterity the lad captured a squirrel in a tree top  he was then some way ahead of me but i saw him drop to the ground and crouch there crying aloud for pleasure like a child  the sound stirred my sympathies it was so fresh and innocent but as i bettered my pace to draw near the cry of the squirrel knocked upon my heart  i have heard and seen much of the cruelty of lads and above all of peasants but what i now beheld struck me into a passion of anger  i thrust the fellow aside plucked the poor brute out of his hands and with swift mercy killed it  then i turned upon the torturer spoke to him long out of the heat of my indignation calling him names at which he seemed to wither and at length pointing toward the residencia bade him begone and leave me for i chose to walk with men not with vermin  he fell upon his knees and the words coming to him with more cleanness than usual poured out a stream of the most touching supplications begging me in mercy to forgive him to forget what he had done to look to the future  o i try so hard he said  o commandante bear with felipe this once he will never be a brute again  thereupon much more affected than i cared to show i suffered myself to be persuaded and at last shook hands with him and made it up  but the squirrel by way of penance i made him bury speaking of the poor things beauty telling him what pains it had suffered and how base a thing was the abuse of strength  see felipe said i you are strong indeed but in my hands you are as helpless as that poor thing of the trees  give me your hand in mine  you cannot remove it  now suppose that i were cruel like you and took a pleasure in pain  i only tighten my hold and see how you suffer  he screamed aloud his face stricken ashy and dotted with needle points of sweat and when i set him free he fell to the earth and nursed his hand and moaned over it like a baby  but he took the lesson in good part and whether from that or from what i had said to him or the higher notion he now had of my bodily strength his original affection was changed into a dog like adoring fidelity  meanwhile i gained rapidly in health  the residencia stood on the crown of a stony plateau on every side the mountains hemmed it about only from the roof where was a bartizan there might be seen between two peaks a small segment of plain blue with extreme distance  the air in these altitudes moved freely and largely great clouds congregated there and were broken up by the wind and left in tatters on the hilltops a hoarse and yet faint rumbling of torrents rose from all round and one could there study all the ruder and more ancient characters of nature in something of their pristine force  i delighted from the first in the vigorous scenery and changeful weather nor less in the antique and dilapidated mansion where i dwelt  this was a large oblong flanked at two opposite corners by bastionlike projections one of which commanded the door while both were loopholed for musketry  the lower storey was besides naked of windows so that the building if garrisoned could not be carried without artillery  it enclosed an open court planted with pomegranate trees  from this a broad flight of marble stairs ascended to an open gallery running all round and resting towards the court on slender pillars  thence again several enclosed stairs led to the upper storeys of the house which were thus broken up into distinct divisions the windows both within and without were closely shuttered some of the stonework in the upper parts had fallen the roof in one place had been wrecked in one of the flurries of wind which were common in these mountains and the whole house in the strong beating sunlight and standing out above a grove of stunted corktrees thickly laden and discoloured with dust looked like the sleeping palace of the legend  the court in particular seemed the very home of slumber  a hoarse cooing of doves haunted about the eaves the winds were excluded but when they blew outside the mountain dust fell here as thick as rain and veiled the red bloom of the pomegranates shuttered windows and the closed doors of numerous cellars and the vacant arches of the gallery enclosed it and all day long the sun made broken profiles on the four sides and paraded the shadow of the pillars on the gallery floor  at the ground level there was however a certain pillared recess which bore the marks of human habitation  though it was open in front upon the court it was yet provided with a chimney where a wood fire would he always prettily blazing and the tile floor was littered with the skins of animals  it was in this place that i first saw my hostess  she had drawn one of the skins forward and sat in the sun leaning against a pillar  it was her dress that struck me first of all for it was rich and brightly coloured and shone out in that dusty courtyard with something of the same relief as the flowers of the pomegranates  at a second look it was her beauty of person that took hold of me  as she sat backwatching me i thought though with invisible eyesand wearing at the same time an expression of almost imbecile goodhumour and contentment she showed a perfectness of feature and a quiet nobility of attitude that were beyond a statues  i took off my hat to her in passing and her face puckered with suspicion as swiftly and lightly as a pool ruffles in the breeze but she paid no heed to my courtesy  i went forth on my customary walk a trifle daunted her idollike impassivity haunting me and when i returned although she was still in much the same posture i was half surprised to see that she had moved as far as the next pillar following the sunshine  this time however she addressed me with some trivial salutation civilly enough conceived and uttered in the same deepchested and yet indistinct and lisping tones that had already baffled the utmost niceness of my hearing from her son  i answered rather at a venture for not only did i fail to take her meaning with precision but the sudden disclosure of her eyes disturbed me  they were unusually large the iris golden like felipes but the pupil at that moment so distended that they seemed almost black and what affected me was not so much their size as what was perhaps its consequence the singular insignificance of their regard  a look more blankly stupid i have never met  my eyes dropped before it even as i spoke and i went on my way upstairs to my own room at once baffled and embarrassed  yet when i came there and saw the face of the portrait i was again reminded of the miracle of family descent  my hostess was indeed both older and fuller in person her eyes were of a different colour her face besides was not only free from the illsignificance that offended and attracted me in the painting it was devoid of either good or bada moral blank expressing literally naught  and yet there was a likeness not so much speaking as immanent not so much in any particular feature as upon the whole  it should seem i thought as if when the master set his signature to that grave canvas he had not only caught the image of one smiling and falseeyed woman but stamped the essential quality of a race  from that day forth whether i came or went i was sure to find the senora seated in the sun against a pillar or stretched on a rug before the fire only at times she would shift her station to the top round of the stone staircase where she lay with the same nonchalance right across my path  in all these days i never knew her to display the least spark of energy beyond what she expended in brushing and rebrushing her copious coppercoloured hair or in lisping out in the rich and broken hoarseness of her voice her customary idle salutations to myself  these i think were her two chief pleasures beyond that of mere quiescence she seemed always proud of her remarks as though they had been witticisms and indeed though they were empty enough like the conversation of many respectable persons and turned on a very narrow range of subjects they were never meaningless or incoherent nay they had a certain beauty of their own breathing as they did of her entire contentment  now she would speak of the warmth in which like her son she greatly delighted now of the flowers of the pomegranate trees and now of the white doves and longwinged swallows that fanned the air of the court  the birds excited her  as they raked the eaves in their swift flight or skimmed sidelong past her with a rush of wind she would sometimes stir and sit a little up and seem to awaken from her doze of satisfaction  but for the rest of her days she lay luxuriously folded on herself and sunk in sloth and pleasure  her invincible content at first annoyed me but i came gradually to find repose in the spectacle until at last it grew to be my habit to sit down beside her four times in the day both coming and going and to talk with her sleepily i scarce knew of what  i had come to like her dull almost animal neighbourhood her beauty and her stupidity soothed and amused me  i began to find a kind of transcendental good sense in her remarks and her unfathomable good nature moved me to admiration and envy  the liking was returned she enjoyed my presence halfunconsciously as a man in deep meditation may enjoy the babbling of a brook  i can scarce say she brightened when i came for satisfaction was written on her face eternally as on some foolish statues but i was made conscious of her pleasure by some more intimate communication than the sight  and one day as i set within reach of her on the marble step she suddenly shot forth one of her hands and patted mine  the thing was done and she was back in her accustomed attitude before my mind had received intelligence of the caress and when i turned to look her in the face i could perceive no answerable sentiment  it was plain she attached no moment to the act and i blamed myself for my own more uneasy consciousness  the sight and if i may so call it the acquaintance of the mother confirmed the view i had already taken of the son  the family blood had been impoverished perhaps by long inbreeding which i knew to be a common error among the proud and the exclusive  no decline indeed was to be traced in the body which had been handed down unimpaired in shapeliness and strength and the faces of today were struck as sharply from the mint as the face of two centuries ago that smiled upon me from the portrait  but the intelligence that more precious heirloom was degenerate the treasure of ancestral memory ran low and it had required the potent plebeian crossing of a muleteer or mountain contrabandista to raise what approached hebetude in the mother into the active oddity of the son  yet of the two it was the mother i preferred  of felipe vengeful and placable full of starts and shyings inconstant as a hare i could even conceive as a creature possibly noxious  of the mother i had no thoughts but those of kindness  and indeed as spectators are apt ignorantly to take sides i grew something of a partisan in the enmity which i perceived to smoulder between them  true it seemed mostly on the mothers part  she would sometimes draw in her breath as he came near and the pupils of her vacant eyes would contract as if with horror or fear  her emotions such as they were were much upon the surface and readily shared and this latent repulsion occupied my mind and kept me wondering on what grounds it rested and whether the son was certainly in fault  i had been about ten days in the residencia when there sprang up a high and harsh wind carrying clouds of dust  it came out of malarious lowlands and over several snowy sierras  the nerves of those on whom it blew were strung and jangled their eyes smarted with the dust their legs ached under the burthen of their body and the touch of one hand upon another grew to be odious  the wind besides came down the gullies of the hills and stormed about the house with a great hollow buzzing and whistling that was wearisome to the ear and dismally depressing to the mind  it did not so much blow in gusts as with the steady sweep of a waterfall so that there was no remission of discomfort while it blew but higher upon the mountain it was probably of a more variable strength with accesses of fury for there came down at times a faroff wailing infinitely grievous to hear and at times on one of the high shelves or terraces there would start up and then disperse a tower of dust like the smoke of in explosion  i no sooner awoke in bed than i was conscious of the nervous tension and depression of the weather and the effect grew stronger as the day proceeded  it was in vain that i resisted in vain that i set forth upon my customary mornings walk the irrational unchanging fury of the storm had soon beat down my strength and wrecked my temper and i returned to the residencia glowing with dry heat and foul and gritty with dust  the court had a forlorn appearance now and then a glimmer of sun fled over it now and then the wind swooped down upon the pomegranates and scattered the blossoms and set the window shutters clapping on the wall in the recess the senora was pacing to and fro with a flushed countenance and bright eyes i thought too she was speaking to herself like one in anger  but when i addressed her with my customary salutation she only replied by a sharp gesture and continued her walk  the weather had distempered even this impassive creature and as i went on upstairs i was the less ashamed of my own discomposure  all day the wind continued and i sat in my room and made a feint of reading or walked up and down and listened to the riot overhead  night fell and i had not so much as a candle  i began to long for some society and stole down to the court  it was now plunged in the blue of the first darkness but the recess was redly lighted by the fire  the wood had been piled high and was crowned by a shock of flames which the draught of the chimney brandished to and fro  in this strong and shaken brightness the senora continued pacing from wall to wall with disconnected gestures clasping her hands stretching forth her arms throwing back her head as in appeal to heaven  in these disordered movements the beauty and grace of the woman showed more clearly but there was a light in her eye that struck on me unpleasantly and when i had looked on awhile in silence and seemingly unobserved i turned tail as i had come and groped my way back again to my own chamber  by the time felipe brought my supper and lights my nerve was utterly gone and had the lad been such as i was used to seeing him i should have kept him even by force had that been necessary to take off the edge from my distasteful solitude  but on felipe also the wind had exercised its influence  he had been feverish all day now that the night had come he was fallen into a low and tremulous humour that reacted on my own  the sight of his scared face his starts and pallors and sudden harkenings unstrung me and when he dropped and broke a dish i fairly leaped out of my seat  i think we are all mad today said i affecting to laugh  it is the black wind he replied dolefully  you feel as if you must do something and you dont know what it is  i noted the aptness of the description but indeed felipe had sometimes a strange felicity in rendering into words the sensations of the body and your mother too said i she seems to feel this weather much  do you not fear she may be unwell  he stared at me a little and then said no almost defiantly and the next moment carrying his hand to his brow cried out lamentably on the wind and the noise that made his head go round like a millwheel  who can be well he cried and indeed i could only echo his question for i was disturbed enough myself  i went to bed early wearied with daylong restlessness but the poisonous nature of the wind and its ungodly and unintermittent uproar would not suffer me to sleep  i lay there and tossed my nerves and senses on the stretch  at times i would doze dream horribly and wake again and these snatches of oblivion confused me as to time  but it must have been late on in the night when i was suddenly startled by an outbreak of pitiable and hateful cries  i leaped from my bed supposing i had dreamed but the cries still continued to fill the house cries of pain i thought but certainly of rage also and so savage and discordant that they shocked the heart  it was no illusion some living thing some lunatic or some wild animal was being foully tortured  the thought of felipe and the squirrel flashed into my mind and i ran to the door but it had been locked from the outside and i might shake it as i pleased i was a fast prisoner  still the cries continued  now they would dwindle down into a moaning that seemed to be articulate and at these times i made sure they must be human and again they would break forth and fill the house with ravings worthy of hell  i stood at the door and gave ear to them till at last they died away  long after that i still lingered and still continued to hear them mingle in fancy with the storming of the wind and when at last i crept to my bed it was with a deadly sickness and a blackness of horror on my heart  it was little wonder if i slept no more  why had i been locked in  what had passed  who was the author of these indescribable and shocking cries  a human being  it was inconceivable  a beast  the cries were scarce quite bestial and what animal short of a lion or a tiger could thus shake the solid walls of the residencia  and while i was thus turning over the elements of the mystery it came into my mind that i had not yet set eyes upon the daughter of the house  what was more probable than that the daughter of the senora and the sister of felipe should be herself insane  or what more likely than that these ignorant and half witted people should seek to manage an afflicted kinswoman by violence here was a solution and yet when i called to mind the cries which i never did without a shuddering chill it seemed altogether insufficient not even cruelty could wring such cries from madness  but of one thing i was sure i could not live in a house where such a thing was half conceivable and not probe the matter home and if necessary interfere  the next day came the wind had blown itself out and there was nothing to remind me of the business of the night  felipe came to my bedside with obvious cheerfulness as i passed through the court the senora was sunning herself with her accustomed immobility and when i issued from the gateway i found the whole face of nature austerely smiling the heavens of a cold blue and sown with great cloud islands and the mountainsides mapped forth into provinces of light and shadow  a short walk restored me to myself and renewed within me the resolve to plumb this mystery and when from the vantage of my knoll i had seen felipe pass forth to his labours in the garden i returned at once to the residencia to put my design in practice  the senora appeared plunged in slumber i stood awhile and marked her but she did not stir even if my design were indiscreet i had little to fear from such a guardian and turning away i mounted to the gallery and began my exploration of the house  all morning i went from one door to another and entered spacious and faded chambers some rudely shuttered some receiving their full charge of daylight all empty and unhomely  it was a rich house on which time had breathed his tarnish and dust had scattered disillusion  the spider swung there the bloated tarantula scampered on the cornices ants had their crowded highways on the floor of halls of audience the big and foul fly that lives on carrion and is often the messenger of death had set up his nest in the rotten woodwork and buzzed heavily about the rooms  here and there a stool or two a couch a bed or a great carved chair remained behind like islets on the bare floors to testify of mans bygone habitation and everywhere the walls were set with the portraits of the dead  i could judge by these decaying effigies in the house of what a great and what a handsome race i was then wandering  many of the men wore orders on their breasts and had the port of noble offices the women were all richly attired the canvases most of them by famous hands  but it was not so much these evidences of greatness that took hold upon my mind even contrasted as they were with the present depopulation and decay of that great house  it was rather the parable of family life that i read in this succession of fair faces and shapely bodies  never before had i so realised the miracle of the continued race the creation and recreation the weaving and changing and handing down of fleshly elements  that a child should be born of its mother that it should grow and clothe itself we know not how with humanity and put on inherited looks and turn its head with the manner of one ascendant and offer its hand with the gesture of another are wonders dulled for us by repetition  but in the singular unity of look in the common features and common bearing of all these painted generations on the walls of the residencia the miracle started out and looked me in the face  and an ancient mirror falling opportunely in my way i stood and read my own features a long while tracing out on either hand the filaments of descent and the bonds that knit me with my family  at last in the course of these investigations i opened the door of a chamber that bore the marks of habitation  it was of large proportions and faced to the north where the mountains were most wildly figured  the embers of a fire smouldered and smoked upon the hearth to which a chair had been drawn close  and yet the aspect of the chamber was ascetic to the degree of sternness the chair was uncushioned the floor and walls were naked and beyond the books which lay here and there in some confusion there was no instrument of either work or pleasure  the sight of books in the house of such a family exceedingly amazed me and i began with a great hurry and in momentary fear of interruption to go from one to another and hastily inspect their character  they were of all sorts devotional historical and scientific but mostly of a great age and in the latin tongue  some i could see to bear the marks of constant study others had been torn across and tossed aside as if in petulance or disapproval  lastly as i cruised about that empty chamber i espied some papers written upon with pencil on a table near the window  an unthinking curiosity led me to take one up  it bore a copy of verses very roughly metred in the original spanish and which i may render somewhat thus     pleasure approached with pain and shame    grief with a wreath of lilies came    pleasure showed the lovely sun    jesu dear how sweet it shone    grief with her worn hand pointed on          jesu dear to thee  shame and confusion at once fell on me and laying down the paper i beat an immediate retreat from the apartment  neither felipe nor his mother could have read the books nor written these rough but feeling verses  it was plain i had stumbled with sacrilegious feet into the room of the daughter of the house  god knows my own heart most sharply punished me for my indiscretion  the thought that i had thus secretly pushed my way into the confidence of a girl so strangely situated and the fear that she might somehow come to hear of it oppressed me like guilt  i blamed myself besides for my suspicions of the night before wondered that i should ever have attributed those shocking cries to one of whom i now conceived as of a saint spectral of mien wasted with maceration bound up in the practices of a mechanical devotion and dwelling in a great isolation of soul with her incongruous relatives and as i leaned on the balustrade of the gallery and looked down into the bright close of pomegranates and at the gaily dressed and somnolent woman who just then stretched herself and delicately licked her lips as in the very sensuality of sloth my mind swiftly compared the scene with the cold chamber looking northward on the mountains where the daughter dwelt  that same afternoon as i sat upon my knoll i saw the padre enter the gates of the residencia  the revelation of the daughters character had struck home to my fancy and almost blotted out the horrors of the night before but at sight of this worthy man the memory revived  i descended then from the knoll and making a circuit among the woods posted myself by the wayside to await his passage  as soon as he appeared i stepped forth and introduced myself as the lodger of the residencia  he had a very strong honest countenance on which it was easy to read the mingled emotions with which he regarded me as a foreigner a heretic and yet one who had been wounded for the good cause  of the family at the residencia he spoke with reserve and yet with respect  i mentioned that i had not yet seen the daughter whereupon he remarked that that was as it should be and looked at me a little askance  lastly i plucked up courage to refer to the cries that had disturbed me in the night  he heard me out in silence and then stopped and partly turned about as though to mark beyond doubt that he was dismissing me  do you take tobacco powder said he offering his snuffbox and then when i had refused i am an old man he added and i may be allowed to remind you that you are a guest  i have then your authority i returned firmly enough although i flushed at the implied reproof to let things take their course and not to interfere  he said yes and with a somewhat uneasy salute turned and left me where i was  but he had done two things he had set my conscience at rest and he had awakened my delicacy  i made a great effort once more dismissed the recollections of the night and fell once more to brooding on my saintly poetess  at the same time i could not quite forget that i had been locked in and that night when felipe brought me my supper i attacked him warily on both points of interest  i never see your sister said i casually  oh no said he she is a good good girl and his mind instantly veered to something else  your sister is pious i suppose i asked in the next pause  oh he cried joining his hands with extreme fervour a saint it is she that keeps me up  you are very fortunate said i for the most of us i am afraid and myself among the number are better at going down  senor said felipe earnestly i would not say that  you should not tempt your angel  if one goes down where is he to stop  why felipe said i i had no guess you were a preacher and i may say a good one but i suppose that is your sisters doing  he nodded at me with round eyes  well then i continued she has doubtless reproved you for your sin of cruelty  twelve times he cried for this was the phrase by which the odd creature expressed the sense of frequency  and i told her you had done soi remembered that he added proudlyand she was pleased  then felipe said i what were those cries that i heard last night for surely they were cries of some creature in suffering  the wind returned felipe looking in the fire  i took his hand in mine at which thinking it to be a caress he smiled with a brightness of pleasure that came near disarming my resolve  but i trod the weakness down  the wind i repeated and yet i think it was this hand holding it up that had first locked me in  the lad shook visibly but answered never a word  well said i i am a stranger and a guest  it is not my part either to meddle or to judge in your affairs in these you shall take your sisters counsel which i cannot doubt to be excellent  but in so far as concerns my own i will be no mans prisoner and i demand that key  half an hour later my door was suddenly thrown open and the key tossed ringing on the floor  a day or two after i came in from a walk a little before the point of noon  the senora was lying lapped in slumber on the threshold of the recess the pigeons dozed below the eaves like snowdrifts the house was under a deep spell of noontide quiet and only a wandering and gentle wind from the mountain stole round the galleries rustled among the pomegranates and pleasantly stirred the shadows  something in the stillness moved me to imitation and i went very lightly across the court and up the marble staircase  my foot was on the topmost round when a door opened and i found myself face to face with olalla  surprise transfixed me her loveliness struck to my heart she glowed in the deep shadow of the gallery a gem of colour her eyes took hold upon mine and clung there and bound us together like the joining of hands and the moments we thus stood face to face drinking each other in were sacramental and the wedding of souls  i know not how long it was before i awoke out of a deep trance and hastily bowing passed on into the upper stair  she did not move but followed me with her great thirsting eyes and as i passed out of sight it seemed to me as if she paled and faded  in my own room i opened the window and looked out and could not think what change had come upon that austere field of mountains that it should thus sing and shine under the lofty heaven  i had seen herolalla  and the stone crags answered olalla and the dumb unfathomable azure answered olalla  the pale saint of my dreams had vanished for ever and in her place i beheld this maiden on whom god had lavished the richest colours and the most exuberant energies of life whom he had made active as a deer slender as a reed and in whose great eyes he had lighted the torches of the soul  the thrill of her young life strung like a wild animals had entered into me the force of soul that had looked out from her eyes and conquered mine mantled about my heart and sprang to my lips in singing  she passed through my veins she was one with me  i will not say that this enthusiasm declined rather my soul held out in its ecstasy as in a strong castle and was there besieged by cold and sorrowful considerations  i could not doubt but that i loved her at first sight and already with a quivering ardour that was strange to my experience  what then was to follow  she was the child of an afflicted house the senoras daughter the sister of felipe she bore it even in her beauty  she had the lightness and swiftness of the one swift as an arrow light as dew like the other she shone on the pale background of the world with the brilliancy of flowers  i could not call by the name of brother that halfwitted lad nor by the name of mother that immovable and lovely thing of flesh whose silly eyes and perpetual simper now recurred to my mind like something hateful  and if i could not marry what then  she was helplessly unprotected her eyes in that single and long glance which had been all our intercourse had confessed a weakness equal to my own but in my heart i knew her for the student of the cold northern chamber and the writer of the sorrowful lines and this was a knowledge to disarm a brute  to flee was more than i could find courage for but i registered a vow of unsleeping circumspection  as i turned from the window my eyes alighted on the portrait  it had fallen dead like a candle after sunrise it followed me with eyes of paint  i knew it to be like and marvelled at the tenacity of type in that declining race but the likeness was swallowed up in difference  i remembered how it had seemed to me a thing unapproachable in the life a creature rather of the painters craft than of the modesty of nature and i marvelled at the thought and exulted in the image of olalla  beauty i had seen before and not been charmed and i had been often drawn to women who were not beautiful except to me but in olalla all that i desired and had not dared to imagine was united  i did not see her the next day and my heart ached and my eyes longed for her as men long for morning  but the day after when i returned about my usual hour she was once more on the gallery and our looks once more met and embraced  i would have spoken i would have drawn near to her but strongly as she plucked at my heart drawing me like a magnet something yet more imperious withheld me and i could only bow and pass by and she leaving my salutation unanswered only followed me with her noble eyes  i had now her image by rote and as i conned the traits in memory it seemed as if i read her very heart  she was dressed with something of her mothers coquetry and love of positive colour  her robe which i know she must have made with her own hands clung about her with a cunning grace  after the fashion of that country besides her bodice stood open in the middle in a long slit and here in spite of the poverty of the house a gold coin hanging by a ribbon lay on her brown bosom  these were proofs had any been needed of her inborn delight in life and her own loveliness  on the other hand in her eyes that hung upon mine i could read depth beyond depth of passion and sadness lights of poetry and hope blacknesses of despair and thoughts that were above the earth  it was a lovely body but the inmate the soul was more than worthy of that lodging  should i leave this incomparable flower to wither unseen on these rough mountains  should i despise the great gift offered me in the eloquent silence of her eyes  here was a soul immured should i not burst its prison  all side considerations fell off from me were she the child of herod i swore i should make her mine and that very evening i set myself with a mingled sense of treachery and disgrace to captivate the brother  perhaps i read him with more favourable eyes perhaps the thought of his sister always summoned up the better qualities of that imperfect soul but he had never seemed to me so amiable and his very likeness to olalla while it annoyed yet softened me  a third day passed in vainan empty desert of hours  i would not lose a chance and loitered all afternoon in the court where to give myself a countenance i spoke more than usual with the senora  god knows it was with a most tender and sincere interest that i now studied her and even as for felipe so now for the mother i was conscious of a growing warmth of toleration  and yet i wondered  even while i spoke with her she would doze off into a little sleep and presently awake again without embarrassment and this composure staggered me  and again as i marked her make infinitesimal changes in her posture savouring and lingering on the bodily pleasure of the movement i was driven to wonder at this depth of passive sensuality  she lived in her body and her consciousness was all sunk into and disseminated through her members where it luxuriously dwelt  lastly i could not grow accustomed to her eyes  each time she turned on me these great beautiful and meaningless orbs wide open to the day but closed against human inquiryeach time i had occasion to observe the lively changes of her pupils which expanded and contracted in a breathi know not what it was came over me i can find no name for the mingled feeling of disappointment annoyance and distaste that jarred along my nerves  i tried her on a variety of subjects equally in vain and at last led the talk to her daughter  but even there she proved indifferent said she was pretty which as with children was her highest word of commendation but was plainly incapable of any higher thought and when i remarked that olalla seemed silent merely yawned in my face and replied that speech was of no great use when you had nothing to say  people speak much very much she added looking at me with expanded pupils and then again yawned and again showed me a mouth that was as dainty as a toy  this time i took the hint and leaving her to her repose went up into my own chamber to sit by the open window looking on the hills and not beholding them sunk in lustrous and deep dreams and hearkening in fancy to the note of a voice that i had never heard  i awoke on the fifth morning with a brightness of anticipation that seemed to challenge fate  i was sure of myself light of heart and foot and resolved to put my love incontinently to the touch of knowledge  it should lie no longer under the bonds of silence a dumb thing living by the eye only like the love of beasts but should now put on the spirit and enter upon the joys of the complete human intimacy  i thought of it with wild hopes like a voyager to el dorado into that unknown and lovely country of her soul i no longer trembled to adventure  yet when i did indeed encounter her the same force of passion descended on me and at once submerged my mind speech seemed to drop away from me like a childish habit and i but drew near to her as the giddy man draws near to the margin of a gulf  she drew back from me a little as i came but her eyes did not waver from mine and these lured me forward  at last when i was already within reach of her i stopped  words were denied me if i advanced i could but clasp her to my heart in silence and all that was sane in me all that was still unconquered revolted against the thought of such an accost  so we stood for a second all our life in our eyes exchanging salvos of attraction and yet each resisting and then with a great effort of the will and conscious at the same time of a sudden bitterness of disappointment i turned and went away in the same silence  what power lay upon me that i could not speak  and she why was she also silent  why did she draw away before me dumbly with fascinated eyes was this love or was it a mere brute attraction mindless and inevitable like that of the magnet for the steel  we had never spoken we were wholly strangers and yet an influence strong as the grasp of a giant swept us silently together  on my side it filled me with impatience and yet i was sure that she was worthy i had seen her books read her verses and thus in a sense divined the soul of my mistress but on her side it struck me almost cold  of me she knew nothing but my bodily favour she was drawn to me as stones fall to the earth the laws that rule the earth conducted her unconsenting to my arms and i drew back at the thought of such a bridal and began to be jealous for myself  it was not thus that i desired to be loved  and then i began to fall into a great pity for the girl herself  i thought how sharp must be her mortification that she the student the recluse felipes saintly monitress should have thus confessed an overweening weakness for a man with whom she had never exchanged a word  and at the coming of pity all other thoughts were swallowed up and i longed only to find and console and reassure her to tell her how wholly her love was returned on my side and how her choice even if blindly made was not unworthy  the next day it was glorious weather depth upon depth of blue overcanopied the mountains the sun shone wide and the wind in the trees and the many falling torrents in the mountains filled the air with delicate and haunting music  yet i was prostrated with sadness  my heart wept for the sight of olalla as a child weeps for its mother  i sat down on a boulder on the verge of the low cliffs that bound the plateau to the north  thence i looked down into the wooded valley of a stream where no foot came  in the mood i was in it was even touching to behold the place untenanted it lacked olalla and i thought of the delight and glory of a life passed wholly with her in that strong air and among these rugged and lovely surroundings at first with a whimpering sentiment and then again with such a fiery joy that i seemed to grow in strength and stature like a samson  and then suddenly i was aware of olalla drawing near  she appeared out of a grove of corktrees and came straight towards me and i stood up and waited  she seemed in her walking a creature of such life and fire and lightness as amazed me yet she came quietly and slowly  her energy was in the slowness but for inimitable strength i felt she would have run she would have flown to me  still as she approached she kept her eyes lowered to the ground and when she had drawn quite near it was without one glance that she addressed me  at the first note of her voice i started  it was for this i had been waiting this was the last test of my love  and lo her enunciation was precise and clear not lisping and incomplete like that of her family and the voice though deeper than usual with women was still both youthful and womanly  she spoke in a rich chord golden contralto strains mingled with hoarseness as the red threads were mingled with the brown among her tresses  it was not only a voice that spoke to my heart directly but it spoke to me of her  and yet her words immediately plunged me back upon despair  you will go away she said today  her example broke the bonds of my speech i felt as lightened of a weight or as if a spell had been dissolved  i know not in what words i answered but standing before her on the cliffs i poured out the whole ardour of my love telling her that i lived upon the thought of her slept only to dream of her loveliness and would gladly forswear my country my language and my friends to live for ever by her side  and then strongly commanding myself i changed the note i reassured i comforted her i told her i had divined in her a pious and heroic spirit with which i was worthy to sympathise and which i longed to share and lighten  nature i told her was the voice of god which men disobey at peril and if we were thus humbly drawn together ay even as by a miracle of love it must imply a divine fitness in our souls we must be made i saidmade for one another  we should be mad rebels i cried outmad rebels against god not to obey this instinct  she shook her head  you will go today she repeated and then with a gesture and in a sudden sharp noteno not today she cried to morrow  but at this sign of relenting power came in upon me in a tide  i stretched out my arms and called upon her name and she leaped to me and clung to me  the hills rocked about us the earth quailed a shock as of a blow went through me and left me blind and dizzy  and the next moment she had thrust me back broken rudely from my arms and fled with the speed of a deer among the corktrees  i stood and shouted to the mountains i turned and went back towards the residencia waltzing upon air  she sent me away and yet i had but to call upon her name and she came to me  these were but the weaknesses of girls from which even she the strangest of her sex was not exempted go  not i olallao not i olalla my olalla  a bird sang near by and in that season birds were rare  it bade me be of good cheer  and once more the whole countenance of nature from the ponderous and stable mountains down to the lightest leaf and the smallest darting fly in the shadow of the groves began to stir before me and to put on the lineaments of life and wear a face of awful joy  the sunshine struck upon the hills strong as a hammer on the anvil and the hills shook the earth under that vigorous insulation yielded up heady scents the woods smouldered in the blaze  i felt the thrill of travail and delight run through the earth  something elemental something rude violent and savage in the love that sang in my heart was like a key to natures secrets and the very stones that rattled under my feet appeared alive and friendly  olalla  her touch had quickened and renewed and strung me up to the old pitch of concert with the rugged earth to a swelling of the soul that men learn to forget in their polite assemblies  love burned in me like rage tenderness waxed fierce i hated i adored i pitied i revered her with ecstasy  she seemed the link that bound me in with dead things on the one hand and with our pure and pitying god upon the other a thing brutal and divine and akin at once to the innocence and to the unbridled forces of the earth  my head thus reeling i came into the courtyard of the residencia and the sight of the mother struck me like a revelation  she sat there all sloth and contentment blinking under the strong sunshine branded with a passive enjoyment a creature set quite apart before whom my ardour fell away like a thing ashamed  i stopped a moment and commanding such shaken tones as i was able said a word or two  she looked at me with her unfathomable kindness her voice in reply sounded vaguely out of the realm of peace in which she slumbered and there fell on my mind for the first time a sense of respect for one so uniformly innocent and happy and i passed on in a kind of wonder at myself that i should be so much disquieted  on my table there lay a piece of the same yellow paper i had seen in the north room it was written on with pencil in the same hand olallas hand and i picked it up with a sudden sinking of alarm and read if you have any kindness for olalla if you have any chivalry for a creature sorely wrought go from here today in pity in honour for the sake of him who died i supplicate that you shall go  i looked at this awhile in mere stupidity then i began to awaken to a weariness and horror of life the sunshine darkened outside on the bare hills and i began to shake like a man in terror  the vacancy thus suddenly opened in my life unmanned me like a physical void  it was not my heart it was not my happiness it was life itself that was involved  i could not lose her  i said so and stood repeating it  and then like one in a dream i moved to the window put forth my hand to open the casement and thrust it through the pane  the blood spurted from my wrist and with an instantaneous quietude and command of myself i pressed my thumb on the little leaping fountain and reflected what to do  in that empty room there was nothing to my purpose i felt besides that i required assistance  there shot into my mind a hope that olalla herself might be my helper and i turned and went down stairs still keeping my thumb upon the wound  there was no sign of either olalla or felipe and i addressed myself to the recess whither the senora had now drawn quite back and sat dozing close before the fire for no degree of heat appeared too much for her  pardon me said i if i disturb you but i must apply to you for help  she looked up sleepily and asked me what it was and with the very words i thought she drew in her breath with a widening of the nostrils and seemed to come suddenly and fully alive  i have cut myself i said and rather badly  see  and i held out my two hands from which the blood was oozing and dripping  her great eyes opened wide the pupils shrank into points a veil seemed to fall from her face and leave it sharply expressive and yet inscrutable  and as i still stood marvelling a little at her disturbance she came swiftly up to me and stooped and caught me by the hand and the next moment my hand was at her mouth and she had bitten me to the bone  the pang of the bite the sudden spurting of blood and the monstrous horror of the act flashed through me all in one and i beat her back and she sprang at me again and again with bestial cries cries that i recognised such cries as had awakened me on the night of the high wind  her strength was like that of madness mine was rapidly ebbing with the loss of blood my mind besides was whirling with the abhorrent strangeness of the onslaught and i was already forced against the wall when olalla ran betwixt us and felipe following at a bound pinned down his mother on the floor  a trancelike weakness fell upon me i saw heard and felt but i was incapable of movement  i heard the struggle roll to and fro upon the floor the yells of that catamount ringing up to heaven as she strove to reach me  i felt olalla clasp me in her arms her hair falling on my face and with the strength of a man raise and half drag half carry me upstairs into my own room where she cast me down upon the bed  then i saw her hasten to the door and lock it and stand an instant listening to the savage cries that shook the residencia  and then swift and light as a thought she was again beside me binding up my hand laying it in her bosom moaning and mourning over it with dovelike sounds  they were not words that came to her they were sounds more beautiful than speech infinitely touching infinitely tender and yet as i lay there a thought stung to my heart a thought wounded me like a sword a thought like a worm in a flower profaned the holiness of my love  yes they were beautiful sounds and they were inspired by human tenderness but was their beauty human  all day i lay there  for a long time the cries of that nameless female thing as she struggled with her halfwitted whelp resounded through the house and pierced me with despairing sorrow and disgust  they were the deathcry of my love my love was murdered was not only dead but an offence to me and yet think as i pleased feel as i must it still swelled within me like a storm of sweetness and my heart melted at her looks and touch  this horror that had sprung out this doubt upon olalla this savage and bestial strain that ran not only through the whole behaviour of her family but found a place in the very foundations and story of our lovethough it appalled though it shocked and sickened me was yet not of power to break the knot of my infatuation  when the cries had ceased there came a scraping at the door by which i knew felipe was without and olalla went and spoke to himi know not what  with that exception she stayed close beside me now kneeling by my bed and fervently praying now sitting with her eyes upon mine  so then for these six hours i drank in her beauty and silently perused the story in her face  i saw the golden coin hover on her breaths i saw her eyes darken and brighter and still speak no language but that of an unfathomable kindness i saw the faultless face and through the robe the lines of the faultless body  night came at last and in the growing darkness of the chamber the sight of her slowly melted but even then the touch of her smooth hand lingered in mine and talked with me  to lie thus in deadly weakness and drink in the traits of the beloved is to reawake to love from whatever shock of disillusion  i reasoned with myself and i shut my eyes on horrors and again i was very bold to accept the worst  what mattered it if that imperious sentiment survived if her eyes still beckoned and attached me if now even as before every fibre of my dull body yearned and turned to her  late on in the night some strength revived in me and i spoke  olalla i said nothing matters i ask nothing i am content i love you  she knelt down awhile and prayed and i devoutly respected her devotions the moon had begun to shine in upon one side of each of the three windows and make a misty clearness in the room by which i saw her indistinctly  when she rearose she made the sign of the cross  it is for me to speak she said and for you to listen  i know you can but guess  i prayed how i prayed for you to leave this place  i begged it of you and i know you would have granted me even this or if not o let me think so  i love you i said  and yet you have lived in the world she said after a pause you are a man and wise and i am but a child  forgive me if i seem to teach who am as ignorant as the trees of the mountain but those who learn much do but skim the face of knowledge they seize the laws they conceive the dignity of the designthe horror of the living fact fades from their memory  it is we who sit at home with evil who remember i think and are warned and pity  go rather go now and keep me in mind  so i shall have a life in the cherished places of your memory a life as much my own as that which i lead in this body  i love you i said once more and reaching out my weak hand took hers and carried it to my lips and kissed it  nor did she resist but winced a little and i could see her look upon me with a frown that was not unkindly only sad and baffled  and then it seemed she made a call upon her resolution plucked my hand towards her herself at the same time leaning somewhat forward and laid it on the beating of her heart there she cried you feel the very footfall of my life  it only moves for you it is yours  but is it even mine  it is mine indeed to offer you as i might take the coin from my neck as i might break a live branch from a tree and give it you  and yet not mine  i dwell or i think i dwell if i exist at all somewhere apart an impotent prisoner and carried about and deafened by a mob that i disown  this capsule such as throbs against the sides of animals knows you at a touch for its master ay it loves you  but my soul does my soul  i think not i know not fearing to ask  yet when you spoke to me your words were of the soul it is of the soul that you askit is only from the soul that you would take me  olalla i said the soul and the body are one and mostly so in love what the body chooses the soul loves where the body clings the soul cleaves body for body soul to soul they come together at gods signal and the lower part if we can call aught low is only the footstool and foundation of the highest  have you she said seen the portraits in the house of my fathers have you looked at my mother or at felipe  have your eyes never rested on that picture that hangs by your bed  she who sat for it died ages ago and she did evil in her life  but lookagain there is my hand to the least line there are my eyes and my hair  what is mine then and what am i  if not a curve in this poor body of mine which you love and for the sake of which you dotingly dream that you love me not a gesture that i can frame not a tone of my voice not any look from my eyes no not even now when i speak to him i love but has belonged to others others ages dead have wooed other men with my eyes other men have heard the pleading of the same voice that now sounds in your ears  the hands of the dead are in my bosom they move me they pluck me they guide me i am a puppet at their command and i but reinform features and attributes that have long been laid aside from evil in the quiet of the grave  is it me you love friend or the race that made me  the girl who does not know and cannot answer for the least portion of herself or the stream of which she is a transitory eddy the tree of which she is the passing fruit  the race exists it is old it is ever young it carries its eternal destiny in its bosom upon it like waves upon the sea individual succeeds to individual mocked with a semblance of self control but they are nothing  we speak of the soul but the soul is in the race  you fret against the common law i said  you rebel against the voice of god which he has made so winning to convince so imperious to command  hear it and how it speaks between us  your hand clings to mine your heart leaps at my touch the unknown elements of which we are compounded awake and run together at a look the clay of the earth remembers its independent life and yearns to join us we are drawn together as the stars are turned about in space or as the tides ebb and flow by things older and greater than we ourselves  alas she said what can i say to you  my fathers eight hundred years ago ruled all this province they were wise great cunning and cruel they were a picked race of the spanish their flags led in war the king called them his cousin the people when the rope was slung for them or when they returned and found their hovels smoking blasphemed their name  presently a change began  man has risen if he has sprung from the brutes he can descend again to the same level  the breath of weariness blew on their humanity and the cords relaxed they began to go down their minds fell on sleep their passions awoke in gusts heady and senseless like the wind in the gutters of the mountains beauty was still handed down but no longer the guiding wit nor the human heart the seed passed on it was wrapped in flesh the flesh covered the bones but they were the bones and the flesh of brutes and their mind was as the mind of flies  i speak to you as i dare but you have seen for yourself how the wheel has gone backward with my doomed race  i stand as it were upon a little rising ground in this desperate descent and see both before and behind both what we have lost and to what we are condemned to go farther downward  and shall ii that dwell apart in the house of the dead my body loathing its waysshall i repeat the spell  shall i bind another spirit reluctant as my own into this bewitched and tempestbroken tenement that i now suffer in  shall i hand down this cursed vessel of humanity charge it with fresh life as with fresh poison and dash it like a fire in the faces of posterity  but my vow has been given the race shall cease from off the earth  at this hour my brother is making ready his foot will soon be on the stair and you will go with him and pass out of my sight for ever  think of me sometimes as one to whom the lesson of life was very harshly told but who heard it with courage as one who loved you indeed but who hated herself so deeply that her love was hateful to her as one who sent you away and yet would have longed to keep you for ever who had no dearer hope than to forget you and no greater fear than to be forgotten  she had drawn towards the door as she spoke her rich voice sounding softer and farther away and with the last word she was gone and i lay alone in the moonlit chamber  what i might have done had not i lain bound by my extreme weakness i know not but as it was there fell upon me a great and blank despair  it was not long before there shone in at the door the ruddy glimmer of a lantern and felipe coming charged me without a word upon his shoulders and carried me down to the great gate where the cart was waiting  in the moonlight the hills stood out sharply as if they were of cardboard on the glimmering surface of the plateau and from among the low trees which swung together and sparkled in the wind the great black cube of the residencia stood out bulkily its mass only broken by three dimly lighted windows in the northern front above the gate  they were olallas windows and as the cart jolted onwards i kept my eyes fixed upon them till where the road dipped into a valley they were lost to my view forever  felipe walked in silence beside the shafts but from time to time he would cheek the mule and seem to look back upon me and at length drew quite near and laid his hand upon my head  there was such kindness in the touch and such a simplicity as of the brutes that tears broke from me like the bursting of an artery  felipe i said take me where they will ask no questions  he said never a word but he turned his mule about end for end retraced some part of the way we had gone and striking into another path led me to the mountain village which was as we say in scotland the kirkton of that thinly peopled district  some broken memories dwell in my mind of the day breaking over the plain of the cart stopping of arms that helped me down of a bare room into which i was carried and of a swoon that fell upon me like sleep  the next day and the days following the old priest was often at my side with his snuffbox and prayer book and after a while when i began to pick up strength he told me that i was now on a fair way to recovery and must as soon as possible hurry my departure whereupon without naming any reason he took snuff and looked at me sideways  i did not affect ignorance i knew he must have seen olalla  sir said i you know that i do not ask in wantonness  what of that family  he said they were very unfortunate that it seemed a declining race and that they were very poor and had been much neglected  but she has not i said  thanks doubtless to yourself she is instructed and wise beyond the use of women  yes he said the senorita is wellinformed  but the family has been neglected  the mother i queried  yes the mother too said the padre taking snuff  but felipe is a wellintentioned lad  the mother is odd i asked  very odd replied the priest  i think sir we beat about the bush said i  you must know more of my affairs than you allow  you must know my curiosity to be justified on many grounds  will you not be frank with me  my son said the old gentleman i will be very frank with you on matters within my competence on those of which i know nothing it does not require much discretion to be silent  i will not fence with you i take your meaning perfectly and what can i say but that we are all in gods hands and that his ways are not as our ways  i have even advised with my superiors in the church but they too were dumb  it is a great mystery  is she mad i asked  i will answer you according to my belief  she is not returned the padre or she was not  when she was younggod help me i fear i neglected that wild lambshe was surely sane and yet although it did not run to such heights the same strain was already notable it had been so before her in her father ay and before him and this inclined me perhaps to think too lightly of it  but these things go on growing not only in the individual but in the race  when she was young i began and my voice failed me for a moment and it was only with a great effort that i was able to add was she like olalla  now god forbid exclaimed the padre  god forbid that any man should think so slightingly of my favourite penitent  no no the senorita but for her beauty which i wish most honestly she had less of has not a hairs resemblance to what her mother was at the same age  i could not bear to have you think so though heaven knows it were perhaps better that you should  at this i raised myself in bed and opened my heart to the old man telling him of our love and of her decision owning my own horrors my own passing fancies but telling him that these were at an end and with something more than a purely formal submission appealing to his judgment  he heard me very patiently and without surprise and when i had done he sat for some time silent  then he began the church and instantly broke off again to apologise  i had forgotten my child that you were not a christian said he  and indeed upon a point so highly unusual even the church can scarce be said to have decided  but would you have my opinion  the senorita is in a matter of this kind the best judge i would accept her judgment  on the back of that he went away nor was he thenceforward so assiduous in his visits indeed even when i began to get about again he plainly feared and deprecated my society not as in distaste but much as a man might be disposed to flee from the riddling sphynx  the villagers too avoided me they were unwilling to be my guides upon the mountain  i thought they looked at me askance and i made sure that the more superstitious crossed themselves on my approach  at first i set this down to my heretical opinions but it began at length to dawn upon me that if i was thus redoubted it was because i had stayed at the residencia  all men despise the savage notions of such peasantry and yet i was conscious of a chill shadow that seemed to fall and dwell upon my love  it did not conquer but i may not deify that it restrained my ardour  some miles westward of the village there was a gap in the sierra from which the eye plunged direct upon the residencia and thither it became my daily habit to repair  a wood crowned the summit and just where the pathway issued from its fringes it was overhung by a considerable shelf of rock and that in its turn was surmounted by a crucifix of the size of life and more than usually painful in design  this was my perch thence day after day i looked down upon the plateau and the great old house and could see felipe no bigger than a fly going to and fro about the garden  sometimes mists would draw across the view and be broken up again by mountain winds sometimes the plain slumbered below me in unbroken sunshine it would sometimes be all blotted out by rain  this distant post these interrupted sights of the place where my life had been so strangely changed suited the indecision of my humour  i passed whole days there debating with myself the various elements of our position now leaning to the suggestions of love now giving an ear to prudence and in the end halting irresolute between the two  one day as i was sitting on my rock there came by that way a somewhat gaunt peasant wrapped in a mantle  he was a stranger and plainly did not know me even by repute for instead of keeping the other side he drew near and sat down beside me and we had soon fallen in talk  among other things he told me he had been a muleteer and in former years had much frequented these mountains later on he had followed the army with his mules had realised a competence and was now living retired with his family  do you know that house i inquired at last pointing to the residencia for i readily wearied of any talk that kept me from the thought of olalla  he looked at me darkly and crossed himself  too well he said it was there that one of my comrades sold himself to satan the virgin shield us from temptations  he has paid the price he is now burning in the reddest place in hell  a fear came upon me i could answer nothing and presently the man resumed as if to himself yes he said o yes i know it  i have passed its doors  there was snow upon the pass the wind was driving it sure enough there was death that night upon the mountains but there was worse beside the hearth  i took him by the arm senor and dragged him to the gate i conjured him by all he loved and respected to go forth with me i went on my knees before him in the snow and i could see he was moved by my entreaty  and just then she came out on the gallery and called him by his name and he turned and there was she standing with a lamp in her hand and smiling on him to come back  i cried out aloud to god and threw my arms about him but he put me by and left me alone  he had made his choice god help us  i would pray for him but to what end there are sins that not even the pope can loose  and your friend i asked what became of him  nay god knows said the muleteer  if all be true that we hear his end was like his sin a thing to raise the hair  do you mean that he was killed i asked  sure enough he was killed returned the man  but how  ay how  but these are things that it is sin to speak of  the people of that house     i began  but he interrupted me with a savage outburst  the people he cried what people  there are neither men nor women in that house of satans what have you lived here so long and never heard  and here he put his mouth to my ear and whispered as if even the fowls of the mountain might have overheard and been stricken with horror  what he told me was not true nor was it even original being indeed but a new edition vamped up again by village ignorance and superstition of stories nearly as ancient as the race of man  it was rather the application that appalled me  in the old days he said the church would have burned out that nest of basilisks but the arm of the church was now shortened his friend miguel had been unpunished by the hands of men and left to the more awful judgment of an offended god  this was wrong but it should be so no more  the padre was sunk in age he was even bewitched himself but the eyes of his flock were now awake to their own danger and some dayay and before longthe smoke of that house should go up to heaven  he left me filled with horror and fear  which way to turn i knew not whether first to warn the padre or to carry my illnews direct to the threatened inhabitants of the residencia  fate was to decide for me for while i was still hesitating i beheld the veiled figure of a woman drawing near to me up the pathway  no veil could deceive my penetration by every line and every movement i recognised olalla and keeping hidden behind a corner of the rock i suffered her to gain the summit  then i came forward  she knew me and paused but did not speak i too remained silent and we continued for some time to gaze upon each other with a passionate sadness  i thought you had gone she said at length  it is all that you can do for meto go  it is all i ever asked of you  and you still stay  but do you know that every day heaps up the peril of death not only on your head but on ours  a report has gone about the mountain it is thought you love me and the people will not suffer it  i saw she was already informed of her danger and i rejoiced at it olalla i said i am ready to go this day this very hour but not alone  she stepped aside and knelt down before the crucifix to pray and i stood by and looked now at her and now at the object of her adoration now at the living figure of the penitent and now at the ghastly daubed countenance the painted wounds and the projected ribs of the image  the silence was only broken by the wailing of some large birds that circled sidelong as if in surprise or alarm about the summit of the hills presently olalla rose again turned towards me raised her veil and still leaning with one hand on the shaft of the crucifix looked upon me with a pale and sorrowful countenance  i have laid my hand upon the cross she said  the padre says you are no christian but look up for a moment with my eyes and behold the face of the man of sorrows  we are all such as he wasthe inheritors of sin we must all bear and expiate a past which was not ours there is in all of usay even in mea sparkle of the divine  like him we must endure for a little while until morning returns bringing peace  suffer me to pass on upon my way alone it is thus that i shall be least lonely counting for my friend him who is the friend of all the distressed it is thus that i shall be the most happy having taken my farewell of earthly happiness and willingly accepted sorrow for my portion  i looked at the face of the crucifix and though i was no friend to images and despised that imitative and grimacing art of which it was a rude example some sense of what the thing implied was carried home to my intelligence  the face looked down upon me with a painful and deadly contraction but the rays of a glory encircled it and reminded me that the sacrifice was voluntary  it stood there crowning the rock as it still stands on so many highway sides vainly preaching to passersby an emblem of sad and noble truths that pleasure is not an end but an accident that pain is the choice of the magnanimous that it is best to suffer all things and do well  i turned and went down the mountain in silence and when i looked back for the last time before the wood closed about my path i saw olalla still leaning on the crucifix     the treasure of franchard   chapter i  by the dying mountebank   they had sent for the doctor from bourron before six  about eight some villagers came round for the performance and were told how matters stood  it seemed a liberty for a mountebank to fall ill like real people and they made off again in dudgeon  by ten madame tentaillon was gravely alarmed and had sent down the street for doctor desprez  the doctor was at work over his manuscripts in one corner of the little diningroom and his wife was asleep over the fire in another when the messenger arrived  sapristi said the doctor you should have sent for me before  it was a case for hurry  and he followed the messenger as he was in his slippers and skullcap  the inn was not thirty yards away but the messenger did not stop there he went in at one door and out by another into the court and then led the way by a flight of steps beside the stable to the loft where the mountebank lay sick  if doctor desprez were to live a thousand years he would never forget his arrival in that room for not only was the scene picturesque but the moment made a date in his existence  we reckon our lives i hardly know why from the date of our first sorry appearance in society as if from a first humiliation for no actor can come upon the stage with a worse grace  not to go further back which would be judged too curious there are subsequently many moving and decisive accidents in the lives of all which would make as logical a period as this of birth and here for instance doctor desprez a man past forty who had made what is called a failure in life and was moreover married found himself at a new point of departure when he opened the door of the loft above tentaillons stable  it was a large place lighted only by a single candle set upon the floor the mountebank lay on his back upon a pallet a large man with a quixotic nose inflamed with drinking  madame tentaillon stooped over him applying a hot water and mustard embrocation to his feet and on a chair close by sat a little fellow of eleven or twelve with his feet dangling  these three were the only occupants except the shadows  but the shadows were a company in themselves the extent of the room exaggerated them to a gigantic size and from the low position of the candle the light struck upwards and produced deformed foreshortenings the mountebanks profile was enlarged upon the wall in caricature and it was strange to see his nose shorten and lengthen as the flame was blown about by draughts  as for madame tentaillon her shadow was no more than a gross hump of shoulders with now and again a hemisphere of head  the chair legs were spindled out as long as stilts and the boy set perched atop of them like a cloud in the corner of the roof  it was the boy who took the doctors fancy  he had a great arched skull the forehead and the hands of a musician and a pair of haunting eyes  it was not merely that these eyes were large or steady or the softest ruddy brown  there was a look in them besides which thrilled the doctor and made him half uneasy  he was sure he had seen such a look before and yet he could not remember how or where  it was as if this boy who was quite a stranger to him had the eyes of an old friend or an old enemy  and the boy would give him no peace he seemed profoundly indifferent to what was going on or rather abstracted from it in a superior contemplation beating gently with his feet against the bars of the chair and holding his hands folded on his lap  but for all that his eyes kept following the doctor about the room with a thoughtful fixity of gaze  desprez could not tell whether he was fascinating the boy or the boy was fascinating him  he busied himself over the sick man he put questions he felt the pulse he jested he grew a little hot and swore and still whenever he looked round there were the brown eyes waiting for his with the same inquiring melancholy gaze  at last the doctor hit on the solution at a leap  he remembered the look now  the little fellow although he was as straight as a dart had the eyes that go usually with a crooked back he was not at all deformed and yet a deformed person seemed to be looking at you from below his brows the doctor drew a long breath he was so much relieved to find a theory for he loved theories and to explain away his interest  for all that he despatched the invalid with unusual haste and still kneeling with one knee on the floor turned a little round and looked the boy over at his leisure  the boy was not in the least put out but looked placidly back at the doctor  is this your father asked desprez  oh no returned the boy my master  are you fond of him continued the doctor  no sir said the boy  madame tentaillon and desprez exchanged expressive glances  that is bad my man resumed the latter with a shade of sternness every one should be fond of the dying or conceal their sentiments and your master here is dying  if i have watched a bird a little while stealing my cherries i have a thought of disappointment when he flies away over my garden wall and i see him steer for the forest and vanish how much more a creature such as this so strong so astute so richly endowed with faculties  when i think that in a few hours the speech will be silenced the breath extinct and even the shadow vanished from the wall i who never saw him this lady who knew him only as a guest are touched with some affection  the boy was silent for a little and appeared to be reflecting  you did not know him he replied at last he was a bad man  he is a little pagan said the landlady  for that matter they are all the same these mountebanks tumblers artists and what not  they have no interior  but the doctor was still scrutinising the little pagan his eyebrows knotted and uplifted  what is your name he asked  jeanmarie said the lad  desprez leaped upon him with one of his sudden flashes of excitement and felt his head all over from an ethnological point of view  celtic celtic he said  celtic cried madame tentaillon who had perhaps confounded the word with hydrocephalous  poor lad is it dangerous  that depends returned the doctor grimly  and then once more addressing the boy and what do you do for your living jeanmarie he inquired  i tumble was the answer  so  tumble repeated desprez  probably healthful  i hazard the guess madame tentaillon that tumbling is a healthful way of life  and have you never done anything else but tumble  before i learned that i used to steal answered jeanmarie gravely  upon my word cried the doctor  you are a nice little man for your age  madame when my confrere comes from bourron you will communicate my unfavourable opinion  i leave the case in his hands but of course on any alarming symptom above all if there should be a sign of rally do not hesitate to knock me up  i am a doctor no longer i thank god but i have been one  good night madame  good sleep to you jeanmarie    chapter ii  morning talk   doctor desprez always rose early  before the smoke arose before the first cart rattled over the bridge to the days labour in the fields he was to be found wandering in his garden  now he would pick a bunch of grapes now he would eat a big pear under the trellice now he would draw all sorts of fancies on the path with the end of his cane now he would go down and watch the river running endlessly past the timber landing place at which he moored his boat  there was no time he used to say for making theories like the early morning  i rise earlier than any one else in the village he once boasted  it is a fair consequence that i know more and wish to do less with my knowledge  the doctor was a connoisseur of sunrises and loved a good theatrical effect to usher in the day  he had a theory of dew by which he could predict the weather  indeed most things served him to that end the sound of the bells from all the neighbouring villages the smell of the forest the visits and the behaviour of both birds and fishes the look of the plants in his garden the disposition of cloud the colour of the light and last although not least the arsenal of meteorological instruments in a louvreboarded hutch upon the lawn  ever since he had settled at gretz he had been growing more and more into the local meteorologist the unpaid champion of the local climate  he thought at first there was no place so healthful in the arrondissement  by the end of the second year he protested there was none so wholesome in the whole department  and for some time before he met jeanmarie he had been prepared to challenge all france and the better part of europe for a rival to his chosen spot  doctor he would saydoctor is a foul word  it should not be used to ladies  it implies disease  i remark it as a flaw in our civilisation that we have not the proper horror of disease  now i for my part have washed my hands of it i have renounced my laureation i am no doctor i am only a worshipper of the true goddess hygieia  ah believe me it is she who has the cestus  and here in this exiguous hamlet has she placed her shrine here she dwells and lavishes her gifts here i walk with her in the early morning and she shows me how strong she has made the peasants how fruitful she has made the fields how the trees grow up tall and comely under her eyes and the fishes in the river become clean and agile at her presencerheumatism he would cry on some malapert interruption o yes i believe we do have a little rheumatism  that could hardly be avoided you know on a river  and of course the place stands a little low and the meadows are marshy theres no doubt  but my dear sir look at bourron  bourron stands high  bourron is close to the forest plenty of ozone there you would say  well compared with gretz bourron is a perfect shambles  the morning after he had been summoned to the dying mountebank the doctor visited the wharf at the tail of his garden and had a long look at the running water  this he called prayer but whether his adorations were addressed to the goddess hygieia or some more orthodox deity never plainly appeared  for he had uttered doubtful oracles sometimes declaring that a river was the type of bodily health sometimes extolling it as the great moral preacher continually preaching peace continuity and diligence to mans tormented spirits  after he had watched a mile or so of the clear water running by before his eyes seen a fish or two come to the surface with a gleam of silver and sufficiently admired the long shadows of the trees falling half across the river from the opposite bank with patches of moving sunlight in between he strolled once more up the garden and through his house into the street feeling cool and renovated  the sound of his feet upon the causeway began the business of the day for the village was still sound asleep  the church tower looked very airy in the sunlight a few birds that turned about it seemed to swim in an atmosphere of more than usual rarity and the doctor walking in long transparent shadows filled his lungs amply and proclaimed himself well contented with the morning  on one of the posts before tentaillons carriage entry he espied a little dark figure perched in a meditative attitude and immediately recognised jeanmarie  aha he said stopping before him humorously with a hand on either knee  so we rise early in the morning do we  it appears to me that we have all the vices of a philosopher  the boy got to his feet and made a grave salutation  and how is our patient asked desprez  it appeared the patient was about the same  and why do you rise early in the morning he pursued  jeanmarie after a long silence professed that he hardly knew  you hardly know repeated desprez  we hardly know anything my man until we try to learn  interrogate your consciousness  come push me this inquiry home  do you like it  yes said the boy slowly yes i like it  and why do you like it continued the doctor  we are now pursuing the socratic method  why do you like it  it is quiet answered jeanmarie and i have nothing to do and then i feel as if i were good  doctor desprez took a seat on the post at the opposite side  he was beginning to take an interest in the talk for the boy plainly thought before he spoke and tried to answer truly  it appears you have a taste for feeling good said the doctor  now there you puzzle me extremely for i thought you said you were a thief and the two are incompatible  is it very bad to steal asked jeanmarie  such is the general opinion little boy replied the doctor  no but i mean as i stole explained the other  for i had no choice i think it is surely right to have bread it must be right to have bread there comes so plain a want of it  and then they beat me cruelly if i returned with nothing he added  i was not ignorant of right and wrong for before that i had been well taught by a priest who was very kind to me  the doctor made a horrible grimace at the word priest but it seemed to me when one had nothing to eat and was beaten it was a different affair  i would not have stolen for tartlets i believe but any one would steal for bakers bread  and so i suppose said the doctor with a rising sneer you prayed god to forgive you and explained the case to him at length  why sir asked jeanmarie  i do not see  your priest would see however retorted desprez  would he asked the boy troubled for the first time  i should have thought god would have known  eh snarled the doctor  i should have thought god would have understood me replied the other you do not i see but then it was god that made me think so was it not  little boy little boy said dr desprez i told you already you had the vices of philosophy if you display the virtues also i must go  i am a student of the blessed laws of health an observer of plain and temperate nature in her common walks and i cannot preserve my equanimity in presence of a monster  do you understand  no sir said the boy  i will make my meaning clear to you replied the doctor  look there at the skybehind the belfry first where it is so light and then up and up turning your chin back right to the top of the dome where it is already as blue as at noon  is not that a beautiful colour  does it not please the heart  we have seen it all our lives until it has grown in with our familiar thoughts  now changing his tone suppose that sky to become suddenly of a live and fiery amber like the colour of clear coals and growing scarlet towards the topi do not say it would be any the less beautiful but would you like it as well  i suppose not answered jeanmarie  neither do i like you returned the doctor roughly  i hate all odd people and you are the most curious little boy in all the world  jeanmarie seemed to ponder for a while and then he raised his head again and looked over at the doctor with an air of candid inquiry  but are not you a very curious gentleman he asked  the doctor threw away his stick bounded on the boy clasped him to his bosom and kissed him on both cheeks  admirable admirable imp he cried  what a morning what an hour for a theorist of fortytwo  no he continued apostrophising heaven i did not know such boys existed i was ignorant they made them so i had doubted of my race and now  it is like he added picking up his stick like a lovers meeting  i have bruised my favourite staff in that moment of enthusiasm  the injury however is not grave  he caught the boy looking at him in obvious wonder embarrassment and alarm  hullo said he why do you look at me like that  egad i believe the boy despises me  do you despise me boy  o no replied jeanmarie seriously only i do not understand  you must excuse me sir returned the doctor with gravity i am still so young  o hang him he added to himself  and he took his seat again and observed the boy sardonically  he has spoiled the quiet of my morning thought he  i shall be nervous all day and have a febricule when i digest  let me compose myself  and so he dismissed his preoccupations by an effort of the will which he had long practised and let his soul roam abroad in the contemplation of the morning  he inhaled the air tasting it critically as a connoisseur tastes a vintage and prolonging the expiration with hygienic gusto  he counted the little flecks of cloud along the sky  he followed the movements of the birds round the church towermaking long sweeps hanging poised or turning airy somersaults in fancy and beating the wind with imaginary pinions and in this way he regained peace of mind and animal composure conscious of his limbs conscious of the sight of his eyes conscious that the air had a cool taste like a fruit at the top of his throat and at last in complete abstraction he began to sing  the doctor had but one air malbrouck sen vaten guerre even with that he was on terms of mere politeness and his musical exploits were always reserved for moments when he was alone and entirely happy  he was recalled to earth rudely by a pained expression on the boys face what do you think of my singing he inquired stopping in the middle of a note and then after he had waited some little while and received no answer what do you think of my singing he repeated imperiously  i do not like it faltered jeanmarie  oh come cried the doctor  possibly you are a performer yourself  i sing better than that replied the boy  the doctor eyed him for some seconds in stupefaction  he was aware that he was angry and blushed for himself in consequence which made him angrier  if this is how you address your master he said at last with a shrug and a flourish of his arms  i do not speak to him at all returned the boy  i do not like him  then you like me snapped doctor desprez with unusual eagerness  i do not know answered jeanmarie  the doctor rose  i shall wish you a good morning he said  you are too much for me  perhaps you have blood in your veins perhaps celestial ichor or perhaps you circulate nothing more gross than respirable air but of one thing i am inexpugnably assuredthat you are no human being no boyshaking his stick at himyou are not a human being  write write it in your memoryi am not a human beingi have no pretension to be a human beingi am a dive a dream an angel an acrostic an illusionwhat you please but not a human being  and so accept my humble salutations and farewell  and with that the doctor made off along the street in some emotion and the boy stood mentally gaping where he left him    chapter iii  the adoption   madame desprez who answered to the christian name of anastasie presented an agreeable type of her sex exceedingly wholesome to look upon a stout brune with cool smooth cheeks steady dark eyes and hands that neither art nor nature could improve  she was the sort of person over whom adversity passes like a summer cloud she might in the worst of conjunctions knit her brows into one vertical furrow for a moment but the next it would be gone  she had much of the placidity of a contented nun with little of her piety however for anastasie was of a very mundane nature fond of oysters and old wine and somewhat bold pleasantries and devoted to her husband for her own sake rather than for his  she was imperturbably goodnatured but had no idea of selfsacrifice  to live in that pleasant old house with a green garden behind and bright flowers about the window to eat and drink of the best to gossip with a neighbour for a quarter of an hour never to wear stays or a dress except when she went to fontainebleau shopping to be kept in a continual supply of racy novels and to be married to doctor desprez and have no ground of jealousy filled the cup of her nature to the brim those who had known the doctor in bachelor days when he had aired quite as many theories but of a different order attributed his present philosophy to the study of anastasie  it was her brute enjoyment that he rationalised and perhaps vainly imitated  madame desprez was an artist in the kitchen and made coffee to a nicety she had a knack of tidiness with which she had infected the doctor everything was in its place everything capable of polish shone gloriously and dust was a thing banished from her empire  aline their single servant had no other business in the world but to scour and burnish  so doctor desprez lived in his house like a fatted calf warmed and cosseted to his hearts content  the midday meal was excellent  there was a ripe melon a fish from the river in a memorable bearnaise sauce a fat fowl in a fricassee and a dish of asparagus followed by some fruit  the doctor drank half a bottle plus one glass the wife half a bottle minus the same quantity which was a marital privilege of an excellent coterotie seven years old  then the coffee was brought and a flask of chartreuse for madame for the doctor despised and distrusted such decoctions and then aline left the wedded pair to the pleasures of memory and digestion  it is a very fortunate circumstance my cherished one observed the doctorthis coffee is adorablea very fortunate circumstance upon the wholeanastasie i beseech you go without that poison for today only one day and you will feel the benefit i pledge my reputation  what is this fortunate circumstance my friend inquired anastasie not heeding his protest which was of daily recurrence  that we have no children my beautiful replied the doctor  i think of it more and more as the years go on and with more and more gratitude towards the power that dispenses such afflictions  your health my darling my studious quiet our little kitchen delicacies how they would all have suffered how they would all have been sacrificed  and for what  children are the last word of human imperfection  health flees before their face  they cry my dear they put vexatious questions they demand to be fed to be washed to be educated to have their noses blown and then when the time comes they break our hearts as i break this piece of sugar  a pair of professed egoists like you and me should avoid offspring like an infidelity  indeed said she and she laughed  now that is like youto take credit for the thing you could not help  my dear returned the doctor solemnly we might have adopted  never cried madame  never doctor with my consent  if the child were my own flesh and blood i would not say no  but to take another persons indiscretion on my shoulders my dear friend i have too much sense  precisely replied the doctor  we both had  and i am all the better pleased with our wisdom becausebecause  he looked at her sharply  because what she asked with a faint premonition of danger  because i have found the right person said the doctor firmly and shall adopt him this afternoon  anastasie looked at him out of a mist  you have lost your reason she said and there was a clang in her voice that seemed to threaten trouble  not so my dear he replied i retain its complete exercise  to the proof instead of attempting to cloak my inconsistency i have by way of preparing you thrown it into strong relief  you will there i think recognise the philosopher who has the ecstasy to call you wife  the fact is i have been reckoning all this while without an accident  i never thought to find a son of my own  now last night i found one  do not unnecessarily alarm yourself my dear he is not a drop of blood to me that i know  it is his mind darling his mind that calls me father  his mind she repeated with a titter between scorn and hysterics  his mind indeed  henri is this an idiotic pleasantry or are you mad  his mind  and what of my mind  truly replied the doctor with a shrug you have your finger on the hitch  he will be strikingly antipathetic to my ever beautiful anastasie  she will never understand him he will never understand her you married the animal side of my nature dear and it is on the spiritual side that i find my affinity for jeanmarie  so much so that to be perfectly frank i stand in some awe of him myself  you will easily perceive that i am announcing a calamity for you  do not he broke out in tones of real solicitudedo not give way to tears after a meal anastasie  you will certainly give yourself a false digestion  anastasie controlled herself  you know how willing i am to humour you she said in all reasonable matters  but on this point  my dear love interrupted the doctor eager to prevent a refusal who wished to leave paris  who made me give up cards and the opera and the boulevard and my social relations and all that was my life before i knew you  have i been faithful  have i been obedient  have i not borne my doom with cheerfulness  in all honesty anastasie have i not a right to a stipulation on my side  i have and you know it  i stipulate my son  anastasie was aware of defeat she struck her colours instantly  you will break my heart she sighed  not in the least said he  you will feel a trifling inconvenience for a month just as i did when i was first brought to this vile hamlet then your admirable sense and temper will prevail and i see you already as content as ever and making your husband the happiest of men  you know i can refuse you nothing she said with a last flicker of resistance nothing that will make you truly happier  but will this are you sure my husband  last night you say you found him  he may be the worst of humbugs  i think not replied the doctor  but do not suppose me so unwary as to adopt him out of hand  i am i flatter myself a finished man of the world i have had all possibilities in view my plan is contrived to meet them all  i take the lad as stable boy  if he pilfer if he grumble if he desire to change i shall see i was mistaken i shall recognise him for no son of mine and send him tramping  you will never do so when the time comes said his wife i know your good heart  she reached out her hand to him with a sigh the doctor smiled as he took it and carried it to his lips he had gained his point with greater ease than he had dared to hope for perhaps the twentieth time he had proved the efficacy of his trusty argument his excalibur the hint of a return to paris  six months in the capital for a man of the doctors antecedents and relations implied no less a calamity than total ruin anastasie had saved the remainder of his fortune by keeping him strictly in the country  the very name of paris put her in a blue fear and she would have allowed her husband to keep a menagerie in the back garden let alone adopting a stableboy rather than permit the question of return to be discussed  about four of the afternoon the mountebank rendered up his ghost he had never been conscious since his seizure  doctor desprez was present at his last passage and declared the farce over  then he took jeanmarie by the shoulder and led him out into the inn garden where there was a convenient bench beside the river  here he sat him down and made the boy place himself on his left  jeanmarie he said very gravely this world is exceedingly vast and even france which is only a small corner of it is a great place for a little lad like you  unfortunately it is full of eager shouldering people moving on and there are very few bakers shops for so many eaters  your master is dead you are not fit to gain a living by yourself you do not wish to steal  no  your situation then is undesirable it is for the moment critical  on the other hand you behold in me a man not old though elderly still enjoying the youth of the heart and the intelligence a man of instruction easily situated in this worlds affairs keeping a good tablea man neither as friend nor host to be despised  i offer you your food and clothes and to teach you lessons in the evening which will be infinitely more to the purpose for a lad of your stamp than those of all the priests in europe  i propose no wages but if ever you take a thought to leave me the door shall be open and i will give you a hundred francs to start the world upon  in return i have an old horse and chaise which you would very speedily learn to clean and keep in order  do not hurry yourself to answer and take it or leave it as you judge aright  only remember this that i am no sentimentalist or charitable person but a man who lives rigorously to himself and that if i make the proposal it is for my own endsit is because i perceive clearly an advantage to myself  and now reflect  i shall be very glad  i do not see what else i can do  i thank you sir most kindly and i will try to be useful said the boy  thank you said the doctor warmly rising at the same time and wiping his brow for he had suffered agonies while the thing hung in the wind  a refusal after the scene at noon would have placed him in a ridiculous light before anastasie  how hot and heavy is the evening to be sure  i have always had a fancy to be a fish in summer jeanmarie here in the loing beside gretz  i should lie under a waterlily and listen to the bells which must sound most delicately down below  that would be a lifedo you not think so too  yes said jeanmarie  thank god you have imagination cried the doctor embracing the boy with his usual effusive warmth though it was a proceeding that seemed to disconcert the sufferer almost as much as if he had been an english schoolboy of the same age  and now he added i will take you to my wife  madame desprez sat in the diningroom in a cool wrapper  all the blinds were down and the tile floor had been recently sprinkled with water her eyes were half shut but she affected to be reading a novel as the they entered  though she was a bustling woman she enjoyed repose between whiles and had a remarkable appetite for sleep  the doctor went through a solemn form of introduction adding for the benefit of both parties you must try to like each other for my sake  he is very pretty said anastasie  will you kiss me my pretty little fellow  the doctor was furious and dragged her into the passage  are you a fool anastasie he said  what is all this i hear about the tact of women  heaven knows i have not met with it in my experience  you address my little philosopher as if he were an infant  he must be spoken to with more respect i tell you he must not be kissed and georgyporgyd like an ordinary child  i only did it to please you i am sure replied anastasie but i will try to do better  the doctor apologised for his warmth  but i do wish him he continued to feel at home among us  and really your conduct was so idiotic my cherished one and so utterly and distantly out of place that a saint might have been pardoned a little vehemence in disapproval  do do tryif it is possible for a woman to understand young peoplebut of course it is not and i waste my breath  hold your tongue as much as possible at least and observe my conduct narrowly it will serve you for a model  anastasie did as she was bidden and considered the doctors behaviour she observed that he embraced the boy three times in the course of the evening and managed generally to confound and abash the little fellow out of speech and appetite  but she had the true womanly heroism in little affairs  not only did she refrain from the cheap revenge of exposing the doctors errors to himself but she did her best to remove their illeffect on jeanmarie  when desprez went out for his last breath of air before retiring for the night she came over to the boys side and took his hand  you must not be surprised nor frightened by my husbands manners she said  he is the kindest of men but so clever that he is sometimes difficult to understand  you will soon grow used to him and then you will love him for that nobody can help  as for me you may be sure i shall try to make you happy and will not bother you at all  i think we should be excellent friends you and i  i am not clever but i am very goodnatured  will you give me a kiss  he held up his face and she took him in her arms and then began to cry the woman had spoken in complaisance but she had warmed to her own words and tenderness followed  the doctor entering found them enlaced he concluded that his wife was in fault and he was just beginning in an awful voice anastasie when she looked up at him smiling with an upraised finger and he held his peace wondering while she led the boy to his attic    chapter iv  the education of a philosopher   the installation of the adopted stableboy was thus happily effected and the wheels of life continued to run smoothly in the doctors house  jean marie did his horse and carriage duty in the morning sometimes helped in the housework sometimes walked abroad with the doctor to drink wisdom from the fountainhead and was introduced at night to the sciences and the dead tongues  he retained his singular placidity of mind and manner he was rarely in fault but he made only a very partial progress in his studies and remained much of a stranger in the family  the doctor was a pattern of regularity  all forenoon he worked on his great book the comparative pharmacopoeia or historical dictionary of all medicines which as yet consisted principally of slips of paper and pins  when finished it was to fill many personable volumes and to combine antiquarian interest with professional utility  but the doctor was studious of literary graces and the picturesque an anecdote a touch of manners a moral qualification or a sounding epithet was sure to be preferred before a piece of science a little more and he would have written the comparative pharmacopoeia in verse  the article mummia for instance was already complete though the remainder of the work had not progressed beyond the letter a  it was exceedingly copious and entertaining written with quaintness and colour exact erudite a literary article but it would hardly have afforded guidance to a practising physician of today  the feminine good sense of his wife had led her to point this out with uncompromising sincerity for the dictionary was duly read aloud to her betwixt sleep and waning as it proceeded towards an infinitely distant completion and the doctor was a little sore on the subject of mummies and sometimes resented an allusion with asperity  after the midday meal and a proper period of digestion he walked sometimes alone sometimes accompanied by jeanmarie for madame would have preferred any hardship rather than walk  she was as i have said a very busy person continually occupied about material comforts and ready to drop asleep over a novel the instant she was disengaged  this was the less objectionable as she never snored or grew distempered in complexion when she slept  on the contrary she looked the very picture of luxurious and appetising ease and woke without a start to the perfect possession of her faculties  i am afraid she was greatly an animal but she was a very nice animal to have about in this way she had little to do with jeanmarie but the sympathy which had been established between them on the first night remained unbroken they held occasional conversations mostly on household matters to the extreme disappointment of the doctor they occasionally sallied off together to that temple of debasing superstition the village church madame and he both in their sundays best drove twice a month to fontainebleau and returned laden with purchases and in short although the doctor still continued to regard them as irreconcilably antipathetic their relation was as intimate friendly and confidential as their natures suffered  i fear however that in her heart of hearts madame kindly despised and pitied the boy  she had no admiration for his class of virtues she liked a smart polite forward roguish sort of boy cap in hand light of foot meeting the eye she liked volubility charm a little vicethe promise of a second doctor desprez  and it was her indefeasible belief that jeanmarie was dull  poor dear boy she had said once how sad it is that he should be so stupid  she had never repeated that remark for the doctor had raged like a wild bull denouncing the brutal bluntness of her mind bemoaning his own fate to be so unequally mated with an ass and what touched anastasie more nearly menacing the table china by the fury of his gesticulations  but she adhered silently to her opinion and when jeanmarie was sitting stolid blank but not unhappy over his unfinished tasks she would snatch her opportunity in the doctors absence go over to him put her arms about his neck lay her cheek to his and communicate her sympathy with his distress  do not mind she would say i too am not at all clever and i can assure you that it makes no difference in life  the doctors view was naturally different  that gentleman never wearied of the sound of his own voice which was to say the truth agreeable enough to hear  he now had a listener who was not so cynically indifferent as anastasie and who sometimes put him on his mettle by the most relevant objections  besides was he not educating the boy  and education philosophers are agreed is the most philosophical of duties what can be more heavenly to poor mankind than to have ones hobby grow into a duty to the state  then indeed do the ways of life become ways of pleasantness  never had the doctor seen reason to be more content with his endowments  philosophy flowed smoothly from his lips  he was so agile a dialectician that he could trace his nonsense when challenged back to some root in sense and prove it to be a sort of flower upon his system  he slipped out of antinomies like a fish and left his disciple marvelling at the rabbis depth  moreover deep down in his heart the doctor was disappointed with the ill success of his more formal education  a boy chosen by so acute an observer for his aptitude and guided along the path of learning by so philosophic an instructor was bound by the nature of the universe to make a more obvious and lasting advance  now jeanmarie was slow in all things impenetrable in others and his power of forgetting was fully on a level with his power to learn  therefore the doctor cherished his peripatetic lectures to which the boy attended which he generally appeared to enjoy and by which he often profited  many and many were the talks they had together and health and moderation proved the subject of the doctors divagations  to these he lovingly returned  i lead you he would say by the green pastures  my system my beliefs my medicines are resumed in one phraseto avoid excess blessed nature healthy temperate nature abhors and exterminates excess  human law in this matter imitates at a great distance her provisions and we must strive to supplement the efforts of the law  yes boy we must be a law to ourselves and for ourselves and for our neighbourslex armataarmed emphatic tyrannous law  if you see a crapulous human ruin snuffing dash from him his box  the judge though in a way an admission of disease is less offensive to me than either the doctor or the priest  above all the doctorthe doctor and the purulent trash and garbage of his pharmacopoeia  pure airfrom the neighbourhood of a pinetum for the sake of the turpentineunadulterated wine and the reflections of an unsophisticated spirit in the presence of the works of naturethese my boy are the best medical appliances and the best religious comforts  devote yourself to these  hark there are the bells of bourron the wind is in the north it will be fair  how clear and airy is the sound  the nerves are harmonised and quieted the mind attuned to silence and observe how easily and regularly beats the heart your unenlightened doctor would see nothing in these sensations and yet you yourself perceive they are a part of healthdid you remember your cinchona this morning  good  cinchona also is a work of nature it is after all only the bark of a tree which we might gather for ourselves if we lived in the localitywhat a world is this  though a professed atheist i delight to bear my testimony to the world  look at the gratuitous remedies and pleasures that surround our path  the river runs by the garden end our bath our fishpond our natural system of drainage  there is a well in the court which sends up sparkling water from the earths very heart clean cool and with a little wine most wholesome  the district is notorious for its salubrity rheumatism is the only prevalent complaint and i myself have never had a touch of it i tell youand my opinion is based upon the coldest clearest processes of reasonif i if you desired to leave this home of pleasures it would be the duty it would be the privilege of our best friend to prevent us with a pistol bullet  one beautiful june day they sat upon the hill outside the village  the river as blue as heaven shone here and there among the foliage  the indefatigable birds turned and flickered about gretz church tower  a healthy wind blew from over the forest and the sound of innumerable thousands of treetops and innumerable millions on millions of green leaves was abroad in the air and filled the ear with something between whispered speech and singing  it seemed as if every blade of grass must hide a cigale and the fields rang merrily with their music jingling far and near as with the sleighbells of the fairy queen  from their station on the slope the eye embraced a large space of poplard plain upon the one hand the waving hilltops of the forest on the other and gretz itself in the middle a handful of roofs  under the bestriding arch of the blue heavens the place seemed dwindled to a toy  it seemed incredible that people dwelt and could find room to turn or air to breathe in such a corner of the world  the thought came home to the boy perhaps for the first time and he gave it words  how small it looks he sighed  ay replied the doctor small enough now  yet it was once a walled city thriving full of furred burgesses and men in armour humming with affairswith tall spires for aught that i know and portly towers along the battlements  a thousand chimneys ceased smoking at the curfew bell  there were gibbets at the gate as thick as scarecrows  in time of war the assault swarmed against it with ladders the arrows fell like leaves the defenders sallied hotly over the drawbridge each side uttered its cry as they plied their weapons  do you know that the walls extended as far as the commanderie  tradition so reports  alas what a long way off is all this confusionnothing left of it but my quiet words spoken in your earand the town itself shrunk to the hamlet underneath us  byandby came the english warsyou shall hear more of the english a stupid people who sometimes blundered into goodand gretz was taken sacked and burned  it is the history of many towns but gretz never rose again it was never rebuilt its ruins were a quarry to serve the growth of rivals and the stones of gretz are now erect along the streets of nemours  it gratifies me that our old house was the first to rise after the calamity when the town had come to an end it inaugurated the hamlet  i too am glad of that said jeanmarie  it should be the temple of the humbler virtues responded the doctor with a savoury gusto  perhaps one of the reasons why i love my little hamlet as i do is that we have a similar history she and i  have i told you that i was once rich  i do not think so answered jeanmarie  i do not think i should have forgotten  i am sorry you should have lost your fortune  sorry cried the doctor  why i find i have scarce begun your education after all  listen to me  would you rather live in the old gretz or in the new free from the alarms of war with the green country at the door without noise passports the exactions of the soldiery or the jangle of the curfewbell to send us off to bed by sundown  i suppose i should prefer the new replied the boy  precisely returned the doctor so do i  and in the same way i prefer my present moderate fortune to my former wealth  golden mediocrity cried the adorable ancients and i subscribe to their enthusiasm  have i not good wine good food good air the fields and the forest for my walk a house an admirable wife a boy whom i protest i cherish like a son  now if i were still rich i should indubitably make my residence in parisyou know parisparis and paradise are not convertible terms  this pleasant noise of the wind streaming among leaves changed into the grinding babel of the street the stupid glare of plaster substituted for this quiet pattern of greens and greys the nerves shattered the digestion falsifiedpicture the fall  already you perceive the consequences the mind is stimulated the heart steps to a different measure and the man is himself no longer  i have passionately studied myselfthe true business of philosophy  i know my character as the musician knows the ventages of his flute  should i return to paris i should ruin myself gambling nay i go furtheri should break the heart of my anastasie with infidelities  this was too much for jeanmarie  that a place should so transform the most excellent of men transcended his belief  paris he protested was even an agreeable place of residence  nor when i lived in that city did i feel much difference he pleaded  what cried the doctor  did you not steal when you were there  but the boy could never be brought to see that he had done anything wrong when he stole  nor indeed did the doctor think he had but that gentleman was never very scrupulous when in want of a retort  and now he concluded do you begin to understand  my only friends were those who ruined me  gretz has been my academy my sanatorium my heaven of innocent pleasures  if millions are offered me i wave them back retro sathanasevil one begone  fix your mind on my example despise riches avoid the debasing influence of cities hygienehygiene and mediocrity of fortunethese be your watchwords during life  the doctors system of hygiene strikingly coincided with his tastes and his picture of the perfect life was a faithful description of the one he was leading at the time  but it is easy to convince a boy whom you supply with all the facts for the discussion  and besides there was one thing admirable in the philosophy and that was the enthusiasm of the philosopher  there was never any one more vigorously determined to be pleased and if he was not a great logician and so had no right to convince the intellect he was certainly something of a poet and had a fascination to seduce the heart  what he could not achieve in his customary humour of a radiant admiration of himself and his circumstances he sometimes effected in his fits of gloom  boy he would say avoid me today  if i were superstitious i should even beg for an interest in your prayers  i am in the black fit the evil spirit of king saul the hag of the merchant abudah the personal devil of the mediaeval monk is with meis in me tapping on his breast  the vices of my nature are now uppermost innocent pleasures woo me in vain i long for paris for my wallowing in the mire  see he would continue producing a handful of silver i denude myself i am not to be trusted with the price of a fare  take it keep it for me squander it on deleterious candy throw it in the deepest of the riveri will homologate your action  save me from that part of myself which i disown  if you see me falter do not hesitate if necessary wreck the train  i speak of course by a parable  any extremity were better than for me to reach paris alive  doubtless the doctor enjoyed these little scenes as a variation in his part they represented the byronic element in the somewhat artificial poetry of his existence but to the boy though he was dimly aware of their theatricality they represented more  the doctor made perhaps too little the boy possibly too much of the reality and gravity of these temptations  one day a great light shone for jeanmarie  could not riches be used well he asked  in theory yes replied the doctor  but it is found in experience that no one does so  all the world imagine they will be exceptional when they grow wealthy but possession is debasing new desires spring up and the silly taste for ostentation eats out the heart of pleasure  then you might be better if you had less said the boy  certainly not replied the doctor but his voice quavered as he spoke  why demanded pitiless innocence  doctor desprez saw all the colours of the rainbow in a moment the stable universe appeared to be about capsizing with him  because said heaffecting deliberation after an obvious pausebecause i have formed my life for my present income  it is not good for men of my years to be violently dissevered from their habits  that was a sharp brush  the doctor breathed hard and fell into taciturnity for the afternoon  as for the boy he was delighted with the resolution of his doubts even wondered that he had not foreseen the obvious and conclusive answer  his faith in the doctor was a stout piece of goods  desprez was inclined to be a sheet in the winds eye after dinner especially after rhone wine his favourite weakness  he would then remark on the warmth of his feeling for anastasie and with inflamed cheeks and a loose flustered smile debate upon all sorts of topics and be feebly and indiscreetly witty  but the adopted stableboy would not permit himself to entertain a doubt that savoured of ingratitude  it is quite true that a man may be a second father to you and yet take too much to drink but the best natures are ever slow to accept such truths  the doctor thoroughly possessed his heart but perhaps he exaggerated his influence over his mind  certainly jeanmarie adopted some of his masters opinions but i have yet to learn that he ever surrendered one of his own  convictions existed in him by divine right they were virgin unwrought the brute metal of decision  he could add others indeed but he could not put away neither did he care if they were perfectly agreed among themselves and his spiritual pleasures had nothing to do with turning them over or justifying them in words  words were with him a mere accomplishment like dancing  when he was by himself his pleasures were almost vegetable  he would slip into the woods towards acheres and sit in the mouth of a cave among grey birches his soul stared straight out of his eyes he did not move or think sunlight thin shadows moving in the wind the edge of firs against the sky occupied and bound his faculties  he was pure unity a spirit wholly abstracted  a single mood filled him to which all the objects of sense contributed as the colours of the spectrum merge and disappear in white light  so while the doctor made himself drunk with words the adopted stableboy bemused himself with silence    chapter v  treasure trove   the doctors carriage was a twowheeled gig with a hood a kind of vehicle in much favour among country doctors  on how many roads has one not seen it a great way off between the poplarsin how many village streets tied to a gatepost  this sort of chariot is affectedparticularly at the trotby a kind of pitching movement to and fro across the axle which well entitles it to the style of a noddy  the hood describes a considerable arc against the landscape with a solemnly absurd effect on the contemplative pedestrian  to ride in such a carriage cannot be numbered among the things that appertain to glory but i have no doubt it may be useful in liver complaint  thence perhaps its wide popularity among physicians  one morning early jeanmarie led forth the doctors noddy opened the gate and mounted to the drivingseat  the doctor followed arrayed from top to toe in spotless linen armed with an immense fleshcoloured umbrella and girt with a botanical case on a baldric and the equipage drove off smartly in a breeze of its own provocation  they were bound for franchard to collect plants with an eye to the comparative pharmacopoeia  a little rattling on the open roads and they came to the borders of the forest and struck into an unfrequented track the noddy yawed softly over the sand with an accompaniment of snapping twigs  there was a great green softly murmuring cloud of congregated foliage overhead  in the arcades of the forest the air retained the freshness of the night  the athletic bearing of the trees each carrying its leafy mountain pleased the mind like so many statues and the lines of the trunk led the eye admiringly upward to where the extreme leaves sparkled in a patch of azure  squirrels leaped in mid air  it was a proper spot for a devotee of the goddess hygieia  have you been to franchard jeanmarie inquired the doctor  i fancy not  never replied the boy  it is ruin in a gorge continued desprez adopting his expository voice the ruin of a hermitage and chapel  history tells us much of franchard how the recluse was often slain by robbers how he lived on a most insufficient diet how he was expected to pass his days in prayer  a letter is preserved addressed to one of these solitaries by the superior of his order full of admirable hygienic advice bidding him go from his book to praying and so back again for varietys sake and when he was weary of both to stroll about his garden and observe the honey bees  it is to this day my own system  you must often have remarked me leaving the pharmacopoeiaoften even in the middle of a phraseto come forth into the sun and air  i admire the writer of that letter from my heart he was a man of thought on the most important subjects  but indeed had i lived in the middle ages i am heartily glad that i did not i should have been an eremite myselfif i had not been a professed buffoon that is  these were the only philosophical lives yet open laughter or prayer sneers we might say and tears  until the sun of the positive arose the wise man had to make his choice between these two  i have been a buffoon of course observed jeanmarie  i cannot imagine you to have excelled in your profession said the doctor admiring the boys gravity  do you ever laugh  oh yes replied the other  i laugh often  i am very fond of jokes  singular being said desprez  but i divagate i perceive in a thousand ways that i grow old  franchard was at length destroyed in the english wars the same that levelled gretz  buthere is the pointthe hermits for there were already more than one had foreseen the danger and carefully concealed the sacrificial vessels  these vessels were of monstrous value jeanmariemonstrous valuepriceless we may say exquisitely worked of exquisite material  and now mark me they have never been found  in the reign of louis quatorze some fellows were digging hard by the ruins  suddenlytockthe spade hit upon an obstacle  imagine the men fooling one to another imagine how their hearts bounded how their colour came and went  it was a coffer and in franchard the place of buried treasure  they tore it open like famished beasts  alas it was not the treasure only some priestly robes which at the touch of the eating air fell upon themselves and instantly wasted into dust  the perspiration of these good fellows turned cold upon them jeanmarie  i will pledge my reputation if there was anything like a cutting wind one or other had a pneumonia for his trouble  i should like to have seen them turning into dust said jeanmarie otherwise i should not have cared so greatly  you have no imagination cried the doctor  picture to yourself the scene  dwell on the ideaa great treasure lying in the earth for centuries the material for a giddy copious opulent existence not employed dresses and exquisite pictures unseen the swiftest galloping horses not stirring a hoof arrested by a spell women with the beautiful faculty of smiles not smiling cards dice opera singing orchestras castles beautiful parks and gardens big ships with a tower of sailcloth all lying unborn in a coffinand the stupid trees growing overhead in the sunlight year after year  the thought drives one frantic  it is only money replied jeanmarie  it would do harm  o come cried desprez that is philosophy it is all very fine but not to the point just now  and besides it is not only money as you call it there are works of art in the question the vessels were carved you speak like a child  you weary me exceedingly quoting my words out of all logical connection like a parroquet  and at any rate we have nothing to do with it returned the boy submissively  they struck the route ronde at that moment and the sudden change to the rattling causeway combined with the doctors irritation to keep him silent  the noddy jigged along the trees went by looking on silently as if they had something on their minds  the quadrilateral was passed then came franchard  they put up the horse at the little solitary inn and went forth strolling  the gorge was dyed deeply with heather the rocks and birches standing luminous in the sun  a great humming of bees about the flowers disposed jeanmarie to sleep and he sat down against a clump of heather while the doctor went briskly to and fro with quick turns culling his simples  the boys head had fallen a little forward his eyes were closed his fingers had fallen lax about his knees when a sudden cry called him to his feet  it was a strange sound thin and brief it fell dead and silence returned as though it had never been interrupted  he had not recognised the doctors voice but as there was no one else in all the valley it was plainly the doctor who had given utterance to the sound he looked right and left and there was desprez standing in a niche between two boulders and looking round on his adopted son with a countenance as white as paper  a viper cried jeanmarie running towards him  a viper  you are bitten  the doctor came down heavily out of the cleft and advanced in silence to meet the boy whom he took roughly by the shoulder  i have found it he said with a gasp  a plant asked jeanmarie  desprez had a fit of unnatural gaiety which the rocks took up and mimicked  a plant he repeated scornfully  wellyesa plant  and here he added suddenly showing his right hand which he had hitherto concealed behind his backhere is one of the bulbs  jeanmarie saw a dirty platter coated with earth  that said he  it is a plate  it is a coach and horses cried the doctor  boy he continued growing warmer i plucked away a great pad of moss from between these boulders and disclosed a crevice and when i looked in what do you suppose i saw  i saw a house in paris with a court and garden i saw my wife shining with diamonds i saw myself a deputy i saw youwell ii saw your future he concluded rather feebly  i have just discovered america he added  but what is it asked the boy  the treasure of franchard cried the doctor and throwing his brown straw hat upon the ground he whooped like an indian and sprang upon jean marie whom he suffocated with embraces and bedewed with tears  then he flung himself down among the heather and once more laughed until the valley rang  but the boy had now an interest of his own a boys interest  no sooner was he released from the doctors accolade than he ran to the boulders sprang into the niche and thrusting his hand into the crevice drew forth one after another encrusted with the earth of ages the flagons candlesticks and patens of the hermitage of franchard  a casket came last tightly shut and very heavy  o what fun he cried  but when he looked back at the doctor who had followed close behind and was silently observing the words died from his lips  desprez was once more the colour of ashes his lip worked and trembled a sort of bestial greed possessed him  this is childish he said  we lose precious time  back to the inn harness the trap and bring it to yon bank  run for your life and remembernot one whisper  i stay here to watch  jeanmarie did as he was bid though not without surprise  the noddy was brought round to the spot indicated and the two gradually transported the treasure from its place of concealment to the boot below the driving seat  once it was all stored the doctor recovered his gaiety  i pay my grateful duties to the genius of this dell he said  o for a live coal a heifer and a jar of country wine  i am in the vein for sacrifice for a superb libation  well and why not  we are at franchard  english pale ale is to be hadnot classical indeed but excellent  boy we shall drink ale  but i thought it was so unwholesome said jeanmarie and very dear besides  fiddlededee exclaimed the doctor gaily  to the inn  and he stepped into the noddy tossing his head with an elastic youthful air  the horse was turned and in a few seconds they drew up beside the palings of the inn garden  here said desprezhere near the table so that we may keep an eye upon things  they tied the horse and entered the garden the doctor singing now in fantastic high notes now producing deep reverberations from his chest he took a seat rapped loudly on the table assailed the waiter with witticisms and when the bottle of bass was at length produced far more charged with gas than the most delirious champagne he filled out a long glassful of froth and pushed it over to jeanmarie  drink he said drink deep  i would rather not faltered the boy true to his training  what thundered desprez  i am afraid of it said jeanmarie my stomach  take it or leave it interrupted desprez fiercely but understand it once for allthere is nothing so contemptible as a precisian  here was a new lesson  the boy sat bemused looking at the glass but not tasting it while the doctor emptied and refilled his own at first with clouded brow but gradually yielding to the sun the heady prickling beverage and his own predisposition to be happy  once in a way he said at last by way of a concession to the boys more rigorous attitude once in a way and at so critical a moment this ale is a nectar for the gods  the habit indeed is debasing wine the juice of the grape is the true drink of the frenchman as i have often had occasion to point out and i do not know that i can blame you for refusing this outlandish stimulant  you can have some wine and cakes  is the bottle empty  well we will not be proud we will have pity on your glass  the beer being done the doctor chafed bitterly while jeanmarie finished his cakes  i burn to be gone he said looking at his watch  good god how slow you eat  and yet to eat slowly was his own particular prescription the main secret of longevity  his martyrdom however reached an end at last the pair resumed their places in the buggy and desprez leaning luxuriously back announced his intention of proceeding to fontainebleau  to fontainebleau repeated jeanmarie  my words are always measured said the doctor  on  the doctor was driven through the glades of paradise the air the light the shining leaves the very movements of the vehicle seemed to fall in tune with his golden meditations with his head thrown back he dreamed a series of sunny visions ale and pleasure dancing in his veins  at last he spoke  i shall telegraph for casimir he said  good casimir a fellow of the lower order of intelligence jeanmarie distinctly not creative not poetic and yet he will repay your study his fortune is vast and is entirely due to his own exertions  he is the very fellow to help us to dispose of our trinkets find us a suitable house in paris and manage the details of our installation  admirable casimir one of my oldest comrades  it was on his advice i may add that i invested my little fortune in turkish bonds when we have added these spoils of the mediaeval church to our stake in the mahometan empire little boy we shall positively roll among doubloons positively roll  beautiful forest he cried farewell  though called to other scenes i will not forget thee thy name is graven in my heart  under the influence of prosperity i become dithyrambic jeanmarie  such is the impulse of the natural soul such was the constitution of primaeval man  and iwell i will not refuse the crediti have preserved my youth like a virginity another who should have led the same snoozing countryfied existence for these years another had become rusted become stereotype but i i praise my happy constitution retain the spring unbroken  fresh opulence and a new sphere of duties find me unabated in ardour and only more mature by knowledge  for this prospective change jeanmarieit may probably have shocked you  tell me now did it not strike you as an inconsistency confessit is useless to dissembleit pained you  yes said the boy  you see returned the doctor with sublime fatuity i read your thoughts  nor am i surprisedyour education is not yet complete the higher duties of men have not been yet presented to you fully  a hinttill we have leisuremust suffice  now that i am once more in possession of a modest competence now that i have so long prepared myself in silent meditation it becomes my superior duty to proceed to paris  my scientific training my undoubted command of language mark me out for the service of my country  modesty in such a case would be a snare  if sin were a philosophical expression i should call it sinful a man must not deny his manifest abilities for that is to evade his obligations  i must be up and doing i must be no skulker in lifes battle  so he rattled on copiously greasing the joint of his inconsistency with words while the boy listened silently his eyes fixed on the horse his mind seething  it was all lost eloquence no array of words could unsettle a belief of jeanmaries and he drove into fontainebleau filled with pity horror indignation and despair  in the town jeanmarie was kept a fixture on the drivingseat to guard the treasure while the doctor with a singular slightly tipsy airiness of manner fluttered in and out of cafes where he shook hands with garrison officers and mixed an absinthe with the nicety of old experience in and out of shops from which he returned laden with costly fruits real turtle a magnificent piece of silk for his wife a preposterous cane for himself and a kepi of the newest fashion for the boy in and out of the telegraph office whence he despatched his telegram and where three hours later he received an answer promising a visit on the morrow and generally pervaded fontainebleau with the first fine aroma of his divine good humour  the sun was very low when they set forth again the shadows of the forest trees extended across the broad white road that led them home the penetrating odour of the evening wood had already arisen like a cloud of incense from that broad field of treetops and even in the streets of the town where the air had been baked all day between white walls it came in whiffs and pulses like a distant music  halfway home the last gold flicker vanished from a great oak upon the left and when they came forth beyond the borders of the wood the plain was already sunken in pearly greyness and a great pale moon came swinging skyward through the filmy poplars  the doctor sang the doctor whistled the doctor talked  he spoke of the woods and the wars and the deposition of dew he brightened and babbled of paris he soared into cloudy bombast on the glories of the political arena  all was to be changed as the day departed it took with it the vestiges of an outworn existence and tomorrows sun was to inaugurate the new  enough he cried of this life of maceration  his wife still beautiful or he was sadly partial was to be no longer buried she should now shine before society  jeanmarie would find the world at his feet the roads open to success wealth honour and posthumous renown  and o by the way said he for gods sake keep your tongue quiet  you are of course a very silent fellow it is a quality i gladly recognise in yousilence golden silence  but this is a matter of gravity  no word must get abroad none but the good casimir is to be trusted we shall probably dispose of the vessels in england  but are they not even ours the boy said almost with a sobit was the only time he had spoken  ours in this sense that they are nobody elses replied the doctor but the state would have some claim  if they were stolen for instance we should be unable to demand their restitution we should have no title we should be unable even to communicate with the police  such is the monstrous condition of the law 263  it is a mere instance of what remains to be done of the injustices that may yet be righted by an ardent active and philosophical deputy  jeanmarie put his faith in madame desprez and as they drove forward down the road from bourron between the rustling poplars he prayed in his teeth and whipped up the horse to an unusual speed  surely as soon as they arrived madame would assert her character and bring this waking nightmare to an end  their entrance into gretz was heralded and accompanied by a most furious barking all the dogs in the village seemed to smell the treasure in the noddy  but there was no one in the street save three lounging landscape painters at tentaillons door  jeanmarie opened the green gate and led in the horse and carriage and almost at the same moment madame desprez came to the kitchen threshold with a lighted lantern for the moon was not yet high enough to clear the garden walls  close the gates jeanmarie cried the doctor somewhat unsteadily alighting  anastasie where is aline  she has gone to montereau to see her parents said madame  all is for the best exclaimed the doctor fervently  here quick come near to me i do not wish to speak too loud he continued darling we are wealthy  wealthy repeated the wife  i have found the treasure of franchard replied her husband  see here are the first fruits a pineapple a dress for my everbeautifulit will suit hertrust a husbands trust a lovers taste  embrace me darling  this grimy episode is over the butterfly unfolds its painted wings  tomorrow casimir will come in a week we may be in parishappy at last  you shall have diamonds  jeanmarie take it out of the boot with religious care and bring it piece by piece into the diningroom  we shall have plate at table  darling hasten and prepare this turtle it will be a whetit will be an addition to our meagre ordinary  i myself will proceed to the cellar  we shall have a bottle of that little beaujolais you like and finish with the hermitage there are still three bottles left  worthy wine for a worthy occasion  but my husband you put me in a whirl she cried  i do not comprehend  the turtle my adored the turtle cried the doctor and he pushed her towards the kitchen lantern and all  jeanmarie stood dumfounded  he had pictured to himself a different scenea more immediate protest and his hope began to dwindle on the spot  the doctor was everywhere a little doubtful on his legs perhaps and now and then taking the wall with his shoulder for it was long since he had tasted absinthe and he was even then reflecting that the absinthe had been a misconception  not that he regretted excess on such a glorious day but he made a mental memorandum to beware he must not a second time become the victim of a deleterious habit  he had his wine out of the cellar in a twinkling he arranged the sacrificial vessels some on the white tablecloth some on the sideboard still crusted with historic earth  he was in and out of the kitchen plying anastasie with vermouth heating her with glimpses of the future estimating their new wealth at ever larger figures and before they sat down to supper the ladys virtue had melted in the fire of his enthusiasm her timidity had disappeared she too had begun to speak disparagingly of the life at gretz and as she took her place and helped the soup her eyes shone with the glitter of prospective diamonds  all through the meal she and the doctor made and unmade fairy plans they bobbed and bowed and pledged each other  their faces ran over with smiles their eyes scattered sparkles as they projected the doctors political honours and the ladys drawingroom ovations  but you will not be a red cried anastasie  i am left centre to the core replied the doctor  madame gastein will present uswe shall find ourselves forgotten said the lady  never protested the doctor  beauty and talent leave a mark  i have positively forgotten how to dress she sighed  darling you make me blush cried he  yours has been a tragic marriage  but your successto see you appreciated honoured your name in all the papers that will be more than pleasureit will be heaven she cried  and once a week said the doctor archly scanning the syllables once a weekone good little game of baccarat  only once a week she questioned threatening him with a finger  i swear it by my political honour cried he  i spoil you she said and gave him her hand  he covered it with kisses  jeanmarie escaped into the night  the moon swung high over gretz  he went down to the garden end and sat on the jetty  the river ran by with eddies of oily silver and a low monotonous song  faint veils of mist moved among the poplars on the farther side  the reeds were quietly nodding  a hundred times already had the boy sat on such a night and watched the streaming river with untroubled fancy  and this perhaps was to be the last  he was to leave this familiar hamlet this green rustling country this bright and quiet stream he was to pass into the great city his dear lady mistress was to move bedizened in saloons his good garrulous kindhearted master to become a brawling deputy and both be lost for ever to jeanmarie and their better selves  he knew his own defects he knew he must sink into less and less consideration in the turmoil of a city life sink more and more from the child into the servant  and he began dimly to believe the doctors prophecies of evil he could see a change in both  his generous incredulity failed him for this once a child must have perceived that the hermitage had completed what the absinthe had begun  if this were the first day what would be the last  if necessary wreck the train thought he remembering the doctors parable  he looked round on the delightful scene he drank deep of the charmed night air laden with the scent of hay  if necessary wreck the train he repeated  and he rose and returned to the house    chapter vi  a criminal investigation in two parts   the next morning there was a most unusual outcry in the doctors house the last thing before going to bed the doctor had locked up some valuables in the diningroom cupboard and behold when he rose again as he did about four oclock the cupboard had been broken open and the valuables in question had disappeared  madame and jeanmarie were summoned from their rooms and appeared in hasty toilets they found the doctor raving calling the heavens to witness and avenge his injury pacing the room barefooted with the tails of his nightshirt flirting as he turned  gone he said the things are gone the fortune gone  we are paupers once more  boy what do you know of this  speak up sir speak up  do you know of it  where are they  he had him by the arm shaking him like a bag and the boys words if he had any were jolted forth in inarticulate murmurs  the doctor with a revulsion from his own violence set him down again  he observed anastasie in tears anastasie he said in quite an altered voice compose yourself command your feelings  i would not have you give way to passion like the vulgar  thisthis trifling accident must be lived down  jeanmarie bring me my smaller medicine chest  a gentle laxative is indicated  and he dosed the family all round leading the way himself with a double quantity  the wretched anastasie who had never been ill in the whole course of her existence and whose soul recoiled from remedies wept floods of tears as she sipped and shuddered and protested and then was bullied and shouted at until she sipped again  as for jeanmarie he took his portion down with stoicism  i have given him a less amount observed the doctor his youth protecting him against emotion  and now that we have thus parried any morbid consequences let us reason  i am so cold wailed anastasie  cold cried the doctor  i give thanks to god that i am made of fierier material  why madam a blow like this would set a frog into a transpiration  if you are cold you can retire and by the way you might throw me down my trousers  it is chilly for the legs  oh no protested anastasie i will stay with you  nay madam you shall not suffer for your devotion said the doctor  i will myself fetch you a shawl  and he went upstairs and returned more fully clad and with an armful of wraps for the shivering anastasie  and now he resumed to investigate this crime  let us proceed by induction  anastasie do you know anything that can help us  anastasie knew nothing  or you jeanmarie  not i replied the boy steadily  good returned the doctor  we shall now turn our attention to the material evidences  i was born to be a detective i have the eye and the systematic spirit  first violence has been employed  the door was broken open and it may be observed in passing that the lock was dear indeed at what i paid for it a crow to pluck with master goguelat second here is the instrument employed one of our own tableknives one of our best my dear which seems to indicate no preparation on the part of the gangif gang it was  thirdly i observe that nothing has been removed except the franchard dishes and the casket our own silver has been minutely respected  this is wily it shows intelligence a knowledge of the code a desire to avoid legal consequences  i argue from this fact that the gang numbers persons of respectabilityoutward of course and merely outward as the robbery proves  but i argue second that we must have been observed at franchard itself by some occult observer and dogged throughout the day with a skill and patience that i venture to qualify as consummate  no ordinary man no occasional criminal would have shown himself capable of this combination  we have in our neighbourhood it is far from improbable a retired bandit of the highest order of intelligence  good heaven cried the horrified anastasie  henri how can you  my cherished one this is a process of induction said the doctor  if any of my steps are unsound correct me  you are silent  then do not i beseech you be so vulgarly illogical as to revolt from my conclusion  we have now arrived he resumed at some idea of the composition of the gangfor i incline to the hypothesis of more than oneand we now leave this room which can disclose no more and turn our attention to the court and garden  jeanmarie i trust you are observantly following my various steps this is an excellent piece of education for you  come with me to the door  no steps on the court it is unfortunate our court should be paved  on what small matters hang the destiny of these delicate investigations  hey  what have we here  i have led on to the very spot he said standing grandly backward and indicating the green gate  an escalade as you can now see for yourselves has taken place  sure enough the green paint was in several places scratched and broken and one of the panels preserved the print of a nailed shoe  the foot had slipped however and it was difficult to estimate the size of the shoe and impossible to distinguish the pattern of the nails  the whole robbery concluded the doctor step by step has been reconstituted  inductive science can no further go  it is wonderful said his wife  you should indeed have been a detective henri  i had no idea of your talents  my dear replied desprez condescendingly a man of scientific imagination combines the lesser faculties he is a detective just as he is a publicist or a general these are but local applications of his special talent  but now he continued would you have me go further would you have me lay my finger on the culpritsor rather for i cannot promise quite so much point out to you the very house where they consort  it may be a satisfaction at least it is all we are likely to get since we are denied the remedy of law  i reach the further stage in this way  in order to fill my outline of the robbery i require a man likely to be in the forest idling i require a man of education i require a man superior to considerations of morality  the three requisites all centre in tentaillons boarders  they are painters therefore they are continually lounging in the forest  they are painters therefore they are not unlikely to have some smattering of education  lastly because they are painters they are probably immoral and this i prove in two ways  first painting is an art which merely addresses the eye it does not in any particular exercise the moral sense  and second painting in common with all the other arts implies the dangerous quality of imagination  a man of imagination is never moral he outsoars literal demarcations and reviews life under too many shifting lights to rest content with the invidious distinctions of the law  but you always sayat least so i understood yousaid madame that these lads display no imagination whatever  my dear they displayed imagination and of a very fantastic order too returned the doctor when they embraced their beggarly profession besidesand this is an argument exactly suited to your intellectual levelmany of them are english and american  where else should we expect to find a thiefand now you had better get your coffee  because we have lost a treasure there is no reason for starving  for my part i shall break my fast with white wine  i feel unaccountably heated and thirsty today  i can only attribute it to the shock of the discovery and yet you will bear me out i supported the emotion nobly  the doctor had now talked himself back into an admirable humour and as he sat in the arbour and slowly imbibed a large allowance of white wine and picked a little bread and cheese with no very impetuous appetite if a third of his meditations ran upon the missing treasure the other two thirds were more pleasingly busied in the retrospect of his detective skill  about eleven casimir arrived he had caught an early train to fontainebleau and driven over to save time and now his cab was stabled at tentaillons and he remarked studying his watch that he could spare an hour and a half  he was much the man of business decisively spoken given to frowning in an intellectual manner  anastasies born brother he did not waste much sentiment on the lady gave her an english family kiss and demanded a meal without delay  you can tell me your story while we eat he observed  anything good today stasie  he was promised something good  the trio sat down to table in the arbour jeanmarie waiting as well as eating and the doctor recounted what had happened in his richest narrative manner  casimir heard it with explosions of laughter  what a streak of luck for you my good brother he observed when the tale was over  if you had gone to paris you would have played dick duckdrake with the whole consignment in three months  your own would have followed and you would have come to me in a procession like the last time  but i give you warningstasie may weep and henri ratiocinateit will not serve you twice  your next collapse will be fatal  i thought i had told you so stasie  hey  no sense  the doctor winced and looked furtively at jeanmarie but the boy seemed apathetic  and then again broke out casimir what children you arevicious children my faith  how could you tell the value of this trash  it might have been worth nothing or next door  pardon me said the doctor  you have your usual flow of spirits i perceive but even less than your usual deliberation  i am not entirely ignorant of these matters  not entirely ignorant of anything ever i heard of interrupted casimir bowing and raising his glass with a sort of pert politeness  at least resumed the doctor i gave my mind to the subjectthat you may be willing to believeand i estimated that our capital would be doubled  and he described the nature of the find  my word of honour said casimir i half believe you  but much would depend on the quality of the gold  the quality my dear casimir was  and the doctor in default of language kissed his fingertips  i would not take your word for it my good friend retorted the man of business  you are a man of very rosy views  but this robbery he continuedthis robbery is an odd thing  of course i pass over your nonsense about gangs and landscapepainters  for me that is a dream who was in the house last night  none but ourselves replied the doctor  and this young gentleman asked casimir jerking a nod in the direction of jeanmarie  he toothe doctor bowed  well and if it is a fair question who is he pursued the brotherin law  jeanmarie answered the doctor combines the functions of a son and stableboy  he began as the latter but he rose rapidly to the more honourable rank in our affections  he is i may say the greatest comfort in our lives  ha said casimir  and previous to becoming one of you  jeanmarie has lived a remarkable existence his experience his been eminently formative replied desprez  if i had had to choose an education for my son i should have chosen such another  beginning life with mountebanks and thieves passing onward to the society and friendship of philosophers he may be said to have skimmed the volume of human life  thieves repeated the brotherinlaw with a meditative air  the doctor could have bitten his tongue out  he foresaw what was coming and prepared his mind for a vigorous defence  did you ever steal yourself asked casimir turning suddenly on jean marie and for the first time employing a single eyeglass which hung round his neck  yes sir replied the boy with a deep blush  casimir turned to the others with pursed lips and nodded to them meaningly  hey said he how is that  jeanmarie is a teller of the truth returned the doctor throwing out his bust  he has never told a lie added madame  he is the best of boys  never told a lie has he not reflected casimir  strange very strange  give me your attention my young friend he continued  you knew about this treasure  he helped to bring it home interposed the doctor  desprez i ask you nothing but to hold your tongue returned casimir i mean to question this stableboy of yours and if you are so certain of his innocence you can afford to let him answer for himself  now sir he resumed pointing his eyeglass straight at jeanmarie  you knew it could be stolen with impunity  you knew you could not be prosecuted  come  did you or did you not  i did answered jeanmarie in a miserable whisper  he sat there changing colour like a revolving pharos twisting his fingers hysterically swallowing air the picture of guilt  you knew where it was put resumed the inquisitor  yes from jeanmarie  you say you have been a thief before continued casimir  now how am i to know that you are not one still  i suppose you could climb the green gate  yes still lower from the culprit  well then it was you who stole these things  you know it and you dare not deny it  look me in the face  raise your sneaks eyes and answer  but in place of anything of that sort jeanmarie broke into a dismal howl and fled from the arbour  anastasie as she pursued to capture and reassure the victim found time to send one parthian arrowcasimir you are a brute  my brother said desprez with the greatest dignity you take upon yourself a licence  desprez interrupted casimir for heavens sake be a man of the world you telegraph me to leave my business and come down here on yours  i come i ask the business you say find me this thief  well i find him i say there he is  you need not like it but you have no manner of right to take offence  well returned the doctor i grant that i will even thank you for your mistaken zeal  but your hypothesis was so extravagantly monstrous  look here interrupted casimir was it you or stasie  certainly not answered the doctor  very well then it was the boy  say no more about it said the brother inlaw and he produced his cigarcase  i will say this much more returned desprez if that boy came and told me so himself i should not believe him and if i did believe him so implicit is my trust i should conclude that he had acted for the best  well well said casimir indulgently  have you a light  i must be going  and by the way i wish you would let me sell your turks for you i always told you it meant smash  i tell you so again  indeed it was partly that that brought me down  you never acknowledge my lettersa most unpardonable habit  my good brother replied the doctor blandly i have never denied your ability in business but i can perceive your limitations  egad my friend i can return the compliment observed the man of business  your limitation is to be downright irrational  observe the relative position returned the doctor with a smile  it is your attitude to believe through thick and thin in one mans judgmentyour own  i follow the same opinion but critically and with open eyes  which is the more irrationali leave it to yourself  o my dear fellow cried casimir stick to your turks stick to your stableboy go to the devil in general in your own way and be done with it  but dont ratiocinate with mei cannot bear it  and so tata  i might as well have stayed away for any good ive done  say goodbye from me to stasie and to the sullen hangdog of a stableboy if you insist on it im off  and casimir departed  the doctor that night dissected his character before anastasie  one thing my beautiful he said he has learned one thing from his lifelong acquaintance with your husband the word ratiocinate  it shines in his vocabulary like a jewel in a muckheap and even so he continually misapplies it  for you must have observed he uses it as a sort of taunt in the sense of to ergotise implying as it werethe poor dear fellowa vein of sophistry  as for his cruelty to jeanmarie it must be forgiven himit is not his nature it is the nature of his life  a man who deals with money my dear is a man lost  with jeanmarie the process of reconciliation had been somewhat slow  at first he was inconsolable insisted on leaving the family went from paroxysm to paroxysm of tears and it was only after anastasie had been closeted for an hour with him alone that she came forth sought out the doctor and with tears in her eyes acquainted that gentleman with what had passed  at first my husband he would hear of nothing she said  imagine if he had left us what would the treasure be to that  horrible treasure it has brought all this about  at last after he has sobbed his very heart out he agrees to stay on a conditionwe are not to mention this matter this infamous suspicion not even to mention the robbery  on that agreement only the poor cruel boy will consent to remain among his friends  but this inhibition said the doctor this embargoit cannot possibly apply to me  to all of us anastasie assured him  my cherished one desprez protested you must have misunderstood  it cannot apply to me  he would naturally come to me  henri she said it does i swear to you it does  this is a painful a very painful circumstance the doctor said looking a little black  i cannot affect anastasie to be anything but justly wounded  i feel this i feel it my wife acutely  i knew you would she said  but if you had seen his distress  we must make allowances we must sacrifice our feelings  i trust my dear you have never found me averse to sacrifices returned the doctor very stiffly  and you will let me go and tell him that you have agreed  it will be like your noble nature she cried  so it would he perceivedit would be like his noble nature  up jumped his spirits triumphant at the thought  go darling he said nobly reassure him  the subject is buried morei make an effort i have accustomed my will to these exertionsand it is forgotten  a little after but still with swollen eyes and looking mortally sheepish jeanmarie reappeared and went ostentatiously about his business  he was the only unhappy member of the party that sat down that night to supper  as for the doctor he was radiant  he thus sang the requiem of the treasure  this has been on the whole a most amusing episode he said  we are not a penny the worsenay we are immensely gainers  our philosophy has been exercised some of the turtle is still leftthe most wholesome of delicacies i have my staff anastasie has her new dress jeanmarie is the proud possessor of a fashionable kepi  besides we had a glass of hermitage last night the glow still suffuses my memory  i was growing positively niggardly with that hermitage positively niggardly  let me take the hint we had one bottle to celebrate the appearance of our visionary fortune let us have a second to console us for its occultation  the third i hereby dedicate to jeanmaries wedding breakfast    chapter vii  the fall of the house of desprez   the doctors house has not yet received the compliment of a description and it is now high time that the omission were supplied for the house is itself an actor in the story and one whose part is nearly at an end  two stories in height walls of a warm yellow tiles of an ancient ruddy brown diversified with moss and lichen it stood with one wall to the street in the angle of the doctors property  it was roomy draughty and inconvenient  the large rafters were here and there engraven with rude marks and patterns the handrail of the stair was carved in countrified arabesque a stout timber pillar which did duty to support the diningroom roof bore mysterious characters on its darker side runes according to the doctor nor did he fail when he ran over the legendary history of the house and its possessors to dwell upon the scandinavian scholar who had left them  floors doors and rafters made a great variety of angles every room had a particular inclination the gable had tilted towards the garden after the manner of a leaning tower and one of the former proprietors had buttressed the building from that side with a great strut of wood like the derrick of a crane  altogether it had many marks of ruin it was a house for the rats to desert and nothing but its excellent brightnessthe windowglass polished and shining the paint well scoured the brasses radiant the very prop all wreathed about with climbing flowersnothing but its air of a welltended smiling veteran sitting crutch and all in the sunny corner of a garden marked it as a house for comfortable people to inhabit  in poor or idle management it would soon have hurried into the blackguard stages of decay  as it was the whole family loved it and the doctor was never better inspired than when he narrated its imaginary story and drew the character of its successive masters from the hebrew merchant who had reedified its walls after the sack of the town and past the mysterious engraver of the runes down to the longheaded dirty handed boor from whom he had himself acquired it at a ruinous expense  as for any alarm about its security the idea had never presented itself what had stood four centuries might well endure a little longer  indeed in this particular winter after the finding and losing of the treasure the desprez had an anxiety of a very different order and one which lay nearer their hearts  jeanmarie was plainly not himself  he had fits of hectic activity when he made unusual exertions to please spoke more and faster and redoubled in attention to his lessons  but these were interrupted by spells of melancholia and brooding silence when the boy was little better than unbearable  silence the doctor moralisedyou see anastasie what comes of silence  had the boy properly unbosomed himself the little disappointment about the treasure the little annoyance about casimirs incivility would long ago have been forgotten  as it is they prey upon him like a disease  he loses flesh his appetite is variable and on the whole impaired  i keep him on the strictest regimen i exhibit the most powerful tonics both in vain  dont you think you drug him too much asked madame with an irrepressible shudder  drug cried the doctor i drug  anastasie you are mad  time went on and the boys health still slowly declined  the doctor blamed the weather which was cold and boisterous  he called in his confrere from bourron took a fancy for him magnified his capacity and was pretty soon under treatment himselfit scarcely appeared for what complaint  he and jeanmarie had each medicine to take at different periods of the day  the doctor used to lie in wait for the exact moment watch in hand  there is nothing like regularity he would say fill out the doses and dilate on the virtues of the draught and if the boy seemed none the better the doctor was not at all the worse  gunpowder day the boy was particularly low  it was scowling squally weather  huge broken companies of cloud sailed swiftly overhead raking gleams of sunlight swept the village and were followed by intervals of darkness and white flying rain  at times the wind lifted up its voice and bellowed  the trees were all scourging themselves along the meadows the last leaves flying like dust  the doctor between the boy and the weather was in his element he had a theory to prove  he sat with his watch out and a barometer in front of him waiting for the squalls and noting their effect upon the human pulse  for the true philosopher he remarked delightedly every fact in nature is a toy  a letter came to him but as its arrival coincided with the approach of another gust he merely crammed it into his pocket gave the time to jeanmarie and the next moment they were both counting their pulses as if for a wager  at nightfall the wind rose into a tempest  it besieged the hamlet apparently from every side as if with batteries of cannon the houses shook and groaned live coals were blown upon the floor  the uproar and terror of the night kept people long awake sitting with pallid faces giving ear  it was twelve before the desprez family retired  by halfpast one when the storm was already somewhat past its height the doctor was awakened from a troubled slumber and sat up  a noise still rang in his ears but whether of this world or the world of dreams he was not certain  another clap of wind followed  it was accompanied by a sickening movement of the whole house and in the subsequent lull desprez could hear the tiles pouring like a cataract into the loft above his head  he plucked anastasie bodily out of bed  run he cried thrusting some wearing apparel into her hands the house is falling  to the garden  she did not pause to be twice bidden she was down the stair in an instant  she had never before suspected herself of such activity  the doctor meanwhile with the speed of a piece of pantomime business and undeterred by broken shins proceeded to rout out jeanmarie tore aline from her virgin slumbers seized her by the hand and tumbled downstairs and into the garden with the girl tumbling behind him still not half awake  the fugitives rendezvousd in the arbour by some common instinct  then came a bullseye flash of struggling moonshine which disclosed their four figures standing huddled from the wind in a raffle of flying drapery and not without a considerable need for more  at the humiliating spectacle anastasie clutched her nightdress desperately about her and burst loudly into tears  the doctor flew to console her but she elbowed him away  she suspected everybody of being the general public and thought the darkness was alive with eyes  another gleam and another violent gust arrived together the house was seen to rock on its foundation and just as the light was once more eclipsed a crash which triumphed over the shouting of the wind announced its fall and for a moment the whole garden was alive with skipping tiles and brickbats  one such missile grazed the doctors ear another descended on the bare foot of aline who instantly made night hideous with her shrieks  by this time the hamlet was alarmed lights flashed from the windows hails reached the party and the doctor answered nobly contending against aline and the tempest  but this prospect of help only awakened anastasie to a more active stage of terror  henri people will be coming she screamed in her husbands ear  i trust so he replied  they cannot  i would rather die she wailed  my dear said the doctor reprovingly you are excited  i gave you some clothes  what have you done with them  oh i dont knowi must have thrown them away  where are they she sobbed  desprez groped about in the darkness  admirable he remarked my grey velveteen trousers  this will exactly meet your necessities  give them to me she cried fiercely but as soon as she had them in her hands her mood appeared to altershe stood silent for a moment and then pressed the garment back upon the doctor  give it to aline she saidpoor girl  nonsense said the doctor  aline does not know what she is about aline is beside herself with terror and at any rate she is a peasant now i am really concerned at this exposure for a person of your housekeeping habits my solicitude and your fantastic modesty both point to the same remedythe pantaloons  he held them ready  it is impossible  you do not understand she said with dignity  by this time rescue was at hand  it had been found impracticable to enter by the street for the gate was blocked with masonry and the nodding ruin still threatened further avalanches  but between the doctors garden and the one on the right hand there was that very picturesque contrivancea common well the door on the desprez side had chanced to be unbolted and now through the arched aperture a mans bearded face and an arm supporting a lantern were introduced into the world of windy darkness where anastasie concealed her woes  the light struck here and there among the tossing apple boughs it glinted on the grass but the lantern and the glowing face became the centre of the world  anastasie crouched back from the intrusion  this way shouted the man  are you all safe  aline still screaming ran to the new comer and was presently hauled headforemost through the wall  now anastasie come on it is your turn said the husband  i cannot she replied  are we all to die of exposure madame thundered doctor desprez  you can go she cried  oh go go away  i can stay here i am quite warm  the doctor took her by the shoulders with an oath  stop she screamed  i will put them on  she took the detested lendings in her hand once more but her repulsion was stronger than shame  never she cried shuddering and flung them far away into the night  next moment the doctor had whirled her to the well  the man was there and the lantern anastasie closed her eyes and appeared to herself to be about to die  how she was transported through the arch she knew not but once on the other side she was received by the neighbours wife and enveloped in a friendly blanket  beds were made ready for the two women clothes of very various sizes for the doctor and jeanmarie and for the remainder of the night while madame dozed in and out on the borderland of hysterics her husband sat beside the fire and held forth to the admiring neighbours  he showed them at length the causes of the accident for years he explained the fall had been impending one sign had followed another the joints had opened the plaster had cracked the old walls bowed inward last not three weeks ago the cellar door had begun to work with difficulty in its grooves  the cellar he said gravely shaking his head over a glass of mulled wine  that reminds me of my poor vintages  by a manifest providence the hermitage was nearly at an end  one bottlei lose but one bottle of that incomparable wine  it had been set apart against jean maries wedding  well i must lay down some more it will be an interest in life  i am however a man somewhat advanced in years  my great work is now buried in the fall of my humble roof it will never be completedmy name will have been writ in water  and yet you find me calmi would say cheerful  can your priest do more  by the first glimpse of day the party sallied forth from the fireside into the street  the wind had fallen but still charioted a world of troubled clouds the air bit like frost and the party as they stood about the ruins in the rainy twilight of the morning beat upon their breasts and blew into their hands for warmth  the house had entirely fallen the walls outward the roof in it was a mere heap of rubbish with here and there a forlorn spear of broken rafter  a sentinel was placed over the ruins to protect the property and the party adjourned to tentaillons to break their fast at the doctors expense  the bottle circulated somewhat freely and before they left the table it had begun to snow  for three days the snow continued to fall and the ruins covered with tarpaulin and watched by sentries were left undisturbed  the desprez meanwhile had taken up their abode at tentaillons  madame spent her time in the kitchen concocting little delicacies with the admiring aid of madame tentaillon or sitting by the fire in thoughtful abstraction the fall of the house affected her wonderfully little that blow had been parried by another and in her mind she was continually fighting over again the battle of the trousers  had she done right  had she done wrong  and now she would applaud her determination and anon with a horrid flush of unavailing penitence she would regret the trousers  no juncture in her life had so much exercised her judgment  in the meantime the doctor had become vastly pleased with his situation  two of the summer boarders still lingered behind the rest prisoners for lack of a remittance they were both english but one of them spoke french pretty fluently and was besides a humorous agileminded fellow with whom the doctor could reason by the hour secure of comprehension  many were the glasses they emptied many the topics they discussed  anastasie the doctor said on the third morning take an example from your husband from jeanmarie  the excitement has done more for the boy than all my tonics he takes his turn as sentry with positive gusto  as for me you behold me  i have made friends with the egyptians and my pharaoh is i swear it a most agreeable companion  you alone are hipped  about a housea few dresses  what are they in comparison to the pharmacopoeiathe labour of years lying buried below stones and sticks in this depressing hamlet  the snow falls i shake it from my cloak  imitate me  our income will be impaired i grant it since we must rebuild but moderation patience and philosophy will gather about the hearth  in the meanwhile the tentaillons are obliging the table with your additions will pass only the wine is execrablewell i shall send for some today  my pharaoh will be gratified to drink a decent glass aha and i shall see if he possesses that acme of organisationa palate  if he has a palate he is perfect  henri she said shaking her head you are a man you cannot understand my feelings no woman could shake off the memory of so public a humiliation  the doctor could not restrain a titter  pardon me darling he said but really to the philosophical intelligence the incident appears so small a trifle  you looked extremely well  henri she cried  well well i will say no more he replied  though to be sure if you had consented to induea propos he broke off and my trousers they are lying in the snowmy favourite trousers  and he dashed in quest of jeanmarie  two hours afterwards the boy returned to the inn with a spade under one arm and a curious sop of clothing under the other  the doctor ruefully took it in his hands  they have been he said their tense is past  excellent pantaloons you are no more  stay something in the pocket and he produced a piece of paper  a letter ay now i mind me it was received on the morning of the gale when i was absorbed in delicate investigations  it is still legible  from poor dear casimir  it is as well he chuckled that i have educated him to patience  poor casimir and his correspondencehis infinitesimal timorous idiotic correspondence  he had by this time cautiously unfolded the wet letter but as he bent himself to decipher the writing a cloud descended on his brow  bigre he cried with a galvanic start  and then the letter was whipped into the fire and the doctors cap was on his head in the turn of a hand  ten minutes  i can catch it if i run he cried  it is always late i go to paris  i shall telegraph  henri what is wrong cried his wife  ottoman bonds came from the disappearing doctor and anastasie and jeanmarie were left face to face with the wet trousers  desprez had gone to paris for the second time in seven years he had gone to paris with a pair of wooden shoes a knitted spencer a black blouse a country nightcap and twenty francs in his pocket  the fall of the house was but a secondary marvel the whole world might have fallen and scarce left his family more petrified    chapter viii the wages of philosophy   on the morning of the next day the doctor a mere spectre of himself was brought back in the custody of casimir  they found anastasie and the boy sitting together by the fire and desprez who had exchanged his toilette for a readymade rigout of poor materials waved his hand as he entered and sank speechless on the nearest chair  madame turned direct to casimir  what is wrong she cried  well replied casimir what have i told you all along  it has come it is a clean shave this time so you may as well bear up and make the best of it  house down too eh  bad luck upon my soul  are weare weruined she gasped  the doctor stretched out his arms to her  ruined he replied you are ruined by your sinister husband  casimir observed the consequent embrace through his eyeglass then he turned to jeanmarie  you hear he said  they are ruined no more pickings no more house no more fat cutlets  it strikes me my friend that you had best be packing the present speculation is about worked out  and he nodded to him meaningly  never cried desprez springing up  jeanmarie if you prefer to leave me now that i am poor you can go you shall receive your hundred francs if so much remains to me  but if you will consent to staythe doctor wept a littlecasimir offers me a placeas clerk he resumed the emoluments are slender but they will be enough for three  it is too much already to have lost my fortune must i lose my son  jeanmarie sobbed bitterly but without a word  i dont like boys who cry observed casimir  this one is always crying  here you clear out of this for a little i have business with your master and mistress and these domestic feelings may be settled after i am gone  march and he held the door open  jeanmarie slunk out like a detected thief  by twelve they were all at table but jeanmarie  hey said casimir  gone you see  took the hint at once  i do not i confess said desprez i do not seek to excuse his absence  it speaks a want of heart that disappoints me sorely  want of manners corrected casimir  heart he never had  why desprez for a clever fellow you are the most gullible mortal in creation  your ignorance of human nature and human business is beyond belief  you are swindled by heathen turks swindled by vagabond children swindled right and left upstairs and downstairs  i think it must be your imagination  i thank my stars i have none  pardon me replied desprez still humbly but with a return of spirit at sight of a distinction to be drawn pardon me casimir  you possess even to an eminent degree the commercial imagination  it was the lack of that in meit appears it is my weak pointthat has led to these repeated shocks  by the commercial imagination the financier forecasts the destiny of his investments marks the falling house  egad interrupted casimir our friend the stableboy appears to have his share of it  the doctor was silenced and the meal was continued and finished principally to the tune of the brotherinlaws not very consolatory conversation  he entirely ignored the two young english painters turning a blind eyeglass to their salutations and continuing his remarks as if he were alone in the bosom of his family and with every second word he ripped another stitch out of the air balloon of desprezs vanity by the time coffee was over the poor doctor was as limp as a napkin  let us go and see the ruins said casimir  they strolled forth into the street  the fall of the house like the loss of a front tooth had quite transformed the village  through the gap the eye commanded a great stretch of open snowy country and the place shrank in comparison  it was like a room with an open door  the sentinel stood by the green gate looking very red and cold but he had a pleasant word for the doctor and his wealthy kinsman  casimir looked at the mound of ruins he tried the quality of the tarpaulin  hm he said i hope the cellar arch has stood  if it has my good brother i will give you a good price for the wines  we shall start digging tomorrow said the sentry  there is no more fear of snow  my friend returned casimir sententiously you had better wait till you get paid  the doctor winced and began dragging his offensive brotherinlaw towards tentaillons  in the house there would be fewer auditors and these already in the secret of his fall  hullo cried casimir there goes the stableboy with his luggage no egad he is taking it into the inn  and sure enough jeanmarie was seen to cross the snowy street and enter tentaillons staggering under a large hamper  the doctor stopped with a sudden wild hope  what can he have he said  let us go and see  and he hurried on  his luggage to be sure answered casimir  he is on the movethanks to the commercial imagination  i have not seen that hamper forfor ever so long remarked the doctor  nor will you see it much longer chuckled casimir unless indeed we interfere  and by the way i insist on an examination  you will not require said desprez positively with a sob and casting a moist triumphant glance at casimir he began to run  what the devil is up with him i wonder casimir reflected and then curiosity taking the upper hand he followed the doctors example and took to his heels  the hamper was so heavy and large and jeanmarie himself so little and so weary that it had taken him a great while to bundle it upstairs to the desprez private room and he had just set it down on the floor in front of anastasie when the doctor arrived and was closely followed by the man of business  boy and hamper were both in a most sorry plight for the one had passed four months underground in a certain cave on the way to acheres and the other had run about five miles as hard as his legs would carry him half that distance under a staggering weight  jeanmarie cried the doctor in a voice that was only too seraphic to be called hysterical is it  it is he cried  o my son my son and he sat down upon the hamper and sobbed like a little child  you will not go to paris now said jeanmarie sheepishly  casimir said desprez raising his wet face do you see that boy that angel boy  he is the thief he took the treasure from a man unfit to be entrusted with its use he brings it back to me when i am sobered and humbled  these casimir are the fruits of my teaching and this moment is the reward of my life  tiens said casimir  printed by spottiswoode and co ltd newstreet square london
