may 1669 a man was standing at the edge of the shore of a rocky island one of a group of a dozen or so similar in character lying off the southwestern portion of sumatra it would have been difficult to fix his nationality the outline of the face was arab the colour of the skin showed that though one or other of his parents had been white the other had been either arab or malay he stood looking after a dutch vessel carrying guns like all those engaged at that time in the eastern trade his hands were clenched and he was regarding the ship with an expression of malignant hate  close by where he stood a roughlymade grave piled with rocks with a wooden cross standing at its head showed that a christian had been buried there any seaman of the time who had seen the man would have rightly concluded that he had been marooned for some crime committed on board the ship that was sailing away and their judgment would have been a correct one  the dordrecht a dutch merchantman carrying sixteen guns was chartered by a dozen rich citizens of holland who had sailed in her determined to take up land to settle and to cultivate the plants that grew in the island of java on a large scale some were traders others had been tempted by the tales of the wealth of the island where the dutch had fifty years before acquired a settlement by conquest the ship had touched at the cape to take in a fresh supply of water and fill up with provisions they had lost their cook overboard in a storm and thought themselves fortunate in engaging in his place a man who had served with the governor there and who was recommended as thoroughly understanding his work whose only drawback was that he possessed a passionate and revengeful disposition which had led to his dismissal from his office this in a vessel carrying a strong crew and some fifty soldiers was not considered of any importance and the man speedily justified his recommendation in other respects  i dont like the fellow the lieutenant in command of the troops said to his subaltern one day when they were a month out from the cape i grant you that he is a good cook but if i offended him i should not care to touch any food he handled the fellow is capable of poisoning a whole crew to get his revenge on one of them  the other laughed i grant he has an evil face van houten but i think that you are a little prejudiced i own though that i felt inclined to knock him down myself this afternoon when he stood at the door of the galley staring at fraulein meyers through his halfclosed eyes he put me in mind of a cat watching a mouse  yes i have noticed it myself several times the other said hotly it is hardly a thing one can take up the fellow might declare that it was not her that he was looking at but that he was merely meditating and to tell you the truth although i am no coward i would rather not make a mortal enemy of that man i have no fancy for being stabbed to the heart while i am asleep if he said or did anything insolent it would be another matter i would have him ironed and sent down below and kept there till we got to batavia  the other laughed again you would get into hot water with all the passengers van houten the fellow cooks so well that they are always singing his praises  yes there has been a great improvement in the diet since we left the cape but still even at the risk of displeasing the worshipful passengers i would put the fellow in irons did he give me the shadow of an excuse i should not be surprised if he did so for of late i have observed a malignant look on his face as his eyes fell upon me it is absurd to suppose that the hound feels any illwill towards me because i am a good deal with fraulein meyers the assumption is too monstrous but i really dont see any other reason for him to dislike me i have never spoken to him since he came on board  perhaps the matter will be taken out of your hands altogether the other said i heard the mate having a row with him this morning and certainly he is not likely to put up with any nonsense and he is strong enough to pick the arab or whatever he is up with one hand and throw him overboard  i am not quite so sure about that erasmus he looks small beside the mate i acknowledge but i should say that what there is of him is all sinew and muscle and it would be like a fight between a panther and a buffalo  a week later the passengers were down at dinner they were in high spirits for the hills of sumatra were dimly visible on the port side and another two or three days sail would take them to batavia suddenly a shout was heard and then a sudden uproar the captain and van houten ran up on the deck lay the mate stabbed to the heart while the cook with a knife in his hand was struggling in the grasp of half a dozen soldiers  how did this happen the captain asked as he came up to the group  i dont know how it began one of the crew said but the cook was standing at the door of his galley the mate said something to him and the cook burst into a volley of curses the mate knocked him down but he was up in a moment with his knife in his hand he flung himself upon the mate and the latter fell as you see two or three of us who were close by threw ourselves on the cook but it was hard work to hold him for he fought like a wild cat and he had slashed some of us before we could get hold of his wrists  drop that knife the captain said sternly but the man was halfmad with passion and continued to struggle desperately van houten caught up a belaying pin from its place and struck him heavily on his fingers the knife dropped to the deck and one of the soldiers snatched it up the man instantly ceased struggling and stood impassive although his breast still heaved with his exertion then he said in a quiet voice to the young officer that is another i owe you van houten but i will get even with you one day  your threat is an idle one the captain said at sunset you shall swing from the yardarm tie him up tightly men and fasten him to the mast carry the mates body forward and throw a flag over it we will bury him after we have done with this fellow  going below the captain briefly stated what had occurred  but you will not hang him captain will you one of the lady passengers said it is awful that the mate should have been killed but you see he gave the most terrible provocation it would be a sad ending to our voyage if a man were hanged on board could you not hand him over to the authorities when we get to batavia  no madam i certainly might do so but the chances are that the fellow would make his escape long before his trial was concluded i know that he speaks malay and he would find some means to get some natives outside to help him and i do not care to run the risk of the fate that has befallen the mate i should hardly think that van houten would care about it either i fancy that he would be the first victim by the look that the fellow gave him  an hour later the captain went up to van houten  the women have been begging me not to hang that fellow as it is evident that i shall gain much illwill if i do for he has well satisfied them and as i have no mind to risk my life and yours if he should get free at batavia i have a good mind to land him on one of the islets ahead i might heave the ship to for an hour land the poor mate and bury him and leave the scoundrel there it will amount to the same thing in the end for as the rocks are thirty miles from the coast there would be no chance of his getting off for it would be very improbable that any native craft will come along this way they always keep close inshore that way one would avoid a scene with the women and i own that there is something in what they say the deed was done in a moment of passion and under great provocation for werter was a strong fighter and a hasty man and a blow from his fist was no joke  just as you think fit captain it will give him time to think over his misdeeds which no doubt are pretty numerous for i dare say his career has been a black one it certainly has if his face does not belie him greatly still i would much prefer to see him hung  accordingly an hour later the vessel was hove to the remains of the mate covered with a flag were placed in a boat the cook still bound was made to descend into it and the second mate and eight wellarmed sailors with picks and shovels took their places in it the ships carpenter had made a rough cross which he handed to the second mate when they reached the shore two men were left there with the cook the others dug a shallow grave laid the body in it refilled it and heaped great stones upon it and then stuck the cross in the sands at its head the arab was brought ashore and the ropes that bound him were unfastened the crew and second mate took their places in the boat and rowed off to the ship which was put on her way again as soon as they reached it as far as they could make out the figure of the man on shore he was standing where they had left him gazing at the ship on the following day there was a heavy gale offshore and the ship was blown some little distance out of her course  in two days however the wind fell and the dordrecht arrived five days later at batavia the passengers landed at once and the captain went ashore on the following day with his logbook is there any special item to which you wish to call my attention the official asked  this is the only one sir and he pointed to the last page cook stabbed the mate  and you marooned him on one of the rocky islands off the coast of sumatra why did you not hang him  well sir we had a good many lady passengers on board and they all rather took the mans part on the ground that the mate had knocked him down and that he stabbed him in the heat of passion but really i think it was because they had been highly satisfied with his cooking during the voyage  what nationality was the man  a mixture he spoke dutch perfectly well but his features were arab rather than european  the official did not speak for nearly a minute what height was he  about the average height the captain said with some surprise in his tone broader than arabs generally are but lithe and sinewy i used to think there must be some malay blood in him  the official got up and took down a book from a shelf how long had he been at the cape before you hired him do you know he asked as he turned over the leaves  i did not question him he said that he had been six months cook at the governors house and that was good enough for me  had he any particular mark on his face the official asked as he found the entry for which he was in search  he had a scar on one cheek the captain said a white line as if it had been a clean cut with a knife  that is the man then your first description at once struck me i will read to you what is written here middle height age about thirtyfive clean shaven very strong and active figure nationality uncertain believed to be arab on the fathers side by dutch or portuguese woman probably some malay blood long thin scar across one cheek  that is the man to a t  well captain you have missed five hundred pounds and the great credit you would have gained if you had brought in that man dead or alive he was the boldest and most savage of the pirates who infest these seas and is feared by the native traders as much as by the dutch merchants who trade with the east he never spared a man white or brown that fell into his hands sometimes he would sail alone sometimes with a score of native craft with these he would land on one of the islands or on the mainland burn plunder and murder and carry off into slavery the young men and women the last we heard of him was two years ago a boat was picked up with two men still alive in her they were the sole survivors of one of our vessels that had been captured by him he had transferred the greater part of his own crew to her every soul on board our ship had been murdered with the exception of these two men who managed to conceal themselves among the cargo and had while the pirates were carousing dropped into a boat that lay alongside and escaped in the morning they could see their own ship bearing west while the original pirate was making for the northeast  from that day nothing was heard of the arab it was supposed that he had intended to cruise near the cape there his appearance would enable him unsuspected to approach ships six months later however a ship arriving here brought news that the heldin which was the name of the vessel that they had taken had been lost with all hands some forty miles from the cape the natives had brought down a story of a wreck having occurred near their village and a craft was despatched to the spot and found the shore strewn with timber among the wreckage was the stern of a boat bearing the heldins name and an empty keg also stamped with it that seemed to settle the question and the wreck had taken place just about the time that the pirate would had she held on the course on which she was last seen have arrived off the cape there is not much doubt now that the sea tiger for so he was always called managed to reach the shore and make his way to the town and when he found that he was the sole survivor and no suspicion existed that the ship had changed hands before she was wrecked found some sort of employment until by means no doubt of forged testimonials he obtained a position in the household of the governor i must at once inform the council who are now sitting of what has taken place  an hour later a government craft with twenty soldiers on board sailed from batavia taking with it the second mate of the dordrecht to point out to them the island upon which the pirate had been landed and the spot where they had set him on shore she returned a week later no traces of the man they sought had been found but on the shore was a deep mark evidently caused by a native boat having been pulled up there during the storm the sand around was greatly trampled there were chips of wood as if some repairs had been done and there was little doubt that after the storm had abated and the craft been sufficiently repaired the whole party had sailed away the news that the famous pirate known as the sea tiger had escaped and was again at large caused great consternation among the merchant community of batavia  the captain of the dordrecht was severely censured by the authorities and was so overwhelmed with reproaches by the merchants that he was glad indeed when he had discharged his cargo and taken in another and left the island behind him the female passengers whose intercession had saved the pirates life came in for some share of the unpopularity of the captain and were made to regret bitterly the part they had taken in the affair three months later reports were brought by natives of the doings of a piratical fleet who had taken and sunk numbers of native craft had landed at various points on the coast of sumatra and destroyed dutch factories the natives who had escaped from these massacres all agreed in stating that the leader of this fleet was the dreaded sea tiger of whom nothing had been heard for so long then three dutch ships which were due did not arrive and one which came in reported that they had seen a glow of light in midocean it could have been caused only by a ship on fire very many miles away  the ship had been headed in this direction but the wind was contrary and the light had disappeared suddenly they however kept on their course and although the next morning they came upon some wreckage of charred timber and had cruised for some hours in the neighbourhood they had seen no signs of boats then rapidly came in the news that descents had been made upon various points on the mainland and one morning a horseman rode in saying that a landing had been effected at a point about thirty miles from batavia plantations had been destroyed all the white colonists killed and ablebodied natives carried off as slaves there was only one vessel of war at batavia but the governor and council took up two merchantmen that happened to be there and put on board of each fifty soldiers together with a strong crew to work the guns lieutenant van houten was in command of the soldiers on one of these vessels his engagement to fraulein meyers had now been announced her father was settled on a plantation that he had purchased from a colonist whose health had suffered from the climate and who was now returning home it was twelve miles to the east of the town and situated near the seashore  he had been appointed to the command at his own request he had more than shared in the general consternation at the pirates escape he was not one however to blame the captain certainly the arab had acted under great provocation and he knew that had he been in the captains place he would have yielded to the solicitations of the ladies especially as it seemed that the death of the culprit was as certain as if slower than that by the rope he himself would vastly have preferred to have seen the man hung he recognized how dangerous an enemy he was and as soon as he heard of his escape he became anxious about the safety of his betrothed remembering as he did the evident admiration that this scoundrel had felt for her he had even begged her father to move into the town until the depredations of the pirates had been arrested but mr meyers had scoffed at the idea it is just the time for nutmeg picking it is quite absurd there is no other plantation within three miles and even if they came along here it would not pay them to land for the plunder of a solitary house  his daughter was very tearful when she heard that her lover was going out in search of the pirate there is no occasion for you to go she said why should you have volunteered for such dangerous service  because i have a particular wish to capture or kill this pirate i have no doubt that he has a strong enmity against all connected with the dordrecht and i shall never feel comfortable so long as he roves the sea even putting our own case aside see the frightful destruction that he is causing he is depopulating islands massacring peaceable natives capturing ships and murdering all on board there is not an officer here but is burning to take part in his capture besides i feel he has a particular animosity against me how it arises does not matter i know that he has that feeling and so long as he is abroad and powerful my life is not safe even in the streets of batavia  after this his betrothed had no further objection to his going it was known that the pirates rendezvous was on the east coast of sumatra where he had made an alliance with a tribe at war with its neighbours and had aided in conquering the latter and it was in that direction that the three ships steered their course hoping to encounter the pirates as they came down the straits of malacca on one of their expeditions they cruised backwards and forwards for a week without seeing a sail save a few native boats creeping along close to the shore one morning however the lookout at the masthead saw a number of sail in the distance among them were two vessels much larger than the others these were doubtless the dutch ships that had been captured the others were native craft most of them rowing as could be seen as the sun flashed on their oars preparations were at once made for battle for there was no change in the direction of the pirate flotilla after it was certain that they must have seen the dutch fleet  it almost looks van houten said to erasmus his young subaltern who was again with him as if they had received information as to our starting in pursuit of them otherwise there would surely have been some hesitation when they first saw us some consultation whether they should attack us or not unless i am greatly mistaken one of the ships is the dordrecht she was only three weeks at batavia the fellow must have lost no time in getting allies among the native princes in order to waylay her when she came out again she would be the first object of his vengeance  she certainly looks like her the other agreed well if so there is one more debt to be paid off the captain was a good old fellow and i liked the second mate very much i hope both of them fell before the vessel was seized for we may be sure that they would not have had an easy death if they were captured it will be a tough fight for i have no doubt that the boats are crammed with men there is one thing which i do not expect they havemany guns except in the two ships but counting only fifty men a boatand no doubt many of them carry a hundredwe shall be tremendously outnumbered if they get alongside  yes it is a little unfortunate that there is not more wind then we might keep away from their boats and pepper them hotly as it is they can move three feet to our one  as soon as the pirates were within range the three dutch vessels opened fire they were unanswered for a short time for the two pirate ships had been outstripped by the prahs but several of the latter now took them in tow and presently they began to return the fire with their bowguns although several of the prahs were sunk and some so badly damaged that they had to drop behind the others pressed on  at a signal from the commander of the ship of war his consorts now brought their heads round so that they lay nearly in a line with their broadsides to the pirates  with loud shouts beating of drums and the blowing of horns the prahs came along at racing speed instead of using roundshot the guns were now crammed to the muzzle with bags of bullets and these did terrible execution but the malays did not relax their efforts and presently dashed alongside of the dutch ships soon a desperate fight took place the soldiers kept up an incessant musketryfire as fast as they could load the sailors cut down those who attempted to board and the malays threw showers of spears stinkpots and missiles of all kinds  for half an hour the fight continued and the result was still in doubt when there was a crash and the decks were swept by a storm of bullets scarce noticed while the struggle was going on the two pirate ships had come up passed ahead of the dutch vessels and had sailed close up on the opposite side to that on which the fight with the prahs was taking place the pirates had shifted all their guns so as to bear on the dutch vessels each mounted sixteen cannon and these poured in their contents simultaneously the effect was terrible more than half the defenders were swept away and a minute later the pirate ships were alongside and as the dutch turned to repel the storm of figures leaping on to their decks the men in the canoes crowded up on the other side the dutch soldiers and sailors fought with desperation they knew there was no quarter and held out to the last but in five minutes the ship of war and the one next to her had been captured and the last of the defenders slain  the ship that carried van houten was at the end of the line and had up to now been only attacked by the natives a few of the sailors were withdrawn from their work of the defence of the bulwarks and were ordered to haul on the sheets so that the sails might catch what wind there was if she could escape from the attack of the two ships she might yet beat off the natives but it was too late the pirates threw off the grapnels that attached them to the ships they had captured and again some of the canoes took them in tow several of these were sunk but the way given was sufficient and the leading vessel ranged alongside the merchantman  the exultant shouts of the malays rose high in the air as the men from the pirate ship and prahs swarmed on deck the dutch soldiers held together and fought steadily but their numbers lessened fast as the spears of the malays flew among them few of them had time to reload their muskets and fire a second shot erasmus fell by van houtens side when the latter had but a dozen men left around him the leader of the pirates whom he now recognized shouted do not touch that white officer make him prisoneri want him  a moment later there was a general rush of the malays three of them sprang upon van houten and dragged him to the ground and soon a yell of triumph told that the last of the defenders had fallen van houten was now allowed to rise to his feet his arms still clasped by his assailants why dont you kill me you scoundrel the same as the others he said to the pirate  you will be killed soon enough the arab said but i want to keep you for a while just to have the pleasure of showing you that girl in my hands i was not good enough to look at her you thought good or not she shall be mine i settled on that the first moment that i saw her bind him tightly and take him below be sure that his cords are tight notie him to the mast we shall have the pleasure of looking at him and talking to him sometimes  then he gave a number of orders prize crews were told off to the three captured vessels the remaining prahs took the five ships in tow and in a body they moved away six hours rowing brought them to a narrow inlet here was a native village two of the men were placed as guards over van houten and the work of emptying the ships of their valuables then began and continued until late at night everything being taken ashore by the boats three days passed in feasting and rejoicing the prisoners arms were unbound so that he could eat the food given him at regular intervals his guards were changed every two hours and the pirate came round each day to taunt his captive even had the guards been removed the latter could not have freed himself for the ropes round his legs and chest were all tied round the other side of the mast and he could not therefore possibly get at the knots  on the third evening van houten saw that one at least of the two men who came on guard was the worse for liquor he grumbled loudly at being brought off from the pleasures on shore to look after this white prisoner  however he said i have brought off my gourd  you had better be careful the other said if the captain came off and found you drunk he would shoot you like a dog  bah he went into his hut half an hour ago and he wont be out again tonight besides i am not going to get drunk i am just comfortable that is all  nevertheless the warning had its effect and the man only took small sips from his gourd van houten let his chin drop on his breast as if asleep and presently the man as he passed in front of him lurched against him in a moment van houten snatched one of the knives from his girdle and hid it beneath his coat the other guard was standing a few paces away watching the shore and the action was unnoticed feeling for the first time since he had been captured that there was some hope the young soldier now went off to sleep a thing he had not been able to do before owing to the tightness of his bonds when he woke the sun was just rising and his guard had been twice changed the day passed as before but that evening the boats pushed off to their various ships  early the next morning these were towed out of the inlet the boats that were not to accompany them returned to the village slowly and clumsily the sails were hoisted and the five vessels each crowded with malays set sail van houten had been carried the evening before to the warship of which the pirate captain had taken the command he was as before tied to the mast but was fastened in a sitting position on the deck instead of a standing one  i do not wish you to die yet the man said giving him a kick i dont want you to be so sleepy that you will be stupid i want you to be able to take it all in  the change was an intense relief for five days he had been kept standing at times his legs refused to bear his weight and he had been supported entirely by the ropes round his body he dropped almost instantaneously asleep when the pirate left him and the sun was high next day before he awoke for a time his neck was so stiff from the position he had slept in that he almost cried out from the pain as he lifted it he had been dreaming that he was in the dungeon of the spanish inquisition and that he was being tortured and for a moment he could scarce understand where he was for the pain of the tightly bound ropes seemed to be part of his dream  four days passed he was no longer strictly guarded for escape in midocean was impossible nevertheless the knots of his ropes were examined two or three times a day as had been the case all along he was liberated from his bonds for five minutes four times a day four of the malays keeping close to him to prevent him from jumping overboard early one afternoon the western extremity of sumatra was made out and after the fleet had passed through the narrow straits between that island and the island of banca they headed south keeping close inshore towards the straits of sunda as van houten when he had taken his last walk before it became dark saw the ships heads were pointed south he thought that from the course they were taking they would strike the island of java early next morning some thirty miles to the west of batavia  i have no doubt you are thinking the pirate said to him coldly that the people on shore will see us in the morning and take the alarm there is no fear of that before it is light the two ships i had before will make their way to sea again we shall have the dutch flag flying and shall sail along two miles or so from the coast of course we shall be recognized as we pass batavia and the authorities will suppose that their fleet has not come upon the vessels they were in search of and having obtained news that they were likely to attempt a landing on the island farther to the east are now coasting along in hopes of falling in with them  a bold plan is it not by evening we shall be back again off the meyerss plantation and by nightfall i shall have my beauty on board we shall have been already joined by our consorts and shall sail together to batavia the artillerymen in the fort will think we have made a capture during the night and we shall get in without a shot being fired at us at the same time the party that have landed will attack the place on the land side then we will sack and burn the town attack the forts from the land side where they are weak kill the artillerymen and carry off such guns as we choose after that we shall have a wedding which you shall witness if we cannot get a minister to perform it we will manage to do without one she shall then be taken on board my ship while i superintend your roasting on a bonfire that is my programme what do you think of it  van houten had stared stolidly astern while the pirate was speaking the latter apparently not expecting any answer to his question with a mocking laugh turned away as soon as it had become quite dark a boat had been lowered and the pirate had gone on board the other vessels to give his orders the prisoner listened eagerly for his return if the boat were pulled up it seemed to him that the last chance of escape was gone for cramped as he was by his long confinement he felt sure he would not be able to swim ashore he almost held his breath as he heard it returning to the ships side there were no such appliances as now exist for raising boats and to get one of the clumsy and heavy boats on deck was a work of no small labour  the pirate sprung on deck and gave an order to the men in the boat as the prisoner did not understand malay he was ignorant of its purport but when the four men who had been rowing her came on deck and one of them holding the boats painter in his hand walked astern with it he felt sure that she was to be allowed to tow there at any rate till morning after the ships had been put on their course parallel with the shore there was soon silence on board there was no moon but the stars were bright and the vessels moved along with a gentle breeze about three knots an hour that evening the guard of two men had again been posted over the prisoner for certain as the captain felt that escape was impossible he thought it would be as well to neglect no precaution now that land was near the malays themselves seemed to consider that a guard was altogether unnecessary and after some talk between them one lay down between the guns while the other took up his place by the mast and leant against it close to van houten  the latter waited for half an hour until he felt that the other guard was asleep then taking out his knife he cut the cords the slight noise as these fell aroused the sentry on guard halfasleep as he leant against the mast and he stooped down so as to assure himself that all was right van houten seized his throat with one hand and with the other drove his knife up to the hilt into him there was no need to repeat the blow it had been driven through the heart noiselessly van houten lowered him to the deck then moving a little on one side propped up the body against the mast in the attitude in which he himself had been bound after taking off his shoes he made his way astern the malays were lying thickly between the guns on either side but all were sound asleep reaching the ladder up to the lofty poop he climbed it  there were no malays here except the man at the wheel and he was so intent on his work that he did not notice van houten as he crept past he found the boats rope which was tied to the rail and lowered himself till he was in the water the boat was some ten yards astern and severing the rope he was soon alongside her keeping his hand on the gunwale he worked along it till he reached the stern this he grasped and hung on the boat soon lost her way and the ship receded fast he made no effort to climb into the boat until the latter had quite disappeared from his sight for had he in climbing on board moved one of the oars in her the rattle might have been heard by someone sleeping lightly on the ship once assured that she was well away he cautiously raised himself and clambered over the stern using the utmost care in each movement so as to avoid touching anything movable he waited a quarter of an hour then he crept forward took off his coat cut off one of the sleeves fastened this round one of the heavy oars and put it out over the stern so that the cloth was in the groove made for the purpose of enabling one man to scull her when near shore this would prevent the slightest chance of the pirates hearing him at work  he found it terribly hard at first so sore was his body from the pressure of the ropes gradually however as he warmed to his work he became able to put out his strength the stars being a sufficient guide to enable him to make his way straight to shore he had no fear of being overtaken even if his escape were speedily discovered for they would not be able to tell how long a time had elapsed since he got away he thought it probable however that the escape would not be discovered until morning the other malay would have slept till he was roused by his comrade and would not be likely to wake until day broke when he would discover the change that had been effected  the heavy boat moved but slowly and it was not until a good hour after leaving the ship that he made out the shore fortunately the breeze during the afternoon had been a good one and so the pirates had passed the straits of sunda at nine oclock and had then changed their course to the east what wind there was was from the north and so helped him and two hours after leaving the ship he reached the shore he had fifty miles to go to batavia but there would be plenty of time it was certain that the attack at the station could not take place till the following night he knew a plantation where a colonist with whom he was acquainted lived and this could not be more than two or three miles away his strength weakened by suffering and mental torment was greatly diminished and after walking for a mile he felt that it would be better for him to rest till morning broke when he would be able to ascertain exactly where he was and find his way to the plantation  accordingly he lay down but would not permit himself to doze as worn out as he was from want of rest if he did so he might sleep far into the day he soon found that lying down it would be impossible for him to keep awake and accordingly sat down by a large rock in the position to which he had become accustomed the hours passed slowly but he had now no difficulty in keeping awake he was filled with exultation at his escape and at the prospect of turning the tables upon the pirate as soon as day broke he struck inland for he knew that a road ran east and west by which the various products of the land were taken to the town in half an hour he came upon it and after following it for a mile came upon the plantation fence arriving at the gate he entered and made his way up to the house there was already movement there a group of native labourers were receiving orders from an overseer who looked in astonishment at the appearance of an officer haggard and blistered by the sun and whose uniform was still wet and one sleeve altogether missing  this is the station of meinheer de koning is it not van houten asked  it is sir but he is not up yet  i am the bearer of important news and must see him at once will you order one of the servants to arouse him and tell him that lieutenant van houten desires to see him instantly on a matter of the most pressing importance  in five minutes the planter came down philip had met him several times in batavia the latter gazed at him in surprise failing at first to recognize the figure before him as the smart young officer of his acquaintance  it is i just escaped from one of the ships of the sea tiger who with four vessels beside his own is on his way to attack batavia and unless i can arrive there in time to warn them he will do terrible damage  which way were the ships going de koning asked in consternation  they were going east the five ships are crowded with malays and they reckon upon destroying the town and overrunning the whole country i beg of you that you will at once lend me a good horse  you dont look fit to ride five miles much less fifty i will have two horses put into my vehicle and drive you myself in the meantime come in and take a glass of wine and some bread i will have a basket of provisions put in the trap for you to eat as we go along  in a quarter of an hour a light vehicle drawn by two horses drew up to the door philip who felt refreshed and strengthened by the wine at once clambered up the planter took the reins and they started  on their way philip told the story of the events he had gone through  and so the scoundrels captured the ship of war and her two consorts no wonder they think that with five ships crowded as you say with men they can take batavia  the basket contained a good supply of provisions and fruit and philip was able to make a hearty meal after the diet of bread and water on which he had lived for the last ten days the planter had lent him a doublet which he had put on in place of his uniform coat and they therefore attracted no attention when after six hours drive they arrived at batavia and went straight to the governors house the latter on hearing philips story summoned the members of the council and the military commander after some discussion the plan of action was decided upon all the troops in garrison were to march to meyerss plantation they were to take with them six light guns the crier went round the town summoning all the inhabitants to gather in the marketplace  here the governor told them the news that he had received and then explained the plan of operations the artillery are to remain here to man the guns of the fort in case the pirates should change their plan and one company of soldiers is also to stay behind to oppose any landing in the first place i beg that all having vehicles will place them at our disposalthey will be used to carry the troops out to meyerss station then if the troops hear firing here they will know that the pirates have changed their plans and will be brought back to the town with all speed so that in a little over an hour after the first gun is fired they will be here ready to help in the defence in the next place it is allimportant for the safety of the island and the town that a heavy blow shall be dealt these pirates there are now four merchant ships in the harbour and a number of native boats i trust that every man capable of bearing arms will volunteer to man them i myself shall remain here but all the members of the council have decided to go in the boats i think it probable that by far the greater portion of the malays will land and attempt to capture meyerss plantation with the intention of afterwards marching upon the town and attacking it on the land side if they do this their ships will naturally be but feebly manned and we have decided to adopt the suggestion made by lieutenant van houten who has been in the hands of the pirates and has escaped from them that as soon as the fight begins on shore and the attention of the pirates on board is fixed on the struggle they shall be attacked on the other side by the flotilla of boats  this attack shall be chiefly directed against the ship of war which i am sorry to say they have captured she carries heavier guns than the others and is a fast sailer therefore when she is once taken her guns can be turned on the others and i hope these will all be recaptured the officers and crew of the merchant ships here will aid in the attack they have as great an interest as we have in their destruction and will be able to work the guns if we are successful we shall at one blow destroy the power of this terrible pirate the seatiger and render the sea open again to commerce captain smidt one of your council who is as you know a distinguished naval officer has volunteered to take the command of the expedition and will lead the boats to the attack  he will also arrange the crews of each boat i beg that you will all inscribe your names as ready to fight for your homes families and possessions all of which will be in grievous danger unless these pirates are crushed at seven oclock this evening those who have volunteered will assemble at the fort the boats will be in readiness with a number painted on each so that when you are told off you will be able each one to take his place without confusion in his allotted boat or in one or other of the ships the pirates will make their landing about eleven oclock the boats will row till within three miles of them then they will be taken in tow by the ships the sounds of the boats oars would be heard for a long way on a still night you will probably get quite close to them before you are seen the moment the alarm is given the towropes must be thrown off the ships will fire a broadside into the manofwar and at once range alongside her and the boats will attack the other pirates  the speech was received in silence save that a hearty shout arose when the governor called upon them to volunteer  captain smidt is already at the townhall he said go there and register your names in order that he may know how many boats will be required and will be able to make his arrangements accordingly a cordon of troops has been placed round the town and no one will be allowed to leave without a permit some of the natives might if they knew the preparations that have been made make off and swim to the pirate ships with the news  as he ceased speaking the little crowd moved off towards the townhall mounted men were at once despatched to all plantations within fifteen miles calling upon the planters to drive in instantly with their arms for the defence of the town which was menaced by an attack from pirates  at four oclock in the afternoon the three vessels that had left there ten days before were seen sailing past the town they should have been sighted some hours earlier but shortly after daybreak the wind had fallen and the calm had lasted till midday all were flying the dutch flag which they hauled down in salute to those flying on the fort but proceeded on their way without changing their course everything was apparently quiet in the fort and the salutes were duly returned boats sufficient to carry the number of men available had by this time been drawn up close to the shore each bearing its number painted on her bow  at halfpast six the townspeople began to gather all were armed with muskets or rifles pikes or swords and quietly and without confusion they took their allotted places some on the boats some on the two ships  the troops had marched an hour before joined by between forty and fifty men who came in from the plantations van houten had gone with them they halted half a mile from the station it was desirable that they should not come up until the native labourers were all asleep van houten himself rode on and it was nearly nine oclock as he entered he was greeted by a cry of joy and surprise from the planters daughter  why philip she exclaimed how have you got here we saw your three vessels come along just as it became dark an hour ago i suppose you must have landed as they passed batavia but what is the matter you look strangely ill have you been wounded in a fight with those pirates  you do look strange her father added and you are not in uniform  things have gone badly he replied our three vessels have all been captured and i am the sole survivor of the crews i have been a prisoner and only escaped last night  then what are the three ships we saw the planter said i could have sworn to the manofwar leyden i was not sure as to the other two ships  they were full of pirates meinheer and have probably been joined by two more ships by this time they are going to land at about eleven oclock to burn this place down and carry your daughter off and after that they will storm and sack batavia  are you in earnest van houten or dreaming if your news is true there is not a moment to be lost we must have the horses and trap round at once and drive inland or to batavia the town can successfully resist  i should certainly advise elise to retire at once to a station a mile or two away there will be a battle fought here two hundred soldiers and forty or fifty planters with six guns halted a mile away they will be here in an hours time and will give the malays a reception that they do not dream of as soon as the fight begins their ships will be attacked by two merchantmen and a flotilla of boats manned by every available man in batavia with the exception of the governor himself and a small garrison who will remain in the fort to protect the town should the pirates change their plans captain smidt is in command of the flotilla colonel stern is with the troops  this is startling news indeed the planter said after a moments silence you say they will not attack till eleven i will have the horses put in at once i will take elise to my neighbour rogen whose house is three miles inland i shall be back again in plenty of time to take my part in the affair or noyou shall drive her there van houten i dare say that you would like to do so  thank you sir  but can i not stay here  no dear her father said decisively you might be hit by a chance shot and i dont want to be in a state of anxiety about you while i have other things to do  he rang the bell standing on the table a servant entered in the first place go and tell domingo to put the horses into the carriage at once and to bring it round to the door then bring in glasses and a bottle of rhine wine  ten minutes later van houten started with elise the native driving on the way he gave her a sketch of all that had happened since he went away and told her of the plans of the sea tiger the girl shuddered  from what a fate have you saved me she murmured but it would not have been so for i would have killed myself  i do not think that he would have given you much opportunity for doing that he said that he would take good care that no weapon should be put in your way however thank god that his schemes have been thwarted by his own folly in torturing me by telling me of his intentions you need have no fear of the results of this fight taken wholly by surprise as they will be and bewildered by the attack on their ships we are certain to defeat them on land and i trust that we shall capture all their ships and the lesson will be so terrible that it will be a long time before any other is likely to follow the sea tigers example  on arriving at the planters house he found that he and his son had ridden into batavia at four oclock in obedience to the governors call his wife and daughter were glad to have elise with them and leaving her to tell the story philip drove back to her fathers  the column arrived three minutes after his return and the colonel went round the ground with van houten and the planter the house stood some three hundred yards from the shore the ground slanting gradually down from it there were plantations on either side four of the guns were placed under the broad verandah with the fiveandtwenty men who were to work them the rest were distributed among the shrubberies on either side of the open space running down from the house towards the water where they would take the pirates as they advanced in flank van houten offered to take ten of the planters down to destroy the boats when the malays had left them  ten of the colonists volunteered for the service and were provided from the storehouse with axes for staving in the boards they posted themselves in a clump of bushes close to the shore a quarter of an hour passed and then they heard five loud splashes and a confused noise and knew that the pirates ships had anchored then came a creaking of pulleys and grating sounds and they knew that the boats had been lowered the lights in the house had all been extinguished and perfect silence reigned presently there was a sound of many oars and the beat of paddles and five minutes later ten large boats crowded with men appeared making for the shore and in a few minutes the grating of the keels was heard on the sand and dark figures could be seen making their way up the beach  there must be three hundred of them at least van houten said to the man who was standing next to him and i fancy that about the same number remain on board as far as i can make out there are only one or two men left on guard at each boat we will creep up as quietly as we can directly the firing breaks out each of you will pick off his manthe noise will not be noticed in the row that will be going on up above then let two go to each boat and stave in a couple of planks and then go along and do the same with the others but see that it is done thoroughly directly all the boats are damaged hurry back here and open fire upon the pirates as they return traces have been fastened to the guns and the artillerymen will run them down towards the waters edge and the soldiers will advance and surround the scoundrels as they strive to push the boats off not one of them should be able to regain their ships  the pirates were led by a man whose white dress showed up clearly in the darkness and who van houten was sure was the sea tiger himself they advanced towards the house in an irregular line the two flanks rather in advance no sound was heard among them it was evident that they had been ordered to preserve silence until the house was surrounded they went on and on until they could be no longer seen by the watchers suddenly a voice shouted fire  six guns loaded to the muzzle with bullets spoke out and the musketry in a semicircle flashed from the shrubbery now is our time van houten cried the ten men went forward at a run within twenty yards of the nearest boat they halted and poured in their fire and more than half the men standing together on the beach fell then they dashed forward two minutes sufficed to do the work and they ran back to the bush from which they started the din above was terrible the malays for a moment staggered by the terrible and unexpected fire had run back a few paces but the voice of their leader encouraged them and with loud yells they again rushed forward  the cannon were silent for loading was a long operation in those days but by the colonels orders only half the soldiers had taken part in the first volley and the others now poured in their fire  the malays pushed on recklessly and were within twenty yards of the house when they paused as two broadsides were fired in quick succession out at sea the dutch vessels had passed behind the pirates and having delivered their first broadside had tacked and laid themselves alongside the ship of war pouring in their other broadside as they did so at the same moment a musketryfire opened from the whole of the pirate ships answered more loudly from the boats for comparatively few of the malays carried firearms  this unexpected attack did what the fear of death could not effect with a yell of alarm and rage they turned and ran down towards their boats then the soldiers poured out from their concealment those by the guns seized the traces and ran them down to a distance of fifty yards from the shore and poured their contents into the crowded mass the malays leapt into their boats and pushed them off but before they were fairly afloat they were full of water to the gunwale most of them jumped over and started to swim towards the ships others leapt ashore and drawing their krises rushed at the troops and fell there fighting fiercely to the end then the guns were run down to the shore and poured showers of grape among the swimmers in the meantime firing had ceased on board the ship of war and two of the pirates and the cheers of their captors rose loudly on the others fighting was still going on and the yells of the malays and the cheers of the dutch could be plainly heard  in one the fighting presently ceased but in the other the malays were apparently successful the sounds grew fainter and the direction showed that the malays had beaten off their opponents cut their cable and were under sail three minutes later there was a flash of guns and their light showed the warship also under sail evidently in pursuit answering guns came back and these grew farther away of the malays who had landed some twenty unwounded had alone been taken prisoners these were placed under a strong guard the colonel hailed the ships to send a boat ashore it presently arrived and they heard as they supposed that four of the ships had been recaptured and that the leyden was in pursuit of the other  they also heard that only some twenty of the men of the naval expedition had been killed for so completely were the malays taken by surprise that their assailants had gained a footing on their decks comparatively without opposition sails had been at once hoisted when the boat had rowed ashore and the vessels made for batavia where at noon next day the leyden arrived with her prize not a man had fallen of the dutch force on shore though a few had been wounded by the malays who finding their retreat cut off had rushed at them  directly the fight was over philip drove over in the trap that had been kept waiting on the other side of the house and told elise and the rogens that all was over that the formers father and he were both unhurt and that the dreaded pirate had fallen shot through the head within twenty yards of the house  your father requests that you will stay here till morning elise he said then he will drive over and take you into batavia where he will join you and you will stay there until all signs of the fight have been removed  batavia went wild with joy at the news of the capture of the whole of the pirate fleet and the destruction of the sea tiger and his followers no quarter had been given on board the vessels first captured and thirty malays alone survived the fight of the vessel brought in by the leyden all the prisoners were tried and shot three days later van houten was the hero of the occasion and received immediate promotion all felt that had he not warned them the town would almost certainly have been captured and every soul in it massacred  a month later the whole of batavia and the neighbourhood thronged to the church to witness the marriage of captain van houten and elise meyers     on the track     chapter i  a sad christmas   never had there been such a sensation since the day when brownsville ohio was first founded as that which was experienced on the 23rd of december 1879 at the news that mr partridge the cashier at the bank had absconded and that a great number of valuable securities and a large sum of money were missing the first report indeed stated that the bank would have to suspend payment but the panic caused by this was speedily allayed by the issue of a notice signed by james johnstone president to the effect that the loss although heavy would in no degree affect the stability of the bank that the assets were equal to all demands and that the books had already been placed in the hands of skilled accountants who would before nightfall certify to the stability of the bank  this did not however prevent a run taking place but as all demands were promptly met and as at six oclock in the afternoon a satisfactory assurance as to the state of the bank signed by the two accountants was affixed to the doors confidence was restored and the people were able to concentrate their attention upon the subject of the missing cashier a few said that they had always suspected that something was wrong but these were the people who are always wise after an event the majority admitted frankly that there was nothing in william partridges antecedents or behaviour which would warrant a shadow of suspicion as to his probity he was not altogether a popular man and was what the people of brownsville called high in his notions that is to say he did not care about mixing much in general society being intimate only with a small circle of friends  there was nothing indeed in mr partridges way of living which would not have been warranted by the salary he was known to draw he lived in a pretty house just outside the town and certainly spent more money than his neighbours in keeping his garden bright with flowers but he never entertained on a large scale his dinners were choice but small he kept no equipage and had no expensive tastes his reputation indeed was that of a somewhat retiring man with a higher degree of culture and education than most of his neighbours with quiet and refined manners and studious tastes all these things however would not have prevented him from being seized with the demon speculation for many another man apparently as quiet and as refined had ruined himself that way and the verdict of brownsville was unanimous that he must have become involved in some extensive speculations which had failed signally and to bolster himself up must have taken the bank funds and securities hoping to be able to replace them at the next turn of luck  everyone agreed that the greatest credit was due to the president whose vigilance and astuteness had detected the defalcations before they had reached a point which would have proved ruinous to the bank its shareholders and depositors mr james johnstone had always been a popular personage in brownsville but he was never so popular as upon this occasion a deputation of shareholders and depositors waited upon him to express their thanks for his vigilance and watchfulness and although mr johnstone did not say much he led them to understand that they had every reason to be grateful for that things would very shortly have been in a very bad way had it not been for his interposition  the president was a tall man and just sufficiently inclined to stoutness to add to his appearance of respectability and solvency he was smoothly shaven and wore gold eyeglasses and looked a director every inch while his cashier never attended public gatherings on scientific political or sordid subjects the president was always a prominent figure at them he never however took a leading part on either side but appeared rather in the character of an arbitrator his speeches were always pleasing to both parties throwing oil on the troubled waters he was a large subscriber to all the local charities and although he himself belonged to the baptist persuasion he made no distinction between the various creeds in the distribution of his alms such being the case when brownsville once realized the fact that its own savings were in no jeopardy its sympathy with the banker for the annoyance and trouble that this occurrence would cause him became very great the matter was discussed in all lights at every teatable in brownsville and even formed the principal topic of conversation among a number of young people who were preparing a schoolroom for the festivities which were to take place on the following evening  what is to be done about roland partridge lilla fairfax a girl of some sixteen years of age asked during a pause in the buzz of conversation  of course he wont have the bad taste to show his face here percy johnstone the presidents son replied  i dont see that cissie white a girl who had however taken no part in the conversation but had been sitting in a corner undisturbed manufacturing wreaths said warmly he is not to blame for the faults of his father  bravo cissie percy johnstone said in a sneering voice it is as well that he should know what a valiant champion he has but you see we have scriptural authority for saying that children must suffer for the faults of their fathers  it was not meant in that way the girl retorted and i think it very mean of you to talk so i suppose you think because roland partridge is to suffer for the fault of his father that you are a great man because of the numerous virtues of yours  there was a general laugh for percy johnstone was known to give himself airs to no inconsiderable extent on account of the social position of the banker he coloured hotly at the reply and the laughter that followed it but found no answer ready at hand  but really lilla fairfax said we ought to decide what we are to do about roland partridge i dont see that there is any necessity for quarrelling over it but we have got to discuss it it would not be quite pleasant you know for him to be coming amongst us just as if nothing had happened you would not like it yourself cissie  i should not like what cissie white asked shortly  well you would not like to go out sleighing with him for example  i should certainly go out sleighing with him if he asked me cissie answered quietly indeed he did ask me two days ago and i said yes and if he comes to fetch me i shall certainly go now  he is not likely to jane simmonds the eldest girl present said  no he is not likely to cissie agreed he has other things to think about i only say that if he does come i shall keep my engagement  quite right cissie tom fernlea said heartily i like a friend who is a friend not a mere fairweather bird there is no better fellow going than roland he may not be quite so brilliant as some fellows and he glanced at percy and he does not go out of his own way to make himself popular but i prefer good straightforward earnest fellows and i would almost back him against all brownsville  there are a good many people percy johnstone said coldly who would perhaps have said as much two days ago for his father perhaps you may change your opinion one of these days  i am not likely to change my opinion of you at any rate tom replied hotly and that is a pretty strong one i can tell you everyone knows that you never liked roland because he always beat you in class and he is a better baseball player and a better skater and a better fellow all round than you are  oh dear oh dear lilla fairfax exclaimed plaintively whatever are you all quarrelling about we have come here to make decorations for tomorrow and the demon of discord seems to have entered in i vote girls that the next person who quarrels whoever he or she may be shall be unanimously expelled from this society  there was a chorus of assent jane simmonds dexterously changed the conversation by asking whether the arrangements had quite been settled for the programme of the following evening it was easy however to see during the rest of the meeting that less interest than usual was taken in the various discussions and that the thoughts of most of the young people were otherwise occupied little whispered conferences went on before they broke up the opinions of most of those present were ascertained and were found to be pretty equally divided as to the advisability or otherwise of treating roland partridge just as if his father had still been occupying the position of cashier at the bank  while the conversation had been going on the subject of it was pacing up and down the sittingroom at home discussing the matter with his mother roland had a few days before gone over to stay for a week with an uncle who lived some twenty miles away and had that morning received a telegram from his mother begging him to return at once and it was not until he reached home in the evening that he heard the terrible news  but it is impossible mother absolutely impossible that my father can have done this thing  that is what i say roland your father is the last man in the world to do such a thing  he never speculated as far as you know mother  no roland i am quite sure that he didnt he was quite contented with his position he wanted nothing more and i have often heard him say that no one connected with a bank had any right whatever to engage in business outside it  but what did he say mother surely he must have said something when he left you last night  he came in about halfpast nine roland he has been staying late at the bank this week making up the books he was as pale as death his lips were trembling and he could hardly speak when i begged him to tell me what was the matter with him he said as nearly as i can remember his words a terrible thing has happened and i must go away at once the bank has been robbed  but what has that to do with you william i asked i am accused of doing it he said i almost laughed it seemed so absurd but he went on appearances are terribly against me it is all a mystery to me but if i stay i shall be arrested tomorrow morning and surely condemned and i could not stand it it would kill me i must go there is no other way i will write to you and tell you what to do when i can think it over but i cant think now he was in such a nervous state that it was useless to speak to him and indeed i was so stunned with the news myself that i could think of nothing i did say it would be far better for you to stay william and face it out your innocence is sure to be proved but he only shook his head and repeated i must go  so i hurried to get a few things together for him and the moment that i had done so he was off to catch the train i dont think he was five minutes in the house altogether and it was not till he had gone that i was able to think clearly what had happened  i am not blaming you mother dear roland said tenderly but it is most unfortunate that father should have acted as he did you and i know perfectly well that he is innocent but his running away will of course convince everyone else that he is guilty it would have been a thousand times better to have braved it out however strong the circumstances might be that point against him  so i think of course roland but you know what your father is and naturally i understand him even better than you do you have only known him since he was prosperous and respected here but in the early days of our marriage when he was still a struggling young man i learnt i will not say the faults my son but the weaknesses of his character he is as you know a man of strict nay of extreme honour and integrity but he is sensitive almost to a fault he has no selfassertion and very little selfconfidence he is just the man in fact to bend before a storm rather than brave it and although i may greatly lament it i am not a bit surprised that when suddenly confronted with such a terrible accusation as this and seeing as he says that circumstances are altogether against him he should abandon the field without a struggle rather than face the storm of public obloquy and indignation  roland was silent he knew how his father shrunk from anything like a public turmoil and how easily upset he was by trifles which another would scarcely have noticed and although he had never acknowledged as much to himself he had even when much younger been vaguely conscious that his father was lacking in force of character there was a disinclination to find fault a shrinking from unpleasantness and an avoidance even of argument a desire that everything should go on with clocklike regularity and that nothing should disturb the even tenor of life which seemed to show a constitutional avoidance of effort or struggle still as roland had as his mother said only seen his father under circumstances of ease and comfort he could not tell how far this was an innate defect in his character until it now showed itself so disastrously  you dont know where he has gone to mother he said at length because if you have the slightest idea as to the locality i will start at once to try and find him and to persuade him to return whatever the circumstances may be against him it would be a thousand times better to brave it out than by running away to make what cannot but appear a tacit confession of guilt and now mother dear what do you intend to do  that is what i was wanting to talk to you about roland it seems to me that the best thing to do will be to give up our house at once and to sell the furniture and then in the meantime if i do not hear from your father to move right away to some place where we shall not be known and where i can earn a little money by my needle and you perhaps can obtain a situation of some sort  no mother roland said decidedly i quite agree with you as to giving up the house and selling the furniture but go away we will not father may have given up the battle in despair but i shall stay and fight it out we know that he did not take this moneyit is for me to find out who did so if we go away the matter can never be cleared up so long as we remain here there is a chance of our striking on some clue or other  it will be dreadful mrs partridge began  it will be horribly painful roland agreed awful to have to meet all your old friends and know that they regard one as the son of a swindler but it has to be done mother for only so can we hope to prove that father is an honest man but i dont ask you to stay mother i am quite sure that uncle will be glad for you to go and live with him at the farm he was saying only yesterday that it had been a dull life for him since aunt had gone  no my boy i could not do that mrs partridge said i could not leave you here to bear the burden alone  dont think me unkind mother when i say i would rather that you would i think i could bear the changed faces of old friends so long as the slights affect only myself but i should suffer ten times more in seeing you suffer therefore mother i do think that my plan is the best i hope that it will not be for very long but till matters are made clear it will be best for you to stay with uncle and i could run over from time to time to see you and tell you how i am getting on  at any rate roland there is no occasion to decide for a few days the first thing to do is to get rid of the house and sell the furniture when that is done we can talk matters over again  the next morning roland called upon their landlord and asked him if he would take the house off their hands at once this the landlord willingly agreed to do and was indeed well pleased with the proposition he had already been wondering how mrs partridge intended to manage the lease had still two years to run but he did not see how she would be able to pay her rent he had that morning received an application from a gentleman who was willing to take the house if he could obtain possession at once and rolands proposal to move out at the end of a week exactly suited him after settling this matter roland went to an auctioneer and arranged that notice should at once be issued of the immediate sale of the furniture he returned home well pleased with the success of his mission  as far as i am concerned mother i think things will be better than i expected i see there is a difference of opinion in brownsville i have met several people we know well this morning some of them just gave me a nod as much as to say we see you but dont want to speak to you others nodded as if they would have liked to have stopped and chatted with me but were rather afraid to do so while tom fernlea and two other fellows came up and shook hands just as heartily as usual and asked when i came back from uncles what i had been doing and so on as if nothing had happened at any rate mother a thing like this gives one an opportunity of finding out which of your friends are worth having and which are not  there was a certain indication of bitterness in his tone and his mother looked at him a little anxiously you will not get cynical i hope roland my dear boy you must remember that a vast number of people act quite as much in accordance with what they think other people will do as with their own convictions we are all apt to be guided by the opinions of the world and though it seems hard that the sins of parents should in any degree be visited upon their children we must remember that children get the benefit the other way if a boy or a girls father is a rich and popular man they will be made more of than when not so situated of course this is wrong and everyone should be judged by themselves and no doubt that eventually is the case of course if one whom we believed to be a true friend fell away at a time of trial it would be a proof that his friendship was not a true one but we must not be surprised if any mere acquaintances go with the stream whatever its direction may be  you are becoming quite a philosopher little mother roland laughed at any rate as i said things are better than i expected of course it is no good doing anything for the next day or two and a shade passed over rolands face as he thought how widely his christmas day would differ from his anticipations of it but next week i will go round and see if i can get something to do i am not particular what it is as long as it enables me to stay at brownsville     chapter ii  true friends   late in the afternoon roland went out to get a few things that were required suddenly he came on a group of half a dozen girls who had just finished putting up the decorations in the schoolroom the first couple passed him with a bow but cissie white who was walking next stopped with her companion and shook hands with him  how are you roland we have missed you at decorations this afternoon  i was sorry not to be able to come cissie roland said and i am sorry i shall not be able to keep my engagement to go sleighing on the 26th  i am very sorry too i should have been so glad to have gone with you if you could have taken me but i was afraid you would not be able to i want to tell you rolandand she hesitated i dont know whether people talk about such things but i am sure you wont mind i want to tell you how sorry we all are about the news we have heard and to say i hope it is not going to make any difference to you  i am afraid it must make a difference cissie roland answered but thank you very much for what you have said and i want to tell you that whatever people may think i and my mother know that my father did not do this thing that they accuse him of and some day i hope to prove his innocence  i am so glad to hear you say so roland it did seem impossible and yetand she hesitated  and yet everyone said so he put in unfortunately my father is a very nervous and sensitive man and the thought of such a charge made him wellnigh beside himself and he went away but he is not guilty for all that and some day i will prove it will you please tell the peoplethe people i know i meannot that my father is innocent for they might not believe it but that his wife and son are absolutely sure that he is so  i will indeed roland and i am very very glad to hear what you say you may be sure that whatever other people say in future i shall believe it as you tell me goodbye now and again shaking hands warmly she hurried away after her companions who were waiting for her at the corner of the next block  what have you found to talk about cissie i would have stopped and spoken too only i could not think what i should say  i told him that i was sorry to hear the news cissie said and that i hoped it would not make any difference to him  oh cissie you dont mean to say you alluded to that how could youa chorus from the others  why not cissie asked he knew that we must be thinking about it and why shouldnt i say it and i am glad i did for if i had not spoken perhaps he would not have alluded to the matter and he told me that whatever other people might say he and his mother were quite sure that mr partridge did not take the money  there was an incredulous oh from her hearers and jane simmonds asked what did he run away for then if he wasnt guilty  because he is sensitive and could not stay to face such an accusation of course roland did not say that he was foolish but i could see that he thought that it was an awful pity  i should think it was jane simmonds replied sarcastically of course his wife and son say they think he is innocent that is only natural but they wont get anyone to believe them  you are wrong for once jane cissie said quietly although i know that it must appear to you to be quite impossible but as it happens i believe them entirely and although i am a very insignificant person still i am somebody and that you see upsets your sweeping assertion  well my dear jane simmonds replied if you wish to retain your reputation as a sensible girl i should advise you to keep your opinion to yourself unless indeed you wish to set up as knowing more than anyone else in the town  i shall do nothing of the sort cissie replied cassandra was looked upon as an idiot you know but she turned out to be right brownsville is welcome to entertain the same opinion about me and i am content that they should think so till i turn out to be right as you will see will be the case in the end and now i must be off to tea  the sale came off on the day arranged no word had been received from mr partridge but his wife had hardly expected that he would write so soon and as she knew he had some hundred dollars in his possession when he went away she was under no uneasiness respecting him on the morning of the sale she went to her brothers rolands plan having finally been decided upon as the best the day before the sale mrs partridge received a note from mr johnstone saying that he should be glad to obtain a position for her son in a mercantile house in new york to which mrs partridge replied that she was greatly obliged and thankful for the offer but that roland had quite made up his mind that for the present he should remain in brownsville where he hoped to obtain some sort of occupation  the refusal was speedily known in brownsville percy johnstone spreading the news everywhere it excited surprise among some displeasure among many  i think it was wonderfully good of my father percy told his friends after the trouble and loss the fellows father has caused to offer to put him into a situation i should have thought that he would have been only too glad to have got away from here and i am sure his absence would have been a relief to us all i cant understand his motives  many others even among those most favourably disposed towards roland were inclined to agree with percy his continued presence in brownsville would be a source of embarrassment and trouble to those who had previously been intimate with him and it did seem strange that he should prefer to live among people cognisant of his fathers misdoings instead of taking the opportunity that offered of beginning life elsewhere  mr johnstones conduct in interesting himself on his behalf was considered kind in the extreme still more surprise was excited when at the meeting of the directors of the bank called a day or two after the beginning of the new year after explaining the amount of the loss to the bank he said in reply to questions that he had not as yet offered any reward for the apprehension of the fugitive and had not indeed instructed the police to take any steps in the matter rumours to that effect had already been current for the police authorities when interviewed on the subject had declared that they had no instructions on the matter but it was generally supposed that this was mere official reticence intended to lull the fugitive into security while they were quietly working to arrest him the announcement of mr johnstone caused quite a sensation among his colleagues  i must say mr johnstone one said angrily that your course in this matter appears to me to be most extraordinary as you did not call us together at once we naturally supposed that you were taking all the necessary steps and that partridge would in a few days at latest be in the hands of the police and now you meet us and tell us that you have done nothing you said in fact when we wanted to go into the question on the morning after the discovery of the cashiers flight and one of us suggested that a hot pursuit should be at once set on foot that we could safely leave that matter in your hands and that we had best confine our attention to the investigation of the accounts  several others spoke to the same effect and mr johnstone then rose with his usual placid and undisturbed aspect gentlemen he said in the first place i have not called you together earlier because just at this time of year every man is occupied more or less by family matters and as it did not seem to me that there was any extreme urgency in the matter i thought i would allow you to enjoy the holiday undisturbed now as to the main subject of your remarks namely that i have taken no steps to secure the arrest of our late cashier well gentlemen i am aware that in not doing so i have assumed a certain amount of responsibility certainly when i met you ten days since i had intended to set the police at work without delay for the first twentyfour hours however i was so occupied with the investigations into the state of the books and i may say with reassuring the minds of our depositors and restoring confidence that i had really no time to move in the matter  then gentlemen came christmas with christmas thoughts christmas sermons and christmas associations and i said to myself this man is undoubtedly a thief and a defaulter but how stands it the man should be punished but gentlemen for the last fifteen years he has been our friend we have all been proud of him as a gentleman of singular culture most of us have been intimate at his house and acquainted with his wife one of the most charming ladies in our section in all these years his conduct has been above reproach and although he has had passing through his hands the funds of the bank he has up till now accounted for them up to the last penny there can be no doubt that the mania of speculation which is the bane of our civilization seized upon this unhappy man and that in a moment i may say of temporary insanity he laid his hands upon the bank funds to meet some loss intending no doubt to replace them at the earliest opportunity  well gentlemen that opportunity never came we know the usual sad story in these cases loss follows loss and a man becomes desperate until at last comes the inevitable discovery gentlemen we all know that the man who does these things should be punished but it seemed to me that no punishment that the law could allot would add very greatly to that which he must be now suffering imagine gentlemen a man with refined tastes and habits skulking a fugitive from justice perhaps by this time halfway across the ocean knowing that he can never raise his head again in the society of honest men there was nothing to gain for you may be sure that the money has long since passed out of his hands and i feel that it would do us no good were he arrested and tried everyone knows now that the bank has made a loss they are also satisfied that the bank is solvent confidence is restored and we have avoided anything like a run no one indeed has any idea how large the losses really are outside this board  now gentlemen if we were to have a trial the real amount of the loss would become known and although we ourselves may feel confident that we can weather the storm and can in time pull round it is by no means certain that the public will take the same view the run which has now been averted might then take place and the bank be compelled to shut its doors and you know gentlemen that when you come to a forced realization of effects how far the sum realized falls short of the value placed upon it and how heavy the calls upon the shareholders to make up the deficiency well gentlemen we are all large shareholders in the bank and now that ten days have elapsed and we have kept matters quiet i ask you is it worth while to run the risk of bringing ruin upon the bank and beggary upon its shareholders merely for the pleasure of knowing that our defaulting cashier has got so many years of penal servitude  put in this light the matter assumed a very different appearance the directors knew well enough that although they had put a good face on the matter the loss did seriously compromise the stability of the bank and that the less the matter was dragged before the public the better the directors looked at each other in silence when mr johnstone concluded but one said the public will think it a most extraordinary thing that we do not prosecute  but we intend to prosecute mr johnstone said it is distinctly understood that is our intention but facts have come to our knowledge which leave no doubt that our cashier escaped into canada within a few hours of his leaving this place and it is believed by this time he has crossed the atlantic should he ever return to this country he will of course be prosecuted at once on grounds of public policy and as a duty to the shareholders but at the same time we have no objection to its being whispered abroad that although the directors would strictly carry out their duty had the opportunity been afforded they are at heart by no means sorry both for the sake of the man himself and for that of his wife that he has succeeded in escaping before the hand of justice could be laid upon him  after some further discussion the view taken by the president was unanimously approved of and the report that the cashier was known to have escaped into canada and had made his way to europe and that the bank authorities were convinced that he had managed to take but little with him and were not sorry that the painful duty of prosecuting him had been avoided was speedily spread through the town  the unpleasantness which his former friends had anticipated from the strange resolution of roland partridge to remain in brownsville was not experienced for he never showed himself in his old resorts and was seldom to be met with in the streets it was known that he had applied for several situations but without success and that he was at present living in a poor lodging in the outskirts of the place  have you seen roland partridge lately cissie white asked tom fernlea  no i havent i have not seen him since christmas eve  have you been to see him tom you know where he lives  yes i know no i have not been there yet i have been meaning to go every day but what with the sleighing parties and one thing and another i have never found time  then you ought to have found it cissie said indignantly i did not think that you were that sort of boy tom i thought that you would have stuck to your friend i am downright ashamed of you  well i am ashamed of myself now that you have put it so though i really do mean to stick to him you know i have an engagement this evening but i will get out of it and go  you ought to have gone a week since cissie said very little mollified call yourself a friend and let your amusements stand in the way for ten days of your going to see a chum who is all alone and in trouble i would not give a fig for such friendship as that  well you are a staunch friend anyhow cissie tom said admiringly it is not every girl who would care to stick up for a boy as you do for roland  why shouldnt i stick up for him she asked scornfully his mother and mine were friends and many a pleasant afternoon have i spent there why shouldnt a girl stick up for her friend as well as a boy i should like to know i liked roland partridge better than any of the boys in our set and i dont care who knows it and i say it is scandalous his being cut because his father turned out badly even if he did turn out badly which i dont believe  oh come now cissie that is too much somebody said that you did not believe mr partridge was guilty but i put that down to pure obstinacy well you need not look angry about it because i like people who are obstinate for their friends but i did not imagine that you really could think so  why shouldnt i i have a right to my thoughts tom fernlea i suppose as well as you have do you think that roland partridge would tell a lie  no i am sure that he wouldnt tom said all the years that i have known him i have never heard him tell anything like an untruth  well then why shouldnt you believe him now he says that he and his mother are absolutely convinced that his father is innocent i suppose they are quite as likely to know the truth of the matter as anyone in brownsville  well cissie if roland says that he must have grounds for such a statement anyhow i will go to see him this evening i need not tell him i suppose that you sent me  if you do i will never speak to you again tom fernlea so now you know  when tom called at rolands lodgings that evening he was told that he was out whereupon he took post at the door and waited for an hour when his friend returned  i have come for a chat he said old fellow if you will let me in i have been waiting for an hour to see you i should have called before but you know how engaged fellows are just at this time of the year however i was determined i would come this evening so i threw over the party at the dawsons and here i am  i am glad to see you tom come in roland said quietly he led the way up to his room and lighted a candle  you are looking pale and out of sorts old fellow he said as he saw rolands face i know you have had an awful lot to upset you but still it is of no use letting it make you ill it is easy i know for me to talk he went on as he saw a slight smile on rolands face for i am sure that i should be horribly cut up if i were in your position do you think it quite wise roland your determination to stop here i should have thought that you would be only too glad to be away from it all but they say that you refused an offer that mr johnstone made you of a situation in new york of course you know your own business best but if i had been in your place i should have jumped at it  well you see tom it depends how you look at things if i thought my father guilty i would go right away quick enough but as i am sure that he is not you see i stop  yes cissie white was telling me so this afternoon roland i heard before that she was saying so but it was not until she told me herself this afternoon that i believed she was quite in earnest you will excuse my saying so but up till then i had thought as other people do but when she said that you had assured her that your mother and yourself were thoroughly convinced that your father was innocent i saw matters in an entirely different light for i know that even on such a thing as that you would not say anything that you didnt really believe but in that case you dont mind my asking you why your father went away  i dont mind your asking at all tom i would much rather people spoke plainly what they think instead of avoiding all allusion to the subject i was away you know when father went but from what he said to my mother i imagine that in some way i cant say how he felt that circumstances were against him and that although he was perfectly innocent he was not in a position to prove it he is a very sensitive nervous man and i believe he felt at the moment that anything in the world would be better than standing up before everyone who believed that he was guilty i think that it was a terrible mistake however i can understand my father whose disposition is entirely different from mine taking the course he did now believing as i do that he is the victim of somebody elses crime i made up my mind to stay here and brave it out in order that if it be possible i may find out who has done it how i am going to set about it i cannot tell you but i may say that i will watch everyone who is connected with the bank and possibly i may obtain some clue  i understand now roland and quite agree with you as to your course i am very glad that you have told me for before i could not make you out  of course you understand tom this is for you alone if the real thief had an idea that he was being watched it would make him careful and diminish my chances i had rather people thought that i had stopped here from pure pigheaded obstinacy  you have not got a place yet have you roland  no i have applied for several situations but have always met with refusals no doubt the people thought that i was better away out of this  i will speak to my father if you dont mind roland my giving him a hint of what your motives are the old man is no talker and i know he used to like you very much and i am sure he will do what he can for you is there anything else that i can do  the thing i want to know roland said is if anyone connected with the bank here has been speculating in new york but i dont know how to set about it  let me see tom said thoughtfully you know my cousin arthur went away last year to a brokers office there of course he knows lots of clerks in other offices now if you dont mind my writing to him and telling him frankly all about it i am sure he will set to work heart and soul in the matter and maybe he will find out something  roland eagerly agreed and then for a couple of hours the lads sat chatting about school and other matters and when tom took his leave he felt that he had cheered his friend up and done him service     chapter iii  making a start   two days later tom fernlea again called on roland  my father says will you look round to his office tomorrow morning he did not tell me exactly what he wanted you for but i expect it is all right he was very much interested in what i told him yesterday and when the old man takes a thing up he generally carries it through so i expect there is something in the wind what a pity it is roland you did not see your father before he went away i have been thinking it over and it seems to me that if he had told you the whole circumstances you would have been sure to have got some clue to work upon  that is what i have thought a hundred times tom i hope that we shall hear from him ere long i may tell you privately that he is in canada my mother has had two short notes from him he is evidently in a sadly depressed state but says he is well the letters having canadian stamps on them we knew they came from there but he says nothing about where he is he is no doubt afraid that he may be traced and his extradition demanded but i hope soon that he will give us some address to which we can write to him directly he does i shall send him a letter saying that i am settled here and am going to make it the business of my life to prove his innocence and shall implore him to write to me fully every detail he can respecting the affair as his story may give me some sort of a clue as to the real thief  the next morning roland presented himself at the office of mr fernlea who was the leading lawyer of the town he was at once shown into the inner office  glad to see you roland you have not been up at the house with tom for the last month he has been talking to me about this business of your fathers i quite take the view you do i have been puzzled over the affair ever since i first heard of it but your fathers foolish flight deceived me as well as the rest of us i have no doubt what you say is correct and that he has been so badly scared that he helped the game of the rascals who are the real criminals by bolting however although that may be your opinion and mine it does not advance the case a bit your father by his own act has so to speak pleaded guilty and has been condemned and sentenced accordingly by public opinion and i tell you frankly that i dont think it is likely you will ever obtain a reversal of the sentence still i approve of the resolution which tom tells me that you have taken you could not have a nobler aim in life than to clear your fathers name and i am ready to aid you so far as to give you a seat in my office here with a salary of six dollars a weekno great thing but enough to keep you it is unlikely to my mind that you will ever get any clue which will aid you but if you should do i shall be most heartily glad to help you with my advice or in any other way in my power i had always a high respect for your father and will be glad to assist you for his sake but i may say frankly i will do so especially because you are a great friend of my tom and although he is not particularly bright he has i think enough good sense to choose his friends wisely and indeed i know now from my own observation in this instance he has done so now what do you say to my offer  i am extremely obliged to you sir it is most kind of you and is far better than anything i had hoped for  that is settled then you may as well begin at once mr mullins will show you what you have to do  roland was indeed glad at the opening which mr fernlea had made for him the utmost he had hoped for was to obtain a position in a store and as hitherto it had been intended that he should go to harvard at the beginning of the next term the thought of entering a store had gone somewhat against the grain now with the position in mr fernleas office he might be considered not only to retain the position he occupied among his schoolfellows and friends but to have taken the first step in a promising career  when it became known in brownsville that mr fernlea had taken roland partridge into his office there was much surprise and comment more than one leading man in the place had made overtures to the lawyer for placing his son with him but he had always declined saying that he found that he and mullins were able to get through the work and that he did not care for the trouble of teaching young bears there was a general feeling among these that the lawyer had in some sort of way done them a personal wrong by thus taking into his office the son of a defaulter and one whom they had hoped would be obliged to leave the place from his inability to find employment there  the lawyer however was not the man to concern himself with the opinions of others and would have been unconscious of the comments his decision had excited had not tom told him laughing that he had outraged the feelings of all the old women in the place tom did not forget his promise to write to his cousin in new york and to interest him in the search which roland had undertaken and did this so effectually that he received a letter by return saying that the writer would do anything he could to aid his old schoolfellow and that he would set enquiries on foot among all his acquaintances in brokers offices to find out if possible if any resident in brownsville had lately been going into extensive speculations a few days after roland had entered upon his new duties mr fernlea called him into his office  by the way partridge he said i have been thinking over that matter of yours with the idea that i might perhaps hit upon some clue upon which you might work i have not done so for a curious difficulty at once presented itself it naturally occurred to me that one of the methods to be first pursued was to find out through whose hands some of the stolen securities had passed and then to trace them backwards but when i came to think of it it at once struck me that the list of the securities stolen had never been published this was so singular and so out of the usual course that yesterday i spoke to one of the directors of the bank who had come in to smoke a cigar with me he said it had been decided by the board that as the frauds had extended over some months and as the defaulter had got safely away to canada there was no chance of being able to recover the securities which by this time had probably passed through a dozen hands and it was thought better for the credit of the bank and so on to let the whole matter drop but of course the defaulter would be arrested at once if he ever showed his face in this country again  the course the directors have taken strikes me as being a very unusual one i do not say that from some points of view it may not be a very wise one the loss may be heavier than people suppose and they may think it better not to call any further attention to it it may be that it was policy in fact i think perhaps it was so still it is certainly unusual and angry men do not always take the wisest course i said as much to my friend from what he said i gathered that they had been to some extent influenced by a feeling of sympathy with you and your mother and by their respect for your fathers former position in the place he said that was the view the president took and that they all fell in with it it wasnt my business to make any remark and i changed the subject but i must own the more i think it over the more unusual and singular it appears to me  no doubt they were influenced far more by the thought of the credit of the bank than by their sympathy with your father and mother and i must say that i am glad i am not a large shareholder in the bank still it is curious and at any rate one result is that there are no clues to be obtained from following up any of the missing securities of course the directors all know what has been taken but naturally they will keep their own council and no help is to be obtained in that way  now that it was manifest that roland partridge was settled for good in brownsville the little party who had from the first taken his side gained ground rapidly their argument was indeed unanswerable now that he was there it was as well to make the best of it tom fernlea and several others of his set would anyhow stick to him and as he would be met in their company it was of no use pretending to ignore his presence it would indeed only cause unpleasantness and disagreement consequently it was decided with but few dissentient voices headed by percy johnstone that roland partridge should again be received into the set as if nothing unpleasant had taken place accordingly he received an invitation to one of the first parties that was got up he showed it to tom fernlea  yes i knew it was coming tom said laughing we have won all along the line  of course i shall not go roland said  of course you will go tom replied dont make a fool or a martyr of yourself what has happened was natural enough people thought your father had got into a scrape and all the shareholders of the bank considered that they lost a lot of money by him it was generally thought that you would be leaving the town and naturally there was some sort of awkwardness about your joining in our fun as usual nobody thought any the worse of you for it was of course not your fault it was simply the awkwardness now that you are going to stay the matter has altered a month has passed and the story has become an old one everyone will meet you just as before and i shall be glad to have you with us again besides if you were to refuse it would place me and the others who have stuck to you all along in a very uncomfortable position for whenever you happened to be with us and we met some of the people whom you refuse to visit we should either have to pass without speaking or you would have to stand aloof in the cold while we were talking to them you made up your mind to live here and it is of no use your putting your back up and going about like a moral hedgehog so sit down like a good fellow and write and say that you will be happy to accept the invitation then go at once and secure a cutter for the day and ask cissie white if she will keep her old engagement i am going to take bessie hartley and i will arrange that two or three others shall start just at the same time and place so we can all drive there together in a party  roland felt that his friends advice was good and although it needed an effort to follow it he sat down at once and wrote saying that he would be very glad to join the party then he went out and secured the cutter and called at mrs whites and saw cissie  i have been asked to join the sleighing party next thursday cissie will you let me drive you  with pleasure roland i have an outstanding engagement with you you know and i have been hoping that you would call and remind me of it in fact i made so sure you would that i considered myself engaged and refused two invitations yesterday  that was good of you cissie you have been my best friend all through this business  not better than many others roland she said quietly the two sides were pretty equally divided all along and now we have won it is a triumph for us all  four cutters drew up together at mrs whites door at four oclock on the thursday afternoon tom fernlea and bessie hartley occupied one two of the others were filled with couples full of life and spirits while roland partridge held the reins in the fourth cissie white was all ready to start and came out at once and was soon muffled in the rugs by his side  hoorah tom fernlea shouted as they started this is what i call jollya glorious day capital company and lots of fun before us  the whole party were in great spirits and their laughter rose high as at a rapid pace they dashed along towards their destination this was a barn belonging to the father of one of the party who lived ten miles away two or three of the boys had gone over the day before to sweep and decorate the place the contributions of provisions had been sent over in a sleigh the previous afternoon and two or three cutters had driven on an hour or two before the rest to light the fire and prepare tea a fiddler had been engaged and after tea they were to dance and drive back at ten oclock by moonlight  on the way the party overtook several of the cutters and ten of them dashed up together in procession to the barn the jingling of the bells and the joyous shouts brought the early arrivals to the door and there was general greeting and shaking of hands and roland who had rather dreaded the moment soon felt himself at home again first of all the horses had to be put up in the stables and some empty barns and when this was done the boys made their way to the place of assembly some forty young people were gathered there all in the highest spirits a great wood fire blazed at one end and over it hung a huge cauldron of boiling water tables of boards and rough trestles were arranged down the side of the barn they were covered with snowy tablecloths on which were placed a great variety of eatables  a committee had decided what each of those present should contribute the most solid viands had been provided by the lads and cold turkeys chickens and joints of meat showed that there was an ample store for the fifty who were to share the feast while the variety of fruitpies cakes and sweets of all descriptions showed that the girls had fully done their share as soon as the last comers had arrived the meal began and all did full justice to it for the drive had sharpened their appetites by the time it was finished it was growing dark and while the boys cleared the tables and carried them outside others lit the candles placed in the sconces hired for the occasion and nailed against the sides of the barn while the girls washed up the teathings and packed them away in baskets ready for transport home on the following day then came five hours of dancing and as the clock struck ten the boys hurried off for the horses and the party started for home roland had enjoyed himself thoroughly with the exception of percy johnstone and one or two others everyone had behaved to him just as if the last month had been a blank except perhaps that there was a little extra kindness and cordiality as if each wished to show how glad he or she was to see him among them again  it was not so very dreadful was it cissie asked as they drove homeward  it was not dreadful at all he said i think cissie half our troubles arise from our own selfconsciousness we fancy people are thinking and talking about us when in fact they are not giving us a thought and if one does but grasp the nettle firmly one finds that there is no sting in it  the next morning roland received a letter from his mother saying that she had again heard from his father and although he had not precisely given his address he had given indications by which a letter could be addressed to him under a name not his own and roland that night sat down and wrote to him at great length he told him that he and his mother were convinced that he was the victim of anothers misdoings and that he had determined that if it was humanly possible he would find out the guilty party but that before he set about doing so with any chance of success it was absolutely necessary that he should be in possession of all the facts of the case and he implored him to write fully and frankly to him giving him every detail however minute which could bear upon it he concluded by saying  my dear father i know how very painful to you the thought must be of appearing in the light of a suspected person in the presence of those who have known and respected you but i cannot but think that it would have been better if you had made an effort and faced it out for your innocence must sooner or later have been proved however for the sake of your good name and my mothers happiness it is clearly incumbent on you now to aid us to the utmost in our effort to reestablish your good name even if to do so you should have to come back and demand a trial however this is not necessary now and i hope never will be but the first thing of all is for us to understand exactly what the circumstances were that have caused a suspicion of this crime to fall upon you     chapter iv  a clue   a week later roland received a letter from his father in answer to that he had written him its contents were as follows  my dear rolandi know that with your young heart and strong courage and a complete and happy absence of nerves you cannot but think it weak and cowardly of me to run away instead of waiting and fighting hard against circumstances i know as well as anyone can tell me that this is the course i should have adopted and a score of times since i came away i have been on the point of returning and giving myself up but each time when it has come to the point i have drawn back and despised myself for my cowardice but i cannot overcome it i had an unhappy childhood under a stern father and a very unkind stepmother and i think that any spirit i ever had was frightened out of me by the time i entered lifea shrinking sensitive young fellow conscious that i possessed fair abilities but altogether unfit to fight my own way  for some years life was very hard to me and my failing increased rather than diminished and then by some good chance certainly from no solicitation on my part a course opened before me i married your mothers firmness gave me support and her love and goodness brought me happiness then when i obtained the post of cashier at the bank of brownsville it seemed that my trials were over although i could never bring myself to mix much with other men i gained confidence in myself and believed that i had grown out of that extreme sensibility which had rendered my early years so unhappy when the trial came upon me suddenly i found that i was mistaken the thought of standing before the world accused of theft filled me with an overpowering fear and rather than stay and face it i should have put an end to my existence i know that you will scarcely understand this feeling i know that you will think it weak and cowardly i simply say my boy that i cannot help it and that i can no more withstand it than a madman can check his impulses  and now i have told you so much my son i will tell you of the events of that evening for some days i had been low and out of sorts a haunting sense that something was wrong had been upon me the last clerk before leaving had as usual laid the keys on the desk beside me i told him he could go as i had some hours work before me for an hour i went through the books and then a sudden impulse seized me i would examine some of the securities and see that none were missing i took the keys and went down to the strong room a thing which i never that i can recall had done after the bank was shut took out some large parcels of shares and bonds and locked the doors again i took them up with me to count in my room and compare them with the books i had just set to work when i heard the latchkey of the front door turn and a minute later mr johnstone came in you are at work late partridge he said i saw your light burning as i was passing why hallo he said with a change of voice what have you got all the securities up for that is rather unusual isnt it wasnt the strong room locked up before the clerks went away it had not struck me that there was anything strange about it but the tone of the presidents voice showed me that there was and my old nervousness seized me as if with a sudden grip and i have no doubt that the tone in which i explained my reason for going down into the strong room and bringing up the securities added to his suspicion however he said coldly i am not aware of anything that should have excited your suspicions that all was not right and induced you to unlock the strong room after the bank was closed however as you have brought up some of the securities and i have nothing to do for the next halfhour i will go through them with you  he sat down by my side and took the book containing the lists of the securities held by the bank and i read out the number of the bonds new york centrals of five hundred dollars each presently he said sharply that does not tally with the book he ran his eye down and remarked there are fifty missing here running in successive numbers between the last two you read out perhaps they are out of place i said and looked through the rest of the bonds but they were not there how do you account for this the president asked sharply i cannot account for it i said bewildered oh he said in an awkward tone that particularly struck me here are your initials to all these figures showing that they have been paid out when were they redeemed i looked at the book there were my initials sure enough the bonds had not been redeemed at all i was certain but there were my initials i looked at them thunderstruck  i have the highest opinion of you mr partridge the president said but this you must admit has a very curious appearance here i find you have after the bank has closed opened the strong room and have got some of the securities up here and i find that some of them are missing but that the book is initialled by you so that anyone else going through it with the securities would suppose that they had been parted with in due course your own manner if you will excuse my saying so strikes me as altogether suspicious however let us go through some more  each bundle that we examined showed deficiencies and although i had not brought up onetenth of the bonds and securities we found a deficiency of over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars when we had done mr johnstone did not make a single observation beyond briefly pointing out the numbers of the missing securities and added you see mr partridge i have but one course to follow the bank has been robbed of an immense amount how much as yet i have no means of knowing i find you here with the securities brought out of the strong room at this unusual hour these securities were entirely in your hands and no one touches them but yourself you can give me no explanation of the deficiency and in every case your initials are appended as a proof that they have been paid out in due course under such circumstances it is my duty to at once give you into custody  i had been getting more nervous and confused as each fresh discovery was made and the horrible consciousness of my position became stronger  i am innocent sir i exclaimed before god i am innocent  in that case mr partridge you will no doubt be able to prove it to the satisfaction of the jury in my mind i confess the matter is clear this book in which your entries are made is your own private property and you keep it i presume in your own safe here of which no one but yourself has a key and it is not the sort of book that you are in the habit of leaving about what you have done with the proceeds of the bonds i know not but that you have taken them seems to me as clear as day of course the matter may be explained in some way i hope that it will be you have worked here with me for the last fifteen years and i have hitherto not only had implicit confidence in you but respect and liking i would give anything to escape the situation in which i am placed but my duty is clear i must hand you over to the police  it will kill me i said i am innocent mr johnstone innocent as a child but the disgrace of this will kill me  he was silent for some time and then he said i am sorry for you mr partridge with all my heart and still more sorry for your wife this money i suppose is hopelessly gone in some wild speculationi again protested but he waved to me to be silentand irretrievably lost for the sake of our long friendship and of the good lady your wife i will suffer you to leave this office a free man i will take no steps till morning more than that i will if possible keep the affair out of the hands of the police for the next twelve hours by which time you ought to be across the frontier into canada i am risking a great deal in doing this but i will do it and i will satisfy my colleagues as well as i can there let no more be said go and strive in future by a life of strict honesty to justify the course which i am taking  i murmured something whether of thanks or protest i know not and seizing my hat went out into the air anyone who had noticed me on my way home must have thought me drunk for i know that i staggered blindly along your mother will have told you what happened when i got home that is the tale roland and it makes things look very black against me i was at the bank late having opened the strong room and taken out the securities the president coming in and finding me so employed went through the books with me and discovered large deficiencies in the securities which were never handled by anyone but myself worst of all in my private book kept always under lock and key are my initials showing that i am cognizant of the securities having been parted with lastly there is my flight and my manner against me in answer i give my bare protest that i knew nothing about the securities being missing and that though the initials appear indeed to be my own that i certainly never signed them though i own that the book was never to my knowledge out of my custody at any time and that the safe in which it was kept was always locked up by me of an evening that somebody has taken the securities is clear also that somebody has got at my book and forged my initials  but it is only this bare assertion that i have against all the facts that seem to prove me guilty i am going west i have made the acquaintance of a gentleman who has given me letters to two or three large storekeepers in winnipeg where under another name i hope to obtain employment there i trust your mother will follow me as for yourself you have told me you have been taken by mr fernlea into his office and i trust in spite of the terrible blot i have brought upon our name that you will succeed i have however no hope that you will be able to clear up the mystery of which i am the victim still i will not dissuade you from trying and although i cannot hope i shall pray day and night that success may attend your efforts  roland read the letter through and through until he had almost learnt it by heart the next morning he took it in to mr fernlea you know what my object is in remaining at brownsville mr fernlea i should like you to read this letter which i have received from my father i need not say that i shall show it to no one else i received it yesterday evening and have been thinking it over all night but i cannot see that it furnishes me with any clue such as i had hoped but you may think differently  mr fernlea read the letter through to the end then without a word he turned it over and reread it frankly roland he said when he laid it down is there no impression left in your mind after reading that letter  well sir roland said hesitatingly it seems too absurd but i cannot but think it a little strange that mr johnstone should let my father go off like that  that is it mr fernlea said johnstone has the reputation of being a pleasant gentleman adverse to trouble and contention and desirous of keeping on good terms with everyone but he has nevertheless been always sharp enough on creditors to the bank and has several times prosecuted when it appeared that the bank was the victim of sharp practices i have always wondered that no attempt to discover and arrest your father was made when the loss was first discovered which was i understood when johnstone examined the bonds on the morning when your father was found missing but now that i find he knew it before your father left it is still more surprising to me that he should have let him go he assumed as it seems by this letter that your father had spent all the proceeds of the robbery but why should he assume that  your father might still have had a great number of bonds in hand and by arresting him at once a considerable number of the stolen securities might have been recovered but this is not all there is one very singular fact in the story your father was reading over the numbers of the bonds when mr johnstone suddenly exclaimed that is wrong there are fifty bonds missing between the last two numbers you read out where are they why should he have said that as i take it the number of the bonds which had hitherto been read corresponded with the number of those marked still in hand that is to say of those against which no initial had been placed but it seems that these fifty were initialled what was there then to call johnstones attention to the fact that they should have been there that is very remarkable to say the least of it  roland clasped his hands before him oh mr fernlea do you really think  i dont think anything roland mr fernlea said sharply mr johnstone is president of the bank a prominent citizen a man of unblemished reputation i simply say that these facts stated together are singular and i think they give you a clue how that clue is to be followed up i cannot at present suggest i simply affirm that it is a clue now i want you to take the next train to chicago a client of mine wants some enquiries made about a house which he is thinking of purchasing here are the papers connected with it you can study them as you go along of course you will go to the land office and see if there are any mortgages on it and you will look up the titles  roland reached chicago in the afternoon where he at once set about making the necessary enquiries the lawyers upon whom he first called at once showed him the titles which appeared to him to be correct but of which he made an abstract for mr fernleas inspection he then went to the land office and found that mortgages were registered on the house from there he walked to the address of the owner which he found to be in a small street the house was shut up he made some enquiries carefully among the neighbours and found the reputation of the man was the reverse of favourable it was now getting late in the afternoon and he rode to the central telegraph office to send off a short message to mr fernlea with the result of his enquiries two or three persons were writing their messages and to his surprise he at once recognized in one of them mr johnstone of brownsville  there was nothing in the least strange that the banker should be at chicago a hundred and fifty miles from brownsville and had it not been that roland had been thinking of him all day the meeting would not have given him a second thought as it was he drew back instantly and took his place at a distant desk to write his own message house mortgaged for 2500 dollars title apparently good vendors house shut up neighbours give bad account of him i wait instructions just as he had finished mr johnstone turned from the desk and went up to the pigeonhole and handed in his message a question or two was asked and having paid his money he left  roland at once went to the same pigeonhole the girl was in the act of handing the message she had just received to an operator it is a cipher what tiresome things those are one has to be so careful with them and there is no sense to help one  mine is not a cipher roland said as he handed his in but my handwriting is not a very clear one your last message ought not to be difficult to make out for i know mr johnstones writing is as clear as print  johnstone the girl said glancing back over the others shoulder it isnt johnstone it is westerton  roland felt a thrill shoot through him but he answered carelessly oh is it i was mistaken in my man then i thought i knew him  an hour later he received a telegram from mr fernlea in answer to that he had sent it simply said come back he accordingly took the night train to brownsville and appeared at the office as usual in the morning  you have found out just what we wanted to know partridge the man is a sort of acquaintance of my client and wanted him to let him have a thousand dollars today pending the examination of the titles of course he said nothing about the mortgage already on the house my client believed it was all right and would have advanced the money had i not begged him to wait twentyfour hours so your trip has prevented him from throwing away a thousand dollars  i am very glad i went sir on my own account roland said for i have made a discovery which may be of importance i have found out that mr johnstone is in the habit of going over to chicago and despatching telegrams there in the name of westerton  and he then related the incident of the telegraph office  that may be of importance mr fernlea said but we must not place too much importance upon it he may possibly have sent off a message for some friend still it is a clue  so tom fernlea thought when roland told him the circumstances i must get you to write off again tom to your cousin you told me two days ago that so far he had not found out among his acquaintances that anyone here connected with the bank was speculating the thing now is to ask among them if anyone knows of a mr westerton of chicago dealing in ventures of that sort    chapter v  the fog clears   a week later tom brought roland a letter which he had received from his cousin my dear tomthe plot begins to thicken and i think we are on the right scent i was taking drinks with some other stock exchange men this afternoon when i said does anyone know westerton of chicago  yes he is a client of ours one of them replied he speculates pretty heavily in all sorts of stock and has dropped a lot of money the last six months do you know him because if you do it is more than anyone in chicago seems to the chief has asked lots of men there about him but no one seems to know the name of course it does not matter to us because there is always ample cover so we cannot burn our fingers but it does seem rum that a man who can go in for such heavy speculations should not be known to anyone there  no i dont know him i said but a man was asking me about him i fancy he speculates with him too  likely enough these fellows always have two or three agents we think it rather probable that it is a false name there is many a man who dabbles in speculations that none of his friends would ever believe did anything of the sort such as clergymen and merchants with solid businesses whose credit would be injured if men thought that they speculated and so on we who are behind the scenes would astonish the world if we were to tell all we know  however i turned the subject as i did not want him to suspect that i had any particular interest in westerton so you see tom the first step is gained and we have found out that the respectable president of brownsville bank speculates largely under an assumed name i dont know what partridges next move may be but if i can give any further assistance you can rely upon me  what are you going to do next tom said as he closed the letter  i havent the least idea tom but at any rate i will consult your father it is something to learn as much as we have and we certainly seem to have got on the right clue i never quite despaired but i feel now pretty certain that we shall get to the bottom of it at last  it will do percy johnstone a world of good to take down his conceit a bita stuckup monkey  dont say that tom i felt it myself so much that i am sure i could not wish my worst enemy to go through such a thing  i dont wish percy johnstone any particular ill roland but if somebody has got to suffer i would rather it was him than anyone else in brownsville the insufferable airs that fellow gives himself are disgusting  mr fernlea was greatly interested when he heard the news i have no doubt whatever that you are on the right track now roland taking your fathers letter the points we noticed when we read it and the facts we know now that johnstone is a heavy and unsuccessful speculator seem to show without doubt that he is the real thief his conduct in not arresting your father at once and in allowing him without pursuit to get across the frontier is accounted for now he did not want anything like a public trial for in that case the numbers of the missing bonds must have been made public and might in that way have been traced to him i have no doubt whatever that he is the thief but the question is how are we to prove it  of course if johnstone goes on at this game and it continues to be unnoticed there will be a smash up sooner or later but even then the whole thing might not come out if your father should come back here they would be obliged to arrest him but even if he denounced johnstone as the real thief we have nothing to go upon the mere fact that he has speculated would in itself be no proof or that he did so under an assumed name for he would urge that many people do the same and that he only adopted this precaution because being in the position of president of the bank he did not wish people here to know that he dabbled in shares i own that i do not see what our next step is to be it seems to me that we must wait and watch  that is what i was thinking sir will you kindly give me leave to be away from your office till this is done i should like to come here of a morning and go in and out as if i was in your employment in case mr johnstone was watching me which is not likely he would then suppose that i am still working for you but went out rather frequently on errands  certainly roland and if you want any money let me know anything that you may require to carry the matter through i shall be glad to let you have  thank you sir but i hope i shall not be obliged to avail myself of your kind offer my mother still has the proceeds of the sale of our furniture and i need hardly say how glad she will be to spend it if she knows that there is a chance of proving my fathers innocence  roland now kept a strict watch upon mr johnstones movements and the next time that gentleman boarded the train at brownsville roland did the same but got into a thirdclass compartment forward he was close at hand however when the banker presently took out his ticket which was only for a town some thirty miles out but when the train stopped at this station the banker ran into the office and procuring a ticket for chicago continued his journey to that city when he alighted there roland followed him he went to a small house in a retired quarter and on knocking at the door was admitted without question and roland concluded that he habitually stayed there he came out in a few minutes without the bag which he had carried in and as soon as he was fairly away roland seeing that there was a notice in the window that there was an apartment to let knocked at the door  you have a room to let he said can i see it  certainly sir and roland followed the woman upstairs the room will do very nicely he said i shall not be a troublesome lodger for i am a great deal away and shall only sleep here occasionally but i like to have a place of my own instead of always putting up at an hotel  that is just the case with our lodger downstairs sir he does not often sleep herenot more than one night in the week he travels i believe for some house of business but as he says he likes to have a quiet place to come to when here  he is your only other lodger i hope roland said for above all things i like quietness  yes sir we only let these rooms he is quiet enough when he comes here he generally comes in the afternoon but goes out directly and comes back again at seven to his dinner and he always goes off at six oclock in the morning a quieter gentleman no one could wish to have for a lodger than mr westerton  roland at once agreed to take the room and paying a deposit said that he would come on the following day to take possession my name is rowlands but it is not likely that anyone will come to enquire for me  having watched mr johnstone off by the first train in the morning roland went to his lodgings where he soon became friendly with his landlady who was quite ready to gossip she was full of praise for her other lodger i expect he has got a good situation she said money dont seem of any consequence to him he always has the best of everything that is in season no matter what it costs and he has got quite a cellar of wine and always takes a bottle with his dinner i am sure the room was furnished nice enough for anything when he came but he had all the furniture turned out and put in fresh himself and a heap of money it must have cost him i can tell you fresh paper on the walls and lookingglasses and pictures they are nice rooms indeed they could not be nicerexcept that the sittingroom is spoilt by a big ugly safe he has got to keep his papers in it just spoils the room as i told him but he dont seem to mind so there aint no reason why i should  i should like to see the rooms roland said not that i can afford to furnish mine like them at present  i will show you them with pleasure sir only if you meets him and gets to know him afterwards dont you let out that i showed you his rooms he is a mighty perticular sort of gent though he is so affable and pleasant  the rooms were quietly and handsomely furnished as roland had expected there was nothing whatever in them to give a clue to the identity of their owner no letters or papers were lying about rolands attention was particularly drawn towards the safe it was a strong burglarproof structure by one of the best makers  yes he said i agree with you the furniture is very handsome and good but i should not care if it were mine to spoil it with that safe  he told me he had lost a valuable lot of papers once and had determined that he would never run such a risk again and so he got a safe that could be neither carried off nor broken into  the next day roland returned to brownsville and informed mr fernlea of the progress that he had made  capital roland i shall certainly employ you in any detective work that may in future come into the office the two next steps to be taken are clear enough but it is not so easy to see how we are to take them in the first place we shall have to obtain a list of the missing securities and the next to find out whether any of them are still in that safe those are the steps but how on earth are we to take them your father would hardly be likely to remember the numbers of the missing bonds and i could not ask one of the directors without taking him into our confidence which i am averse to doing for they all hold johnstone in such respect that our idea would seem to them altogether preposterous  at any rate i could write to my father and ask him roland said he may not remember the numbers it is hardly possible that he should when there are such a lot of them missing but he might be able to give us some hint how to set about it  accordingly roland wrote a letter to his father informing him of the steps which he had taken and the discoveries which he had made  you see father he wrote that while mr fernlea has no more doubt than i have that johnstone stole the securities which he accused you of taking it is very difficult to bring the matter home to him and as a first step it is absolutely necessary to get the numbers of the bonds and that without there being a possibility of its coming to his ears that i am moving in the matter can you suggest any plan  a week later when roland had returned to his lodgings after dark a man was standing at the gate  roland my boy is that you  good heavens father how you startled me i am glad indeed to see you again but it is surely imprudent to venture back just at this moment for were your presence here discovered it would upset all our plans but come in i have a key and you can go up with me but even if the woman of the house saw you she would hardly be likely to recognize you for she has not been settled in the town very long  as soon as they were in his room roland struck a light and was able to look at his father he would hardly have recognized him so pale and haggard was he why father have you been ill  not actually ill roland though almost out of my mind at times but i trust that it is nearly over your letter has given me new life for it has made me hope that this black cloud which has fallen over me will be cleared away and that i can again lift up my head and look my fellowmen in the face i am ready now to give myself up if mr fernlea thinks that it will be the best thing for me to do and to stand my trial before i had nothing save a bare negative to oppose the evidence against me now there is at least a story to tell  we must not tell it at present father we must wait till it is complete if there is any evidence in that safe at chicago connecting johnstone with the thefts we may be sure that it would be destroyed the instant you appeared on the scene the first thing as mr fernlea says is to obtain a list of at any rate some of the securities that are missing we hardly hoped that you would be able to furnish them  no roland i could tell you the stocks to which they belonged but not the numbers and so far as i know there is but one way of doing so besides that of obtaining the list from one of the directors which you said in your letter mr fernlea thinks would be dangerous to do  and what is that father  it is for me to go to the bank and get the book which johnstone and i went through together that night  but how are you to do that father it is probably in the safe if it is still in existence  i supposed so roland but when i went away i never thought of leaving the keys behind me and found them days afterwards in the pocket of my overcoat unless they have changed the fastenings there is nothing to prevent my unlocking the door going up to my old room entering it and opening the safe as usual there would be no occasion even for a light for i know the feel of the book so well with its locked clasp that i could tell it in the dark if i put my hand on it  but it would be an awful risk father were you detected you would be accused and he hesitated  of trying to rob the bank for a second time mr partridge said well if necessary i must run the risk  at any rate father before you attempt it i must speak to mr fernlea he has been so good a friend throughout the business that we must not move a single step without consulting him i will go up and see him at once before i start i will tell the woman of the house that i have a friend come to stop with me for a day or two she has a spare room and will get it ready for you will you have some supper before i start  no no roland go at once and i will have a nap in your easychair while you are away for i have travelled without stopping once since i got your letter i am not so strong as i used to be  mr fernlea listened attentively to rolands account of his interview with his father  it is a dangerous step to take he said thoughtfully but i dont know that i can propose anything better of course if he is taken i should come forward and declare that he was my client that he has been wrongly accused all through and that he was only going to the bank for the purpose of possessing himself of the book which was his private property in order to obtain the list of the missing securities that he might if possible trace their course i should reserve suspicion about johnstone until the trial but of course there they would have to accuse him of the original theft of the securities i will go back with you now and talk to him myself  my poor friend he said as he entered the room where mr partridge too anxious to sleep was walking restlessly to and fro i see that all this has told upon you sadly however i hope that we are in a fair way of putting matters right at last i tell you frankly i thought at the time that it was foolish of you to run away as you did but i think now that it has turned out the best for we had little or no defence beyond a bare denial whereas we could make out a strong case of suspicion anyhow against johnstone from what we know already  do you approve of my plan for the recovery of the book  yes if it can be carried out but i fear that they are likely to have changed the locks that is the first suggestion which the new cashier on learning that the keys were missing would make  i did not think of that till i was halfway here but i am afraid that it is only too likely  the best plan father roland said will be to give me the keys of the door i can go round tonight and try it if i find it opens it you can carry out your plan tomorrow night if not there is no use your running the risk of being detected  but you might be taken in my place roland  not at all father i am not going to enter the bank i shall simply put the key in the lock and turn it and see if the door opens and i shall take good care that no one is near when i do it if by any possible chance i were caught at iti dont see though how such a thing can happeni should simply say that having come across the key i went for a matter of curiosity to see if it was the one that would open the bank door  yes i dont think there would be much risk in that mr fernlea agreed you had better go at once roland and i will remain with your father until you come back if by any chance you are detected in trying the door it would be far better that it should be at this time of the evening when you might be passing by accidentally and have acted upon the impulse to see if the key fitted than if you were to go down in the middle of the night  in twenty minutes roland returned  a new lock has been put upon the door father the key wont go in at all  mr partridge gave an exclamation of disappointment  dont trouble about that mr fernlea said i dont think that it matters very much you see the list would only be perfect so far as the securities you went through which was only a small proportion of those in the hands of the bank it is essential that we should get the entire list it might happen that he has parted with those which you know to have been stolen while he may have some of the others still in his possession i will think the matter over tonight and see if i can hit upon a plausible excuse for wanting to get the list of the missing securities without being obliged to hint at the purpose for which we require them     chapter vi  conclusion   in the morning mr fernlea said to roland when he appeared at the office the more i think of it the more i am convinced that it would be dangerous to try and get any of the directors to act with us johnstone virtually runs the concern and the others know very little about it and i do not think that i could get any of them to move the best man that i can think of is hertman he is one of our most prominent men of business and is a large shareholder in the bank and is intelligent and independent and if he were convinced that wrong had been done he would take it up hitherto he has of course been under the impression that your father was guilty and expressed himself freely in condemnation of the policy of the directors in allowing him to escape and in hushing matters up he is not a client of mine but i am concerned in business transactions with him and i think he has a respect for my judgment as i have for his i have written a note saying that i want to speak to him on business and shall be glad if he will come over to my office or i will go over to his as will be most convenient to him will you take it across at once his office is in exchange street  mr hertman glanced at the note and told roland to say that he would be across in a few minutes  what i am going to say mr hertman will surprise you mr fernlea said when his visitor had taken a seat you are i am aware one of the largest shareholders in the bank  i am sorry to say that i am mr hertman said i wish i were not but i cant get rid of my shares except at a very heavy loss that mysterious affair three months ago has greatly depressed the value of the stock for in fact no one seems to know what is the amount of the losses we suffered the directors told me that the matter was kept quiet to avoid a run upon the bank and in that respect no doubt they succeeded and public confidence seems pretty well restored i have no idea as to how we have come out of it  well mr hertman it may surprise you when i tell you that in this matter i am acting on behalf of partridge  what the absconding cashier mr fernlea  just so i have always entertained a strong idea that he was innocent and was the victim of others and i am happy to say i am now far on my way to be able to prove it  you dont say so mr hertman said in surprise why i thought there was no doubt in the matter  so most other people thought mr fernlea said dryly and certainly his running away instead of staying to meet the charge was terribly against him but it has not proved so unwise a step as i thought it would had he been arrested and tried then it would have gone hard with him but as matters have turned out things have come to light which alter the complexion of the case you have heard perhaps that i took his son into my office  yes i heard that mr hertman replied i thought that it was a piece of mistaken kindness on your part and that the young fellow would have done better to leave the place and begin life elsewhere  i took him mr hertman in order that he might remain upon the spot to devote himself to getting at the bottom of this mystery and i may tell you at once that he is within a short distance of success  mr fernlea then related the whole of the incidents connected with the search  there can be little doubt that you are right in the matter mr hertman said when he had concluded and that this man johnstone is really the culprit a great wrong has clearly been done and you can command my assistance to the utmost in aiding you what is wantedfunds i will draw you a cheque for any amount that you may require  thank you mr hertman from my knowledge of your character i expected nothing less but that is not my object in taking you into our confidence what we want is the list of the securities stolen  i should doubt mr hertman said whether there is any such list in existence one of the directors who is a personal friend of mine told me at the time of the meeting that the president explained to them what shares and scrip were missing and their value and that the board had individually pledged themselves to keep absolute silence until the meeting of shareholders which will not take place for another six months yet certainly if your suspicions are correct and i think they are it would be greatly to the interest of the president that nobody except himself should have such a list  in that case mr fernlea said the only way of getting at them is to obtain partridges private book there has been no fresh cashier appointed has there  no the chief clerk is acting as cashier at present the appointment has not been filled up  do you possess any influence with him  yes a good deal he got his appointment as clerk there some fifteen years ago from my recommendation he is the son of a man with whom i am closely connected in business matters  then perhaps you might manage it for us what i should propose if you will consent is that some afternoon when we know that johnstone has just left for chicago you should see this man and tell him you have a clue to some of the missing securities but that it is necessary for you to ascertain the exact numbers and that you think you can do so by an examination of the book kept by partridge on which as i understand johnstone scored with red ink some at least of those found to be missing you might say that you only wanted it for two or three hours and that if he would let you have it you would pledge yourself to place it in his hands again the first thing the next morning you could of course say that for the success of the endeavour you are making it is absolutely necessary that no one not even the president and directors should have an idea that anything was being done in the matter  i think i can do that mr hertman said smithson will naturally think that if anything comes of it he will get some credit for aiding us in the matter  very well then mr fernlea said i will let you know next time that mr johnstone goes to chicago he generally takes the trip once a week and tomorrow is his usual day  the next evening the book was handed to mr fernlea  can i be of any further use mr hertman asked  well if you can spare two or three hours i should be glad if you would go through the lists with us partridge is in the next room waiting  certainly i will i tell you i have taken up this business in earnest and am prepared to help you in every way possible  a minute later mr partridge was called in  i am glad to see you mr hertman said and regard you as a deeply wronged man and would spend my bottom dollar if necessary in clearing up this business  the three men at once sat down to their work and turned to the pages where mr johnstone had scored a line of red ink against the securities found to be missing  we will take down the numbers and descriptions of the marked ones first mr fernlea said because as to these there can be no mistake  this was soon done  now mr partridge will you look at these initials closely are they yours  after a long examination mr partridge said they are very like mine  well let us compare them with the real ones mr fernlea said producing a magnifying glass  i see a difference mr hertman said do you see in your own initials you do not take your hand off the paper at all while in these there is a little break the w j are written together but the writer has paused before making the p the manner in which you form the letter p is rather a peculiar one while the w and j are easy enough to imitate and i expect that after having finished the first letters he looked at the copy before commencing the third you see he continued the upstroke from the j to the p is as nearly as possible continuous but with the glass you can make out that sometimes the lines do not quite touch and at others they overlap slightly  the others at once perceived the point that he had indicated and they now went through the whole book and without difficulty marked off the shares against which the false initials had been placed it took them five hours work and it was just midnight when they concluded  we have got the list complete now mr fernlea said  and a very long one it is mr hertman said seven hundred thousand dollars why it is more than the calledup capital of the bank he never told the men who examined the books on the day after the affair was first known what the real extent of the loss was or they would never have signed that announcement reassuring the public however there is a reserve to call up and if things are put into good hands the bank may pull through yet now what is the next step that you propose mr fernlea  i intend myself to go to new york to obtain the assistance of the police and to call upon the broker who has acted for westertonthat is for johnstone i shall tell him frankly we are tracing an extensive robbery and that we have reasons to believe that large numbers of the foreign securities have passed through his hands sent to him from chicago i shall show him this list and ask him if he has dealt in any of them if he says yes we shall then have nothing to do but to go to chicago and obtain a warrant for the arrest of westerton we will not bring johnstone into it then the next time he goes over we will pounce upon him i should like you to give me an authority to ask for you as one of the principal shareholders of the bank  i will go with you myself mr hertman said i shall have to go there on business in a few days anyway and can kill two birds with one stone i suppose you will take mr partridge with you  certainly i shall have to tell the whole story to the commissioner of police and he will want what i say confirmed both as to the theft and the numbers of the missing securities  the mission to new york was attended with complete success the broker when called upon by mr fernlea mr hertman and the chief commissioner himself had no hesitation in disclosing his dealings with westerton it was found that a large proportion of the securities noted had passed through his hands  i have had my own suspicions that something was not quite right with that gentleman lately two months ago he made a very lucky hit in corn up to that time he had been unfortunate and as you see all those securities have been sold by him through me to meet his losses since then he has been buying but what struck me as singular was that he insisted upon getting back the very securities he had parted with he had a special reason he said for wanting these particular shares and no others it gave me a lot of trouble because the buyers had often parted with them and sometimes they had gone through two or three hands and i had to offer something over the market price to get them again however with the exception of sixty thousand dollars worth i have got them all or rather he has got them and i am in treaty for most of those he still wants he said in his letter that it was a crotchet of his and i put it down that he was either a crank or a thief and yet even in the latter case i could not see any reason for his wanting to get into his hands securities which he had once parted with  i can only suppose mr fernlea said that he was afraid that at the meeting of the shareholders they would insist upon a committee being appointed to investigate the whole affair and the list of the missing securities would then be published in which case they would of course be traced back to himat least to westerton  then his name is not westerton  it is not the chief commissioner said but i dont think we will mention just at present what his real name is though you are likely to know it before long now he went on when they had left the brokers office our course is clear enough i will send one of my men with you gentlemen to chicago with instructions to the local police to aid him in the arrest of one westerton on the charge of stealing a large number of valuable securities the property of the brownsville bank and i think i can congratulate you and the other shareholders of the bank on what you have just heard i fancy it likely that in that safe will be found the whole of the missing property with the exception of the small number not yet bought up and even these will probably be recovered for of course the broker has already received money to buy them with  five days later roland partridge looking out from his window at his lodgings in chicago saw six men stop before the house he went quietly downstairs and opened the door and said that is the room  the door opened and the party entered  westerton alias johnstone i arrest you on the charge of stealing securities the property of the brownsville bank  there was an exclamation a slight struggle and then mr johnstone stood handcuffed among his captors the safe stood open mr fernlea and mr hertman stepped forward and glanced at its contents  it is as we expected the former said i cannot say how many are missing but these are the securities stolen from the bank  i have been recovering them mr johnstone said hoarsely i have been purchasing them so as to save the shareholders the loss another week and i should have got them all i received a batch today and there are only fifteen thousand dollars worth missing  that may be true enough mr hertman said but we know that you stole them all in the first placethat you yourself stole them and put the blame on your unfortunate cashier  the excitement in brownsville on the absconding of the cashier of the bank was as nothing to that caused when the local paper came out with the following telegram from its correspondent at chicago  a most important arrest was effected here this evening in the person of a man known as johnstone alias westerton this man has for months occupied a lodging in hale street in this city he only used it one night a week and was supposed by mrs james the landladya person of the highest respectabilityto be a commercial traveller this evening he was arrested by an officer who came down especially from new york aided by our own active and intelligent police authorities on the charge of stealing a great number of valuable securities the property of the brownsville bank which institution was as our readers may remember threatened with a run towards the conclusion of last year by the discovery of a robbery which was at that time supposed to have been effected by mr william partridge the cashier of the bank  the extraordinary part of the business is that the man westerton turns out to be the president of the bank mr james johnstone who has hitherto borne the highest of characters being considered quite the leading citizen of brownsville the whole circumstances are most romantic and i shall be able to telegraph further details for your next edition i am enabled to state that this startling discovery has been brought to light chiefly by the efforts of mr roland partridge son of mr william partridge hitherto suspected of the theft mr partridge has been assisted by those wellknown citizens of brownsville mr fernlea and mr robert hertman these gentlemen are with the two mr partridges at present in chicago and will i understand leave by the first train in the morning for brownsville the prisoner will also be taken over in course of the day in charge of the police and will be charged before the justices of your city with his offence i am informed that the greater portion of the securities stolen have been recovered by the police so that the bank is not likely to be the loser of more than a few thousand dollars by this crime  brownsville could at first scarcely believe the news but enquiries elicited the fact that mr johnstone was absent and that the police had late the previous evening on the receipt of a telegram from chicago gone to his house and placed seals upon the drawers and cabinets the machines of the brownsville gazette were insufficient to cope with the demands for papers of the second edition which gave full details of the affair and were bought up even more eagerly than the first  there was quite a crowd at the station to meet the first train from chicago and a number of gentlemen who had previously known mr partridge pressed forward to shake hands with him and to congratulate him as he alighted from the train with his two friends roland did not accompany him having left the train two stations back to fetch his mother to whom the glad news had been telegraphed on the previous night mr partridge could not himself go as his presence would be necessary at the court there was no feeling of pity for mr johnstone later on he received sentence of five years penal servitudea sentence that would have been heavier had not the court believed his statement that he had intended to return the stolen securities to the bank but the effect of this was in public opinion neutralized by his conduct in throwing the blame on to mr partridge and in allowing him to suffer for his guilt  mr partridge was forced to overcome his objection to public gatherings so far as to receive a banquet and presentation from his fellowtownsmen and was unanimously elected by the shareholders of the brownsville bank president of that institution mr johnstones family left the town immediately after his arrest and percy johnstone is at present a clerk in a store in broadway roland partridge is still in mr fernleas office and will shortly it is said be admitted as a partner in the business about which time it is also rumoured he will enter into another partnership with a young lady who was his staunchest defender in his dark days     a frontier girl  a tale of the backwood settlements   a girl of fifteen slim and lithe in figurealthough it would scarcely have suggested itself to a casual observer so disfigured was it by the thick homespun garment in which she was clothedstood looking out from the door of a log cabin over the lake which lay a hundred yards away her face would have been almost childish had it not been for a certain alertness of expression and keenness of glance which would never have been seen in the face of a townbred girl nor in one brought up in a country where the only danger ever to be encountered was in crossing a meadow in which a bull was grazing mary mitford was the only child of the settler who owned the cabin he had at one time been a welltodo farmer but he had fallen into difficulties and been obliged to give up his farm and travel farther west where land could be had for the taking up  the times had been peaceful and although the spot he had fixed upon was ten miles from the nearest village that did not deter him from settling there it was a natural clearing of some twenty acres in extent the land was fertile and sloped gradually down to the lake a clear spring rose close to the spot where he had determined to make his house and as to indian troubles he shrugged his shoulders and said if the indians break out i shall only have to shut up my cabin and move into the village but as there is no house nearer than that no tracks in the forest leading past my place and nothing worth stealing it is hardly likely that the redskins will come my way they are more likely to attack the village than they are to visit my shanty  he had now lived on his little farm for four years and had had no reason to regret his choice the cabin originally built had been enlarged he had a horse to do his ploughing and some ten acres under tillage a score of halfwild pigs roamed by day in the forest picking up their living there and returning of their own accord to their sties in the evening for their one regular meal five or six cows and a score of sheep grazed on the untilled ground geese and ducks waddled down to the lake at daybreak and returned at nightfall two or three dozen chickens found plenty of grubs and worms to eat between the rows of corn and vegetables on the tilled ground altogether john mitford was doing well he went down once a week with ducks geese fowls and vegetables to the village using a large boat on which he had built a sort of cabin where he often passed the night on the lake returning home to breakfast with a goodly store of wild duck he had shot and sometimes a stag which he had overtaken as it swam across the lake  so well had he done indeed that he had settled to take on three or four hired men to extend the clearing by cutting down and grubbing up the forest he had been ably assisted by his wife who not only looked after the house but assisted on the farm at busy times while mary who was but nine years old when they came there made herself as useful as she could at light work fed the animals cooked when her mother was in the fields and as she grew older spent a good deal of her time in a small birchbark canoe her father had bought for her in the village she added a good deal to the family store by fishing not only was the house well supplied but she enabled her father to take a large basketful down when he went to the village where the people were all too busy to fish for themselves  she also learned to use her fathers rifle with a skill equal to his own and could hit any duck that came within range of the weapon from time to time there were rumours of trouble with the indians but these either proved to be without foundation or the troubles took place at distant spots on the border sometimes marys mother accompanied her father to the village when stores had to be laid in and materials for garments purchased for which their own homespun cloth was unsuitable they had started together this morning and the three men who had been engaged were to return with them these were to be accommodated in an outhouse until they had built a log cabin for themselves and a store of groceries saws and axes blankets and other necessaries for their use were also to be purchased and brought up  they had when the settler had gone down on the previous week heard that councils had been held among the village elders as to the rumoured indian troubles and as to the best method of defending the place should the enemy threaten an attack john mitford had received many warnings but he paid little attention to them and while speaking lightly of them to his wife remarked with a laugh that with the hired men they would have quite a garrison  they will all bring their guns up with them he said and it will scarcely be worth the while of any indians to attack us when they know that we should be able to make a stout fight and that even if they took the place there would be nothing to pay them except our scalps for the loss of life they would suffer the men i hired today are all accustomed to border work and claim to be good shots i can say as much for myself and mary here is a good bit better than i am and you have learned to make very fair practice wife  i have not had time for much of it john but at least i think that i could scarcely miss an indian at fifty yards however as you say we have been hearing these rumours every three or four months since we settled here and nothing has ever come of it  so little did they think of the matter that when they started in the scow an hour before daybreak no allusion was made to it and mary was to have supper ready for them on their return  remember that there will be six mary and you will have to provide plentifully for the men it would never do to give them a bad impression on their arrival we shall be back before nightfall  when they had gone mary went about her usual worklet the pigs out and saw them well on their way towards the forest the ducks started down to the lake and the chickens to the fields while the geese began to graze in the meadow between the house and the lake where the horse and other animals joined them as soon as they were let out having attended to these matters she went about the work of the house from time to time she came to the door to see that all was going on well it was three oclock in the afternoon when she heard a sudden squeal of alarm in the forest and a minute or two later the pigs came galloping out of it accustomed as mary was to all the noises of the place the sudden outcry startled her  what can have frightened the pigs she said to herself it may be that a mountain lion has sprang down upon one of them but it may be that there are indians  she went back at once into the house pulled out the moss from the loopholes that had been made when it was built in case they should ever be attacked and going from one to another gazed into the forest before doing so she had looked to the priming of the three rifles and two shotguns that hung on the walls she could see nothing but observed that there was a general feeling of uneasiness among the animals the horse had stopped feeding and with ears outstretched seemed to be listening for sounds in the forest the cows after staring about commenced to walk in the direction of their byres and some geese which were near the edge of the lake gave warning cries keeping close together and also moved towards the house the girl had heard so many stories of indian raids on lonely settlements that she felt sure that an attack would not be made until after dark they could hardly know that she was alone in the house and would not risk losing lives by an advance against it in broad daylight  as she moved from loophole to loophole she thought over what was best to be done although the indians might wait till nightfall if they saw no advantage in attacking before they would assuredly fall upon her fathers party as they landed as with the advantage of such a surprise they might expect to slaughter them without resistance it was hardly likely that any large party could be in the wood she had heard her father often say that any body of indians on the warpath would make straight for the settlements and would not waste their time upon isolated farms though stragglers from the main body might do so  i must do something at once she said to herself at last if the indians see no one about they may crawl up here and though i might shoot one or two of them i could not be on all sides of the house at once if i were killed father and mother would be sure to fall into the trap from the way those geese behaved i believe it must be a party who were travelling down the lake and knowing of the clearing they landed some little distance away and moved along the shore as canoes often traverse the lake and the indians have an eye for every detail they would know that its occupants possess a scow and that as it was not there some of the inhabitants were certainly away they would therefore probably wait until their return before making an attack on the hut which could be easily captured while were they to attack the cabin at once the firing might be heard and those on the scow being thus warned might go at once to the village where their report would give the alarm to the inhabitants and so put them on their guard against the attack that was to be made upon them by the main body that night  all these things were thought over by the girl she had so often listened to the stories of indian raids told by passing hunters who put up for the night that she was able to judge the situation as accurately as an older settler might have done she was pale but this was the only sign of her consciousness that her life was in extreme danger she knew that if an attack had not been made at once the indians must have good reasons for waiting from time to time indian canoes had stopped there and the occupants had landed in order to exchange skins and other articles for tobacco and powder and so save themselves the journey down to the settlement and they would know that her mother father and herself were the sole occupants the absence of the scow showed that her father was away and that the place could be easily captured though perhaps not without loss of blood for women of the frontier were usually able to use a rifle on an emergency she went out occasionally took some food for the pigs and hung up some clothes to dry in a quiet and unconcerned manner in order to show that no suspicion was entertained that indians were in the neighbourhood  at last she determined upon the best course to be pursued it was above all things necessary to warn her parents that the attempt might cost her her life did not weigh in the slightest she would certainly be killed if she remained there there was just a possibility that she might succeed in saving their lives as well as her own by action once in her canoe she might escape it was very small and light constant exercise had so strengthened her arms that she could make it fly through the water at a speed at which few of the indians with whom she had sometimes tried a spin could surpass the canoe or canoes however in which the redskins had arrived were doubtless paddled by three or more men and these would certainly overtake her it was the knowledge that this was so that had prevented her from making an earlier start to give her a chance of getting away she must carry a rifle with her and once the lurking enemy who were doubtless watching her every movement perceived that she was armed they would guess at once that she was conscious of their presence and would rush out and tomahawk her before she reached the waters edge  at last she decided upon a plan taking off her gown she fastened the rifle with a cord round her body the butt was against her shoulder and the barrel came down just below her ankle projecting but an inch or two below her gown when she put it on again even the sharpest indian eye could scarcely notice this as she walked through the grass she had passed the rope but once round her body and had tied the end in a bow so that she could in a moment unloose it on reaching the canoe for it would be impossible for her to kneel down with the rifle in its present position she took a powderhorn which she slung over her shoulder by a cord and put a dozen bullets into her pocket then she put some grain into a basket and was ready to start before leaving the house she stood for a few minutes in silent prayer for she was unable to kneel then she went out  it needed a great effort to saunter leisurely along but the thought of her parents danger nerved her and she went from animal to animal giving each a handful or two of grain calling them to her and singing in a voice in which at first there was a little quaver but which soon rang out loud and fearlessly fortunately the horse and one or two of the cows were feeding close down by the lake as she went her hopes rose after feeding them she strolled in a leisurely way towards her canoe and standing close to it looked over the water then she went down to its edge and gazed down the lake as if looking for the returning scow after standing thus for a minute or two she returned to the canoe pulled at the ends of the rope under her loose dress and let the muzzle of the rifle drop to the ground she stooped over the canoe as if arranging the paddles and placed the rifle in it the action she thought could hardly have been seen by the indians for the trees were two hundred yards on each side of her she then lifted the light canoe and carried it down to the water  this was the critical moment the indians might allow her to go unmolested thinking that she was only going for a short paddle to pass away the time until her parents returned and in that case they would crawl across and enter the cabin in order to take the party by surprise as they unsuspectingly strolled up from the scow on the other hand if they thought that she had had any idea of their presence and was going to warn her father they would know the coveted scalps would be lost if they did not succeed in catching her as she seated herself in the canoe and took up her paddle her heart beat high with hope but glancing towards the trees she saw six redskins running at full speed from the edge of the forest what she hadnt reckoned upon had occurred their sharp eyes had caught the flash of the sun upon the barrel of the rifle as she put it in and they at once guessed that she was aware of their presence and was endeavouring to escape  it was well that she had lost not a moments time after placing the canoe in the water her nervousness had now passed away and with rapid but steady strokes she drove the light craft ahead and was fifty or sixty yards out on to the lake before the indians reached the spot she had left they had been silent hitherto but their yells rose fiercely as they fired shot after shot but the powder sold to the indians was always of a poor quality and though the balls fell close to her none struck her the redskins did not wait to reload but ran back to the forest and a minute after they had disappeared among the trees she saw a canoe with three paddlers dash out from some bushes in which it had been concealed she had but some three hundred yards start and although she was rowing her hardest looking over her shoulder from time to time she found that they were gaining upon her when a mile had been passed she was but seventy or eighty yards ahead with a sweep of her paddle she turned the canoe broadside to her pursuers laid her paddle in seized her rifle took a steady aim and fired  the report was followed by a yell and the indian in the bow dropped his paddle and fell back at other times at so short a distance she would not have missed her aim at the centre of his chest by a fingers breadth but though she had held her breath in order to steady her rifle her arms were quivering from her exertions and she had only hit him on his right shoulder the red mark on the brown skin showing where he was struck a moment later she was again on her way the fall of the man against the redskin behind him had nearly upset the indian canoe and she had gained several lengths before the pursuit was continued she looked round and saw that the wounded man was again kneeling in his place his paddle had fallen overboard when he was struck and even had it not been so he could have rendered but slight assistance to his comrades with but one hand available  it is lucky that he was not killed she said to herself if he had been they would have thrown him overboard  a minute later she heard a splash the wounded man had leapt into the water and was making for the shore  it is a fair race now she thought their canoe is a large one as it held three sitters besides the rowers now i must take it steadily i am sure they will not gain on me as long as i can keep upit is just a question of last  she rowed however her hardest for a few minutes as it was allimportant to get beyond the range of the indians guns when a glance round showed her that she was some hundred and twenty yards ahead of her pursuers she settled down into a long steady stroke she knew well that she was now practically safe for even if one of their guns could carry to her it was difficult even for the best shot to aim from a dancing canoe for half an hour there was no change in the position the indians were rowing their hardest but the weight of their comparatively heavy canoe was telling upon them as much as the labour of driving her light craft was upon the girl it was well for her that an outofdoor life and daily practice had hardened her muscles and strengthened her frame she had once paused for a couple of seconds and pulled off her frock which at once cumbered her movements and was terribly hot the speed of the canoe had scarcely slackened when the paddle was at work again and she felt a sensible relief from the freedom of her limbs  a few minutes later a little cry of joy broke from her as she saw the scow come out from behind a point some two miles away the sight gave her renewed hope and strength they must have left the village earlier than she had expected on the other hand a yell from the redskins told her that they too had seen the scow and would certainly exert themselves to the utmost to overtake her before she reached it although it had seemed that the paddlers were all doing their best before the added speed of the canoes told that their exertions had been redoubled when within a mile of the scow the girl glanced backwards the indians had gained some thirty yards upon her but another five minutes would bring her within rifleshot of the scow she could see by the motion of the oars that the rowers were doing their utmost while the others were standing up watching the chase with their rifles in their hands  her strength was failing her fast now but she struggled on determinedly at least she had saved her father and mother two minutes later she started at the report of a gun behind and the splash of a ball in the water alongside the canoe she felt that she was safe now the redskins would not have stopped to fire had they not felt that it was their last chance of revenge a few more strokes and she looked round the indians were already on their way towards the shore then she let her paddle drop and collapsed in the bottom of the canoe hearing but faintly the sound of repeated shots from the scow which was now but a little more than a quarter of a mile away hitherto they had been unable to fire as the two canoes were in a line faintly she heard a shout in her fathers voice are you hit mary but she was incapable of making an effort to reply and it was not until the scow came alongside and she was lifted on board that she was able to answer the relief of her father and mother was intense when they found that she was unwounded they had heard the indians fire and at the distance they were away it had seemed to them that the canoes were close to each other they then saw the redskins at once make for shore and she had so quickly afterwards sunk into the canoe that they greatly feared she was wounded the men with them however were unanimous in agreeing that she had not been hit if she had been they argued her pursuers would certainly have paddled up to the canoe and taken her scalp before making for the shore it was some time before she was able to tell her story and the frontiersmen were as warm in their expressions of admiration for her coolness as were her parents  a consultation was now held as to the best plan to be pursued it was finally agreed that one of the men should take the canoe and return to the village which was but four miles away and warn them to prepare for an attack that night the stockades had already been strengthened and if prepared it was probable that the settlers would be able to beat off any attack the scow was then put in motion again it was felt that the three indians on shore would have done nothing until they learned from the men in the canoe that the pursuit had failed and that the settlers had been warned they would probably have followed along the shore to see the result and might either return burn the cabin and slaughter the cattle or might go on and join the indians who were doubtless gathered close to the village the frontiersmen were of opinion that they would take the latter course  the redskins are fond of revenge one of the men said but they are fonder of scalps they will not expect to get much plunder from your house and will certainly get no scalps and though they might do a lot of mischief on your clearing this would offer less satisfaction to them than getting their share of the plunder and scalps from the village  besides another put in they would certainly get into bad odour with their tribe if they were absent from the attack i take it for certain that they had orders to go straight there and that it was only the hope that they would bring in some scalps that induced them to land at your clearing i think that it is plumb sure that they will go straight on  rowing vigorously they reached the farm an hour before sunset to their great satisfaction they saw the animals grazing as usual the cabin intact and no signs of an enemys presence nevertheless the frontiersmen advised mr mitford to proceed cautiously for it was just possible the indians were hidden in the house accordingly he told his wife and daughter to remain in the scow which when the men landed was pushed off into deep water and the grapnel dropped the men moved up through the trees until abreast of the house  i am convinced that they are not there the settler said the animals are all feeding quietly and the geese are just in front of the door i am sure that if redskins were inside the horse and cattle would all be gathered by the water and the geese which are as watchful as dogs would not be near the house  the others agreed and stooping low made their way through the standing grain until within some thirty yards of the house then with rifles advanced ready to fire they dashed forward still all was quiet  they are not here one of the men said positively they certainly would have fired and not let us get up against the wall we have only to walk in  they went round to the door and entered all was exactly as mary had left it the fire had burnt low but the pot was still simmering over it the farmer went down to the water and fetched up his wife and mary  if it hadnt been for you mary he said everything would have been destroyed here and we should be lying dead on the shore  the question was next discussed what they had best do the frontiersmen were unanimous in their opinion that there was no fear of an attack that night but were equally certain that one would be made the next night or at the latest on that following  no matter whether they take the village or not they are sure to attack you if they have won the varmint you have baulked today will bring a party of their friends here for plunder and scalps if they are beaten off they will before they return home ravage every outlying farm to make matters sure i should say it would be safest for your wife and daughter to sleep on board the scow we can bring her in close to the shore and camp down there ourselves so that if needs be we can get on board and put out into the lake they have only one canoe as far as we know but if they had a dozen they would not dare to attack us i do not think that there is a chance of any trouble tonight in the morning i should say your best plan would be to get the things you most value on board the scow with enough meat and provisions to last for a week you must stay with the ladies on board and we will drive all the animals a couple of miles into the forest the worst that can happen then is that when the indians come they will burn down the house i dont see that we can prevent that if we were to lay off here in the scow we could keep them from approaching within range of our rifles but we could not prevent them from coming down from behind the house  it does not matter about the cabin the settler said that is easily put up again and indeed i had intended before long to pull it down and rebuild it in better style and put it close down by the water  that would be a good plan boss if you were to put it there and make a strong palisade running from it on each side down to the water you could fight it out against a big lot of redskins and if the worst came to the worst could make off in your scow i would put a bag or two of grain in the boat if i were you now when you start in the morning row along the shore to the east till you see us come out we will bunch the animals close by there and if we give them a feed every evening they are safe not to wander very far it is not likely the redskins will trouble to hunt for them they will burn your house and then make off you might leave half a dozen of your sheep here if they come the indians can make a meal and they wont be wanting to search the woods for one and are safe to make off without delay when they have once got a beating they dont care to hang about and if they have succeeded at the village and got scalps and booty some of them will at once start for home to have a dance after their victory and the others will be off to strike a blow at some other village before the news of what has occurred reaches the settlers  and so the matter was carried out the night passed quietly but in the morning the frontiersmen putting their ears down to the surface of the lake could make out heavy firing in the distance and knew that the attack on the village had begun the work was then set about the whole of the feathered stock were tied by their legs and placed in the scow the store of provisions groceries the linen and clothes were all placed on board and then the settler with his wife and daughter pushed off while the three men drove the animals into the forest three hours later those on the scow saw them appear at the edge of the lake nearly three miles from the clearing and the scow was at once rowed ashore the animals had been driven to a small clearing a quarter of a mile away and on the party going up they were found to be still there mary went round petting them and giving them handfuls of grain and after remaining there for half an hour they returned to the lake the scow was hidden under some branches overhanging the water in the afternoon a small canoe with a solitary paddler was seen coming along keeping close inshore as it approached mary recognized her canoe and the men declared that the rower was their comrade who had gone to give the alarm to the village  what news reuben they shouted as soon as he was within hearing  bad news he said the village is taken and every soul but myself murdered they made a good fight but the redskins were too strong i got hit in the leg pretty early in the fight and finding that i was no more use i got two women to carry me down to the canoe i knew that i should be as comfortable there as anywhere and if things went wrong it gave me a chance two hours later i heard by the screaming that the redskins had forced the palisades and were in the village so i thought that it was time for me to be off i was able to sit up though i was badly hit below the knee and i paddled off and made for the clearing when i got there i saw at once that all the animals were gone and made sure that they had been driven into the forest and that you had taken to the scow i did not suppose that you had gone very far so i came on looking for you and glad enough i was to hear your shout  you fear that all in the village have been murdered mr mitford said  i have not a doubt of it those red fiends spare no one especially as there was a stout resistance and a good many of them have been wiped out  he was now helped out of the canoe his comrades all of whom had much experience of wounds examined his leg carefully and were of opinion that although the bone was splintered it was not broken and that the ball had gone out behind  the best thing to do one of them said will be to make a deep cut and pick out all the pieces of bone it will never heal properly with them in  fire away then the wounded man said coolly it is best to make a good job of it at once now i know that the bone is not really broken i dont mind what you do with it  do you happen to have a new knife mr mitford one of the other frontiersmen said turning to the settler one wants a new knife and a sharp one  i cannot give you a new one but it was only yesterday that i ground my own knife and it is both sharp and clean  that will do first rate  and taking the long knife the settler wore in a sheath hanging from his belt he proceeded to operate not a groan or a sigh proceeded from the wounded man accustomed to a hard life as these men were they were almost as insensible to pain as the indians themselves after the splinters of bone had been removed the wound was washed with warm water and then carefully bandaged a fire had by this time been lit a short distance in the forest in a position where its light could not be observed by any passing canoe here the men bivouacked taking it by turns to keep watch for four days they remained here then one of them started as soon as it was dark in marys canoe to examine the clearing he returned in little over an hour the cabin and outbuildings had all been burnt and the place was absolutely deserted it was agreed that there was not the slightest chance of the indians returning there and the settler and three of the men at once began to fell trees while the fourth who could not assist in active work for some time went down in the canoe to the village which he found had been entirely destroyed but that a body of the state militia had arrived there from them he learned that another village had been destroyed but in an attack on a third the indians had been repulsed with great loss and had not since been heard of and it was believed that they had retired to their own villages  three months later a loghouse had been erected by the waterside with palisades running down into deep water it was large and comfortable and being built of square logs and well loopholed and with the doors and windows on the waterside only it could resist a formidable attack a very strong gate in one of the palisades would admit of the animals being driven in there for shelter all those which had been taken into the forest had been recovered the house done the men set to work to enlarge the clearing and ten years later it was one of the largest and bestcultivated farms on the lake mary whose exploit had gained for her a wide reputation throughout the district for her courage and coolness had long before married a young englishman who had come out with some capital with the intention of farming mary would not hear of leaving her father and mother and accordingly he entered into partnership with mr mitford and his energy and capital had no small share in developing the farm a second loghouse was built within some twenty yards of the other and connected with it by a strong palisade however the settlers were never again disturbed by the indians and so many newcomers had settled beyond them that it could no longer be called an outlying settlement especially as a town of considerable size had sprung into existence on the site of the village that had been destroyed
