18486285	major barbara  bernard shaw     act i  it is after dinner on a january night in the library in lady britomart undershafts house in wilton crescent a large and comfortable settee is in the middle of the room upholstered in dark leather a person sitting on it it is vacant at present would have on his right lady britomarts writing table with the lady herself busy at it a smaller writing table behind him on his left the door behind him on lady britomarts side and a window with a window seat directly on his left near the window is an armchair  lady britomart is a woman of fifty or thereabouts well dressed and yet careless of her dress well bred and quite reckless of her breeding well mannered and yet appallingly outspoken and indifferent to the opinion of her interlocutory amiable and yet peremptory arbitrary and hightempered to the last bearable degree and withal a very typical managing matron of the upper class treated as a naughty child until she grew into a scolding mother and finally settling down with plenty of practical ability and worldly experience limited in the oddest way with domestic and class limitations conceiving the universe exactly as if it were a large house in wilton crescent though handling her corner of it very effectively on that assumption and being quite enlightened and liberal as to the books in the library the pictures on the walls the music in the portfolios and the articles in the papers  her son stephen comes in he is a gravely correct young man under 25 taking himself very seriously but still in some awe of his mother from childish habit and bachelor shyness rather than from any weakness of character  stephen whats the matter  lady britomart presently stephen  stephen submissively walks to the settee and sits down he takes up the speaker  lady britomart dont begin to read stephen i shall require all your attention  stephen it was only while i was waiting  lady britomart dont make excuses stephen he puts down the speaker now she finishes her writing rises and comes to the settee i have not kept you waiting very long i think  stephen not at all mother  lady britomart bring me my cushion he takes the cushion from the chair at the desk and arranges it for her as she sits down on the settee sit down he sits down and fingers his tie nervously dont fiddle with your tie stephen there is nothing the matter with it  stephen i beg your pardon he fiddles with his watch chain instead  lady britomart now are you attending to me stephen  stephen of course mother  lady britomart no its not of course i want something much more than your everyday matterofcourse attention i am going to speak to you very seriously stephen i wish you would let that chain alone  stephen hastily relinquishing the chain have i done anything to annoy you mother if so it was quite unintentional  lady britomart astonished nonsense with some remorse my poor boy did you think i was angry with you  stephen what is it then mother you are making me very uneasy  lady britomart squaring herself at him rather aggressively stephen may i ask how soon you intend to realize that you are a grownup man and that i am only a woman  stephen amazed only a  lady britomart dont repeat my words please it is a most aggravating habit you must learn to face life seriously stephen i really cannot bear the whole burden of our family affairs any longer you must advise me you must assume the responsibility  stephen i  lady britomart yes you of course you were 24 last june youve been at harrow and cambridge youve been to india and japan you must know a lot of things now unless you have wasted your time most scandalously well advise me  stephen much perplexed you know i have never interfered in the household  lady britomart no i should think not i dont want you to order the dinner  stephen i mean in our family affairs  lady britomart well you must interfere now for they are getting quite beyond me  stephen troubled i have thought sometimes that perhaps i ought but really mother i know so little about them and what i do know is so painfulit is so impossible to mention some things to youhe stops ashamed  lady britomart i suppose you mean your father  stephen almost inaudibly yes  lady britomart my dear we cant go on all our lives not mentioning him of course you were quite right not to open the subject until i asked you to but you are old enough now to be taken into my confidence and to help me to deal with him about the girls  stephen but the girls are all right they are engaged  lady britomart complacently yes i have made a very good match for sarah charles lomax will be a millionaire at 35 but that is ten years ahead and in the meantime his trustees cannot under the terms of his fathers will allow him more than 800 pounds a year  stephen but the will says also that if he increases his income by his own exertions they may double the increase  lady britomart charles lomaxs exertions are much more likely to decrease his income than to increase it sarah will have to find at least another 800 pounds a year for the next ten years and even then they will be as poor as church mice and what about barbara i thought barbara was going to make the most brilliant career of all of you and what does she do joins the salvation army discharges her maid lives on a pound a week and walks in one evening with a professor of greek whom she has picked up in the street and who pretends to be a salvationist and actually plays the big drum for her in public because he has fallen head over ears in love with her  stephen i was certainly rather taken aback when i heard they were engaged cusins is a very nice fellow certainly nobody would ever guess that he was born in australia but  lady britomart oh adolphus cusins will make a very good husband after all nobody can say a word against greek it stamps a man at once as an educated gentleman and my family thank heaven is not a pigheaded tory one we are whigs and believe in liberty let snobbish people say what they please barbara shall marry not the man they like but the man i like  stephen of course i was thinking only of his income however he is not likely to be extravagant  lady britomart dont be too sure of that stephen i know your quiet simple refined poetic people like adolphusquite content with the best of everything they cost more than your extravagant people who are always as mean as they are second rate no barbara will need at least 2000 pounds a year you see it means two additional households besides my dear you must marry soon i dont approve of the present fashion of philandering bachelors and late marriages and i am trying to arrange something for you  stephen its very good of you mother but perhaps i had better arrange that for myself  lady britomart nonsense you are much too young to begin matchmaking you would be taken in by some pretty little nobody of course i dont mean that you are not to be consulted you know that as well as i do stephen closes his lips and is silent now dont sulk stephen  stephen i am not sulking mother what has all this got to do withwithwith my father  lady britomart my dear stephen where is the money to come from it is easy enough for you and the other children to live on my income as long as we are in the same house but i cant keep four families in four separate houses you know how poor my father is he has barely seven thousand a year now and really if he were not the earl of stevenage he would have to give up society he can do nothing for us he says naturally enough that it is absurd that he should be asked to provide for the children of a man who is rolling in money you see stephen your father must be fabulously wealthy because there is always a war going on somewhere  stephen you need not remind me of that mother i have hardly ever opened a newspaper in my life without seeing our name in it the undershaft torpedo the undershaft quick firers the undershaft ten inch the undershaft disappearing rampart gun the undershaft submarine and now the undershaft aerial battleship at harrow they called me the woolwich infant at cambridge it was the same a little brute at kings who was always trying to get up revivals spoilt my bibleyour first birthday present to meby writing under my name son and heir to undershaft and lazarus death and destruction dealers address christendom and judea but that was not so bad as the way i was kowtowed to everywhere because my father was making millions by selling cannons  lady britomart it is not only the cannons but the war loans that lazarus arranges under cover of giving credit for the cannons you know stephen its perfectly scandalous those two men andrew undershaft and lazarus positively have europe under their thumbs that is why your father is able to behave as he does he is above the law do you think bismarck or gladstone or disraeli could have openly defied every social and moral obligation all their lives as your father has they simply wouldnt have dared i asked gladstone to take it up i asked the times to take it up i asked the lord chamberlain to take it up but it was just like asking them to declare war on the sultan they wouldnt they said they couldnt touch him i believe they were afraid  stephen what could they do he does not actually break the law  lady britomart not break the law he is always breaking the law he broke the law when he was born his parents were not married  stephen mother is that true  lady britomart of course its true that was why we separated  stephen he married without letting you know this  lady britomart rather taken aback by this inference oh no to do andrew justice that was not the sort of thing he did besides you know the undershaft motto unashamed everybody knew  stephen but you said that was why you separated  lady britomart yes because he was not content with being a foundling himself he wanted to disinherit you for another foundling that was what i couldnt stand  stephen ashamed do you mean forforfor  lady britomart dont stammer stephen speak distinctly  stephen but this is so frightful to me mother to have to speak to you about such things  lady britomart its not pleasant for me either especially if you are still so childish that you must make it worse by a display of embarrassment it is only in the middle classes stephen that people get into a state of dumb helpless horror when they find that there are wicked people in the world in our class we have to decide what is to be done with wicked people and nothing should disturb our self possession now ask your question properly  stephen mother you have no consideration for me for heavens sake either treat me as a child as you always do and tell me nothing at all or tell me everything and let me take it as best i can  lady britomart treat you as a child what do you mean it is most unkind and ungrateful of you to say such a thing you know i have never treated any of you as children i have always made you my companions and friends and allowed you perfect freedom to do and say whatever you liked so long as you liked what i could approve of  stephen desperately i daresay we have been the very imperfect children of a very perfect mother but i do beg you to let me alone for once and tell me about this horrible business of my father wanting to set me aside for another son  lady britomart amazed another son i never said anything of the kind i never dreamt of such a thing this is what comes of interrupting me  stephen but you said  lady britomart cutting him short now be a good boy stephen and listen to me patiently the undershafts are descended from a foundling in the parish of st andrew undershaft in the city that was long ago in the reign of james the first well this foundling was adopted by an armorer and gunmaker in the course of time the foundling succeeded to the business and from some notion of gratitude or some vow or something he adopted another foundling and left the business to him and that foundling did the same ever since that the cannon business has always been left to an adopted foundling named andrew undershaft  stephen but did they never marry were there no legitimate sons  lady britomart oh yes they married just as your father did and they were rich enough to buy land for their own children and leave them well provided for but they always adopted and trained some foundling to succeed them in the business and of course they always quarrelled with their wives furiously over it your father was adopted in that way and he pretends to consider himself bound to keep up the tradition and adopt somebody to leave the business to of course i was not going to stand that there may have been some reason for it when the undershafts could only marry women in their own class whose sons were not fit to govern great estates but there could be no excuse for passing over my son  stephen dubiously i am afraid i should make a poor hand of managing a cannon foundry  lady britomart nonsense you could easily get a manager and pay him a salary  stephen my father evidently had no great opinion of my capacity  lady britomart stuff child you were only a baby it had nothing to do with your capacity andrew did it on principle just as he did every perverse and wicked thing on principle when my father remonstrated andrew actually told him to his face that history tells us of only two successful institutions one the undershaft firm and the other the roman empire under the antonines that was because the antonine emperors all adopted their successors such rubbish the stevenages are as good as the antonines i hope and you are a stevenage but that was andrew all over there you have the man always clever and unanswerable when he was defending nonsense and wickedness always awkward and sullen when he had to behave sensibly and decently  stephen then it was on my account that your home life was broken up mother i am sorry  lady britomart well dear there were other differences i really cannot bear an immoral man i am not a pharisee i hope and i should not have minded his merely doing wrong things we are none of us perfect but your father didnt exactly do wrong things he said them and thought them that was what was so dreadful he really had a sort of religion of wrongness just as one doesnt mind men practising immorality so long as they own that they are in the wrong by preaching morality so i couldnt forgive andrew for preaching immorality while he practised morality you would all have grown up without principles without any knowledge of right and wrong if he had been in the house you know my dear your father was a very attractive man in some ways children did not dislike him and he took advantage of it to put the wickedest ideas into their heads and make them quite unmanageable i did not dislike him myself very far from it but nothing can bridge over moral disagreement  stephen all this simply bewilders me mother people may differ about matters of opinion or even about religion but how can they differ about right and wrong right is right and wrong is wrong and if a man cannot distinguish them properly he is either a fool or a rascal thats all  lady britomart touched thats my own boy she pats his cheek your father never could answer that he used to laugh and get out of it under cover of some affectionate nonsense and now that you understand the situation what do you advise me to do  stephen well what can you do  lady britomart i must get the money somehow  stephen we cannot take money from him i had rather go and live in some cheap place like bedford square or even hampstead than take a farthing of his money  lady britomart but after all stephen our present income comes from andrew  stephen shocked i never knew that  lady britomart well you surely didnt suppose your grandfather had anything to give me the stevenages could not do everything for you we gave you social position andrew had to contribute something he had a very good bargain i think  stephen bitterly we are utterly dependent on him and his cannons then  lady britomart certainly not the money is settled but he provided it so you see it is not a question of taking money from him or not it is simply a question of how much i dont want any more for myself  stephen nor do i  lady britomart but sarah does and barbara does that is charles lomax and adolphus cusins will cost them more so i must put my pride in my pocket and ask for it i suppose that is your advice stephen is it not  stephen no  lady britomart sharply stephen  stephen of course if you are determined  lady britomart i am not determined i ask your advice and i am waiting for it i will not have all the responsibility thrown on my shoulders  stephen obstinately i would die sooner than ask him for another penny  lady britomart resignedly you mean that i must ask him very well stephen it shall be as you wish you will be glad to know that your grandfather concurs but he thinks i ought to ask andrew to come here and see the girls after all he must have some natural affection for them  stephen ask him here  lady britomart do not repeat my words stephen where else can i ask him  stephen i never expected you to ask him at all  lady britomart now dont tease stephen come you see that it is necessary that he should pay us a visit dont you  stephen reluctantly i suppose so if the girls cannot do without his money  lady britomart thank you stephen i knew you would give me the right advice when it was properly explained to you i have asked your father to come this evening stephen bounds from his seat dont jump stephen it fidgets me  stephen in utter consternation do you mean to say that my father is coming here tonightthat he may be here at any moment  lady britomart looking at her watch i said nine he gasps she rises ring the bell please stephen goes to the smaller writing table presses a button on it and sits at it with his elbows on the table and his head in his hands outwitted and overwhelmed it is ten minutes to nine yet and i have to prepare the girls i asked charles lomax and adolphus to dinner on purpose that they might be here andrew had better see them in case he should cherish any delusions as to their being capable of supporting their wives the butler enters lady britomart goes behind the settee to speak to him morrison go up to the drawingroom and tell everybody to come down here at once morrison withdraws lady britomart turns to stephen now remember stephen i shall need all your countenance and authority he rises and tries to recover some vestige of these attributes give me a chair dear he pushes a chair forward from the wall to where she stands near the smaller writing table she sits down and he goes to the armchair into which he throws himself i dont know how barbara will take it ever since they made her a major in the salvation army she has developed a propensity to have her own way and order people about which quite cows me sometimes its not ladylike im sure i dont know where she picked it up anyhow barbara shant bully me but still its just as well that your father should be here before she has time to refuse to meet him or make a fuss dont look nervous stephen it will only encourage barbara to make difficulties i am nervous enough goodness knows but i dont show it  sarah and barbara come in with their respective young men charles lomax and adolphus cusins sarah is slender bored and mundane barbara is robuster jollier much more energetic sarah is fashionably dressed barbara is in salvation army uniform lomax a young man about town is like many other young men about town he is affected with a frivolous sense of humor which plunges him at the most inopportune moments into paroxysms of imperfectly suppressed laughter cusins is a spectacled student slight thin haired and sweet voiced with a more complex form of lomaxs complaint his sense of humor is intellectual and subtle and is complicated by an appalling temper the lifelong struggle of a benevolent temperament and a high conscience against impulses of inhuman ridicule and fierce impatience has set up a chronic strain which has visibly wrecked his constitution he is a most implacable determined tenacious intolerant person who by mere force of character presents himself asand indeed actually isconsiderate gentle explanatory even mild and apologetic capable possibly of murder but not of cruelty or coarseness by the operation of some instinct which is not merciful enough to blind him with the illusions of love he is obstinately bent on marrying barbara lomax likes sarah and thinks it will be rather a lark to marry her consequently he has not attempted to resist lady britomarts arrangements to that end  all four look as if they had been having a good deal of fun in the drawingroom the girls enter first leaving the swains outside sarah comes to the settee barbara comes in after her and stops at the door  barbara are cholly and dolly to come in  lady britomart forcibly barbara i will not have charles called cholly the vulgarity of it positively makes me ill  barbara its all right mother cholly is quite correct nowadays are they to come in  lady britomart yes if they will behave themselves  barbara through the door come in dolly and behave yourself  barbara comes to her mothers writing table cusins enters smiling and wanders towards lady britomart  sarah calling come in cholly lomax enters controlling his features very imperfectly and places himself vaguely between sarah and barbara  lady britomart peremptorily sit down all of you they sit cusins crosses to the window and seats himself there lomax takes a chair barbara sits at the writing table and sarah on the settee i dont in the least know what you are laughing at adolphus i am surprised at you though i expected nothing better from charles lomax  cusins in a remarkably gentle voice barbara has been trying to teach me the west ham salvation march  lady britomart i see nothing to laugh at in that nor should you if you are really converted  cusins sweetly you were not present it was really funny i believe  lomax ripping  lady britomart be quiet charles now listen to me children your father is coming here this evening general stupefaction  lomax remonstrating oh i say  lady britomart you are not called on to say anything charles  sarah are you serious mother  lady britomart of course i am serious it is on your account sarah and also on charless silence charles looks painfully unworthy i hope you are not going to object barbara  barbara i why should i my father has a soul to be saved like anybody else hes quite welcome as far as i am concerned  lomax still remonstrant but really dont you know oh i say  lady britomart frigidly what do you wish to convey charles  lomax well you must admit that this is a bit thick  lady britomart turning with ominous suavity to cusins adolphus you are a professor of greek can you translate charles lomaxs remarks into reputable english for us  cusins cautiously if i may say so lady brit i think charles has rather happily expressed what we all feel homer speaking of autolycus uses the same phrase  lomax handsomely not that i mind you know if sarah dont  lady britomart crushingly thank you have i your permission adolphus to invite my own husband to my own house  cusins gallantly you have my unhesitating support in everything you do  lady britomart sarah have you nothing to say  sarah do you mean that he is coming regularly to live here  lady britomart certainly not the spare room is ready for him if he likes to stay for a day or two and see a little more of you but there are limits  sarah well he cant eat us i suppose i dont mind  lomax chuckling i wonder how the old man will take it  lady britomart much as the old woman will no doubt charles  lomax abashed i didnt meanat least  lady britomart you didnt think charles you never do and the result is you never mean anything and now please attend to me children your father will be quite a stranger to us  lomax i suppose he hasnt seen sarah since she was a little kid  lady britomart not since she was a little kid charles as you express it with that elegance of diction and refinement of thought that seem never to desert you accordinglyer impatiently now i have forgotten what i was going to say that comes of your provoking me to be sarcastic charles adolphus will you kindly tell me where i was  cusins sweetly you were saying that as mr undershaft has not seen his children since they were babies he will form his opinion of the way you have brought them up from their behavior tonight and that therefore you wish us all to be particularly careful to conduct ourselves well especially charles  lomax look here lady brit didnt say that  lady britomart vehemently i did charles adolphuss recollection is perfectly correct it is most important that you should be good and i do beg you for once not to pair off into opposite corners and giggle and whisper while i am speaking to your father  barbara all right mother well do you credit  lady britomart remember charles that sarah will want to feel proud of you instead of ashamed of you  lomax oh i say theres nothing to be exactly proud of dont you know  lady britomart well try and look as if there was  morrison pale and dismayed breaks into the room in unconcealed disorder  morrison might i speak a word to you my lady  lady britomart nonsense show him up  morrison yes my lady he goes  lomax does morrison know who he is  lady britomart of course morrison has always been with us  lomax it must be a regular corker for him dont you know  lady britomart is this a moment to get on my nerves charles with your outrageous expressions  lomax but this is something out of the ordinary really  morrison at the door theermr undershaft he retreats in confusion  andrew undershaft comes in all rise lady britomart meets him in the middle of the room behind the settee  andrew is on the surface a stoutish easygoing elderly man with kindly patient manners and an engaging simplicity of character but he has a watchful deliberate waiting listening face and formidable reserves of power both bodily and mental in his capacious chest and long head his gentleness is partly that of a strong man who has learnt by experience that his natural grip hurts ordinary people unless he handles them very carefully and partly the mellowness of age and success he is also a little shy in his present very delicate situation  lady britomart good evening andrew  undershaft how dye do my dear  lady britomart you look a good deal older  undershaft apologetically i am somewhat older with a touch of courtship time has stood still with you  lady britomart promptly rubbish this is your family  undershaft surprised is it so large i am sorry to say my memory is failing very badly in some things he offers his hand with paternal kindness to lomax  lomax jerkily shaking his hand ahdedoo  undershaft i can see you are my eldest i am very glad to meet you again my boy  lomax remonstrating no but look here dont you knowovercome oh i say  lady britomart recovering from momentary speechlessness andrew do you mean to say that you dont remember how many children you have  undershaft well i am afraid i they have grown so mucher am i making any ridiculous mistake i may as well confess i recollect only one son but so many things have happened since of courseer  lady britomart decisively andrew you are talking nonsense of course you have only one son  undershaft perhaps you will be good enough to introduce me my dear  lady britomart that is charles lomax who is engaged to sarah  undershaft my dear sir i beg your pardon  lomax not at all delighted i assure you  lady britomart this is stephen  undershaft bowing happy to make your acquaintance mr stephen then going to cusins you must be my son taking cusins hands in his how are you my young friend to lady britomart he is very like you my love  cusins you flatter me mr undershaft my name is cusins engaged to barbara very explicitly that is major barbara undershaft of the salvation army that is sarah your second daughter this is stephen undershaft your son  undershaft my dear stephen i beg your pardon  stephen not at all  undershaft mr cusins i am much indebted to you for explaining so precisely turning to sarah barbara my dear  sarah prompting him sarah  undershaft sarah of course they shake hands he goes over to barbara barbarai am right this time i hope  barbara quite right they shake hands  lady britomart resuming command sit down all of you sit down andrew she comes forward and sits on the settle cusins also brings his chair forward on her left barbara and stephen resume their seats lomax gives his chair to sarah and goes for another  undershaft thank you my love  lomax conversationally as he brings a chair forward between the writing table and the settee and offers it to undershaft takes you some time to find out exactly where you are dont it  undershaft accepting the chair that is not what embarrasses me mr lomax my difficulty is that if i play the part of a father i shall produce the effect of an intrusive stranger and if i play the part of a discreet stranger i may appear a callous father  lady britomart there is no need for you to play any part at all andrew you had much better be sincere and natural  undershaft submissively yes my dear i daresay that will be best making himself comfortable well here i am now what can i do for you all  lady britomart you need not do anything andrew you are one of the family you can sit with us and enjoy yourself  lomaxs too long suppressed mirth explodes in agonized neighings  lady britomart outraged charles lomax if you can behave yourself behave yourself if not leave the room  lomax im awfully sorry lady brit but really you know upon my soul he sits on the settee between lady britomart and undershaft quite overcome  barbara why dont you laugh if you want to cholly its good for your inside  lady britomart barbara you have had the education of a lady please let your father see that and dont talk like a street girl  undershaft never mind me my dear as you know i am not a gentleman and i was never educated  lomax encouragingly nobodyd know it i assure you you look all right you know  cusins let me advise you to study greek mr undershaft greek scholars are privileged men few of them know greek and none of them know anything else but their position is unchallengeable other languages are the qualifications of waiters and commercial travellers greek is to a man of position what the hallmark is to silver  barbara dolly dont be insincere cholly fetch your concertina and play something for us  lomax doubtfully to undershaft perhaps that sort of thing isnt in your line eh  undershaft i am particularly fond of music  lomax delighted are you then ill get it he   goes upstairs for the instrument  undershaft do you play barbara  barbara only the tambourine but chollys teaching me the concertina  undershaft is cholly also a member of the salvation army  barbara no he says its bad form to be a dissenter but i dont despair of cholly i made him come yesterday to a meeting at the dock gates and take the collection in his hat  lady britomart it is not my doing andrew barbara is old enough to take her own way she has no father to advise her  barbara oh yes she has there are no orphans in the salvation army  undershaft your father there has a great many children and plenty of experience eh  barbara looking at him with quick interest and nodding just so how did you come to understand that lomax is heard at the door trying the concertina  lady britomart come in charles play us something at once  lomax righto he sits down in his former place and preludes  undershaft one moment mr lomax i am rather interested in the salvation army its motto might be my own blood and fire  lomax shocked but not your sort of blood and fire you know  undershaft my sort of blood cleanses my sort of fire purifies  barbara so do ours come down tomorrow to my shelterthe west ham shelterand see what were doing were going to march to a great meeting in the assembly hall at mile end come and see the shelter and then march with us it will do you a lot of good can you play anything  undershaft in my youth i earned pennies and even shillings occasionally in the streets and in public house parlors by my natural talent for stepdancing later on i became a member of the undershaft orchestral society and performed passably on the tenor trombone  lomax scandalized oh i say  barbara many a sinner has played himself into heaven on the trombone thanks to the army  lomax to barbara still rather shocked yes but what about the cannon business dont you know to undershaft getting into heaven is not exactly in your line is it  lady britomart charles  lomax well but it stands to reason dont it the cannon business may be necessary and all that we cant get on without cannons but it isnt right you know on the other hand there may be a certain amount of tosh about the salvation armyi belong to the established church myselfbut still you cant deny that its religion and you cant go against religion can you at least unless youre downright immoral dont you know  undershaft you hardly appreciate my position mr lomax  lomax hastily im not saying anything against you personally you know  undershaft quite so quite so but consider for a moment here i am a manufacturer of mutilation and murder i find myself in a specially amiable humor just now because this morning down at the foundry we blew twentyseven dummy soldiers into fragments with a gun which formerly destroyed only thirteen  lomax leniently well the more destructive war becomes the sooner it will be abolished eh  undershaft not at all the more destructive war becomes the more fascinating we find it no mr lomax i am obliged to you for making the usual excuse for my trade but i am not ashamed of it i am not one of those men who keep their morals and their business in watertight compartments all the spare money my trade rivals spend on hospitals cathedrals and other receptacles for conscience money i devote to experiments and researches in improved methods of destroying life and property i have always done so and i always shall therefore your christmas card moralities of peace on earth and goodwill among men are of no use to me your christianity which enjoins you to resist not evil and to turn the other cheek would make me a bankrupt my moralitymy religionmust have a place for cannons and torpedoes in it  stephen coldlyalmost sullenly you speak as if there were half a dozen moralities and religions to choose from instead of one true morality and one true religion  undershaft for me there is only one true morality but it might not fit you as you do not manufacture aerial battleships there is only one true morality for every man but every man has not the same true morality  lomax overtaxed would you mind saying that again i didnt quite follow it  cusins its quite simple as euripides says one mans meat is another mans poison morally as well as physically  undershaft precisely  lomax oh that yes yes yes true true  stephen in other words some men are honest and some are scoundrels  barbara bosh there are no scoundrels  undershaft indeed are there any good men  barbara no not one there are neither good men nor scoundrels there are just children of one father and the sooner they stop calling one another names the better you neednt talk to me i know them ive had scores of them through my hands scoundrels criminals infidels philanthropists missionaries county councillors all sorts theyre all just the same sort of sinner and theres the same salvation ready for them all  undershaft may i ask have you ever saved a maker of cannons  barbara no will you let me try  undershaft well i will make a bargain with you if i go to see you tomorrow in your salvation shelter will you come the day after to see me in my cannon works  barbara take care it may end in your giving up the cannons for the sake of the salvation army  undershaft are you sure it will not end in your giving up the salvation army for the sake of the cannons  barbara i will take my chance of that  undershaft and i will take my chance of the other they shake hands on it where is your shelter  barbara in west ham at the sign of the cross ask anybody in canning town where are your works  undershaft in perivale st andrews at the sign of the sword ask anybody in europe  lomax hadnt i better play something  barbara yes give us onward christian soldiers  lomax well thats rather a strong order to begin with dont you know suppose i sing thourt passing hence my brother its much the same tune  barbara its too melancholy you get saved cholly and youll pass hence my brother without making such a fuss about it  lady britomart really barbara you go on as if religion were a pleasant subject do have some sense of propriety  undershaft i do not find it an unpleasant subject my dear it is the only one that capable people really care for  lady britomart looking at her watch well if you are determined to have it i insist on having it in a proper and respectable way charles ring for prayers general amazement stephen rises in dismay  lomax rising oh i say  undershaft rising i am afraid i must be going  lady

accompaniment is heard when the door opens are you coming stephen  stephen no certainly not she goes he sits down on the settee with compressed lips and an expression of strong dislike    act ii  the yard of the west ham shelter of the salvation army is a cold place on a january morning the building itself an old warehouse is newly whitewashed its gabled end projects into the yard in the middle with a door on the ground floor and another in the loft above it without any balcony or ladder but with a pulley rigged over it for hoisting sacks those who come from this central gable end into the yard have the gateway leading to the street on their left with a stone horsetrough just beyond it and on the right a penthouse shielding a table from the weather there are forms at the table and on them are seated a man and a woman both much down on their luck finishing a meal of bread one thick slice each with margarine and golden syrup and diluted milk  the man a workman out of employment is young agile a talker a poser sharp enough to be capable of anything in reason except honesty or altruistic considerations of any kind the woman is a commonplace old bundle of poverty and hardworn humanity she looks sixty and probably is fortyfive if they were rich people gloved and muffed and well wrapped up in furs and overcoats they would be numbed and miserable for it is a grindingly cold raw january day and a glance at the background of grimy warehouses and leaden sky visible over the whitewashed walls of the yard would drive any idle rich person straight to the mediterranean but these two being no more troubled with visions of the mediterranean than of the moon and  being compelled to keep more of their clothes in the pawnshop and less on their persons in winter than in summer are not depressed by the cold rather are they stung into vivacity to which their meal has just now given an almost jolly turn the man takes a pull at his mug and then gets up and moves about the yard with his hands deep in his pockets occasionally breaking into a stepdance  the woman feel better otter your meal sir  the man no call that a meal good enough for you props but wot is it to me

beating a lively rataplan but makes no sound exactly so but suppose barbara finds you out  cusins you know i do not admit that i am imposing on barbara i am quite genuinely interested in the views of the salvation army the fact is i am a sort of collector of religions and the curious thing is that i find i can believe them all by the way have you any religion  undershaft yes  cusins anything out of the common  undershaft only that there are two things necessary to salvation  cusins disappointed but polite ah the church catechism charles lomax also belongs to the established church  undershaft the two things are  cusins baptism and  undershaft no money and gunpowder  cusins surprised but interested that is the general opinion of our governing classes the novelty is in hearing any man confess it  undershaft just so  cusins excuse me is there any place in your religion for honor justice truth love mercy and so forth  undershaft yes they are the graces and luxuries of a rich strong and safe life  cusins suppose one is forced to choose between them and money or gunpowder  undershaft choose money and gunpowder for without enough of both you cannot afford the others  cusins that is your religion  undershaft yes  the cadence of this reply makes a full close in the conversation cusins twists his face dubiously and contemplates undershaft undershaft contemplates him  cusins barbara wont stand that you will have to choose between your religion and barbara  undershaft so will you my friend she will find out that that drum of yours is hollow  cusins father undershaft you are mistaken i am a sincere salvationist you do not understand the salvation army it is the army of joy of love of courage it has banished the fear and remorse and despair of the old hellridden evangelical sects it marches to fight the devil with trumpet and drum with music and dancing with banner and palm as becomes a sally from heaven by its happy garrison it picks the waster out of the public house and makes a man of him it finds a worm wriggling in a back kitchen and lo a woman men and women of rank too sons and daughters of the highest it takes the poor professor of greek the most artificial and selfsuppressed of human creatures from his meal of roots and lets loose the rhapsodist in him reveals the true worship of dionysos to him sends him down the public street drumming dithyrambs he plays a thundering flourish on the drum  undershaft you will alarm the shelter  cusins oh they are accustomed to these sudden ecstasies of piety however if the drum worries you he pockets the drumsticks unhooks the drum and stands it on the ground opposite the gateway  undershaft thank you  cusins you remember what euripides says about your money and gunpowder  undershaft no  cusins declaiming                        one and another in money and guns may outpass his brother and men in their millions float and flow and seethe with a million hopes as leaven and they win their will or they miss their will and their hopes are dead or are pined for still     but whoeer can know     as the long days go that to live is happy has found his heaven  my translation what do you think of it  undershaft i think my friend that if you wish to know as the long days go that to live is happy you must first acquire money enough for a decent life and power enough to be your own master  cusins you are damnably discouraging he resumes his declamation        is it so hard a thing to see       that the spirit of godwhateer it be the law that abides and changes not ages long the eternal and natureborn these things be strong what else is wisdom what of mans endeavor or gods high grace so lovely and so great to stand from fear set free to breathe and wait to hold a hand uplifted over fate and shall not barbara be loved for ever  undershaft euripides mentions barbara does he  cusins it is a fair translation the word means loveliness  undershaft may i askas barbaras fatherhow much a year she is to be loved for ever on  cusins as barbaras father that is more your affair than mine i can feed her by teaching greek that is about all  undershaft do you consider it a good match for her  cusins with polite obstinacy mr undershaft i am in many ways a weak timid ineffectual person and my health is far from satisfactory but whenever i feel that i must have anything i get it sooner or later i feel that way about barbara i dont like marriage i feel intensely afraid of it and i dont know what i shall do with barbara or what she will do with me but i feel that i and nobody else must marry her please regard that as settlednot that i wish to be arbitrary but why should i waste your time in discussing what is inevitable  undershaft you mean that you will stick at nothing not even the conversion of the salvation army to the worship of dionysos  cusins the business of the salvation army is to save not to wrangle about the name of the pathfinder dionysos or another what does it matter  undershaft rising and approaching him professor cusins you are a young man after my own heart  cusins mr undershaft you are as far as i am able to gather a most infernal old rascal but you appeal very strongly to my sense of ironic humor  undershaft mutely offers his hand they shake  undershaft suddenly concentrating himself and now to business  cusins pardon me we were discussing religion why go back to such an uninteresting and unimportant subject as business  undershaft religion is our business at present because it is through religion alone that we can win barbara  cusins have you too fallen in love with barbara  undershaft yes with a fathers love  cusins a fathers love for a grownup daughter is the most dangerous of all infatuations i apologize for mentioning my own pale coy mistrustful fancy in the same breath with it  undershaft keep to the point we have to win her and we are neither of us methodists  cusins that doesnt matter the power barbara wields herethe power that wields barbara herselfis not calvinism not presbyterianism not methodism  undershaft not greek paganism either eh  cusins i admit that barbara is quite original in her religion  undershaft triumphantly aha barbara undershaft would be her inspiration comes from within herself  cusins how do you suppose it got there  undershaft in towering excitement it is the undershaft inheritance i shall hand on my torch to my daughter she shall make my converts and preach my gospel  cusins what money and gunpowder  undershaft yes money and gunpowder freedom and power command of life and command of death  cusins urbanely trying to bring him down to earth this is extremely interesting mr undershaft of course you know that you are mad  undershaft with redoubled force and you  cusins oh mad as a hatter you are welcome to my secret since i have discovered yours but i am astonished can a madman make cannons  undershaft would anyone else than a madman make them and now with surging energy question for question can a sane man translate euripides  cusins no  undershaft reining him by the shoulder can a sane woman make a man of a waster or a woman of a worm  cusins reeling before the storm father colossusmammoth millionaire  undershaft pressing him are there two mad people or three in this salvation shelter today  cusins you mean barbara is as mad as we are  undershaft pushing him lightly off and resuming his equanimity suddenly and completely pooh professor let us call things by their proper names i am a millionaire you are a poet barbara is a savior of souls what have we three to do with the common mob of slaves and idolaters he sits down again with a shrug of contempt for the mob  cusins take care barbara is in love with the common people so am i have you never felt the romance of that love  undershaft cold and sardonic have you ever been in love with poverty like st francis have you ever been in love with dirt like st simeon have you ever been in love with disease and suffering like our nurses and philanthropists such passions are not virtues but the most unnatural of all the vices this love of the common people may please an earls granddaughter and a university professor but i have been a common man and a poor man and it has no romance for me leave it to the poor to pretend that poverty is a blessing leave it to the coward to make a religion of his cowardice by preaching humility we know better than that we three must stand together above the common people how else can we help their children to climb up beside us barbara must belong to us not to the salvation army  cusins well i can only say that if you think you will get her away from the salvation army by talking to her as you have been talking to me you dont know barbara  undershaft my friend i never ask for what i can buy  cusins in a white fury do i understand you to imply that you can buy barbara  undershaft no but i can buy the salvation army  cusins quite impossible  undershaft you shall see all religious organizations exist by selling themselves to the rich  cusins not the army that is the church of the poor  undershaft all the more reason for buying it  cusins i dont think you quite know what the army does for the poor  undershaft oh yes i do it draws their teeth that is enough for meas a man of business  cusins nonsense it makes them sober  undershaft i prefer sober workmen the profits are larger  cusins honest  undershaft honest workmen are the most economical  cusins attached to their homes  undershaft so much the better they will put up with anything sooner than change their shop  cusins happy  undershaft an invaluable safeguard against revolution  cusins unselfish  undershaft indifferent to their own interests which suits me exactly  cusins with their thoughts on heavenly things  undershaft rising and not on trade unionism nor socialism excellent  cusins revolted you really are an infernal old rascal  undershaft indicating peter shirley who has just came from the shelter and strolled dejectedly down the yard between them and this is an honest man  shirley yes and what av i got by it he passes on bitterly and sits on the form in the corner of the penthouse  snobby price beaming sanctimoniously and jenny hill with a tambourine full of coppers come from the shelter and go to the drum on which jenny begins to count the money  undershaft replying to shirley oh your employers must have got a good deal by it from first to last he sits on the table with one foot on the side form cusins overwhelmed sits down on

two million millions would not be enough there is bad blood on your hands and nothing but good blood can cleanse them money is no use take it away she turns to cusins dolly you must write another letter for me to the papers he makes a wry face yes i know you dont like it but it must be done the starvation this winter is beating us everybody is unemployed the general says we must close this shelter if we cant get more money i force the collections at the meetings until i am ashamed dont i snobby  price its a fair treat to see you work it miss the way you got them up from threeandsix to

to think more of the collection than of the peoples souls and what are those hatfuls of pence and halfpence we want thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands i want to convert people not to be always begging for the army in a way id die sooner than beg for myself  undershaft in profound irony genuine unselfishness is capable of anything my dear  barbara unsuspectingly as she turns away to take the money from the drum and put it in a cash bag she carries yes isnt it undershaft looks sardonically at cusins  cusins aside to undershaft mephistopheles machiavelli  barbara tears coming into

shelter mr undershaft you know the work were doing of course  undershaft very civilly the whole nation knows it mrs baines  mrs baines no sir the whole nation does not know it or we should not be crippled as we are for want of money to carry our work through the length and breadth of the land let me tell you that there would have been rioting this winter in london but for us  undershaft you really think so  mrs baines i know it i remember 1886 when you rich gentlemen hardened your hearts against the cry of the poor they broke the windows of your clubs in pall mall  undershaft gleaming

off through the gate incidentally stealing the sovereign on his way out by picking up his cap from the drum  mrs baines with swimming eyes you see how we take the anger and the bitterness against you out of their hearts mr undershaft  undershaft it is certainly most convenient and gratifying to all large employers of labor mrs baines  mrs baines barbara jenny i have good news most wonderful news jenny runs to her my prayers have been answered i told you they would jenny didnt i  jenny yes yes  barbara moving nearer to the drum have we got money enough to keep the shelter open  mrs baines i hope we shall have enough to keep all the shelters open lord saxmundham has promised us five thousand pounds  barbara hooray  jenny glory  mrs baines if  barbara if if what  mrs baines if five other gentlemen will give a thousand each to make it up to ten thousand  barbara who is lord saxmundham i never heard of him  undershaft who has pricked up his ears at the peers name and is now watching barbara curiously a new creation my dear you have heard of sir horace bodger  barbara bodger do you mean the distiller bodgers whisky  undershaft that is the man he is one of the greatest of our public benefactors he restored the cathedral at hakington they made him a baronet for that he gave half a million to the funds of his party they made him a baron for that  shirley what will they give him for the five thousand  undershaft there is nothing left to give him so the five thousand i should think is to save his soul  mrs baines heaven grant it may oh mr undershaft you have some very rich friends cant you help us towards the other five thousand we are going to hold a great meeting this afternoon at the assembly hall in the mile end road if i could only announce that one gentleman had come forward to support lord saxmundham others would follow dont you know somebody couldnt you wouldnt you her eyes fill with tears oh think of those poor people mr undershaft think of how much it means to them and how little to a great man like you  undershaft sardonically gallant mrs baines you are irresistible i cant disappoint you and i cant deny myself the satisfaction of making bodger pay up you shall have your five thousand pounds  mrs baines thank god  undershaft you dont thank me  mrs baines oh sir dont try to be cynical dont be ashamed of being a good man the lord will bless you abundantly and our prayers will be like a strong fortification round you all the days of your life with a touch of caution you will let me have the cheque to show at the meeting wont you jenny go in and fetch a pen and ink jenny runs to the shelter door  undershaft do not disturb miss hill i have a fountain pen jenny halts he sits at the table and writes the cheque cusins rises to make more room for him they all watch him silently  bill cynically aside to barbara his voice and accent horribly debased wot prawce selvytion nah  barbara stop undershaft stops writing they all turn to her in surprise mrs baines are you really going to take this money  mrs baines astonished why not dear  barbara why not do you know what my father is have you forgotten that lord saxmundham is bodger the whisky man do you remember how we implored the county council to stop him from writing bodgers whisky in letters of fire against the sky so that the poor drinkruined creatures on the embankment could not wake up from their snatches of sleep without being reminded of their deadly thirst by that wicked sky sign do you know that the worst thing i have had to fight here is not the devil but bodger bodger bodger with his whisky his distilleries and his tied houses are you going to make our shelter another tied house for him and ask me to keep it  bill rotten drunken whisky it is too  mrs baines dear barbara lord saxmundham has a soul to be saved like any of us if heaven has found the way to make a good use of his money are we to set ourselves up against the answer to our prayers  barbara i know he has a soul to be saved let him come down here and ill do my best to help him to his salvation but he wants to send his cheque down to buy us and go on being as wicked as ever  undershaft with a reasonableness which cusins alone perceives to be ironical my dear barbara alcohol is a very necessary article it heals the sick  barbara it does nothing of the sort  undershaft well it assists the doctor that is perhaps a less questionable way of putting it it makes life bearable to millions of people who could not endure their existence if they were quite sober it enables parliament to do things at eleven at night that no sane person would do at eleven in the morning is it bodgers fault that this inestimable gift is deplorably abused by less than one per cent of the poor he turns again to the table signs the cheque and crosses it  mrs baines barbara will there be less drinking or more if all those poor souls we are saving come tomorrow and find the doors of our shelters shut in their faces lord saxmundham gives us the money to stop drinkingto take his own business from him  cusins impishly pure selfsacrifice on bodgers part clearly bless dear bodger barbara almost breaks down as adolpbus too fails her  undershaft tearing out the cheque and pocketing the book as he rises and goes past cusins to mrs baines i also mrs baines may claim a little disinterestedness think of my business think of the widows and orphans the men and lads torn to pieces with shrapnel and poisoned with lyddite mrs baines shrinks but he goes on remorselessly the oceans of blood not one drop of which is shed in a really just cause the ravaged crops the peaceful peasants forced women and men to till their fields under the fire of opposing armies on pain of starvation the bad blood of the fierce little cowards at home who egg on others to fight for the gratification of their national vanity all this makes money for me i am never richer never busier than when the papers are full of it well it is your work to preach peace on earth and goodwill to men mrs bainess face lights up again every convert you make is a vote against war her lips move in prayer yet i give you this money to help you to hasten my own commercial ruin he gives her the cheque  cusins mounting the form in an ecstasy of mischief the millennium will be inaugurated by the unselfishness of undershaft and bodger oh be joyful he takes the drumsticks from his pockets and flourishes them  mrs baines taking the cheque the longer i live the more proof i see that there is an infinite goodness that turns everything to the work of salvation sooner or later who would have thought that any good could have come out of war and drink and yet their profits are brought today to the feet of salvation to do its blessed work she is affected to tears  jenny running to mrs baines and throwing her arms round her oh dear how blessed how glorious it all is  cusins in a convulsion of irony let us seize this unspeakable moment let us march to the great meeting at once excuse me just an instant he rushes into the shelter jenny takes her tambourine from the drum head  mrs baines mr undershaft have you ever seen a thousand people fall on their knees with one impulse and pray come with us to the meeting barbara shall tell them that the army is saved and saved through you  cusins returning impetuously from the shelter with a flag and a trombone and coming between mrs baines and undershaft you shall carry the flag down the first street mrs baines he gives her the flag mr undershaft is a gifted trombonist he shall intone an olympian diapason to the west ham salvation march aside to undershaft as he forces the trombone on him blow machiavelli blow  undershaft aside to him as he takes the trombone the trumpet in zion cusins rushes to the drum which he takes up and puts on undershaft continues aloud i will do my best i could vamp a bass if i knew the tune  cusins it is a wedding chorus from one of donizettis operas but we have converted it we convert everything to good here including bodger you remember the chorus for thee immense rejoicingimmenso giubiloimmenso giubilo with drum obbligato rum tum ti tum tum tum tum ti ta  barbara dolly you are breaking my heart  cusins what is a broken heart more or less here dionysos undershaft has descended i am possessed  mrs baines come barbara i must have my dear major to carry the flag with me  jenny yes yes major darling  cusins snatches the tambourine out of jennys hand and mutely offers it to barbara  barbara coming forward a little as she puts the offer behind her with a shudder whilst cusins recklessly tosses the tambourine back to jenny and goes to the gate i cant come  jenny not come  mrs baines with tears in her eyes barbara do you think i am wrong to take the money  barbara impulsively going to her and kissing her no no god help you dear you must you are saving the army go and may you have a great meeting  jenny but arnt you

she pins the badge on and steps back towards the table showing him to the others there its not much for 5000 pounds is it  mrs baines barbara if you wont come and pray with us promise me you will pray for us  barbara i cant pray now perhaps i shall never pray again  mrs baines barbara  jenny major  barbara almost delirious i cant bear any more quick march  cusins calling to the procession in the street outside off we go play up there immenso giubilo he gives the time with his drum and the band strikes up the march which rapidly becomes more distant as the procession moves briskly away  mrs baines i must go dear youre overworked you will be all right tomorrow well never lose you now jenny step out with the old flag blood and fire she marches out through the gate with her flag  jenny glory hallelujah flourishing her tambourine and marching  undershaft to cusins as he marches out past him easing the slide of his trombone my ducats and my daughter  cusins following him out money and gunpowder  barbara drunkenness and murder my god why hast thou forsaken me  she sinks on the form with her face buried in her hands the march passes away into silence bill walker steals across to her

britomart what were you drinking may i ask  cusins a most devilish kind of spanish burgundy warranted free from added alcohol a temperance burgundy in fact its richness in natural alcohol made any addition superfluous  barbara are you joking dolly  cusins patiently no i have been making a night of it with the nominal head of this household that is all  lady britomart andrew made you drunk  cusins no he only provided the wine i think it was dionysos who made me drunk to barbara i told you i was possessed  lady britomart youre not sober yet go home to bed at once  cusins i have never before ventured to reproach you lady brit but how could you marry the prince of darkness  lady britomart it was much more excusable to marry him than to get drunk with him that is a new accomplishment of andrews by the way he usent to drink  cusins he doesnt now he only sat there and completed the wreck of my moral basis the rout of my convictions the purchase of my soul he cares for you barbara that is what makes him so dangerous to me  barbara that has nothing to do with it dolly there are larger loves and diviner dreams than the fireside ones you know that dont you  cusins yes that is our understanding i know it i hold to it unless he can win me on that holier ground he may amuse me for a while but he can get no deeper hold strong as he is  barbara keep to that and the end will be right now tell me what happened at the meeting  cusins it was an amazing meeting mrs baines almost died of emotion jenny hill went stark mad with hysteria the prince of darkness played his trombone like a madman its brazen roarings were like the laughter of the damned 117 conversions took place then and there they prayed with the most touching sincerity and gratitude for bodger and for the anonymous donor of the 5000 pounds your father would not let his name be given  lomax that was rather fine of the old man you know most chaps would have wanted the advertisement  cusins he said all the charitable institutions would be down on him like kites on a battle field if he gave his name  lady britomart thats andrew all over he never does a proper thing without giving an improper reason for it  cusins he convinced me that i have all my life been doing improper things for proper reasons  lady britomart adolphus now that barbara has left the salvation army you had better leave it too i will not have you playing that drum in the streets  cusins your orders are already obeyed lady brit  barbara dolly were you ever really in earnest about it would you have joined if you had never seen me  cusins disingenuously wellerwell possibly as a collector of religions  lomax cunningly not as a drummer though you know you are a very clearheaded brainy chap cholly and it must have been apparent to you that there is a certain amount of tosh about  lady britomart charles if you must drivel drivel like a grownup man and not like a schoolboy  lomax out of countenance well drivel is drivel dont you know whatever a mans age  lady britomart in good society in england charles men drivel at all ages by repeating silly formulas with an air of wisdom schoolboys make their own formulas out of slang like you when they reach your age and get political private secretaryships and things of that sort they drop slang and get their formulas out of the spectator or the times you had better confine yourself to the times you will find that there is a certain amount of tosh about the times but at least its language is reputable  lomax overwhelmed you are so awfully strongminded lady brit  lady britomart rubbish morrison comes in what is it  morrison if you please my lady mr undershaft has just drove up to the door  lady britomart well let him in morrison hesitates whats the matter with you  morrison shall i announce him my lady or is he at home here so to speak my lady  lady britomart announce him  morrison thank you my lady you wont mind my asking i hope the occasion is in a manner of speaking new to me  lady britomart quite right go and let him in  morrison thank you my lady he withdraws  lady britomart children go and get ready sarah and barbara go upstairs for their outofdoor wrap charles go and tell stephen to come down here in five minutes you will find him in the drawing room charles goes adolphus tell them to send round the carriage in about fifteen minutes adolphus goes  morrison at the door mr undershaft  undershaft comes in morrison goes out  undershaft alone how fortunate  lady britomart rising dont be sentimental andrew sit down she sits on the settee he sits beside her on her left she comes to the point before he has time to breathe sarah must have 800 pounds a year until charles lomax comes into his property barbara will need more and need it permanently because adolphus hasnt any property  undershaft resignedly yes my dear i will see to it anything else for yourself for instance  lady britomart i want to talk to you about stephen  undershaft rather wearily dont my dear stephen doesnt interest me  lady britomart he does interest me he is our son  undershaft do you really think so he has induced us to bring him into the world but he chose his parents very incongruously i think i see nothing of myself in him and less of you  lady britomart andrew stephen is an excellent son and a most steady capable highminded young man you are simply trying to find an excuse for disinheriting him  undershaft my dear biddy the undershaft tradition disinherits him it would be dishonest of me to leave the cannon foundry to my son  lady britomart it would be most unnatural and improper of you to leave it to anyone else andrew do you suppose this wicked and immoral tradition can be kept up for ever do you pretend that stephen could not carry on the foundry just as well as all the other sons of the big business houses  undershaft yes he could learn the office routine without understanding the business like all the other sons and the firm would go on by its own momentum until the real undershaftprobably an italian or a germanwould invent a new method and cut him out  lady britomart there is nothing that any italian or german could do that stephen could not do and stephen at least has breeding  undershaft the son of a foundling nonsense  lady britomart my son andrew and even you may have good blood in your veins for all you know  undershaft true probably i have that is another argument in favor of a foundling  lady britomart andrew dont be aggravating and dont be wicked at present you are both  undershaft this conversation is part of the undershaft tradition biddy every undershafts wife has treated him to it ever since the house was founded it is mere waste of breath if the tradition be ever broken it will be for an abler man than stephen  lady britomart pouting then go away  undershaft deprecatory go away  lady britomart yes go away if you will do nothing for stephen you are not wanted here go to your foundling whoever he is and look after him  undershaft the fact is biddy  lady britomart dont call me biddy i dont call you andy  undershaft i will not call my wife britomart it is not good sense seriously my love the undershaft tradition has landed me in a difficulty i am getting on in years and my partner lazarus has at last made a stand and insisted that the succession must be settled one way or the other and of course he is quite right you see i havent found a fit successor yet  lady britomart obstinately there is stephen  undershaft thats just it all the foundlings i can find are exactly like stephen  lady britomart andrew  undershaft i want a man with no relations and no schooling that is a man who would be out of the running altogether if he were not a strong man and i cant find him every blessed foundling nowadays is snapped up in his infancy by barnardo homes or school board officers or boards of guardians and if he shows the least ability he is fastened on by schoolmasters trained to win scholarships like a racehorse crammed with secondhand ideas drilled and disciplined in docility and what they call good taste and lamed for life so that he is fit for nothing but teaching if you want to keep the foundry in the family you had better find an eligible foundling and marry him to barbara  lady britomart ah barbara your pet you would sacrifice stephen to barbara  undershaft cheerfully and you my dear would boil barbara to make soup for stephen  lady britomart andrew this is not a question of our likings and dislikings it is a question of duty it is your duty to make stephen your successor  undershaft just as much as it is your duty to submit to your husband come biddy these tricks of the governing class are of no use with me i am one of the governing class myself and it is waste of time giving tracts to a missionary i have the power in this matter and i am not to be humbugged into using it for your purposes  lady britomart andrew you can talk my head off but you cant change wrong into right and your tie is all on one side put it straight  undershaft disconcerted it wont stay unless its pinned he fumbles at it with childish grimaces  stephen comes in  stephen at the door i beg your pardon about to retire  lady britomart no come in stephen stephen comes forward to his mothers writing table  undershaft not very cordially good afternoon  stephen coldly good afternoon  undershaft to lady britomart he knows all about the tradition i suppose  lady britomart yes to stephen it is what i told you last night stephen  undershaft sulkily i understand you want to come into the cannon business  stephen i go into trade certainly not  undershaft opening his eyes greatly eased in mind and manner oh in that case  lady britomart cannons are not trade stephen they are enterprise  stephen i have no intention of becoming a man of business in any sense i have no capacity for business and no taste for it i intend to devote myself to politics  undershaft rising my dear boy this is an immense relief to me and i trust it may prove an equally good thing for the country i was afraid you would consider yourself disparaged and slighted he moves towards stephen as if to shake hands with him  lady britomart rising and interposing stephen i cannot allow you to throw away an enormous property like this  stephen stiffly mother there must be an end of treating me as a child if you please lady britomart recoils deeply wounded by his tone until last night i did not take your attitude seriously because i did not think you meant it seriously but i find now that you left me in the dark as to matters which you should have explained to me years ago i am extremely hurt and offended any further discussion of my intentions had better take place with my father as between one man and another  lady britomart stephen she sits down again and her eyes fill with tears  undershaft with grave compassion you see my dear it is only the big men who can be treated as children  stephen i am sorry mother that you have forced me  undershaft stopping him yes yes yes yes thats all right stephen she wont interfere with you any more your independence is achieved you have won your latchkey dont rub it in and above all dont apologize he resumes his seat now what about your future as between one man and anotheri beg your pardon biddy as between two men and a woman  lady britomart who has pulled herself together strongly i quite understand stephen by all means go your own way if you feel strong enough stephen sits down magisterially in the chair at the writing table with an air of affirming his majority  undershaft it is settled that you do not ask for the succession to the cannon business  stephen i hope it is settled that i repudiate the cannon business  undershaft come come dont be so devilishly sulky its boyish freedom should be generous besides i owe you a fair start in life in exchange for disinheriting you you cant become prime minister all at once havent you a turn for something what about literature art and so forth  stephen i have nothing of the artist about me either in faculty or character thank heaven  undershaft a philosopher perhaps eh  stephen i make no such ridiculous pretension  undershaft just so well there is the army the navy the church the bar the bar requires some ability what about the bar  stephen i have not studied law and i am afraid i have not the necessary pushi believe that is the name barristers give to their vulgarityfor success in pleading  undershaft rather a difficult case stephen hardly anything left but the stage is there stephen makes an impatient movement well come is there anything you know or care for  stephen rising and looking at him steadily i know the difference between right and wrong  undershaft hugely tickled you dont say so what no capacity for business no knowledge of law no sympathy with art no pretension to philosophy only a simple knowledge of the secret that has puzzled all the philosophers baffled all the lawyers muddled all the men of business and ruined most of the artists the secret of right and wrong why man youre a genius master of masters a god at twentyfour too  stephen keeping his temper with difficulty you are pleased to be facetious i pretend to nothing more than any honorable english gentleman claims as his birthright he sits down angrily  undershaft oh thats everybodys birthright look at poor little jenny hill the salvation lassie she would think you were laughing at her if you asked her to stand up in the street and teach grammar or geography or mathematics or even drawingroom dancing but it never occurs to her to doubt that she can teach morals and religion you are all alike you respectable people you cant tell me the bursting strain of a teninch gun which is a very simple matter but you all think you can tell me the bursting strain of a man under temptation you darent handle high explosives but youre all ready to handle honesty and truth and justice and the whole duty of man and kill one another at that game what a country what a world  lady britomart uneasily what do you think he had better do andrew  undershaft oh just what he wants to do he knows nothing and he thinks he knows everything that points clearly to a political career get him a private secretaryship to someone who can get him an under secretaryship and then leave him alone he will find his natural and proper place in the end on the treasury bench  stephen springing up again i am sorry sir that you force me to forget the respect due to you as my father i am an englishman and i will not hear the government of my country insulted he thrusts his hands in his pockets and walks angrily across to the window  undershaft with a touch of brutality the government of your country i am the government of your country i and lazarus do you suppose that you and half a dozen amateurs like you sitting in a row in that foolish gabble shop can govern undershaft and lazarus no my friend you will do what pays us you will make war when it suits us and keep peace when it doesnt you will find out that trade requires certain measures when we have decided on those measures when i want anything to keep my dividends up you will discover that my want is a national need when other people want something to keep my dividends down you will call out the police and military and in return you shall have the support and applause of my newspapers and the delight of imagining that you are a great statesman government of your country be off with you my boy and play with your caucuses and leading articles and historic parties and great leaders and burning questions and the rest of your toys i am going back to my counting house to pay the piper and call the tune  stephen actually smiling and putting his hand on his fathers shoulder with indulgent patronage really my dear father it is impossible to be angry with you you dont know how absurd all this sounds to me you are very properly proud of having been industrious enough to make money and it is greatly to your credit that you have made so much of it but it has kept you in circles where you are valued for your money and deferred to for it instead of in the doubtless very oldfashioned and behindthetimes public school and university where i formed my habits of mind it is natural for you to think that money governs england but you must allow me to think i know better  undershaft and what does govern england pray  stephen character father character  undershaft whose character yours or mine  stephen neither yours nor mine father but the best elements in the english national character  undershaft stephen ive found your profession for you youre a born journalist ill start you with a hightoned weekly review there  stephen goes to the smaller writing table and busies himself with his letters  sarah barbara lomax and cusins come in ready for walking barbara crosses the room to the window and looks out cusins drifts amiably to the armchair and lomax remains near the door whilst sarah comes to her mother  sarah go and get ready mamma the carriage is waiting lady britomart leaves the room  undershaft to sarah good day my dear good afternoon mr lomax  lomax vaguely ahdedoo  undershaft to cusins quite well after last night euripides eh  cusins as well as can be expected  undershaft thats right to barbara so you are coming to see my death and devastation factory barbara  barbara at the window you came yesterday to see my salvation factory i promised you a return visit  lomax coming forward between sarah and undershaft youll find it awfully interesting ive been through the woolwich arsenal and it gives you a ripping feeling of security you know to think of the lot of beggars we could kill if it came to fighting to undershaft with sudden solemnity still it must be rather an awful reflection for you from the religious point of view as it were youre getting on you know and all that  sarah you dont mind chollys imbecility papa do you  lomax much taken aback oh i say  undershaft mr lomax looks at the matter in a very proper spirit my dear  lomax just so thats all i meant i assure you  sarah are you coming stephen  stephen well i am rather busyer magnanimously oh well yes ill come that is if there is room for me  undershaft i can take two with me in a little motor i am experimenting with for field use you wont mind its being rather unfashionable its not painted yet but its bullet proof  lomax appalled at the prospect of confronting wilton crescent in an unpainted motor oh i say  sarah the carriage for me thank you barbara doesnt mind what shes seen in  lomax i say dolly old chap do you really mind the car being a guy because of course if you do ill go in it still  cusins i prefer it  lomax thanks awfully old man come sarah he hurries out to secure his seat in the carriage sarah follows him  cusins moodily walking across to lady britomarts writing table why are we two coming to this works department of hell that is what i ask myself  barbara i have always thought of it as a sort of pit where lost creatures with blackened faces stirred up smoky fires and were driven and tormented by my father is it like that dad  undershaft scandalized my dear it is a spotlessly clean and beautiful hillside town  cusins with a methodist chapel oh do say theres a methodist chapel  undershaft there are two a primitive one and a sophisticated one there is even an ethical society but it is not much patronized as my men are all strongly religious in the high explosives sheds they object to the presence of agnostics as unsafe  cusins and yet they dont object to you  barbara do they obey all your orders  undershaft i never give them any orders when i speak to one of them it is well jones is the baby doing well and has mrs jones made a good recovery nicely thank you sir and thats all  cusins but jones has to be kept in order how do you maintain discipline among your men  undershaft i dont they do you see the one thing jones wont stand is any rebellion from the man under him or any assertion of social equality between the wife of the man with 4 shillings a week less than himself and mrs jones of course they all rebel against me theoretically practically every man of them keeps the man just below him in his place i never meddle with them i never bully them i dont even bully lazarus i say that certain things are to be done but i dont order anybody to do them i dont say mind you that there is no ordering about and snubbing and even bullying the men snub the boys and order them about the carmen snub the sweepers the artisans snub the unskilled laborers the foremen drive and bully both the laborers and artisans the assistant engineers find fault with the foremen the chief engineers drop on the assistants the departmental managers worry the chiefs and the clerks have tall hats and hymnbooks and keep up the social tone by refusing to associate on equal terms with anybody the result is a colossal profit which comes to me  cusins revolted you really are awell what i was saying yesterday  barbara what was he saying yesterday  undershaft never mind my dear he thinks i have made you unhappy have i  barbara do you think i can be happy in this vulgar silly dress i who have worn the uniform do you understand what you have done to me yesterday i had a mans soul in my hand i set him in the way of life with his face to salvation but when we took your money he turned back to drunkenness and derision with intense conviction i will never forgive you that if i had a child and you destroyed its body with your explosivesif you murdered dolly with your horrible gunsi could forgive you if my forgiveness would open the gates of heaven to you but to take a human soul from me and turn it into the soul of a wolf that is worse than any murder  undershaft does my daughter despair so easily can you strike a man to the heart and leave no mark on him  barbara her face lighting up oh you are right he can never be lost now where was my faith  cusins oh clever clever devil  barbara you may be a devil but god speaks through you sometimes she takes her fathers hands and kisses them you have given me back my happiness i feel it deep down now though my spirit is troubled  undershaft you have learnt something that always feels at first as if you had lost something  barbara well take me to the factory of death and let me learn something more there must be some truth or other behind all this frightful irony come dolly she goes out  cusins my guardian angel to undershaft avaunt he follows barbara  stephen quietly at the writing table you must not mind cusins father he is a very amiable good fellow but he is a greek scholar and naturally a little eccentric  undershaft ah quite so thank you stephen thank you he goes out  stephen smiles patronizingly buttons his coat responsibly and crosses the room to the door lady britomart dressed for outofdoors opens it before he reaches it she looks round far the others looks at stephen and turns to go without a word  stephen embarrassed mother  lady britomart dont be apologetic stephen and dont forget that you have outgrown your mother she goes out  perivale st andrews lies between two middlesex hills half climbing the northern one it is an almost smokeless town of white walls roofs of narrow green slates or red tiles tall trees domes campaniles and slender chimney shafts beautifully situated and beautiful in itself the best view of it is obtained from the crest of a slope about half a mile to the east where the high explosives are dealt with the foundry lies hidden in the depths between the tops of its chimneys sprouting like huge skittles into the middle distance across the crest runs a platform of concrete with a parapet which suggests a fortification because there is a huge cannon of the obsolete woolwich infant pattern peering across it at the town the cannon is mounted on an experimental gun carriage possibly the original model of the undershaft disappearing rampart gun alluded to by stephen the parapet has a high step inside which serves as a seat  barbara is leaning over the parapet looking towards the town on her right is the cannon on her left the end of a shed raised on piles with a ladder of three or four steps up to the door which opens outwards and has a little wooden landing at the threshold with a fire bucket in the corner of the landing the parapet stops short of the shed leaving a gap which is the beginning of the path down the hill through the foundry to the town behind the cannon is a trolley carrying a huge conical bombshell with a red band painted on it further from the parapet on the same side is a deck chair near the door of an office which like the sheds is of the lightest possible construction  cusins arrives by the path from the town  barbara well  cusins not a ray of hope everything perfect wonderful real it only needs a cathedral to be a heavenly city instead of a hellish one  barbara have you found out whether they have done anything for old peter shirley  cusins they have found him a job as gatekeeper and timekeeper hes frightfully miserable he calls the timekeeping brainwork and says he isnt used to it and his gate lodge is so splendid that hes ashamed to use the rooms and skulks in the scullery  barbara poor peter  stephen arrives from the town he carries a fieldglass  stephen enthusiastically have you two seen the place why did you leave us  cusins i wanted to see everything i was not intended to see and barbara wanted to make the men talk  stephen have you found anything discreditable  cusins no they call him dandy andy and are proud of his being a cunning old rascal but its all horribly frightfully immorally unanswerably perfect  sarah arrives  sarah heavens what a place she crosses to the trolley did you see the nursing home she sits down on the shell  stephen did you see the libraries and schools  sarah did you see the ballroom and the banqueting chamber in the town hall  stephen have you gone into the insurance fund the pension fund the building society the various applications of cooperation  undershaft comes from the office with a sheaf of telegrams in his hands  undershaft well have you seen everything im sorry i was called away indicating the telegrams news from manchuria  stephen good news i hope  undershaft very  stephen another japanese victory  undershaft oh i dont know which side wins does not concern us here no the good news is that the aerial battleship is a tremendous success at the first trial it has wiped out a fort with three hundred soldiers in it  cusins from the platform dummy soldiers  undershaft no the real thing cusins and barbara exchange glances then cusins sits on the step and buries his face in his hands barbara gravely lays her hand on his shoulder and he looks up at her in a sort of whimsical desperation well stephen what do you think of the place  stephen oh magnificent a perfect triumph of organization frankly my dear father i have been a fool i had no idea of what it all meantof the wonderful forethought the power of organization the administrative capacity the financial genius the colossal capital it represents i have been repeating to myself as i came through your streets peace hath her victories no less renowned than war i have only one misgiving about it all  undershaft out with it  stephen well i cannot help thinking that all this provision for every want of your workmen may sap their independence and weaken their sense of responsibility and greatly as we enjoyed our tea at that splendid restauranthow they gave us all that luxury and cake and jam and cream for threepence i really cannot imaginestill you must remember that restaurants break up home life look at the continent for instance are you sure so much pampering is really good for the mens characters  undershaft well you see my dear boy when you are organizing civilization you have to make up your mind whether trouble and anxiety are good things or not if you decide that they are then i take it you simply dont organize civilization and there you are with trouble and anxiety enough to make us all angels but if you decide the other way you may as well go through with it however stephen our characters are safe here a sufficient dose of anxiety is always provided by the fact that we may be blown to smithereens at any moment  sarah by the way papa where do you make the explosives  undershaft in separate little sheds like that one when one of them blows up it costs very little and only the people quite close to it are killed  stephen who is quite close to it looks at it rather scaredly and moves away quickly to the cannon at the same moment the door of the shed is thrown abruptly open and a foreman in overalls and list slippers comes out on the little landing and holds the door open for lomax who appears in the doorway  lomax with studied coolness my good fellow you neednt get into a state of nerves nothings going to happen to you and i suppose it wouldnt be the end of the world if anything did a little bit of british pluck is what you want old chap he descends and strolls across to sarah  undershaft to the foreman anything wrong bilton  bilton with ironic calm gentleman walked into the high explosives shed and lit a cigaret sir thats all  undershaft ah quite so to lomax do you happen to remember what you did with the match  lomax oh come im not a fool i took jolly good care to blow it out before i chucked it away  bilton the top of it was red hot inside sir  lomax well suppose it was i didnt chuck it into any of your messes  undershaft think no more of it mr lomax by the way would you mind lending me your matches  lomax offering his box certainly  undershaft thanks he pockets the matches  lomax lecturing to the company generally you know these high explosives dont go off like gunpowder except when theyre in a gun when theyre spread loose you can put a match to them without the least risk they just burn quietly like a bit of paper warming to the scientific interest of the subject did you know that undershaft have you ever tried  undershaft not on a large scale mr lomax bilton will give you a sample of gun cotton when you are leaving if you ask him you can experiment with it at home bilton looks puzzled  sarah bilton will do nothing of the sort papa i suppose its your business to blow up the russians and japs but you might really stop short of blowing up poor cholly bilton gives it up and retires into the shed  lomax my ownest there is no danger he sits beside her on the shell  lady britomart arrives from the town with a bouquet  lady britomart coming impetuously between undershaft and the deck chair andrew you shouldnt have let me see this place  undershaft why my dear  lady britomart never mind why you shouldnt have thats all to think of all that indicating the town being yours and that you have kept it to yourself all these years  undershaft it does not belong to me i belong to it it is the undershaft inheritance  lady britomart it is not your ridiculous cannons and that noisy banging foundry may be the undershaft inheritance but all that plate and linen all that furniture and those houses and orchards and gardens belong to us they belong to me they are not a mans business i wont give them up you must be out of your senses to throw them all away and if you persist in such folly i will call in a doctor  undershaft stooping to smell the bouquet where did you get the flowers my dear  lady britomart your men presented them to me in your william morris labor church  cusins springing up oh it needed only that a labor church  lady britomart yes with morriss words in mosaic letters ten feet high round the dome no man is good enough to be another mans master the cynicism of it  undershaft it shocked the men at first i am afraid but now they take no more notice of it than of the ten commandments in church  lady britomart andrew you are trying to put me off the subject of the inheritance by profane jokes well you shant i dont ask it any longer for stephen he has inherited far too much of your perversity to be fit for it but barbara has rights as well as stephen why should not adolphus succeed to the inheritance i could manage the town for him and he can look after the cannons if they are really necessary  undershaft i should ask nothing better if adolphus were a foundling he is exactly the sort of new blood that is wanted in english business but hes not a foundling and theres an end of it  cusins diplomatically not quite they all turn and stare at him he comes from the platform past the shed to undershaft i thinkmind i am not committing myself in any way as to my future coursebut i think the foundling difficulty can be got over  undershaft what do you mean  cusins well i have something to say which is in the nature of a confession  sarah              lady britomart     confession barbara            stephen             lomax oh i say  cusins yes a confession listen all until i met barbara i thought myself in the main an honorable truthful man because i wanted the approval of my conscience more than i wanted anything else but the moment i saw barbara i wanted her far more than the approval of my conscience  lady britomart adolphus  cusins it is true you accused me yourself lady brit of joining the army to worship barbara and so i did she bought my soul like a flower at a street corner but she bought it for herself  undershaft what not for dionysos or another  cusins dionysos and all the others are in herself i adored what was divine in her and was therefore a true worshipper but i was romantic about her too i thought she was a woman of the people and that a marriage with a professor of greek would be far beyond the wildest social ambitions of her rank  lady britomart adolphus  lomax oh i say  cusins when i learnt the horrible truth  lady britomart what do you mean by the horrible truth pray  cusins that she was enormously rich that her grandfather was an earl that her father was the prince of darkness  undershaft chut  cusinsand that i was only an adventurer trying to catch a rich wife then i stooped to deceive about my birth  lady britomart your birth now adolphus dont dare to make up a wicked story for the sake of these wretched cannons remember i have seen photographs of your parents and the agent general for south western australia knows them personally and has assured me that they are most respectable married people  cusins so they are in australia but here they are outcasts their marriage is legal in australia but not in england my mother is my fathers deceased wifes sister and in this island i am consequently a foundling sensation is the subterfuge good enough machiavelli  undershaft thoughtfully biddy this may be a way out of the difficulty  lady britomart stuff a man cant make cannons any the better for being his own cousin instead of his proper self she sits down in the deck chair with a bounce that expresses her downright contempt for their casuistry  undershaft to cusins you are an educated man that is against the tradition  cusins once in ten thousand times it happens that the schoolboy is a born master of what they try to teach him greek has not destroyed my mind it has nourished it besides i did not learn it at an english public school  undershaft hm well i cannot afford to be too particular you have cornered the foundling market let it pass you are eligible euripides you are eligible  barbara coming from the platform and interposing between cusins and undershaft dolly yesterday morning when stephen told us all about the tradition you became very silent and you have been strange and excited ever since were you thinking of your birth then  cusins when the finger of destiny suddenly points at a man in the middle of his breakfast it makes him thoughtful barbara turns away sadly and stands near her mother listening perturbedly  undershaft aha you have had your eye on the business my young friend have you  cusins take care there is an abyss of moral horror between me and your accursed aerial battleships  undershaft never mind the abyss for the present let us settle the practical details and leave your final decision open you know that you will have to change your name do you object to that  cusins would any man named adolphusany man called dollyobject to be called something else  undershaft good now as to money i propose to treat you handsomely from the beginning you shall start at a thousand a year  cusins with sudden heat his spectacles twinkling with mischief a thousand you dare offer a miserable thousand to the soninlaw of a millionaire no by heavens machiavelli you shall not cheat me you cannot do without me and i can do without you i must have two thousand five hundred a year for two years at the end of that time if i am a failure i go but if i am a success and stay on you must give me the other five thousand  undershaft what other five thousand  cusins to make the two years up to five thousand a year the two thousand five hundred is only half pay in case i should turn out a failure the third year i must have ten per cent on the profits  undershaft taken aback ten per cent why man do you know what my profits are  cusins enormous i hope otherwise i shall require twentyfive per cent  undershaft but mr cusins this is a serious matter of business you are not bringing any capital into the concern  cusins what no capital is my mastery of greek no capital is my access to the subtlest thought the loftiest poetry yet attained by humanity no capital my character my intellect my life my career what barbara calls my soul are these no capital say another word and i double my salary  undershaft be reasonable  cusins peremptorily mr undershaft you have my terms take them or leave them  undershaft recovering himself very well i note your terms and i offer you half  cusins disgusted half  undershaft firmly half  cusins you call yourself a gentleman and you offer me half  undershaft i do not call myself a gentleman but i offer you half  cusins this to your future partner your successor your soninlaw  barbara you are selling your own soul dolly not mine leave me out of the bargain please  undershaft come i will go a step further for barbaras sake i will give you three fifths but that is my last word  cusins done  lomax done in the eye why i only get eight hundred you know  cusins by the way mac i am a classical scholar not an arithmetical one is three fifths more than half or less  undershaft more of course  cusins i would have taken two hundred and fifty how you can succeed in business when you are willing to pay all that money to a university don who is obviously not worth a junior clerks wageswell what will lazarus say  undershaft lazarus is a gentle romantic jew who cares for nothing but string quartets and stalls at fashionable theatres he will get the credit of your rapacity in money matters as he has hitherto had the credit of mine you are a shark of the first order euripides so much the better for the firm  barbara is the bargain closed dolly does your soul belong to him now  cusins no the price is settled that is all the real tug of war is still to come what about the moral question  lady britomart there is no moral question in the matter at all adolphus you must simply sell cannons and weapons to people whose cause is right and just and refuse them to foreigners and criminals  undershaft determinedly no none of that you must keep the true faith of an armorer or you dont come in here  cusins what on earth is the true faith of an armorer  undershaft to give arms to all men who offer an honest price for them without respect of persons or principles to aristocrat and republican to nihilist and tsar to capitalist and socialist to protestant and catholic to burglar and policeman to black man white man and yellow man to all sorts and conditions all nationalities all faiths all follies all causes and all crimes the first undershaft wrote up in his shop if god gave the hand let not man withhold the sword the second wrote up all have the right to fight none have the right to judge the third wrote up to man the weapon to heaven the victory the fourth had no literary turn so he did not write up anything but he sold cannons to napoleon under the nose of george the third the fifth wrote up peace shall not prevail save with a sword in her hand the sixth my master was the best of all he wrote up nothing is ever done in this world until men are prepared to kill one another if it is not done after that there was nothing left for the seventh to say so he wrote up simply unashamed  cusins my good machiavelli i shall certainly write something up on the wall only as i shall write it in greek you wont be able to read it but as to your armorers faith if i take my neck out of the noose of my own morality i am not going to put it into the noose of yours i shall sell cannons to whom i please and refuse them to whom i please so there  undershaft from the moment when you become andrew undershaft you will never do as you please again dont come here lusting for power young man  cusins if power were my aim i should not come here for it you have no power  undershaft none of my own certainly  cusins i have more power than you more will you do not drive this place it drives you and what drives the place  undershaft enigmatically a will of which i am a part  barbara startled father do you know what you are saying or are you laying a snare for my soul  cusins dont listen to his metaphysics barbara the place is driven by the most rascally part of society the money hunters the pleasure hunters the military promotion hunters and he is their slave  undershaft not necessarily remember the armorers faith i will take an order from a good man as cheerfully as from a bad one if you good people prefer preaching and shirking to buying my weapons and fighting the rascals dont blame me i can make cannons i cannot make courage and conviction bah you tire me euripides with your morality mongering ask barbara she understands he suddenly takes barbaras hands and looks powerfully into her eyes tell him my love what power really means  barbara hypnotized before i joined the salvation army i was in my own power and the consequence was that i never knew what to do with myself when i joined it i had not time enough for all the things i had to do  undershaft approvingly just so and why was that do you suppose  barbara yesterday i should have said because i was in the power of god she resumes her selfpossession withdrawing her hands from his with a power equal to his own but you came and showed me that i was in the power of bodger and undershaft today i feeloh how can i put it into words sarah do you remember the earthquake at cannes when we were little childrenhow little the surprise of the first shock mattered compared to the dread and horror of waiting for the second that is how i feel in this place today i stood on the rock i thought eternal and without a word of warning it reeled and crumbled under me i was safe with an infinite wisdom watching me an army marching to salvation with me and in a moment at a stroke of your pen in a cheque book i stood alone and the heavens were empty that was the first shock of the earthquake i am waiting for the second  undershaft come come my daughter dont make too much of your little tinpot tragedy what do we do here when we spend years of work and thought and thousands of pounds of solid cash on a new gun or an aerial battleship that turns out just a hairsbreadth wrong after all scrap it scrap it without wasting another hour or another pound on it well you have made for yourself something that you call a morality or a religion or what not it doesnt fit the facts well scrap it scrap it and get one that does fit that is what is wrong with the world at present it scraps its obsolete steam engines and dynamos but it wont scrap its old prejudices and its old moralities and its old religions and its old political constitutions whats the result in machinery it does very well but in morals and religion and politics it is working at a loss that brings it nearer bankruptcy every year dont persist in that folly if your old religion broke down yesterday get a newer and a better one for tomorrow  barbara oh how gladly i would take a better one to my soul but you offer me a worse one turning on him with sudden vehemence justify yourself show me some light through the darkness of this dreadful place with its beautifully clean workshops and respectable workmen and model homes  undershaft cleanliness and respectability do not need justification barbara they justify themselves i see no darkness here no dreadfulness in your salvation shelter i saw poverty misery cold and hunger you gave them bread and treacle and dreams of heaven i give from thirty shillings a week to twelve thousand a year they find their own dreams but i look after the drainage  barbara and their souls  undershaft i save their souls just as i saved yours  barbara revolted you saved my soul what do you mean  undershaft i fed you and clothed you and housed you i took care that you should have money enough to live handsomelymore than enough so that you could be wasteful careless generous that saved your soul from the seven deadly sins  barbara bewildered the seven deadly sins  undershaft yes the deadly seven counting on his fingers food clothing firing rent taxes respectability and children nothing can lift those seven millstones from mans neck but money and the spirit cannot soar until the millstones are lifted i lifted them from your spirit i enabled barbara to become major barbara and i saved her from the crime of poverty  cusins do you call poverty a crime  undershaft the worst of crimes all the other crimes are virtues beside it all the other dishonors are chivalry itself by comparison poverty blights whole cities spreads horrible pestilences strikes dead the very souls of all who come within sight sound or smell of it what you call crime is nothing a murder here and a theft there a blow now and a curse then what do they matter they are only the accidents and illnesses of life there are not fifty genuine professional criminals in london but there are millions of poor people abject people dirty people ill fed ill clothed people they poison us morally and physically they kill the happiness of society they force us to do away with our own liberties and to organize unnatural cruelties for fear they should rise against us and drag us down into their abyss only fools fear crime we all fear poverty pah turning on barbara you talk of your halfsaved ruffian in west ham you accuse me of dragging his soul back to perdition well bring him to me here and i will drag his soul back again to salvation for you not by words and dreams but by thirtyeight shillings a week a sound house in a handsome street and a permanent job in three weeks he will have a fancy waistcoat in three months a tall hat and a chapel sitting before the end of the year he will shake hands with a duchess at a primrose league meeting and join the conservative party  barbara and will he be the better for that  undershaft you know he will dont be a hypocrite barbara he will be better fed better housed better clothed better behaved and his children will be pounds heavier and bigger that will be better than an american cloth mattress in a shelter chopping firewood eating bread and treacle and being forced to kneel down from time to time to thank heaven for it knee drill i think you call it it is cheap work converting starving men with a bible in one hand and a slice of bread in the other i will undertake to convert west ham to mahometanism on the same terms try your hand on my men their souls are hungry because their bodies are full  barbara and leave the east end to starve  undershaft his energetic tone dropping into one of bitter and brooding remembrance i was an east ender i moralized and starved until one day i swore that i would be a fullfed free man at all coststhat nothing should stop me except a bullet neither reason nor morals nor the lives of other men i said thou shalt starve ere i starve and with that word i became free and great i was a dangerous man until i had my will now i am a useful beneficent kindly person that is the history of most selfmade millionaires i fancy when it is the history of every englishman we shall have an england worth living in  lady britomart stop making speeches andrew this is not the place for them  undershaft punctured my dear i have no other means of conveying my ideas  lady britomart your ideas are nonsense you got oil because you were selfish and unscrupulous  undershaft not at all i had the strongest scruples about poverty and starvation your moralists are quite unscrupulous about both they make virtues of them i had rather be a thief than a pauper i had rather be a murderer than a slave i dont want to be either but if you force the alternative on me then by heaven ill choose the braver and more moral one i hate poverty and slavery worse than any other crimes whatsoever and let me tell you this poverty and slavery have stood up for centuries to your sermons and leading articles they will not stand up to my machine guns dont preach at them dont reason with them kill them  barbara killing is that your remedy for everything  undershaft it is the final test of conviction the only lever strong enough to overturn a social system the only way of saying must let six hundred and seventy fools loose in the street and three policemen can scatter them but huddle them together in a certain house in westminster and let them go through certain ceremonies and call themselves certain names until at last they get the courage to kill and your six hundred and seventy fools become a government your pious mob fills up ballot papers and imagines it is governing its masters but the ballot paper that really governs is the paper that has a bullet wrapped up in it  cusins that is perhaps why like most intelligent people i never vote  undershaft vote bah when you vote you only change the names of the cabinet when you shoot you pull down governments inaugurate new epochs abolish old orders and set up new is that historically true mr learned man or is it not  cusins it is historically true i loathe having to admit it i repudiate your sentiments i abhor your nature i defy you in every possible way still it is true but it ought not to be true  undershaft ought ought ought ought ought are you going to spend your life saying ought like the rest of our moralists turn your oughts into shalls man come and make explosives with me whatever can blow men up can blow society up the history of the world is the history of those who had courage enough to embrace this truth have you the courage to embrace it barbara  lady britomart barbara i positively forbid you to listen to your fathers abominable wickedness and you adolphus ought to know better than to go about saying that wrong things are true what does it matter whether they are true if they are wrong  undershaft what does it matter whether they are wrong if they are true  lady britomart rising children come home instantly andrew i am exceedingly sorry i allowed you to call on us you are wickeder than ever come at once  barbara shaking her head its no use running away from wicked people mamma  lady britomart it is every use it shows your disapprobation of them  barbara it does not save them  lady britomart i can see that you are going to disobey me sarah are you coming home or are you not  sarah i daresay its very wicked of papa to make cannons but i dont think i shall cut him on that account  lomax pouring oil on the troubled waters the fact is you know there is a certain amount of tosh about this notion of wickedness it doesnt work you must look at facts not that i would say a word in favor of anything wrong but then you see all sorts of chaps are always doing all sorts of things and we have to fit them in somehow dont you know what i mean is that you cant go cutting everybody and thats about what it comes to their rapt attention to his eloquence makes him nervous perhaps i dont make myself clear  lady britomart you are lucidity itself charles because andrew is successful and has plenty of money to give to sarah you will flatter him and encourage him in his wickedness  lomax unruffled well where the carcase is there will the eagles be gathered dont you know to undershaft eh what  undershaft precisely by the way may i call you charles  lomax delighted cholly is the usual ticket  undershaft to lady britomart biddy  lady britomart violently dont dare call me biddy charles lomax you are a fool adolphus cusins you are a jesuit stephen you are a prig barbara you are a lunatic andrew you are a vulgar tradesman now you all know my opinion and my conscience is clear at all events she sits down again with a vehemence that almost wrecks the chair  undershaft my dear you are the incarnation of morality she snorts your conscience is clear and your duty done when you have called everybody names come euripides it is getting late and we all want to get home make up your mind  cusins understand this you old demon  lady britomart adolphus  undershaft let him alone biddy proceed euripides  cusins you have me in a horrible dilemma i want barbara  undershaft like all young men you greatly exaggerate the difference between one young woman and another  barbara quite true dolly  cusins i also want to avoid being a rascal  undershaft with biting contempt you lust for personal righteousness for selfapproval for what you call a good conscience for what barbara calls salvation for what i call patronizing people who are not so lucky as yourself  cusins i do not all the poet in me recoils from being a good man but there are things in me that i must reckon with pity  undershaft pity the scavenger of misery  cusins well love  undershaft i know you love the needy and the outcast you love the oppressed races the negro the indian ryot the pole the irishman do you love the japanese do you love the germans do you love the english  cusins no every true englishman detests the english we are the wickedest nation on earth and our success is a moral horror  undershaft that is what comes of your gospel of love is it  cusins may i not love even my fatherinlaw  undershaft who wants your love man by what right do you take the liberty of offering it to me i will have your due heed and respect or i will kill you but your love damn your impertinence  cusins grinning i may not be able to control my affections mac  undershaft you are fencing euripides you are weakening your grip is slipping come try your last weapon pity and love have broken in your hand forgiveness is still left  cusins no forgiveness is a beggars refuge i am with you there we must pay our debts  undershaft well said come you will suit me remember the words of plato  cusins starting plato you dare quote plato to me  undershaft plato says my friend that society cannot be saved until either the professors of greek take to making gunpowder or else the makers of gunpowder become professors of greek  cusins oh tempter cunning tempter  undershaft come choose man choose  cusins but perhaps barbara will not marry me if i make the wrong choice  barbara perhaps not  cusins desperately perplexed you hear  barbara father do you love nobody  undershaft i love my best friend  lady britomart and who is that pray  undershaft my bravest enemy that is the man who keeps me up to the mark  cusins you know the creature is really a sort of poet in his way suppose he is a great man after all  undershaft suppose you stop talking and make up your mind my young friend  cusins but you are driving me against my nature i hate war  undershaft hatred is the cowards revenge for being intimidated dare you make war on war here are the means my friend mr lomax is sitting on them  lomax springing up oh i say you dont mean that this thing is loaded do you my ownest come off it  sarah sitting placidly on the shell if i am to be blown up the more thoroughly it is done the better dont fuss cholly  lomax to undershaft strongly remonstrant your own daughter you know  undershaft so i see to cusins well my friend may we expect you here at six tomorrow morning  cusins firmly not on any account i will see the whole establishment blown up with its own dynamite before i will get up at five my hours are healthy rational hours eleven to five  undershaft come when you please before a week you will come at six and stay until i turn you out for the sake of your health calling bilton he turns to lady britomart who rises my dear let us leave these two young people to themselves for a moment bilton comes from the shed i am going to take you through the gun cotton shed  bilton barring the way you cant take anything explosive in here sir  lady britomart what do you mean are you alluding to me  bilton unmoved no maam mr undershaft has the other gentlemans matches in his pocket  lady britomart abruptly oh i beg your pardon she goes into the shed  undershaft quite right bilton quite right here you are he gives bilton the box of matches come stephen come charles bring sarah he passes into the shed  bilton opens the box and deliberately drops the matches into the firebucket  lomax oh i say bilton stolidly hands him the empty box infernal nonsense pure scientific ignorance he goes in  sarah am i all right bilton  bilton youll have to put on list slippers miss thats all weve got em inside she goes in  stephen very seriously to cusins dolly old fellow think think before you decide do you feel that you are a sufficiently practical man it is a huge undertaking an enormous responsibility all this mass of business will be greek to you  cusins oh i think it will be much less difficult than greek  stephen well i just want to say this before i leave you to yourselves dont let anything i have said about right and wrong prejudice you against this great chance in life i have satisfied myself that the business is one of the highest character and a credit to our country emotionally i am very proud of my father i unable to proceed he presses cusins hand and goes hastily into the shed followed by bilton  barbara and cusins left alone together look at one another silently  cusins barbara i am going to accept this offer  barbara i thought you would  cusins you understand dont you that i had to decide without consulting you if i had thrown the burden of the choice on you you would sooner or later have despised me for it  barbara yes i did not want you to sell your soul for me any more than for this inheritance  cusins it is not the sale of my soul that troubles me i have sold it too often to care about that i have sold it for a professorship i have sold it for an income i have sold it to escape being imprisoned for refusing to pay taxes for hangmens ropes and unjust wars and things that i abhor what is all human conduct but the daily and hourly sale of our souls for trifles what i am now selling it for is neither money nor position nor comfort but for reality and for power  barbara you know that you will have no power and that he has none  cusins i know it is not for myself alone i want to make power for the world  barbara i want to make power for the world too but it must be spiritual power  cusins i think all power is spiritual these cannons will not go off by themselves i have tried to make spiritual power by teaching greek but the world can never be really touched by a dead language and a dead civilization the people must have power and the people cannot have greek now the power that is made here can be wielded by all men  barbara power to burn womens houses down and kill their sons and tear their husbands to pieces  cusins you cannot have power for good without having power for evil too even mothers milk nourishes murderers as well as heroes this power which only tears mens bodies to pieces has never been so horribly abused as the intellectual power the imaginative power the poetic religious power that can enslave mens souls as a teacher of greek i gave the intellectual man weapons against the common man i now want to give the common man weapons against the intellectual man i love the common people i want to arm them against the lawyer the doctor the priest the literary man the professor the artist and the politician who once in authority are the most dangerous disastrous and tyrannical of all the fools rascals and impostors i want a democratic power strong enough to force the intellectual oligarchy to use its genius for the general good or else perish  barbara is there no higher power than that pointing to the shell  cusins yes but that power can destroy the higher powers just as a tiger can destroy a man therefore man must master that power first i admitted this when the turks and greeks were last at war my best pupil went out to fight for hellas my parting gift to him was not a copy of platos republic but a revolver and a hundred undershaft cartridges the blood of every turk he shotif he shot anyis on my head as well as on undershafts that act committed me to this place for ever your fathers challenge has beaten me dare i make war on war i dare i must i will and now is it all over between us  barbara touched by his evident dread of her answer silly baby dolly how could it be  cusins overjoyed then youyouyou oh for my drum he flourishes imaginary drumsticks  barbara angered by his levity take care dolly take care oh if only i could get away from you and from father and from it all if i could have the wings of a dove and fly away to heaven  cusins and leave me  barbara yes you and all the other naughty mischievous children of men but i cant i was happy in the salvation army for a moment i escaped from the world into a paradise of enthusiasm and prayer and soul saving but the moment our money ran short it all came back to bodger it was he who saved our people he and the prince of darkness my papa undershaft and bodger their hands stretch everywhere when we feed a starving fellow creature it is with their bread because there is no other bread when we tend the sick it is in the hospitals they endow if we turn from the churches they build we must kneel on the stones of the streets they pave as long as that lasts there is no getting away from them turning our backs on bodger and undershaft is turning our backs on life  cusins i thought you were determined to turn your back on the wicked side of life  barbara there is no wicked side life is all one and i never wanted to shirk my share in whatever evil must be endured whether it be sin or suffering i wish i could cure you of middleclass ideas dolly  cusins gasping middle cl a snub a social snub to me from the daughter of a foundling  barbara that is why i have no class dolly i come straight out of the heart of the whole people if i were middleclass i should turn my back on my fathers business and we should both live in an artistic drawingroom with you reading the reviews in one corner and i in the other at the piano playing schumann both very superior persons and neither of us a bit of use sooner than that i would sweep out the guncotton shed or be one of bodgers barmaids do you know what would have happened if you had refused papas offer  cusins i wonder  barbara i should have given you up and married the man who accepted it after all my dear old mother has more sense than any of you i felt like her when i saw this placefelt that i must have itthat never never never could i let it go only she thought it was the houses and the kitchen ranges and the linen and china when it was really all the human souls to be saved not weak souls in starved bodies crying with gratitude or a scrap of bread and treacle but fullfed quarrelsome snobbish uppish creatures all standing on their little rights and dignities and thinking that my father ought to be greatly obliged to them for making so much money for himand so he ought that is where salvation is really wanted my father shall never throw it in my teeth again that my converts were bribed with bread she is transfigured i have got rid of the bribe of bread i have got rid of the bribe of heaven let gods work be done for its own sake the work he had to create us to do because it cannot be done by living men and women when i die let him be in my debt not i in his and let me forgive him as becomes a woman of my rank  cusins then the way of life lies through the factory of death  barbara yes through the raising of hell to heaven and of man to god through the unveiling of an eternal light in the valley of the shadow seizing him with both hands oh did you think my courage would never come back did you believe that i was a deserter that i who have stood in the streets and taken my people to my heart and talked of the holiest and greatest things with them could ever turn back and chatter foolishly to fashionable people about nothing in a drawingroom never never never never major barbara will die with the colors oh and i have my dear little dolly boy still and he has found me my place and my work glory hallelujah she kisses him  cusins my dearest consider my delicate health i cannot stand as much happiness as you can  barbara yes it is not easy work being in love with me is it but its good for you she runs to the shed and calls childlike mamma mamma bilton comes out of the shed followed by undershaft i want mamma  undershaft she is taking off her list slippers dear he passes on to cusins well what does she say  cusins she has gone right up into the skies  lady britomart coming from the shed and stopping on the steps obstructing sarah who follows with lomax barbara clutches like a baby at her mothers skirt barbara when will you learn to be independent and to act and think for yourself i know as well as possible what that cry of mamma mamma means always running to me  sarah touching lady britomarts ribs with her finger tips and imitating a bicycle horn pip pip  lady britomart highly indignant how dare you say pip pip to me sarah you are both very naughty children what do you want barbara  barbara i want a house in the village to live in with dolly dragging at the skirt come and tell me which one to take  undershaft to cusins six oclock tomorrow morning my young friend
