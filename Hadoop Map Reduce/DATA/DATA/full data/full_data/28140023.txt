28140023	the heritage of the desert  a novel  by zane grey     i the sign of the sunset   but the mans almost dead  the words stung john hares fainting spirit into life he opened his eyes the desert still stretched before him the appalling thing that had overpowered him with its deceiving purple distance near by stood a sombre group of men  leave him here said one addressing a graybearded giant hes the fellow sent into southern utah to spy out the cattle thieves hes all but dead denes outlaws are after him dont cross dene  the stately answer might have come from a scottish covenanter or a follower of cromwell  martin cole i will not go a hairsbreadth out of my way for dene or any other man you forget your religion i see my duty to god  yes august naab i know replied the little man bitterly you would cast the scriptures in my teeth and liken this man to one who went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves but ive suffered enough at the hands of dene  the formal speech the biblical references recalled to the reviving hare that he was still in the land of the mormons as he lay there the strange words of the mormons linked the hard experience of the last few days with the stern reality of the present  martin cole i hold to the spirit of our fathers replied naab like one reading from the old testament they came into this desert land to worship and multiply in peace they conquered the desert they prospered with the years that brought settlers cattlemen sheepherders all hostile to their religion and their livelihood nor did they ever fail to succor the sick and unfortunate what are our toils and perils compared to theirs why should we forsake the path of duty and turn from mercy because of a cutthroat outlaw i like not the sign of the times but i am a mormon i trust in god  august naab i am a mormon too returned cole but my hands are stained with blood soon yours will be if you keep your waterholes and your cattle yes i know youre strong stronger than any of us far off in your desert oasis hemmed in by walls cut off by canyons guarded by your navajo friends but holderness is creeping slowly on you hell ignore your water rights and drive your stock soon dene will steal cattle under your very eyes dont make them enemies  i cant pass by this helpless man rolled out august naabs sonorous voice  suddenly with livid face and shaking hand cole pointed westward there dene and his band see under the red wall see the dust not ten miles away see them  the desert gray in the foreground purple in the distance sloped to the west eyes keen as those of hawks searched the waste and followed the red mountain rampart which sheer in bold height and processional in its craggy sweep shut out the north far away little puffs of dust rose above the white sage and creeping specks moved at a snails pace  see them ah then look august naab look in the heavens above for my prophecy cried cole fanatically the red sunsetthe sign of the timesblood  a broad bar of dense black shut out the april sky except in the extreme west where a strip of pale blue formed background for several clouds of striking color and shape they alone in all that expanse were dyed in the deserts sunset crimson the largest projected from behind the dark cloudbank in the shape of a huge fist and the others small and round floated below to cole it seemed a giant hand clutching with inexorable strength a bleeding heart his terror spread to his companions as they stared  then as light surrendered to shade the sinister color faded the tracing of the closed hand softened flush and glow paled leaving the sky purple as if mirroring the desert floor one golden shaft shot up to be blotted out by sudden darkening change and the sun had set  that may be gods will said august naab so be it martin cole take your men and go  there was a word half oath half prayer and then rattle of stirrups the creak of saddles and clink of spurs followed by the driving rush of fiery horses cole and his men disappeared in a pall of yellow dust  a wan smile lightened john hares face as he spoke weakly i fear yourgenerous actcant save me may bring you harm id rather you left meseeing you have women in your party  dont try to talk yet said august naab youre faint heredrink he stooped to hare who was leaning against a sagebush and held a flask to his lips rising he called to his men make camp sons weve an hour before the outlaws come up and if they dont go round the sanddune well have longer  hares flagging senses rallied and he forgot himself in wonder while the bustle went on unhitching of wagonteams hobbling and feeding of horses unpacking of campsupplies naab appeared to be lost in deep meditation or prayer not once did he glance backward over the trail on which peril was fast approaching his gaze was fastened on a ridge to the east where desert line fringed by stunted cedars met the paleblue sky and for a long time he neither spoke nor stirred at length he turned to the campfire he raked out red coals and placed the iron pots in position by way of assistance to the women who were preparing the evening meal  a cool wind blew in from the desert rustling the sage sifting the sand fanning the dull coals to burning opals twilight failed and night fell one by one great stars shone out cold and bright from the zone of blackness surrounding the camp burst the short bark the hungry whine the longdrawnout wail of desert wolves  supper sons called naab as he replenished the fire with an armful of greasewood  naabs sons had his stature though not his bulk they were wiry rangy men young yet somehow old the desert had multiplied their years hare could not have told one face from another the bronze skin and steel eye and hard line of each were so alike the women one middleaged the others young were of comely serious aspect  mescal called the mormon  a slender girl slipped from one of the covered wagons she was dark supple straight as an indian  august naab dropped to his knees and as the members of his family bowed their heads he extended his hands over them and over the food laid on the ground  lord we kneel in humble thanksgiving bless this food to our use strengthen us guide us keep us as thou hast in the past bless this stranger within our gates help us to help him teach us thy ways o lordamen  hare found himself flushing and thrilling found himself unable to control a painful binding in his throat in fortyeight hours he had learned to hate the mormons unutterably here in the presence of this austere man he felt that hatred wrenched from his heart and in its place stirred something warm and living he was glad for if he had to die as he believed either from the deed of evil men or from this last struggle of his wasted body he did not want to die in bitterness that simple prayer recalled the home he had long since left in connecticut and the time when he used to tease his sister and anger his father and hurt his mother while grace was being said at the breakfasttable now he was alone in the world sick and dependent upon the kindness of these strangers but they were really friendsit was a wonderful thought  mescal wait on the stranger said august naab and the girl knelt beside him tendering meat and drink his nerveless fingers refused to hold the cup and she put it to his lips while he drank hot coffee revived him he ate and grew stronger and readily began to talk when the mormon asked for his story  there isnt much to tell my name is hare i am twentyfour my parents are dead i came west because the doctors said i couldnt live in the east at first i got better but my money gave out and work became a necessity i tramped from place to place ending up ill in salt lake city people were kind to me there some one got me a job with a big cattle company and sent me to marysvale southward over the bleak plains it was cold i was ill when i reached lund before i even knew what my duties were for at lund i was to begin workmen called me a spy a fellow named chance threatened me an innkeeper led me out the back way gave me bread and water and said take this road to bane its sixteen miles if you make it some onell give you a lift north i walked all night and all the next day then i wandered on till i dropped here where you found me  you missed the road to bane said naab this is the trail to white sage its a trail of sand and stone that leaves no tracks a lucky thing for you dene wasnt in lund while you were thereelse you wouldnt be here he hasnt seen you and he cant be certain of your trail maybe he rode to bane but still we may find a way  one of his sons whistled low causing naab to rise slowly to peer into the darkness to listen intently  here get up he said extending a hand to hare pretty shaky eh can you walk give me a holdthere mescal come the slender girl obeyed gliding noiselessly like a shadow take his arm between them they led hare to a jumble of stones on the outer edge of the circle of light  it wouldnt do to hide continued naab lowering his voice to a swift whisper that might be fatal youre in sight from the campfire but indistinct byandby the outlaws will get here and if any of them prowl around close you and mescal must pretend to be sweethearts understand theyll pass by mormon lovemaking without a second look now lad courage mescal it may save his life  naab returned to the fire his shadow looming in gigantic proportions on the white canopy of a covered wagon fitful gusts of wind fretted the blaze it roared and crackled and sputtered now illuminating the still forms then enveloping them in fantastic obscurity hare shivered perhaps from the cold air perhaps from growing dread westward lay the desert an impenetrable black void in front the gloomy mountain wall lifted jagged peaks close to the stars to the right rose the ridge the rocks and stunted cedars of its summit standing in weird relief suddenly hares fugitive glance descried a dark object he watched intently as it moved and rose from behind the summit of the ridge to make a bold black figure silhouetted against the cold clearness of sky he saw it distinctly realized it was close and breathed hard as the windswept mane and tail the lean wild shape and single plume resolved themselves into the unmistakable outline of an indian mustang and rider  look he whispered to the girl see a mounted indian there on the ridgethere hes goneno i see him again but thats another look there are more he ceased in breathless suspense and stared fearfully at a line of mounted indians moving in single file over the ridge to become lost to view in the intervening blackness a faint rattling of gravel and the peculiar crack of unshod hoof on stone gave reality to that shadowy train  navajos said mescal  navajos he echoed i heard of them at lund desert hawks the men called them worse than piutes must we not alarm the menyouarent you afraid  no  but they are hostile  not to him she pointed at the stalwart figure standing against the firelight  ah i remember the man cole spoke of friendly navajos they must be close by what does it mean  im not sure i think they are out there in the cedars waiting  waiting for what  perhaps for a signal  then they were expected  i dont know i only guess we used to ride often to white sage and lund now we go seldom and when we do there seem to be navajos near the camp at night and riding the ridges by day i believe father naab knows  your fathers risking much for me hes good i wish i could show my gratitude  i call him father naab but he is not my father  a niece or granddaughter then  im no relation father naab raised me in his family my mother was a navajo my father a spaniard  why exclaimed hare when you came out of the wagon i took you for an indian girl but the moment you spokeyou talk so wellno one would dream  mormons are well educated and teach the children they raise she said as he paused in embarrassment  he wanted to ask if she were a mormon by religion but the question seemed curious and unnecessary his interest was aroused he realized suddenly that he had found pleasure in her low voice it was new and strange unlike any womans voice he had ever heard and he regarded her closely he had only time for a glance at her straight cleancut profile when she turned startled eyes on him eyes black as the night and they were eyes that looked through and beyond him she held up a hand slowly bent toward the wind and whispered  listen  hare heard nothing save the barking of coyotes and the breeze in the sage he saw however the men rise from round the campfire to face the north and the women climb into the wagon and close the canvas flaps and he prepared himself with what fortitude he could command for the approach of the outlaws he waited straining to catch a sound his heart throbbed audibly like a muffled drum and for an endless moment his ears seemed deadened to aught else then a stronger puff of wind whipped in banging the rhythmic beat of flying hoofs suspense ended hare felt the easing of a weight upon him whatever was to be his fate it would be soon decided the sound grew into a clattering roar a black mass hurled itself over the border of opaque circle plunged into the light and halted  august naab deliberately threw a bundle of greasewood upon the campfire a blaze leaped up sending abroad a red flare who comes he called  friends mormons friends was the answer  get downfriendsand come to the fire  three horsemen advanced to the foreground others a troop of eight or ten remained in the shadow a silent group  hare sank back against the stone he knew the foremost of those horsemen though he had never seen him  dene whispered mescal and confirmed his instinctive fear  hare was nervously alive to the handsome presence of the outlaw glimpses that he had caught of bad men returned vividly as he noted the cleanshaven face the youthful supple body the cool careless mien denes eyes glittered as he pulled off his gauntlets and beat the sand out of them and but for that quick fierce glance his leisurely friendly manner would have disarmed suspicion  are you the mormon naab he queried  august naab i am  dry camp eh hosses tired i reckon shore its a sandy trail wheres the rest of you fellers  cole and his men were in a hurry to make white sage tonight they were travelling light ive heavy wagons  naab i reckon you shore wouldnt tell a lie  i have never lied  heerd of a young feller thet was in lundpale chaplunger wed call him back west  i heard that he had been mistaken for a spy at lund and had fled toward bane  hadnt seen nothin of him this side of lund  no  seen any navvies  yes  the outlaw stared hard at him apparently he was about to speak of the navajos for his quick uplift of head at naabs blunt affirmative suggested the impulse but he checked himself and slowly drew on his gloves  naab im shore comin to visit you some day never been over thet range heerd you hed fine water fine cattle an say i seen thet little navajo girl you have an i wouldnt mind seein her again  august naab kicked the fire into brighter blaze yes fine range he presently replied his gaze fixed on dene fine water fine cattle fine browse ive a fine graveyard too thirty graves and not one a womans fine place for graves the canyon country you dont have to dig theres one grave the indians never named its three thousand feet deep  thet must be in hell replied dene with a smile ignoring the covert meaning he leisurely surveyed naabs four sons the wagons and horses till his eye fell upon hare and mescal with that he swung in his saddle as if to dismount  i shore want a look around  get down get down returned the mormon the deep voice unwelcoming vibrant with an odd ring would have struck a less suspicious man than dene the outlaw wrung his leg back over the pommel sagged in the saddle and appeared to be pondering the question plainly he was uncertain of his ground but his indecision was brief  twospot you look em over he ordered  the third horseman dismounted and went toward the wagons  hare watching this scene became conscious that his fear had intensified with the recognition of twospot as chance the outlaw whom he would not soon forget in his excitement he moved against mescal and felt her trembling violently  are you afraid he whispered  yes of dene  the outlaw rummaged in one of the wagons pulled aside the canvas flaps of the other laughed harshly and then with clinking spurs tramped through the camp kicking the beds overturning a pile of saddles and making disorder generally till he spied the couple sitting on the stone in the shadow  as the outlaw lurched that way hare with a start of recollection took mescal in his arms and leaned his head against hers he felt one of her hands lightly brush his shoulder and rest there trembling  shuffling footsteps scraped the sand sounded nearer and nearer slowed and paused  sparkin dead to the world ham haw haw  the coarse laugh gave place to moving footsteps the rattling clink of stirrup and spur mingled with the restless stamp of horse chance had mounted denes voice drawled out goodbye naab i shore will see you all some day the heavy thuds of many hoofs evened into a roar that diminished as it rushed away  in unutterable relief hare realized his deliverance he tried to rise but power of movement had gone from him  he was fainting yet his sensations were singularly acute mescals hand dropped from his shoulder her cheek that had been cold against his grew hot she quivered through all her slender length confusion claimed his senses gratitude and hope flooded his soul something sweet and beautiful the touch of this desert girl rioted in his blood his heart swelled in exquisite agony then he was whirling in darkness and he knew no more     ii white sage   the night was as a blank to hare the morning like a drifting of hazy clouds before his eyes he felt himself moving and when he awakened clearly to consciousness he lay upon a couch on the vinecovered porch of a cottage he saw august naab open a garden gate to admit martin cole they met as friends no trace of scorn marred augusts greeting and martin was not the same man who had shown fear on the desert his welcome was one of respectful regard for his superior  elder i heard you were safe in he said fervently we fearedi know not what i was distressed till i got the news of your arrival hows the young man  hes very ill but while theres life theres hope  will the bishop administer to him  gladly if the young mans willing come lets go in  wait august said cole did you know your son snap was in the village  my son here august naab betrayed anxiety i left him home with work he shouldnt have come isis he  hes drinking and in an ugly mood it seems he traded horses with jeff larsen and got the worst of the deal theres pretty sure to be a fight  he always hated larsen  small wonder larsen is mean hes as bad as weve got and thats saying a good deal snap has done worse things than fight with larsen hes doing a worse thing now augusthes too friendly with dene  ive heardive heard it before but martin what can i do  do god knows what can any of us do times have changed august dene is here in white sage free welcome in many homes some of our neighbors perhaps men we trust are secret members of this rustlers band  youre right cole there are mormons who are cattlethieves to my eternal shame i confess it under cover of night they ride with dene and here in our midst they meet him in easy tolerance driven from montana he comes here to corrupt our young men gods mercy  august some of our young men need no one to corrupt them dene had no great task to win them he rode in here with a few outlaws and now he has a strong band weve got to face it we havent any law but he can be killed some one must kill him yet bad as dene is he doesnt threaten our living as holderness does dene steals a few cattle kills a man here and there holderness reaches out and takes our springs because weve no law to stop him he steals the blood of our lifewaterwatergods gift to the desert some one must kill holderness too  martin this lust to kill is a fearful thing come in you must pray with the bishop  no its not prayer i need elder replied cole stubbornly im still a good mormon what i want is the stock ive lost and my fields green again  august naab had no answer for his friend a very old man with snowwhite hair and beard came out on the porch  bishop brother martin is railing again said naab as cole bared his head  martin my son unbosom thyself rejoined the bishop  black doubt and no light said cole despondently im of the younger generation of mormons and faith is harder for me i see signs you cant see ive had trials hard to bear i was rich in cattle sheep and water these gentiles this rancher holderness and this outlaw dene have driven my cattle killed my sheep piped my water off my fields i dont like the present we are no longer in the old days our young men are drifting away and the few who return come with ideas opposed to mormonism our girls and boys are growing up influenced by the gentiles among us they intermarry and thats a deathblow to our creed  martin cast out this poison from your heart return to your faith the millennium will come christ will reign on earth again the ten tribes of israel will be restored the book of mormon is the word of god the creed will live we may suffer here and die but our spirits will go marching on and the city of zion will be builded over our graves  cole held up his hands in a meekness that signified hope if not faith  august naab bent over hare i would like to have the bishop administer to you he said  whats that asked hare  a mormon custom the laying on of hands we know its efficacy in trouble and illness a bishop of the mormon church has the gift of tongues of prophecy of revelation of healing let him administer to you it entails no obligation accept it as a prayer  im willing replied the young man  thereupon naab spoke a few low words to some one through the open door voices ceased soft footsteps sounded without women crossed the threshold followed by tall young men and rosychecked girls and roundeyed children a whitehaired old woman came forward with solemn dignity she carried a silver bowl which she held for the bishop as he stood close by hares couch the bishop put his hands into the bowl anointing them with fragrant oil then he placed them on the young mans head and offered up a brief prayer beautiful in its simplicity and tremulous utterance  the ceremony ended the onlookers came forward with pleasant words on their lips pleasant smiles on their faces the children filed by his couch bashful yet sympathetic the women murmured the young men grasped his hand mescal flitted by with downcast eye with shy smile but no word  your fever is gone said august naab with his hand on hares cheek  it comes and goes suddenly replied hare i feel better now only im oppressed i cant breathe freely i want air and im hungry  mother mary the lads hungry judith esther where are your wits help your mother mescal wait on him see to his comfort  mescal brought a little table and a pillow and the other girls soon followed with food and drink then they hovered about absorbed in caring for him  they said i fell among thieves mused hare when he was once more alone ive fallen among saints as well he felt that he could never repay this august naab if only i might live he ejaculated how restful was this cottage garden the green sward was a balm to his eyes flowers new to him though of familiar springtime hue lifted fresh faces everywhere fruittrees with branches intermingling blended the white and pink of blossoms there was the soft laughter of children in the garden strange birds darted among the trees their notes were new but their song was the old delicious monotonethe joy of living and love of spring a greenbowered irrigation ditch led by the porch and unseen water flowed gently with gurgle and tinkle with music in its hurry innumerable bees murmured amid the blossoms  hare fell asleep upon returning drowsily to consciousness he caught through halfopen eyes the gleam of level shafts of gold sunlight low down in the trees then he felt himself being carried into the house to be laid upon a bed some one gently unbuttoned his shirt at the neck removed his shoes and covered him with a blanket before he had fully awakened he was left alone and quiet settled over the house a languorous sense of ease and rest lulled him to sleep again in another moment it seemed to him he was awake bright daylight streamed through the window and a morning breeze stirred the faded curtain  the drag in his breathing which was always a forerunner of a coughingspell warned him now he put on coat and shoes and went outside where his cough attacked him had its sway and left him  goodmorning sang out august naabs cheery voice sixteen hours of sleep my lad  i did sleep didnt i no wonder i feel well this morning a peculiarity of my illness is that one day im down the next day up  with the goodness of god my lad well gradually increase the days up go in to breakfast afterward i want to talk to you thisll be a busy day for me shoeing the horses and packing supplies i want to start for home tomorrow  hare pondered over naabs words while he ate the suggestion in them implying a relation to his future made him wonder if the good mormon intended to take him to his desert home he hoped so and warmed anew to this friend but he had no enthusiasm for himself his future seemed hopeless  naab was waiting for him on the porch and drew him away from the cottage down the path toward the gate  i want you to go home with me  youre kindim only a sort of beggarive no strength left to work my way ill gothough its only to die  i havent the gift of revelationyet somehow i see that you wont die of this illness you will come home with me its a beautiful place my navajo oasis the indians call it the garden of eschtah if you can get well anywhere itll be there  ill go but i ought not what can i do for you  no man can ever tell what he may do for another the time may comewell john is it settled he offered his huge broad hand  its settledi hare faltered as he put his hand in naabs the mormons grip straightened his frame and braced him strength and simplicity flowed from the giants toilhardened palm hare swallowed his thanks along with his emotion and for what he had intended to say he substituted no one ever called me john i dont know the name call me jack  very well jack and now lets see youll need some things from the store can you come with me its not far  surely and now what i need most is a razor to scrape the alkali and stubble off my face  the wide street bordered by cottages peeping out of green and white orchards stretched in a straight line to the base of the ascent which led up to the pink cliffs a green square enclosed a gray church a schoolhouse and public hall farther down the main thoroughfare were several weatherboarded whitewashed stores two dusty men were riding along one on each side of the wildest most vicious little horse hare had ever seen it reared and bucked and kicked trying to escape from two lassoes in front of the largest store were a number of mustangs all standing free with bridles thrown over their heads and trailing on the ground the loungers leaning against the railing and about the doors were lank brown men very like naabs sons some wore sheepskin chaps some blue overalls all wore boots and spurs wide soft hats and in their belts far to the back hung large colts revolvers  well buy what you need just as if you expected to ride the ranges for me tomorrow said naab the first thing we ask a new man is can he ride next can he shoot  i could ride before i got so weak ive never handled a revolver but i can shoot a rifle never shot at anything except targets and it seemed to come natural for me to hit them  good well show you some targetslions bears deer cats wolves theres a fine fortyfour winchester here that my friend abe has been trying to sell it has a long barrel and weighs eight pounds our desert riders like the light carbines that go easy on a saddle most of the mustangs arent weightcarriers this rifle has a great range ive shot it and its just the gun for you to use on wolves and coyotes youll need a colt and a saddle too  bytheway he went on as they mounted the store steps heres the kind of money we use in this country he handed hare a slip of blue paper a written check for a sum of money signed but without register of bank or name of firm we dont use real money he added theres very little coin or currency in southern utah most of the gentiles lately come in have money and some of us mormons have a bag or two of gold but scarcely any of it gets into circulation we use these checks which go from man to man sometimes for six months the roundup of a check means sheep cattle horses grain merchandise or labor every man gets his real moneys value without paying out an actual cent  such a system at least means honest men said hare laughing his surprise  they went into a wide door to tread a maze of narrow aisles between boxes and barrels stacks of canned vegetables and piles of harness and dry goods they entered an open space where several men leaned on a counter  hello abe said naab seen anything of snap  hello august yes snaps inside sos holderness says he rode in off the range on purpose to see you abe designated an open doorway from which issued loud voices hare glanced into a long narrow room full of smoke and the fumes of rum through the haze he made out a crowd of men at a rude bar abe went to the door and called out hey snap your dad wants you holderness heres august naab  a man staggered up the few steps leading to the store and swayed in his long face had a hawkish cast and it was gray not with age but with the sagegray of the desert his eyes were of the same hue cold yet burning with little fiery flecks in their depths he appeared short of stature because of a curvature of the spine but straightened up he would have been tall he wore a blue flannel shirt and blue overalls round his lean hips was a belt holding two colts revolvers their heavy dark butts projecting outward and he had on high boots with long cruel spurs  howdy father he said  im packing today returned august naab we ride out tomorrow i need your help  alll right when i get my pinto from larsen  never mind larsen if he got the better of you let the matter drop  jeff got my pinto for a mustang with three legs if i hadnt been drunk id never have traded so im looking for jeff  he bit out the last words with a peculiar snap of his long teeth a circumstance which caused hare instantly to associate the savage clicking with the name he had heard given this man august naab looked at him with gloomy eyes and stern shut mouth an expression of righteous anger helplessness and grief combined the look of a man to whom obstacles had been nothing at last confronted with crowning defeat hare realized that this son was naabs firstborn bestloved a thorn in his side a black sheep  say father is that the spy you found on the trail snaps pale eyes gleamed on hare and the little flames seemed to darken and leap  this is john hare the young man i found but hes not a spy  you cant make any one believe that hes down as a spy denes spy his names gone over the ranges as a counter of unbranded stock dene has named him and dene has marked him dont take him home as youve taken so many sick and hunted men before whats the good of it you never made a mormon of one of them yet dont take himunless you want another grave for your cemetery ha ha  hare recoiled with a shock snap naab swayed to the door and stepped down all the time with his face over his shoulder his baleful glance on hare then the blue haze swallowed him  the several loungers went out august engaged the storekeeper in conversation introducing hare and explaining their wants they inspected the various needs of a rangerider selecting in the end not the few suggested by hare but the many chosen by naab the last purchase was the rifle naab had talked about it was a beautiful weapon finely polished and carved entirely out of place among the plain coarsesighted and coarsestocked guns in the rack  never had a chance to sell it said abe too long and heavy for the riders ill let it go cheap half price and the cartridges also two thousand  taken replied naab quickly with a satisfaction which showed he liked a bargain  august you must be going to shoot some queried abe something bigger than rabbits and coyotes its about timeeven if you are an elder we mormons must he broke off continuing in a low tone heres holderness now  hare wheeled with the interest that had gathered with the reiteration of this mans name a newcomer stooped to get in the door he outtopped even naab in height and was a superb blondbearded man striding with the spring of a mountaineer  goodday to you naab he said is this the young fellow you picked up  yes jack hare rejoined naab  well hare im holderness youll recall my name you were sent to lund by men interested in my ranges i expected to see you in lund but couldnt get over  hare met the proffered hand with his own and as he had recoiled from snap naab so now he received another shock different indeed but impelling in its power instinctive of some great portent hare was impressed by an indefinable subtlety a nameless distrust as colorless as the clear penetrating amber lightness of the eyes that bent upon him  holderness will you right the story about hare inquired naab  you mean about his being a spy well naab the truth is that was his job i advised against sending a man down here for that sort of work it wont do these mormons will steal each others cattle and theyve got to get rid of them so they wont have a man taking account of stock brands and all that if the mormons would stand for it the rustlers wouldnt ill take hare out to the ranch and give him work if he wants but hed do best to leave utah  thank you no replied hare decidedly  hes going with me said august naab  holderness accepted this with an almost imperceptible nod and he swept hare with eyes that searched and probed for latent possibilities it was the keen intelligence of a man who knew what development meant on the desert not in any sense an interest in the young man at present then he turned his back  hare feeling that holderness wished to talk with naab walked to the counter and began assorting his purchases but he could not help hearing what was said  lungs bad queried holderness  one of them replied naab  hes all in better send him out of the country hes got the name of denes spy and hell never get another on this desert dene will kill him this isnt good judgment naab to take him with you even your friends dont like it and it means trouble for you  weve settled it said naab coldly  well remember ive warned you ive tried to be friendly with you naab but you wont have it anyway ive wanted to see you lately to find out how we stand  what do you mean  how we stand on several thingsto begin with there mescal  you asked me several times for mescal and i said no  but i never said id marry her now i want her and i will marry her  no rejoined naab adding brevity to his coldness  why not demanded holderness oh well i cant take that as an insult i know theres not enough money in utah to get a girl away from a mormon about the offer for the waterrightshow do we stand ill give you ten thousand dollars for the rights to seeping springs and silver cup  ten thousand ejaculated naab holderness i wouldnt take a hundred thousand you might as well ask to buy my home my stock my range twenty years of toil for ten thousand dollars  you refuse all right i think ive made you a fair proposition said holderness in a smooth quick tone the land is owned by the government and though your ranges are across the arizona line they really figure as utah land my companys spending big money and the government wont let you have a monopoly no one man can control the watersupply of a hundred miles of range times are changing you want to see that you ought to protect yourself before its too late  holderness this is a desert no men save mormons could ever have made it habitable the government scarcely knows of its existence itll be fifty years before man can come in here to take our water  why cant he the water doesnt belong to any one why cant he  because of the unwritten law of the desert no mormon would refuse you or your horse a drink or even a reasonable supply for your stock but you cant come in here and take our water for your own use to supplant us to parch our stock why even an indian respects desert law  bah im not a mormon or an indian im a cattleman its plain business with me once more i make you the offer  naab scorned to reply the men faced each other for a silent moment their glances scintillating then holderness whirled on his heel jostling into hare  get out of my way said the rancher in the disgust of intense irritation he swung his arm and his open hand sent hare reeling against the counter  jack said naab breathing hard holderness showed his real self today i always knew it yet i gave him the benefit of the doubt for him to strike you ive not the gift of revelation but i seelet us go  on the return to the bishops cottage naab did not speak once the transformation which had begun with the appearance of his drunken son had reached a climax of gloomy silence after the clash with holderness naab went directly to the bishop and presently the quavering voice of the old minister rose in prayer  hare dropped wearily into the chair on the porch and presently fell into a doze from which he awakened with a start naabs sons with martin cole and several other men were standing in the yard naab himself was gently crowding the women into the house when he got them all inside he closed the door and turned to cole  was it a fair fight  yes an even break they met in front of abes i saw the meeting neither was surprised they stood for a moment watching each other then they drewonly snap was quicker larsens gun went off as he fell that trick you taught snap saved his life again larsen was no slouch on the draw  wheres snap now  gone after his pinto he was sober said hed pack at once larsens friends are ugly snap said to tell you to hurry out of the village with young hare if you want to take him at all dene has ridden in he swears you wont take hare away  were all packed and ready to hitch up returned naab we could start at once only until dark id rather take chances here than out on the trail  snap said dene would ride right into the bishops after hare  no he wouldnt dare  father dave naab spoke sharply from where he stood high on a grassy bank heres dene now riding up with culver and some man i dont know theyre coming in denes jumped the fence look out  a clatter of hoofs and rattling of gravel preceded the appearance of a black horse in the garden path his rider bent low to dodge the vines of the arbor and reined in before the porch to slip out of the saddle with the agility of an indian it was dene dark smiling nonchalant  what do you seek in the house of a bishop challenged august naab planting his broad bulk square before hare  denes spy  what do you seek in the house of a bishop repeated naab  i shore want to see the young feller you lied to me about returned dene his smile slowly fading  no speech could be a lie to an outlaw  i want him you mormon preacher  you cant have him  ill shore get him  in one great stride naab confronted and towered over dene  the rustlers gaze shifted warily from naab to the quiet mormons and back again then his right hand quivered and shot downward naabs act was even quicker a colt gleamed and whirled to the grass and the outlaw cried as his arm cracked in the mormons grasp  dave naab leaped off the bank directly in front of denes approaching companions and faced them alert and silent his hand on his hip  august naab swung the outlaw against the porchpost and held him there with brawny arm  whelp of an evil breed he thundered shaking his gray head do you think we fear you and your gunsharp tricks look see this he released dene and stepped back with his hand before him suddenly it moved quicker than sight and a colt revolver lay in his outstretched palm he dropped it back into the holster let that teach you never to draw on me again he doubled his huge fist and shoved it before denes eyes one blow would crack your skull like an eggshell why dont i deal it because you mindless hellhound because theres a higher law than mansgods lawthou shalt not kill understand that if you can leave me and mine alone from this day now go  he pushed dene down the path into the arms of his companions  out with you said dave naab hurry get your horse hurry im not so particular about god as dad is     iii the trail of the red wall   after the departure of dene and his comrades naab decided to leave white sage at nightfall martin cole and the bishops sons tried to persuade him to remain urging that the trouble sure to come could be more safely met in the village naab however was obdurate unreasonably so cole said unless there were some good reason why he wished to strike the trail in the night when twilight closed in naab had his teams ready and the women shut in the canvascovered wagons hare was to ride in an open wagon one that naab had left at white sage to be loaded with grain when it grew so dark that objects were scarcely discernible a man vaulted the cottage fence  dave where are the boys asked naab  not so loud the boys are coming replied dave in a whisper dene is wild i guess you snapped a bone in his arm he swears hell kill us all but chance and the rest of the gang wont be in till late weve time to reach the coconina trail if we hustle  any news of snap  he rode out before sundown  three more forms emerged from the gloom  all right boys go ahead dave you lead  dave and george naab mounted their mustangs and rode through the gate the first wagon rolled after them its white dome gradually dissolving in the darkness the second one started then august naab stepped to his seat on the third with a low cluck to the team hare shut the gate and climbed over the tailboard of the wagon  a slight swish of weeds and grasses brushing the wheels was all the sound made in the cautious advance a bare field lay to the left to the right low roofs and sharp chimneys showed among the trees here and there lights twinkled no one hailed not a dog barked  presently the leaders turned into a road where the iron hoofs and wheels cracked and crunched the stones  hare thought he saw something in the deep shade of a line of poplartrees he peered closer and made out a motionless horse and rider just a shade blacker than the deepest gloom the next instant they vanished and the rapid clatter of hoofs down the road told hare his eyes had not deceived him  getup growled naab to his horses jack did you see that fellow  yes what was he doing there  watching the road hes one of denes scouts  will dene  one of naabs sons came trotting back think that was larsens pal he was laying in wait for snap  i thought he was a scout for dene replied august  maybe hes that too  likely enough hurry along and keep the gray team going lively theyve had a weeks rest  hare watched the glimmering lights of the village vanish one by one like jackolanterns the horses kept a steady even trot on into the huge windy hall of the desert night fleecy clouds veiled the stars yet transmitted a wan glow a chill crept over hare as he crawled under the blankets naab had spread for him his hand came into contact with a polished metal surface cold as ice it was his rifle naab had placed it under the blankets fingering the rifle hare found the spring opening on the right side of the breech and pressing it down he felt the round head of a cartridge naab had loaded the weapon he had placed it where hares hand must find it yet he had not spoken of it hare did not stop to reason with his first impulse without a word with silent insistence disregarding his shattered health august naab had given him a mans part to play the full meaning lifted hare out of his selfabasement once more he felt himself a man  hare soon yielded to the warmth of the blankets a drowsiness that he endeavored in vain to throw off smothered his thoughts sleep glued his eyelids tight they opened again some hours later for a moment he could not realize where he was then the whip of the cold wind across his face the woolly feel and smell of the blankets and finally the steady trot of horses and the clink of a chain swinging somewhere under him recalled the actuality of the night ride he wondered how many miles had been covered how the drivers knew the direction and kept the horses in the trail and whether the outlaws were in pursuit when naab stopped the team and climbing down walked back some rods to listen hare felt sure that dene was coming he listened too but the movements of the horses and the rattle of their harness were all the sounds he could hear naab returned to his seat the team started now no longer in a trot they were climbing after that hare fell into a slumber in which he could hear the slow grating whirr of wheels and when it ceased he awoke to raise himself and turn his ear to the back trail byandby he discovered that the black night had changed to gray dawn was not far distant he dozed and awakened to clear light a rosered horizon lay far below and to the eastward the intervening descent was like a rolling sea with leaguelong swells  glad you slept some was naabs greeting no sign of dene yet if we can get over the divide were safe thats coconina there fire mountain in navajo meaning its a plateau low and narrow at this end but it runs far to the east and rises nine thousand feet it forms a hundred miles of the north rim of the grand canyon were across the arizona line now  hare followed the sweep of the ridge that rose to the eastward but to his inexperienced eyes its appearance carried no sense of its noble proportions  dont form any ideas of distance and size yet a while said naab reading hares expression theyd only have to be made over as soon as you learn what light and air are in this country it looks only half a mile to the top of the divide well if we make it by midday were lucky there see a black spot over this way far under the red wall look sharp good thats holdernesss ranch its thirty miles from here nine mile valley heads in there once it belonged to martin cole holderness stole it and hes begun to range over the divide  the sun rose and warmed the chill air hare began to notice the increased height and abundance of the sagebrush which was darker in color the first cedartree stunted in growth dead at the top was the halfway mark up the ascent so naab said it was also the forerunner of other cedars which increased in number toward the summit at length hare tired of looking upward at the creeping white wagons closed his eyes the wheels crunched on the stones the horses heaved and labored naabs getup was the only spoken sound the sun beamed down warm then hot and the hours passed some unusual noise roused hare out of his lethargy the wagon was at a standstill naab stood on the seat with outstretched arm george and dave were close by their mustangs and snap naab mounted on a creamcolored pinto reined him under augusts arm and faced the valley below  maybe youll make them out said august i cant and ive watched those dustclouds for hours george cant decide either  hare looking at snap was attracted by the eyes from which his father and brothers expected so much if ever a human being had the eyes of a hawk snap naab had them the little brown flecks danced in clear pale yellow evidently snap had not located the perplexing dustclouds for his glance drifted suddenly the remarkable vibration of his pupils ceased and his glance grew fixed steely certain  thats a bunch of wild mustangs he said  hare gazed till his eyes hurt but could see neither clouds of dust nor moving objects no more was said the sons wheeled their mustangs and rode to the fore august naab reseated himself and took up the reins the ascent proceeded  but it proceeded leisurely with more frequent rests at the end of an hour the horses toiled over the last rise to the summit and entered a level forest of cedars in another hour they were descending gradually  here we are at the tanks said naab  hare saw that they had come up with the other wagons george naab was leading a team down a rocky declivity to a pool of yellow water the other boys were unharnessing and unsaddling  about three said naab looking at the sun were in good time jack get out and stretch yourself we camp here theres the coconina trail where the navajos go in after deer  it was not a pretty spot this little rockstrewn glade where the white hard trail forked with the road the yellow water with its green scum made hare sick the horses drank with loud gulps naab and his sons drank of it the women filled a pail and portioned it out in basins and washed their faces and hands with evident pleasure dave naab whistled as he wielded an axe vigorously on a cedar it came home to hare that the tension of the past night and morning had relaxed whether to attribute that fact to the distance from white sage or to the arrival at the waterhole he could not determine but the certainty was shown in augusts cheerful talk to the horses as he slipped bags of grain over their noses and in the subdued laughter of the women hare sent up an unspoken thanksgiving that these good mormons had apparently escaped from the dangers incurred for his sake he sat with his back to a cedar and watched the kindling of fires the deft manipulating of biscuit dough in a basin and the steaming of pots the generous meal was spread on a canvas cloth around which men and women sat crosslegged after the fashion of indians hare found it hard to adapt his long legs to the posture and he wondered how these men whose legs were longer than his could sit so easily it was the crown of a cheerful dinner after hours of anxiety and abstinence to have snap naab speak civilly to him and to see him bow his head meekly as his father asked the blessing snap ate as though he had utterly forgotten that he had recently killed a man to hear the others talk to him one would suppose that they had forgotten it also  all had finished eating except snap and dave naab when one of the mustangs neighed shrilly hare would not have noticed it but for looks exchanged among the men the glances were explained a few minutes later when a pattering of hoofs came from the cedar forest and a stream of mounted indians poured into the glade  the ugly glade became a place of color and action the navajos rode wiry wildlooking mustangs and drove ponies and burros carrying packs most of which consisted of deerhides each indian dismounted and unstrapping the blanket which had served as a saddle headed his mustang for the waterhole and gave him a slap then the hides and packs were slipped from the packtrain and soon the pool became a kicking splashing melee every cedartree circling the glade and every branch served as a peg for deer meat some of it was in the haunch the bulk in dark dried strips the indians laid their weapons aside every sagebush and low stone held a blanket a few of these blankets were of solid color most of them had bars of white and gray and red the last color predominating the mustangs and burros filed out among the cedars nipping at the sage and the scattered tufts of spare grass a group of fires sending up curling columns of blue smoke and surrounded by a circle of lean halfnaked bronzeskinned indians cooking and eating completed a picture which afforded hare the satisfying fulfilment of boyish dreams what a contrast to the memory of a campsite on the connecticut shore with boy friends telling tales in the glow of the fire and the wash of the waves on the beach  the sun sank low in the west sending gleams through the gnarled branches of the cedars and turning the green into gold at precisely the moment of sunset the mormon women broke into soft song which had the element of prayer and the lips of the men moved in silent harmony dave naab the only one who smoked removed his pipe for the moments grace to dying day  this simple ceremony over one of the boys put wood on the fire and snap took a jewsharp out of his pocket and began to extract doleful discords from it for which george kicked at him in disgust finally causing him to leave the circle and repair to the cedars where he twanged with supreme egotism  jack said august naab our friends the navajo chiefs scarbreast and eschtah are coming to visit us take no notice of them at first theyve great dignity and if you entered their hogans theyd sit for some moments before appearing to see you scarbreast is a warchief eschtah is the wise old chief of all the navajos on the painted desert it may interest you to know he is mescals grandfather some day ill tell you the story  hare tried very hard to appear unconscious when two tall indians stalked into the circle of mormons he set his eyes on the white heart of the campfire and waited for several minutes no one spoke or even moved the indians remained standing for a time then seated themselves presently august naab greeted them in the navajo language this was a signal for hare to use his eyes and ears another interval of silence followed before they began to talk hare could see only their blanketed shoulders and black heads  jack come round here said naab at length ive been telling them about you these indians do not like the whites except my own family i hope youll make friends with them  how do said the chief whom naab had called eschtah a stately keeneyed warrior despite his age  the next navajo greeted him with a guttural word this was a warrior whose name might well have been scarface for the signs of conflict were there it was a face like a bronze mask cast in the one expression of untamed desert fierceness  hare bowed to each and felt himself searched by burning eyes which were doubtful yet not unfriendly  shake finally said eschtah offering his hand  ugh exclaimed scarbreast extending a bare silverbraceleted arm  this sign of friendship pleased naab he wished to enlist the sympathies of the navajo chieftains in the young mans behalf in his ensuing speech which was plentifully emphasized with gestures he lapsed often into english saying weakno strong when he placed his hand on hares legs and bad when he touched the young mans chest concluding with the words sicksick  scarbreast regarded hare with great earnestness and when naab had finished he said chineagoping and rubbed his hand over his stomach  he says you need meatlots of deermeat translated naab  sick repeated eschtah whose english was intelligible he appeared to be casting about in his mind for additional words to express his knowledge of the white mans tongue and failing continued in navajo tohodenamoochamalocha  hare was nonplussed at the roar of laughter from the mormons august shook like a mountain in an earthquake  eschtah says you hurry get many squawsmany wives  other indians russetskinned warriors with black hair held close by bands round their foreheads joined the circle and sitting before the fire clasped their knees and talked hare listened awhile and then being fatigued he sought the cedartree where he had left his blankets the dry mat of needles made an odorous bed he placed a sack of grain for a pillow and doubling up one blanket to lie upon he pulled the others over him then he watched and listened the cedarwood burned with a clear flame and occasionally snapped out a red spark the voices of the navajos scarcely audible sounded toas and taassyllables he soon learned were characteristic and dominantin low deep murmurs it reminded hare of something that before had been pleasant to his ear then it came to mind a remembrance of mescals sweet voice and that recalled the kinship between her and the navajo chieftain he looked about endeavoring to find her in the ring of light for he felt in her a fascination akin to the charm of this twilight hour dusky forms passed to and fro under the trees the tinkle of bells on hobbled mustangs rang from the forest coyotes had begun their night quest with wild howls the campfire burned red and shadows flickered on the blanketed indians the wind now moaned now lulled in the cedars  hare lay back in his blankets and saw lustrous stars through the network of branches with their light in his face and the cold wind waving his hair on his brow he thought of the strangeness of it all of its remoteness from anything ever known to him before of its inexpressible wildness and a rush of emotion he failed wholly to stifle proved to him that he could have loved this life ifif he had not of late come to believe that he had not long to live still naabs influence exorcised even that one sad thought and he flung it from him in resentment  sleep did not come so readily he was not very well this night the flush of fever was on his cheek and the heat of feverish blood burned his body he raised himself and resolutely seeking for distraction once more stared at the campfire some time must have passed during his dreaming for only three persons were in sight naabs broad back was bowed and his head nodded across the fire in its ruddy flicker sat eschtah beside a slight dark figure at second glance hare recognized mescal surprise claimed him not more for her presence there than for the white band binding her smooth black tresses she had not worn such an ornament before that slender band lent her the one touch which made her a navajo was it worn in respect to her aged grandfather what did this mean for a girl reared with christian teaching was it desert blood hare had no answers for these questions they only increased the mystery and romance he fell asleep with the picture in his mind of eschtah and mescal sitting in the glow of the fire and of august naab nodding silently  jack jack wake up the words broke dully into his slumbers wearily he opened his eyes august naab bent over him shaking him gently  not so well this morning eh heres a cup of coffee were all packed and starting drink now and climb aboard we expect to make seeping springs tonight  hare rose presently and laboring into the wagon lay down on the sacks he had one of his blind sickening headaches the familiar lumbering of wheels began and the clanking of the wagonchain despite jar and jolt he dozed at times awakening to the scrape of the wheel on the leathern brake after a while the rapid descent of the wagon changed to a roll without the irritating rattle he saw a narrow valley on one side the green slowswelling cedar slope of the mountain on the other the perpendicular red wall with its pinnacles like spears against the sky all day this backward outlook was the same except that each time he opened aching eyes the valley had lengthened the red wall and green slope had come closer together in the distance by and by there came a halt the din of stamping horses and sharp commands the bustle and confusion of camp naab spoke kindly to him but he refused any food lay still and went to sleep  daylight brought him the relief of a clear head and cooled blood the camp had been pitched close under the red wall a lichencovered cliff wet with dripping water overhung a round pool a ditch led the water down the ridge to a pond cattle stood up to their knees drinking others lay on the yellow clay which was packed as hard as stone still others were climbing the ridge and passing down on both sides  you look as if you enjoyed that water remarked naab when hare presented himself at the fire well its good only a little salty seeping springs this is and its mine this ridge we call the saddle you see it dips between wall and mountain and separates two valleys this valley we go through today is where my cattle range at the other end is silver cup spring also mine keep your eyes open now my lad  how different was the beginning of this day the sky was as blue as the sea the valley snuggled deep in the embrace of wall and mountain hare took a place on the seat beside naab and faced the descent the line of navajos a graceful straggling curve of color on the trail led the way for the whitedomed wagons  naab pointed to a little calf lying half hidden under a bunch of sage thats what i hate to see theres a calf just born its mother has gone in for water wolves and lions range this valley we lose hundreds of calves that way  as far as hare could see red and white and black cattle speckled the valley  if not overstocked this range is the best in utah said naab i say utah but its really arizona the grand canyon seems to us mormons to mark the line theres enough browse here to feed a hundred thousand cattle but waters the thing in some seasons the springs go almost dry though silver cup holds her own well enough for my cattle  hare marked the tufts of grass lying far apart on the yellow earth evidently there was sustenance enough in every two feet of ground to support only one tuft  whats that he asked noting a rolling cloud of dust with black bobbing borders  wild mustangs replied naab there are perhaps five thousand on the mountain and they are getting to be a nuisance theyre almost as bad as sheep on the browse and i should tell you that if sheep pass over a range once the cattle will starve the mustangs are getting too plentiful there are also several bands of wild horses  whats the difference between wild horses and mustangs  i havent figured that out yet some say the spaniards left horses in here three hundred years ago wild they are wilder than any naturally wild animal that ever ran on four legs wait till you get a look at silvermane or whitefoot  what are they  wild stallions silvermane is an iron gray with a silver mane the most beautiful horse i ever saw whitefoots an old black shaggy demon with one white foot both stallions ought to be killed they fight my horses and lead off the mares i had a chance to shoot silvermane on the way over this trip but he looked so splendid that i just laid down my rifle  can they run asked hare eagerly with the eyes of a man who loved a horse  run whew just you wait till you see silvermane cover ground he can look over his shoulder at you and beat any horse in this country the navajos have given up catching him as a bad job whyhere jack quick get out your riflecoyotes  naab pulled on the reins and pointed to one side hare discerned three grayish sharpnosed beasts sneaking off in the sage and he reached back for the rifle naab whistled stopping the coyotes then hare shot the ball cut a wisp of dust above and beyond them they loped away into the sage  how that rifle spangs exclaimed naab its good to hear it jack you shot high thats the trouble with men who have never shot at game they cant hold low enough aim low lower than you want ha theres anotherthis sidehold ahead of him and low quicktoo high again  it was in this way that august and hare fell far behind the other wagons the nearer naab got to his home the more genial he became when he was not answering hares queries he was giving information of his own accord telling about the cattle and the range the mustangs the navajos and the desert naab liked to talk he had said he had not the gift of revelation but he certainly had the gift of tongues  the sun was in the west when they began to climb a ridge a short ascent and a long turn to the right brought them under a bold spur of the mountain which shut out the northwest camp had been pitched in a grove of trees of a species new to hare from under a bowlder gushed the sparkling spring a grateful sight and sound to desert travellers in a niche of the rock hung a silver cup  jack no man knows how old this cup is or anything about it we named the spring after itsilver cup the strange thing is that the cup has never been lost nor stolen butcould any desert man or outlaw or indian take it away after drinking here  the cup was nicked and battered bright on the sides mossgreen on the bottom when hare drank from it he understood  that evening there was rude merriment around the campfire snap naab buzzed on his jewsharp and sang he stirred some of the younger braves to dancing and they stamped and swung their arms singing hoyaheeyahowya as they moved in and out of the firelight  several of the braves showed great interest in snaps jewsharp and repeatedly asked him for it finally the mormon grudgingly lent it to a curious indian who in trying to play it went through such awkward motions and made such queer sounds that his companions set upon him and fought for possession of the instrument then snap becoming solicitous for its welfare jumped into the fray they tussled for it amid the clamor of a delighted circle snap passing from jest to earnest grew so strenuous in his efforts to regain the harp that he tossed the navajos about like shuttlecocks he got the harp and concealing it sought to break away but the braves laid hold upon him threw him to the ground and calmly sat astride him while they went through his pockets august naab roared his merriment and hare laughed till he cried the incident was as surprising to him as it was amusing these serious mormons and silent navajos were capable of mirth  hare would have stayed up as late as any of them but augusts saying to him get to bed tomorrow will be bad sent him off to his blankets where he was soon fast asleep morning found him well hungry eager to know what the day would bring  wait said august soberly  they rode out of the gray pocket in the ridge and began to climb hare had not noticed the rise till they were started and then as the horses climbed steadily he grew impatient at the monotonous ascent there was nothing to see frequently it seemed that they were soon to reach the summit but still it rose above them hare went back to his comfortable place on the sacks  now jack said august  hare gasped he saw a red world his eyes seemed bathed in blood red scaly ground bare of vegetation sloped down down far down to a vast irregular rent in the earth which zigzagged through the plain beneath to the right it bent its crooked way under the brow of a blacktimbered plateau to the left it straightened its angles to find a vshaped vent in the wall now uplifted to a mountain range beyond this earthriven line lay something vast and illimitable a farreaching vision of white wastes of purple plains of low mesas lost in distance it was the shimmering dustveiled desert  here we come to the real thing explained naab this is windy slope that black line is the grand canyon of arizona on the other side is the painted desert where the navajos live coconina mountain shows his flat head there to the right and the wall on our left rises to the vermillion cliffs now look while you can for presently youll not be able to see  why  wind sand dust gravel pebbleswatch out for your eyes  naab had not ceased speaking when hare saw that the train of indians trailing down the slope was enveloped in red clouds then the white wagons disappeared soon he was struck in the back by a gust which justified naabs warning it swept by the air grew clear again once more he could see but presently a puff taking him unawares filled his eyes with dust difficult of removal whereupon he turned his back to the wind  the afternoon grew apace the sun glistened on the white patches of coconina mountain it set and the wind died  five miles of red sand said naab heres what kills the horses getup  there was no trail all before was red sand hollows slopes levels dunes in which the horses sank above their fetlocks the wheels ploughed deep and little red streams trailed down from the tires naab trudged on foot with the reins in his hands hare essayed to walk also soon tired and floundered behind till naab ordered him to ride again twilight came with the horses still toiling  there thankful i am when we get off that strip but jack that trailless waste prevents a night raid on my home even the navajos shun it after dark well be home soon theres my sign see night or day we call it the blue star  high in the black cliff a starshaped windworn hole let the blue sky through  there was cheer in naabs getup now and the horses quickened with it their ironshod hoofs struck fire from the rosy road easy easysoho cried naab to his steeds in the pitchy blackness under the shelving cliff they picked their way cautiously and turned a corner lights twinkled in hares sight a fresh breeze coming from water dampened his cheek and a hollow rumble a long roll as of distant thunder filled his ears  whats that he asked  that my lad is what i always love to hear it means im home its the roar of the colorado as she takes her first plunge into the canyon     iv the oasis   august naabs oasis was an oval valley level as a floor green with leaf and white with blossom enclosed by a circle of colossal cliffs of vivid vermilion hue at its western curve the colorado river split the red walls from north to south when the wind was west a sullen roar remote as of some faroff driving mill filled the valley when it was east a dreamy hollow hum a somnolent song murmured through the cottonwoods when no wind stirred silence reigned a silence not of serene plain or mountain fastness but shut in compressed strange and breathless safe from the storms of the elements as well as of the world was this garden of eschtah  naab had put hare to bed on the unroofed porch of a log house but routed him out early and when hare lifted the blankets a shower of cottonblossoms drifted away like snow a grove of graybarked trees spread green canopy overhead and through the intricate web shone crimson walls soaring with resistless onsweep up and up to shut out all but a blue lake of sky  i want you to see the navajos cross the river said naab  hare accompanied him out through the grove to a road that flanked the first rise of the red wall they followed this for half a mile and turning a corner came into an unobstructed view a roar of rushing waters had prepared hare but the river that he saw appalled him it was red and swift it slid onward like an enormous slippery snake its constricted head raised a crest of leaping waves and disappeared in a dark chasm whence came a bellow and boom  that opening where she jumps off is the head of the grand canyon said naab its five hundred feet deep there and thirty miles below its five thousand oh once in she tears in a hurry come we turn up the bank here  hare could find no speech and he felt immeasurably small all that he had seen in reaching this isolated spot was dwarfed in comparison this crossing of the fathers as naab called it was the gateway of the desert this roar of turbulent waters was the sinister monotone of the mighty desert symphony of great depths great heights great reaches  on a sandy strip of bank the navajos had halted this was as far as they could go for above the wall jutted out into the river from here the head of the canyon was not visible and the roar of the rapids was accordingly lessened in volume but even in this smooth water the river spoke a warning  the navajos go in here and swim their mustangs across to that sand bar explained naab the current helps when shes high and theres a threefoot raise on now  i cant believe it possible what danger they must runthose little mustangs exclaimed hare  danger yes i suppose so replied naab as if it were a new idea my lad the mormons crossed here by the hundreds many were drowned this trail and crossing were unknown except to indians before the mormon exodus  the mustangs had to be driven into the water scarbreast led and his mustang after many kicks and reluctant steps went over his depth wetting the stalwart chief to the waist barelegged indians waded in and urged their packponies shouts shrill cries blows mingled with snorts and splashes  dave and george naab in flat boats rowed slowly on the downstream side of the indians presently all the mustangs and ponies were in the procession widening out in a triangle from scarbreast the leader the packponies appeared to swim better than the mounted mustangs or else the packs of deerpelts made them more buoyant when onethird way across the head of the swimming train met the current and the line of progress broke mustang after mustang swept down with a rapidity which showed the power of the current yet they swam steadily with flanks shining tails sometimes afloat sometimes under noses up and riders holding weapons aloft but the packponies labored when the current struck them and whirling about they held back the indians who were leading them and blocked those behind the orderly procession of the start became a broken line and then a rout here and there a navajo slipped into the water and swam leading his mustang others pulled on packponies and beat their mounts strongswimming mustangs forged ahead weak ones hung back and all obeyed the downward will of the current  while hare feared for the lives of some of the navajos and pitied the laden ponies he could not but revel in the scene in its vivid action and varying color in the cries and shrill whoops of the indians and the snorts of the frightened mustangs in naabs hoarse yells to his sons and the everpresent menacing roar from around the bend the wildness of it all the necessity of peril and calm acceptance of it stirred within hare the call the awakening the spirit of the desert  august naabs stentorian voice rolled out over the river ho davethe yellow pintopull him loosegeorge back this waytheres a pack slippingdown now downstream turn that straggler indave in that tanglequick theres a boy drowninghis foots caughthes been kickedhurry hurrypull him in the boattheres a pony undertoo late george let that one golet him go i tell you  so the crossing of the navajos proceeded never an instant free from danger in that churning current the mustangs and ponies floundered somewhat on the sandbar and then parted the willows and appeared on a trail skirting the red wall dave naab moored his boat on that side of the river and returned with george  well look over my farm said august as they retraced their steps he led hare through fields of alfalfa in all stages of growth explaining that it yielded six crops a year into one tenacre lot pigs and cows had been turned to feed at will everywhere the ground was soggy little streams of water trickled down ditches next to the fields was an orchard where cherries were ripe apricots already large plumtrees shedding their blossoms and appletrees just opening into bloom naab explained that the products of his oasis were abnormal the ground was exceedingly rich and could be kept always wet the reflection of the sun from the walls robbed even winter of any rigor and the spring summer and autumn were tropical he pointed to grapevines as large as a mans thigh and told of bunches of grapes four feet long he showed sprouting plants on which watermelons and pumpkins would grow so large that one man could not lift them he told of one pumpkin that held a record of taking two men to roll it  i can raise any kind of fruit in such abundance that it cant be used my garden is prodigal but we get little benefit except for our own use for we cannot transport things across the desert  the water which was the prime factor in all this richness came from a small stream which naab by making a dam and tunnelling a corner of cliff had diverted from its natural course into his oasis  between the fence and the red wall there was a wide bare plain which stretched to the house at its farthest end was a green enclosure which hare recognized as the cemetery mentioned by snap hare counted thirty graves a few with crude monuments of stone the others marked by wooden headpieces  ive the reputation of doctoring the women and letting the men die said naab with a smile i hardly think its fair but the fact is no women are buried here some graves are of men i fished out of the river others of those who drifted here and who were killed or died keeping their secrets ive numbered those unknown graves and have kept a description of the men so if the chance ever comes i may tell some one where a father or brother lies buried five sons of mine not one of whom died a natural death found graves heregod rest them heres the grave of mescals father a spaniard he was an adventurer i helped him over in nevada when he was ill he came here with me got well and lived nine years and he died without speaking one word of himself or telling his name  what strange ends men come to mused hare well a grave was a grave wherever it lay he wondered if he would come to rest in that quiet nook with its steady light its simple dignity of bare plain graves fitting the brevity of life the littleness of man  we break wild mustangs along this stretch said naab drawing hare away its a fine run wait till you see mescal on black bolly tearing up the dust shes a navajo for riding  three huge corrals filled a wide curved space in the wall in one corral were the teams that had hauled the wagons from white sage in another upward of thirty burros drooping lazy little fellows half asleep in the third a dozen or more mustangs and some horses which delighted hare snap naabs cream pinto a bay and a giant horse of mottled white attracted him most  our best stock is out on the range said naab the white is charger my saddlehorse when he was a yearling he got away and ran wild for three years but we caught him hes a weightcarrier and he can run some youre fond of a horsei can see that  yes returned hare but iill never ride again he said it brightly smiling the while still the look in his eyes belied the cheerful resignation  ive not the gift of revelation yet i seem to see you on a big gray horse with a shining mane naab appeared to be gazing far away  the cottonwood grove at the western curve of the oasis shaded the five log huts where augusts grown sons lived with their wives and his own cabin which was of considerable dimensions it had a covered porch on one side an open one on the other a shingle roof and was a roomy and comfortable habitation  naab was pointing out the schoolhouse when he was interrupted by childish laughter shrieks of glee and the rush of little feet  its recesstime he said  a frantic crowd of tousledheaded little ones were running from the log schoolhouse to form a circle under the trees there were fourteen of them from four years of age up to ten or twelve such sturdy gladeyed children hare had never seen in a few moments as though their happy screams were signals the shady circle was filled with hounds and a string of puppies stepping on their long ears and ruffling turkeygobblers that gobbled and gobbled and guineahens with their shrill cries and cackling chickens and a lame wild goose that hobbled along alone then there were shiny peafowls screeching clarion calls from the trees overhead and flocks of singing blackbirds and pigeons hovering over and alighting upon the house last to approach were a woolly sheep that added his baabaa to the din and a baldfaced burro that walked in his sleep these two became the centre of clamor after many tumbles four chubby youngsters mounted the burro and the others with loud acclaim shouting noddle noddle getup getup endeavored to make him go but noddle nodded and refused to awaken or budge then an ambitious urchin of six fastened his hands in the fur of the sheep and essayed to climb to his back willing hands assisted him ride him billy ride him getup navvy getup  navvy evidently had never been ridden for he began a fair imitation of a bucking bronco billy held on but the smile vanished and he corners of his mouth drew down  hang on billy hang on cried august naab in delight billy hung on a moment longer and then navvy bewildered by the pestering crowd about him launched out and butting into noddle spilled the four youngsters and billy also into a wriggling heap  this recesstime completed hares introduction to the naabs there were mother mary and judith and esther whom he knew and mother ruth and her two daughters very like their sisters mother ruth augusts second wife was younger than mother mary more comely of face and more sad and serious of expression the wives of the five sons except snap naabs frail bride were stalwart women fit to make homes and rear children  now jack things are moving all right said august for the present you must eat and rest walk some but dont tire yourself well practice shooting a little every day thats one thing ill spare time for ive a trick with a gun to teach you and if you feel able take a burro and ride anyway make yourself at home  hare found eating and resting to be matters of profound enjoyment before he had fallen in with these good people it had been a year since he had sat down to a full meal longer still since he had eaten whole some food and now he had come to a land overflowing with milk and honey as mother ruth smilingly said he could not choose between roast beef and chicken and so he waived the question by taking both and what with the biscuits and butter applesauce and blackberry jam cherry pie and milk like cream there was danger of making himself ill he told his friends that he simply could not help it which shameless confession brought a hearty laugh from august and beaming smiles from his womenfolk  for several days hare was remarkably well for an invalid he won golden praise from august at the rifle practice and he began to take lessons in the quick drawing and rapid firing of a colt revolver naab was wonderfully proficient in the use of both firearms and his skill in drawing the smaller weapon in which his movement was quicker than the eye astonished hare my lad said august it doesnt follow because im a christian that i dont know how to handle a gun besides i like to shoot  in these few days hare learned what conquering the desert made of a man august naab was close to threescore years his chest was wide as a door his arm like the branch of an oak he was a blacksmith a mechanic a carpenter a cooper a potter at his forge and in his shop everywhere were crude tools wagons farming implements sets of buckskin harness odds and ends of nameless things eloquent and pregnant proof of the fact that necessity is the mother of invention he was a mason the levee that buffeted back the rage of the colorado in flood the wall that turned the creek the irrigation tunnel the zigzag trail cut on the face of the cliffall these attested his eye for line his judgment of distance his strength in toil he was a farmer a cattle man a grafter of fruittrees a breeder of horses a herder of sheep a preacher a physician best and strangest of all in this wonderful man was the instinct and the heart to heal i dont combat the doctrine of the mormon church he said but i administer a little medicine with my healing i learned that from the navajos the children ran to him with bruised heads and cut fingers and stubbed toes and his blacksmiths hands were as gentle as a womans a mustang with a lame leg claimed his serious attention a sick sheep gave him an anxious look a steer with a gored skin sent him running for a bucket of salve he could not pass by a crippled quail the farm was overrun by navajo sheep which he had found strayed and lost on the desert anything hurt or helpless had in august naab a friend hare found himself looking up to a great and luminous figure and he loved this man  as the days passed hare learned many other things for a while illness confined him to his bed on the porch at night he lay listening to the roar of the river and watching the stars twice he heard a distant crash and rumble heavy as thunder and he knew that somewhere along the cliffs avalanches were slipping by day he watched the cotton snow down upon him and listened to the many birds and waited for the merry show at recesstime after a short time the children grew less shy and came readily to him they were the most wholesome children he had ever known hare wondered about it and decided it was not so much mormon teaching as isolation from the world these children had never been out of their cliffwalled home and civilization was for them as if it were not he told them stories and after school hours they would race to him and climb on his bed and beg for more  he exhausted his supply of fairystories and animal stories and had begun to tell about the places and cities which he had visited when the eagereyed children were peremptorily called within by mother mary this pained him and he was at a loss to understand it enlightenment came however in the way of an argument between naab and mother mary which he overheard the elder wife said that the stranger was welcome to the children but she insisted that they hear nothing of the outside world and that they be kept to the teachings of the mormon geographywhich made all the world outside utah an untrodden wilderness august naab did not hold to the letter of the mormon law he argued that if the children could not be raised as mormons with a full knowledge of the world they would only be lost in the end to the church  other developments surprised hare the house of this good mormon was divided against itself precedence was given to the first and elder wifemother mary mother ruths life was not without pain the men were out on the ranges all day usually two or more of them for several days at a time and this left the women alone one daughter taught the school the other daughters did all the chores about the house from feeding the stock to chopping wood the work was hard and the girls would rather have been in white sage or lund they disliked mescal and said things inspired by jealousy snap naabs wife was vindictive and called mescal that indian  it struck him on hearing this gossip that he had missed mescal what had become of her curiosity prompting him he asked little billy about her  mescals with the sheep piped billy  that she was a shepherdess pleased hare and he thought of her as free on the open range with the wind blowing her hair  one day when hare felt stronger he took his walk round the farm with new zest upon his return to the house he saw snaps cream pinto in the yard and daves mustang cropping the grass near by a dusty pack lay on the ground hare walked down the avenue of cottonwoods and was about to turn the corner of the old forge when he stopped short  now mind you ill take a bead on this whitefaced spy if you send him up there  it was snap naabs voice and his speech concluded with the click of teeth characteristic of him in anger  stand there august naab exclaimed in wrath listen you have been drinking again or you wouldnt talk of killing a man i warned you i wont do this thing you ask of me till i have your promise why wont you leave the bottle alone  ill promise came the sullen reply  very well then pack and go across to bitter seeps  that jobll take all summer growled snap  so much the better when you come home ill keep my promise  hare moved away silently the shock of snaps first words had kept him fast in his tracks long enough to hear the conversation why did snap threaten him where was august naab going to send him hare had no means of coming to an understanding of either question he was disturbed in mind and resolved to keep out of snaps way he went to the orchard but his stay of an hour availed nothing for on his return after threading the maze of cottonwoods he came face to face with the man he wanted to avoid  snap naab at the moment of meeting had a black bottle tipped high above his lips  with a curse he threw the bottle at hare missing him narrowly he was drunk his eyes were bloodshot  if you tell father you saw me drinking ill kill you he hissed and rattling his colt in its holster he walked away  hare walked back to his bed where he lay for a long time with his whole inner being in a state of strife it gradually wore off as he strove for calm the playground was deserted no one had seen snaps action and for that he was glad then his attention was diverted by a clatter of ringing hoofs on the road a mustang and a cloud of dust were approaching  mescal and black bolly he exclaimed and sat up quickly the mustang turned in the gate slid to a stop and stood quivering restive tossing its thoroughbred head black as a coal with freedom and fire in every line mescal leaped off lightly a gray form flashed in at the gate fell at her feet and rose to leap about her it was a splendid dog huge in frame almost white wild as the mustang  this was the mescal whom he remembered yet somehow different the sombre homespun garments had given place to fringed and beaded buckskin  ive come for you she said  for me he asked wonderingly as she approached with the bridle of the black over her arm  down wolf she cried to the leaping dog yes didnt you know father naab says youre to help me tend the sheep are you better i hope so youre quite pale  iim not so well said hare  he looked up at her at the black sweep of her hair under the white band at her eyes like jet and suddenly realized with a gladness new and strange to him that he liked to look at her that she was beautiful     v black sage and juniper   august naab appeared on the path leading from his fields  mescal here you are he greeted how about the sheep  piutes driving them down to the lower range there are a thousand coyotes hanging about the flock  thats bad rejoined august jack theres evidently some real shooting in store for you well pack today and get an early start tomorrow ill put you on noddle hes slow but the easiest climber i ever owned hes like riding whats the matter with you whats happened to make you angry  one of his long strides spanned the distance between them  oh nothing said hare flushing  lad i know of few circumstances that justify a lie youve met snap  hare might still have tried to dissimulate but one glance at augusts stern face showed the uselessness of it he kept silent  drink makes my son unnatural said naab he breathed heavily as one in conflict with wrath well not wait till tomorrow to go up on the plateau well go at once  then quick surprise awakened for hare in the meaning in mescals eyes he caught only a fleeting glimpse a dark flash and it left him with a glow of an emotion half pleasure half pain  mescal went on august go into the house and keep out of snaps way jack watch me pack you need to learn these things i could put all this outfit on two burros but the trail is narrow and a wide pack might bump a burro off lets see ive got all your stuff but the saddle that well leave till we get a horse for you well alls ready  mescal came at his call and mounting black bolly rode out toward the cliff wall with wolf trotting before her hare bestrode noddle august waving goodbye to his womenfolk started the train of burros after mescal  how they would be able to climb the face of that steep cliff puzzled hare upon nearer view he discovered the yardwide trail curving upward in corkscrew fashion round a projecting corner of cliff the stone was a soft red shale and the trail had been cut in it at a steep angle it was so steep that the burros appeared to be climbing straight up noddle pattered into it dropped his head and his long ears and slackened his pace to patient plodding august walked in the rear  the first thing that struck hare was the way the burros in front of him stopped at the curves in the trail and turned in a space so small that their four feet were close together yet as they swung their packs they scarcely scraped the wall at every turn they were higher than he was going in the opposite direction yet he could reach out and touch them he glanced up to see mescal right above him leaning forward with her brown hands clasping the pommel then he looked out and down already the green cluster of cottonwoods lay far below after that sensations pressed upon him round and round up and up steadily surely the beautiful mustang led the train there were sounds of rattling stones and click of hoofs and scrape of pack on one side towered the ironstained cliff not smooth or glistening at close range but of dull dead rotting rock the trail changed to a zigzag along a seamed and cracked buttress where ledges leaned outward waiting to fall then a steeper incline where the burros crept upward warily led to a level ledge heading to the left  mescal halted on a promontory she with her windblown hair the gleam of white band about her head and a dash of red along the fringed leggings gave inexpressible life and beauty to that wild jagged point of rock sharp against the glaring sky  this is lookout point said naab i keep an indian here all the time during daylight hes a peon a navajo slave he cant talk as he was born without a tongue or it was cut out but he has the best eyes of any indian i know you see this point commands the farm the crossing the navajo trail over the river the echo cliffs opposite where the navajos signal to me and also the white sage trail  the oasis shone under the triangular promontory the river with its rising roar wound in bold curve from the split in the cliffs to the right whitesloped coconina breasted the horizon forward across the canyon line opened the manyhued desert  with this peon watching here im not likely to be surprised said naab that strip of sand protects me at night from approach and ive never had anything to fear from across the river  naabs peon came from a little cave in the wall and grinned the greeting he could not speak to hares uneducated eye all indians resembled each other yet this one stood apart from the others not differing in blanketed leanness or straggling black hair or bronze skin but in the birdofprey cast of his features and the wildness of his glittering eyes naab gave him a bag from one of the packs spoke a few words in navajo and then slapped the burros into the trail  the climb thenceforth was more rapid because less steep and the trail now led among broken fragments of cliff the color of the stones had changed from red to yellow and small cedars grew in protected places hares judgment of height had such frequent cause for correction that he gave up trying to estimate the altitude the ride had begun to tell on his strength and toward the end he thought he could not manage to stay longer upon noddle the air had grown thin and cold and though the sun was yet an hour high his fingers were numb  hang on jack cheered august were almost up  at last black bolly disappeared likewise the bobbing burros one by one then noddle wagging his ears reached a level then hare saw a graygreen cedar forest with yellow crags rising in the background and a rush of cold wind smote his face for a moment he choked he could not get his breath the air was thin and rare and he inhaled deeply trying to overcome the suffocation presently he realized that the trouble was not with the rarity of the atmosphere but with the bittersweet penetrating odor it carried he was almost stifled it was not like the smell of pine though it made him think of pinetrees  ha thats good said naab expanding his great chest thats air for you my lad can you taste it well heres camp your home for many a day jack theres piutehow do howre the sheep  a short squat indian goodhumored of face shook his black head till the silver rings danced in his ears and replied baddamn coyotee  piuteshake with jack him shoot coyotegot big gun said naab  howdojack replied piute extending his hand and then straightway began examining the new rifle damnheap big gun  jack youll find this indian one you can trust for all hes a piute outcast went on august ive had him with me ever since mescal found him on the coconina trail five years ago what piute doesnt know about this side of coconina isnt worth learning  in a depression sheltered from the wind lay the camp a fire burned in the centre a conical tent like a tepee in shape hung suspended from a cedar branch and was staked at its four points a leaning slab of rock furnished shelter for camp supplies and for the indian and at one end a spring gushed out a graysheathed cedartree marked the entrance to this hollow glade and under it august began preparing hares bed  heres the place youre to sleep rain or shine or snow he said now ive spent my life sleeping on the ground and mother earth makes the best bed ill dig out a little pit in this soft mat of needles thats for your hips then the tarpaulin so a blanket so now the other blankets your feet must be a little higher than your head you really sleep down hill which breaks the wind so you never catch cold all you need do is to change your position according to the direction of the wind pull up the blankets and then the long end of the tarpaulin if it rains or snows cover your head and sleep my lad sleep to the song of the wind  from where hare lay resting a weary body he could see down into the depression which his position guarded naab built up the fire piute peeled potatoes with deliberate care mescal on her knees her brown arms bare kneaded dough in a basin wolf crouched on the ground and watched his mistress black bolly tossed her head elevating the bag on her nose so as to get all the grain  naab called him to supper and when hare set to with a will on the bacon and eggs and hot biscuits he nodded approvingly thats what i want to see he said approvingly you must eat piute will get deer or you may shoot them yourself eat all the venison you can remember what scarbreast said then rest thats the secret if you eat and rest you will gain strength  the edge of the wall was not a hundred paces from the camp and when hare strolled out to it after supper the sun had dipped the under side of its red disc behind the desert he watched it sink while the goldenred flood of light grew darker and darker thought seemed remote from him then he watched and watched until he saw the last spark of fire die from the snowslopes of coconina the desert became dimmer and dimmer the oasis lost its outline in a bottomless purple pit except for a faint light like a star  the bleating of sheep aroused him and he returned to camp the fire was still bright wolf slept close to mescals tent piute was not in sight and naab had rolled himself in blankets crawling into his bed hare stretched aching legs and lay still as if he would never move again tired as he was the bleating of the sheep the clear ring of the bell on black bolly and the faint tinkle of lighter bells on some of the rams drove away sleep for a while accompanied by the sough of the wind through the cedars the music of the bells was sweet and he listened till he heard no more  a thin coating of frost crackled on his bed when he awakened and out from under the shelter of the cedar all the ground was hoarwhite as he slipped from his blankets the same strong smell of black sage and juniper smote him almost like a blow his nostrils seemed glued together by some rich piny pitch and when he opened his lips to breathe a sudden pain as of a knifethrust pierced his lungs the thought following was as sharp as the pain pneumonia what he had long expected he sank against the cedar overcome by the shock but he rallied presently for with the reestablishment of the old settled bitterness which had been forgotten in the interest of his situation he remembered that he had given up hope still he could not get back at once to his former resignation he hated to acknowledge that the wildness of this desert canyon country and the spirit it sought to instil in him had wakened a desire to live for it meant only more to give up and after one short instant of battle he was himself again he put his hand under his flannel shirt and felt of the soreness of his lungs he found it not at the apex of the right lung always the one sensitive spot but all through his breast little panting breaths did not hurt but the deep inhalation which alone satisfied him filled his whole chest with thousands of pricking needles in the depth of his breast was a hollow that burned  when he had pulled on his boots and coat and had washed himself in the runway of the spring his hands were so numb with cold they refused to hold his comb and brush and he presented himself at the roaring fire halffrozen dishevelled trembling but cheerful he would not tell naab if he had to die today tomorrow or next week he would lie down under a cedar and die he could not whine about it to this man  up with the sun was naabs greeting his cheerfulness was as impelling as his splendid virility following the wave of his hand hare saw the sun a palepink globe through a misty blue rising between the golden crags of the eastern wall  mescal had a shy goodmorning for him and piute a broad smile and familiar howdo the peon slave who had finished breakfast and was about to depart moved his lips in friendly greeting that had no sound  did you hear the coyotes last night inquired august no well of all the choruses i ever heard there must be a thousand on the bench jack i wish i could spare the time to stay up here with you and shoot some youll have practice with the rifle but dont neglect the colt practice particularly the draw i taught you piute has a carbine and he shoots at the coyotes but who ever saw an indian that could hit anything  damngun no good growled piute who evidently understood english pretty well naab laughed and while hare ate breakfast he talked of the sheep the flock he had numbered three thousand they were a goodly part of them navajo stock small hardy sheep that could live on anything but cactus and needed little water this flock had grown from a small number to its present size in a few years being remarkably free from the diseases and pests which retard increase in low countries the sheep had multiplied almost one for one for every year but for the ravages of wild beasts naab believed he could raise a flock of many thousands and in a brief time be rich in sheep alone in the winter he drove them down into the oasis the other seasons he herded them on the high ranges where the cattle could not climb there was grass enough on this plateau for a million sheep after the spring thaw in early march occasional snows fell till the end of may and frost hung on until early summer then the july rains made the plateau a garden  get the fortyfour concluded naab and well go out and break it in  with the long rifle in the hollow of his arm jack forgot that he was a sick man when he came within gunshot of the flock the smell of sheep effectually smothered the keen tasty odor of black sage and juniper sheep ranged everywhere under the low cedars they browsed with noses in the frost and from all around came the tinkle of tiny bells on the curlyhorned rams and an endless variety of bleats  theyre spread now said august mescal drives them on every little while and piute goes ahead to pick out the best browse watch the dog jack hes all but human his mother was a big shepherd dog that i got in lund she must have had a strain of wild blood once while i was hunting deer on coconina she ran off with timber wolves and we thought she was killed but she came back and had a litter of three puppies two were white the other black i think she killed the black one and she neglected the others one died and mescal raised the other we called him wolf he loves mescal and loves the sheep and hates a wolf mescal puts a bell on him when she is driving and the sheep know the bell i think it would be a good plan for her to tie something red round his necka scarf so as to keep you from shooting him for a wolf  nimble alert the big white dog was not still a moment his duty was to keep the flock compact to head the stragglers and turn them back and he knew his part perfectly there was dash and fire in his work he never barked as he circled the flock the small navajo sheep edging ever toward forbidden ground bleated their way back to the fold the larger ones wheeled reluctantly and the old belled rams squared themselves lowering their massive horns as if to butt him never however did they stand their ground when he reached them for there was a decision about wolf which brooked no opposition at times when he was working on one side a crafty sheep on the other would steal out into the thicket then mescal called and wolf flashed back to her lifting his proud head eager spirited ready to take his order a word a wave of her whip sufficed for the dog to rout out the recalcitrant sheep and send him bleating to his fellows  he manages them easily now said naab but when the lambs come they cant be kept in the coyotes and wolves hang out in the thickets and pick up the stragglers the worst enemy of sheep though is the old grizzly bear usually he is grouchy and dangerous to hunt he comes into the herd kills the mother sheep and eats the milkbagno more he will kill forty sheep in a night piute saw the tracks of one up on the high range and believes this bear is following the flock lets get off into the woods some little way into the edge of the thicketsfor piute always keeps to the gladesand see if we can pick off a few coyotes  august cautioned jack to step stealthily and slip from cedar to cedar to use every bunch of sage and juniper to hide his advance  watch sharp jack ive seen two already look for moving things dont try to see one quiet for you cant till after your eye catches him moving they are gray gray as the cedars the grass the ground good yes i see him but dont shoot thats too far wait they sneak away but they return you can afford to make sure here now by that stoneaim low and be quick  in the course of a mile without keeping the sheep near at hand they saw upward of twenty coyotes five of which jack killed in as many shots  youve got the hang of it said naab rubbing his hands youll kill the varmints piute will skin and salt the pelts now im going up on the high range to look for bear sign go ahead on your own hook  hare was regardless of time while he stole under the cedars and through the thickets spying out the cunning coyotes then naabs yell pealing out claimed his attention he answered and returned when they met he recounted his adventures in mingled excitement and disappointment  are you tired asked naab  tired no replied jack  well you mustnt overdo the very first day ive news for you there are some wild horses on the high range i didnt see them but found tracks everywhere if they come down here you send piute to close the trail at the upper end of the bench and you close the one where we came up there are only two trails where even a deer can get off this plateau and both are narrow splits in the wall which can be barred by the gates we made the gates to keep the sheep in and theyll serve a turn if you get the wild horses on the bench send piute for me at once  they passed the indian herding the sheep into a corral built against an uprising ridge of stone naab dispatched him to look for the dead coyotes the three burros were in camp two wearing empty packsaddles and noddle for once not asleep was eating from mescals hand  mescal hadnt i better take black bolly home asked august  maynt i keep her  shes yours but you run a risk there are wild horses on the range will you keep her hobbled  yes replied mescal reluctantly though i dont believe bolly would run off from me  look out she doesnt go hobbles and all jack heres the other bit of news i have for you theres a big grizzly camping on the trail of our sheep now what i want to know isshall i leave him to you or put off work and come up here to wait for him myself  why said jack slowly whatever you say if you think you can safely leave him to meim willing  a grizzly wont be pleasant to face i never knew one of those sheepkillers that wouldnt run at a man if wounded  tell me what to do  if he comes down its more than likely to be after dark dont risk hunting him then wait till morning and put wolf on his trail hell be up in the rocks and by holding in the dog you may find him asleep in a cave however if you happen to meet him by day do this dont waste any shots climb a ledge or tree if one be handy if not stand your ground get down on your knee and shoot and let him come mind you hell grunt when hes hit and start for you and keep coming till hes dead have confidence in yourself and your gun for you can kill him aim low and shoot steady if he keeps on coming theres always a fatal shot and that is when he rises youll see a bare spot on his breast put a fortyfour into that and hell go down  august had spoken so easily quite as if he were explaining how to shear a yearling sheep that jacks feelings fluctuated between amazement and laughter verily this desert man was stripped of all the false fears of civilization  now jack im off goodbye and good luck mescal look out for him soho noddle getup biscuit and with many a cheery word and slap he urged the burros into the forest where they and his tall form soon disappeared among the trees  piute came stooping toward camp so burdened with coyotes that he could scarcely be seen under the gray pile with a fervent damn he tumbled them under a cedar and trotted back into the forest for another load jack insisted on assuming his share of the duties about camp and mescal assigned him to the task of gathering firewood breaking redhot sticks of wood into small pieces and raking them into piles of live coals then they ate these two alone jack did not do justice to the supper excitement had robbed him of appetite he told mescal how he had crept upon the coyotes how so many had eluded him how he had missed a gray wolf he plied her with questions about the sheep and wanted to know if there would be more wolves and if she thought the silvertip would come he was quite carried away by the events of the day  the sunset drew him to the rim dark clouds were mantling the desert like rolling smoke from a prairiefire he almost stumbled over mescal who sat with her back to a stone wolf lay with his head in her lap and he growled  theres a storm on the desert she said those smoky streaks are flying sand we may have snow tonight its colder and the wind is north see ive a blanket you had better get one  he thanked her and went for it piute was eating his supper and the peon had just come in the bright campfire was agreeable yet hare did not feel cold but he wrapped himself in a blanket and returned to mescal and sat beside her the desert lay indistinct in the foreground inscrutable beyond the canyon lost its line in gloom the solemnity of the scene stilled his unrest the strange freedom of longings unleashed that day what had come over him he shook his head but with the consciousness of self returned a feeling of fatigue the burning pain in his chest the bittersweet smell of black sage and juniper  you love this outlook he asked  yes  do you sit here often  every evening  is it the sunset that you care for the roar of the river just being here high above it all  its that last perhaps i dont know  havent you been lonely  no  youd rather be here with the sheep than be in lund or salt lake city as esther and judith want to be  yes  any other reply from her would not have been consistent with the impression she was making on him as yet he had hardly regarded her as a young girl she had been part of this beautiful desertland but he began to see in her a responsive being influenced by his presence if the situation was wonderful to him what must it be for her like a shy illusive creature unused to men she was troubled by questions fearful of the sound of her own voice yet in repose as she watched the lights and shadows she was serene unconscious her dark quiet glance was dreamy and sad and in it was the sombre brooding strength of the desert  twilight and falling dew sent them back to the camp piute and peon were skinning coyotes by the blaze of the fire the night wind had not yet risen the sheep were quiet there was no sound save the crackle of burning cedar sticks jack began to talk he had to talk so addressing piute and the dumb peon he struck at random into speech and words flowed with a rush piute approved for he said damn whenever his intelligence grasped a meaning and the peon twisted his lips and fixed his diamond eyes upon hare in rapt gaze the sound of a voice was welcome to the sentinels of that lonely sheeprange jack talked of cities of ships of people of simple things in the life he had left and he discovered that mescal listened not only did she listen she became absorbed it was romance to her fulfilment of her vague dreams nor did she seek her tent till he ceased then with a startled goodnight she was gone  from under the snugness of his warm blankets jack watched out the last wakeful moments of that day of days a star peeped through the fringe of cedar foliage the wind sighed and rose steadily to sweep over him with breath of ice with the fragrance of juniper and black sage and a tang of cedar  but that day was only the beginning of eventful days of increasing charm of forgetfulness of self of time that passed unnoted every succeeding day was like its predecessor only richer every day the hoarfrost silvered the dawn the sheep browsed the coyotes skulked in the thickets the rifle spoke truer and truer every sunset mescals changing eyes mirrored the desert every twilight jack sat beside her in the silence every night in the campfire flare he talked to piute and the peon  the indians were appreciative listeners whether they understood jack or not but his talk with them was only a presence he wished to reveal the outside world to mescal and he saw with pleasure that every day she grew more interested  one evening he was telling of new york city of the monster buildings where men worked and of the elevated railways for the time was the late seventies and they were still a novelty then something unprecedented occurred inasmuch as piute earnestly and vigorously interrupted jack demanding to have this last strange story made more clear jack did his best in gesture and speech but he had to appeal to mescal to translate his meaning to the indian this mescal did with surprising fluency the result however was that piute took exception to the story of trains carrying people through the air he lost his grin and regarded jack with much disfavor evidently he was experiencing the bitterness of misplaced trust  heap damn lie he exclaimed with a growl and stalked off into the gloom  piutes expressive doubt discomfited hare but only momentarily for mescals silvery peal of laughter told him that the incident had brought them closer together he laughed with her and discovered a well of joyousness behind her reserve thereafter he talked directly to mescal the ice being broken she began to ask questions shyly at first yet more and more eagerly until she forgot herself in the desire to learn of cities and people of women especially what they wore and how they lived and all that life meant to them  the sweetest thing which had ever come to hare was the teaching of this desert girl how naive in her questions and how quick to grasp she was the reaching out of her mind was like the unfolding of a rose evidently the mormon restrictions had limited her opportunities to learn  but her thought had striven to escape its narrow confines and now liberated by sympathy and intelligence it leaped forth  lambingtime came late in may and mescal wolf piute and jack knew no rest nighttime was safer for the sheep than the day though the howling of a thousand coyotes made it hideous for the shepherds all in a day seemingly the little fleecy lambs came as if by magic and filled the forest with piping bleats then they were tottering after their mothers gamboling at a days growth wilful as youthand the carnage began boldly the coyotes darted out of thicket and bush and many lambs never returned to their mothers gaunt shadows hovered always near the great timberwolves waited in covert for prey piute slept not at all and the dogs jaws were flecked with blood morning and night jack hung up fiftyfour coyotes the second day the third he let them lie seventy in number many times the riflebarrel burned his hands his aim grew unerring so that running brutes in range dropped in their tracks many a gray coyote fell with a lamb in his teeth  one night when sheep and lambs were in the corral and the shepherds rested round the campfire the dog rose quivering sniffed the cold wind and suddenly bristled with every hair standing erect  wolf called mescal  the sheep began to bleat a rippling crash a splintering of wood told of an irresistible onslaught on the corral fence  chuschus exclaimed piute  wolf not heeding mescals cry flashed like lightning under the cedars the rush of the sheep pattering across the corral was succeeded by an uproar  bear bear cried mescal with dark eyes on jack he seized his rifle  dont go she implored her hand on his arm not at nightremember father naab said not  listen i wont stand that ill go here get in the treequick  nono  do as i say it was a command the girl wavered he dropped the rifle and swung her up climb  nodont gojack  with piute at his heels he ran out into the darkness     vi the wind in the cedars   piutes indian sense of the advantage of position in attack stood jack in good stead he led him up the ledge which overhung one end of the corral in the pale starlight the sheep could be seen running in bands massing together crowding the fence their cries made a deafening din  the indian shouted but jack could not understand him a large black object was visible in the shade of the ledge piute fired his carbine before jack could bring his rifle up the black thing moved into startlingly rapid flight then spouts of red flame illumined the corral as he shot jack got fleeting glimpses of the bear moving like a dark streak against a blur of white for all he could tell no bullet took effect  when certain that the visitor had departed jack descended into the corral he and piute searched for dead sheep but much to their surprise found none if the grizzly had killed one he must have taken it with him and estimating his strength from the gap he had broken in the fence he could easily have carried off a sheep they repaired the break and returned to camp  hes gone mescal come down called jack into the cedar let me help youthere wasnt it lucky he wasnt so brave either the flashes from the guns or the dog scared him i was amazed to see how fast he could run  piute found woolly brown fur hanging from wolfs jaws  he nipped the brute thats sure said jack good dog maybe he kept the bear from why mescal youre whiteyoure shaking theres no danger piute and ill take turns watching with wolf  mescal went silently into her tent  the sheep quieted down and made no further disturbance that night the dawn broke gray with a cold north wind duncolored clouds rolled up hiding the tips of the crags on the upper range and a flurry of snow whitened the cedars after breakfast jack tried to get wolf to take the track of the grizzly but the scent had cooled  next day mescal drove the sheep eastward toward the crags and about the middle of the afternoon reached the edge of the slope grass grew luxuriantly and it was easy to keep the sheep in moreover that part of the forest had fewer trees and scarcely any sage or thickets so that the lambs were safer barring danger which might lurk in the seamed and cracked cliffs overshadowing the open grassy plots piutes task at the moment was to drag dead coyotes to the rim near at hand and throw them over mescal rested on a stone and wolf reclined at her feet  jack presently found a fresh deer track and trailed it into the cedars then up the slope to where the huge rocks massed  suddenly a cry from mescal halted him another a piercing scream of mortal fright sent him flying down the slope he bounded out of the cedars into the open  the white wellbunched flock had spread and streams of jumping sheep fled frantically from an enormous silverbacked bear  as the bear struck right and left a bruteengine of destruction jack sent a bullet into him at long range stung the grizzly whirled bit at his side and then reared with a roar of fury  but he did not see jack he dropped down and launched his huge bulk for mescal the blood rushed back to jacks heart and his empty veins seemed to freeze  the grizzly hurdled the streams of sheep terror for mescal dominated jack if he had possessed wings he could not have flown quickly enough to head the bear checking himself with a suddenness that fetched him to his knees he levelled the rifle it waved as if it were a stick of willow the beadsight described a blurred curve round the bear yet he shotin vainagainin vain  above the bleat of sheep and trample of many hoofs rang out mescals cry despairing  she had turned her hands over her breast wolf spread his legs before her and crouched to spring mane erect jaws wide  by some lightning flash of memory august naabs words steadied jacks shaken nerves he aimed low and ahead of the running bear down the beast went in a sliding sprawl with a muffled roar of rage up he sprang dangling a useless leg yet leaping swiftly forward one blow sent the attacking dog aside jack fired again the bear became a wrestling fiery demon deathstricken but full of savage fury jack aimed low and shot again  slowly now the grizzly reared his frosted coat bloodflecked his great head swaying another shot there was one wide sweep of the huge paw and then the bear sank forward drooping slowly and stretched all his length as if to rest  mescal recalled to life staggered backward between her and the outstretched paw was the distance of one short stride  jack bounding up made sure the bear was dead before he looked at mescal she was faint wolf whined about her piute came running from the cedars her eyes were still fixed in a look of fear  i couldnt runi couldnt move she said shuddering a blush drove the white from her cheeks as she raised her face to jack hed soon have reached me  piute added his encomium damnheap big bear jack kill umbig chief  hare laughed away his own fear and turned their attention to the stampeded sheep it was dark before they got the flock together again and they never knew whether they had found them all suppertime was unusually quiet that night piute was jovial but no one appeared willing to talk save the peon and he could only grimace the reaction of feeling following mescals escape had robbed jack of strength of voice he could scarcely whisper mescal spoke no word her black lashes hid her eyes she was silent but there was that in her silence which was eloquent wolf always indifferent save to mescal reacted to the subtle change and as if to make amends laid his head on jacks knees the quiet hour round the campfire passed and sleep claimed them another day dawned awakening them fresh faithful to their duties regardless of what had gone before  so the days slipped by june came with more leisure for the shepherds better grazing for the sheep heavier dews lighter frosts snowsqualls half rain and bursting blossoms on the prickly thorns wildprimrose patches in every shady spot and bluebells lifting wan azure faces to the sun  the last snowstorm of june threatened all one morning hung menacing over the yellow crags in dull lead clouds waiting for the wind then like ships heaving anchor to a single command they sailed down off the heights and the cedar forest became the centre of a blinding eddying storm the flakes were as large as feathers moist almost warm the low cedars changed to mounds of white the sheep became drooping curves of snow the little lambs were lost in the color of their own pure fleece though the storm had been long in coming it was brief in passing winddriven toward the desert it moaned its last in the cedars and swept away a sheeted pall out over the canyon it floated trailing long veils of white that thinned out darkened and failed far above the golden desert the winding columns of snow merged into straight lines of leaden rain the rain flowed into vapory mist and the mist cleared in the goldred glare of endless level and slope no moisture reached the parched desert  jack marched into camp with a snowy burden over his shoulder he flung it down disclosing a small deer then he shook the white mantle from his coat and whistling kicked the firelogs and looked abroad at the silver cedars now dripping under the sun at the rainbows in the settling mists at the rapidly melting snow on the ground  got lost in that squall fine fine he exclaimed and threw wide his arms  jack said mescal jack memory had revived some forgotten thing the dark olive of her skin crimsoned her eyes dilated and shadowed with a rare change of emotion  jack she repeated  well he replied in surprise  to look at youi never dreamedid forgotten  whats the matter with me demanded jack  wonderingly her mind on the past she replied you were dying when we found you at white sage  he drew himself up with a sharp catch in his breath and stared at her as if he saw a ghost  ohjack youre going to get well  her lips curved in a smile  for an instant jack hare spent his soul in searching her face for truth while waiting for death he had utterly forgotten it he remembered now when life gleamed in the girls dark eyes passionate joy flooded his heart  mescalmescal he cried brokenly the eyes were true that shed this sudden light on him glad and sweet were the lips that bade him hope and live again blindly instinctively he kissed thema kiss unutterably grateful then he fled into the forest running without aim  that flight ended in sheer exhaustion on the far rim of the plateau the spreading cedars seemed to have eyes and he shunned eyes in this hour god to think i cared so much he whispered what has happened with time relief came to limbs to labored breast and lungs but not to mind in doubt that would not die he looked at himself the leanness of arms the flat chest the hollows were gone he did not recognize his own body he breathed to the depths of his lungs no painonly exhilaration he pounded his chestno pain he dug his trembling fingers into the firm flesh over the apex of his right lungthe place of his tortureno pain  i wanted to live he cried he buried his face in the fragrant juniper he rolled on the soft brown mat of earth and hugged it close he cooled his hot cheeks in the primrose clusters he opened his eyes to new bright green of cedar to sky of a richer blue to a desert strange beckoning enthralling as life itself he counted backward a month two months and marvelled at the swiftness of time he counted time forward he looked into the future and all was beautifullong days long hunts long rides service to his friend freedom on the wild steppes bluewhite dawns upon the eastern crags redgold sunsets over the lilac mountains of the desert he saw himself in triumphant health and strength earning day by day the spirit of this wilderness coming to fight for it to live for it and in faroff time when he had won his victory to die for it  suddenly his mind was illumined the lofty plateau with its healing breath of sage and juniper had given back strength to him the silence and solitude and strife of his surroundings had called to something deep within him but it was mescal who made this wild life sweet and significant it was mescal the embodiment of the desert spirit like a man facing a great light hare divined his love through all the days on the plateau living with her the natural free life of indians close to the earth his unconscious love had ripened he understood now her charm for him he knew now the lure of her wonderful eyes flashing fire deserttrained like the falcon eyes of her indian grandfather the knowledge of what she had become to him dawned with a mounting desire that thrilled all his blood  twilight had enfolded the plateau when hare traced his way back to camp mescal was not there his supper awaited him piute hummed a song the peon sat grimacing at the fire hare told them to eat and moved away toward the rim  mescal was at her favorite seat with the white dog beside her and she watched the desert where the last glow of sunset gilded the mesas how cold and calm was her face how strange to him in this new character  mescal i didnt know i loved youthenbut i know it now  her face dropped quickly from its level poise hiding the brooding eyes her hand trembled on wolfs head  you spoke the truth ill get well id rather have had it from your lips than from any in the world i mean to live my life here where these wonderful things have come to me the friendship of the good man who saved me this wild free desert the glory of new hope strength lifeand love  he took her hand in his and whispered for i love you do you care for me mescal it must be complete do you carea little  the wind blew her dusky hair he could not see her face he tried gently to turn her to him the hand he had taken lay warm and trembling in his but it was not withdrawn as he waited in fear in hope it became still her slender form rigid within his arm gradually relaxed and yielded to him her face sank on his breast and her dark hair loosened from its band covered her and blew across his lips that was his answer  the wind sang in the cedars no longer a sigh sad as thoughts of a past forever flown but a song of what had come to him of hope of life of mescals love of the things to be     vii silvermane   little dew fell on the night of july first the dawn brightened without mists a hot sun rose the short summer of the plateau had begun  as hare rose refreshed and happy from his breakfast his whistle was cut short by the indian  ugh exclaimed piute lifting a dark finger black bolly had thrown her nosebag and slipped her halter and she moved toward the opening in the cedars her head high her black ears straight up  bolly called mescal the mare did not stop  what the deuce hare ran forward to catch her  i never knew bolly to act that way said mescal seeshe didnt eat half the oats well bollyjack look at wolf  the white dog had risen and stood warily shifting his nose he sniffed the wind turned round and round and slowly stiffened with his head pointed toward the eastern rise of the plateau  hold wolf hold called mescal as the dog appeared to be about to dash away  ugh grunted piute  listen jack did you hear whispered the girl  hear what  listen  the warm breeze came down in puffs from the crags it rustled in the cedars and blew fragrant whiffs of campfire smoke into his face and presently it bore a low prolonged whistle he had never before heard its like the sound broke the silence again clearer a keen sharp whistle  what is it he queried reaching for his rifle  wild mustangs said mescal  no corrected piute vehemently shaking his head clea clea  jack he says horse horse its a wild horse  a third time the whistle rang down from the ridge splitting the air strong and trenchant the fiery shrill challenge of a stallion  black bolly reared straight up  jack ran to the rise of ground above the camp and looked over the cedars oh he cried and beckoned for mescal she ran to him and piute tying black bolly hurried after look look cried jack he pointed to a ridge rising to the left of the yellow crags on the bare summit stood a splendid stallion clearly silhouetted against the ruddy morning sky he was an irongray wild and proud with long silverwhite mane waving in the wind  silvermane silvermane exclaimed mescal  what a magnificent animal jack stared at the splendid picture for the moment before the horse moved back along the ridge and disappeared other horses blacks and bays showed above the sage for a moment and they too passed out of sight  hes got some of his band with him said jack thrilled with excitement mescal theyre down off the upper range and grazing along easy the wind favors us that whistle was just plain fight judging from what naab told me of wild stallions he came to the hilltop and whistled down defiance to any horse wild or tame that might be below ill slip round through the cedars and block the trail leading up to the other range and you and piute close the gate of our trail at this end then send piute down to tell naab weve got silvermane  jack chose the lowest edge of the plateau rim where the cedars were thickest for his detour to get behind the wild band he ran from tree to tree avoiding the open places taking advantage of the thickets keeping away from the ridge he had never gone so far as the gate but knowing where the trail led into a split in the crags he climbed the slope and threaded a way over masses of fallen cliff until he reached the base of the wall the tracks of the wildhorse band were very fresh and plain in the yellow trail four stout posts guarded the opening and a number of bars lay ready to be pushed into place he put them up making a gate ten feet high an impregnable barrier this done he hurried back to camp  jack bolly will need more watching today than the sheep unless i let her loose why she pulls and strains so shell break that halter  she wants to go with the band isnt that it  i dont like to think so but father naab doesnt trust bolly though shes the best mustang he ever broke  better keep her in replied jack remembering naabs warning ill hobble her so if she does break loose she cant go far  when mescal and jack drove in the sheep that afternoon rather earlier than usual piute had returned with august naab dave and billy a string of mustangs and a packtrain of burros  hello mescal cheerily called august as they came into camp well jackbless me why my lad how fine and brownand yes how youve filled out he crushed jacks hand in his broad palm and his gray eyes beamed ive not the gift of revelationbut jack youre going to get well  yes i he had difficulty with his enunciation but he thumped his breast significantly and smiled  black sage and juniper exclaimed august in this air if a man doesnt go off quickly with pneumonia hell get well i never had a doubt for you jackand thank god  he questioned piute and mescal about the sheep and was greatly pleased with their report he shook his head when jack spread out the grizzlypelt and asked for the story of the killing jack made a poor showing with the tale and slighted his share in it but mescal told it as it actually happened and naabs great hand resounded from jacks shoulder then catching sight of the pile of coyote skins under the stone shelf he gave vent to his surprise and delight then he came back to the object of his trip upon the plateau  so youve corralled silvermane well jack if he doesnt jump over the cliff hes ours he cant get off any other way how many horses with him  we had no chance to count i saw at least twelve  good hes out with his picked band werent they all blacks and bays  yes  jack the history of that stallion wouldnt make you proud of him weve corralled him by a lucky chance if i dont miss my guess hes after bolly he has been a lot of trouble to ranchers all the way from the nevada line across utah the stallions hes killed the mares hes led off well dave shall we thirst him out or line up a long corral  better have a look around tomorrow replied dave itll take a lot of chasing to run him down but theres not a spring on the bench where we can throw up a trapcorral well have to chase him  mescal has bolly been good since silvermane came down  no she hasnt declared mescal and told of the circumstance  bollys all right said billy naab any mustang will do that keep her belled and hobbled  silvermane would care a lot about that if he wanted bolly wouldnt he queried dave in quiet scorn keep her roped and haltered i say  daves right said august you cant trust a wild mustang any more than a wild horse  august was right black bolly broke her halter about midnight and escaped into the forest hobbled as she was the indian heard her first and he awoke august who aroused the others  dont make any noise he said as jack came up throwing on his coat theres likely to be some fun here presently bollys loose broke her rope and i think silvermane is close listen sharp now  the slight breeze favored them the campfire was dead and the night was clear and starlit they had not been quiet many moments when the shrill neigh of a mustang rang out the naabs raised themselves and looked at one another in the starlight  now what do you think of that whispered billy  no more than i expected it was bolly replied dave  bolly it was confound her black hide added august now boys did she whistle for silvermane or to warn him which  no telling answered billy lets lie low and take a chance on him coming close it proves one thingyou cant break a wild mare that spirit may sleep in her blood maybe for years but some time itll answer to  shut uplisten interrupted dave  jack strained his hearing yet caught no sound except the distant yelp of a coyote moments went by  there whispered dave  from the direction of the ridge came the faint rattling of stones  theyre coming put in billy  presently sharp clicks preceded the rattles and the sounds began to merge into a regular rhythmic tramp it softened at intervals probably when the horses were under the cedars and strengthened as they came out on the harder ground of the open  i see them whispered dave  a black undulating line wound out of the cedars a line of horses approaching with drooping heads hurrying a little as they neared the spring  twentyodd all blacks and bays said august and some of them are mustangs but wheres silvermanehark  out among the cedars rose the peculiar halting thump of a hobbled horse trying to cover ground followed by snorts and crashings of brush and the pound of plunging hoofs the long black line stopped short and began to stamp then into the starlit glade below moved two shadows the first a great gray horse with snowy mane the second a small shiny black mustang  silvermane and bolly exclaimed august and now shes broken her hobbles  the stallion in the fulfilment of a conquest such as had made him king of the wild ranges was magnificent in action wheeling about her neighing and plunging he arched his splendid neck and pushed his head against her his action was that of a master suddenly black bolly snorted and whirled down the glade silvermane whistled one blast of anger or terror and thundered after her they vanished in the gloom of the cedars and the band of frightened horses and mustangs clattered after them  its one on me remarked billy that little mare played us at the finish caught when she was a yearling broken better than any mustang we ever had she has helped us run down many a stallion and now she runs off with that big whitemaned brute  theyll make a team and if they get out of here well have to chase them to the great salt basin replied dave  mescal thats a wellbehaved mustang of yours said august not only did she break loose but she whistled an alarm to silvermane and his band well roll in now everybody and sleep  at breakfast the following day the naabs fell into a discussion upon the possibility of there being other means of exit from the plateau than the two trails already closed they had never run any mustangs on the plateau and in the case of a wild horse like silvermane who would take desperate chances it was advisable to know the ground exactly billy and dave taking their mounts from the sheepcorral where they had put them up for the night rode in opposite directions around the rim of the plateau it was triangular in shape and some six or seven miles in circumference and the brothers rode around it in less than an hour  corralled said dave laconically  good did you see him what kind of a bunch has he with him asked his father  if we get the pick of the lot it will be worth two weeks work replied dave i saw him and bolly too i believe we can catch her easily she was off from the bunch and it looks as though the mares were jealous i think we can run her into a cove under the wall and get her then mescal can help us run down the stallion and you can look out on this end for the best level stretch to drop the line of cedars and make our trap  the brothers at their fathers nod rode off into the forest naab had detained the peon and now gave him orders and sent him off  tonight you can stand on the rim here and watch him signal across to the top of echo cliffs to the navajos explained august to jack ive sent for the best breaker of wild mustangs on the desert dave can break mustangs and piute is very good but i want the best man in the country because this is a grand horse and i intend to give him to you  to me exclaimed hare  yes and if hes broken right at the start hell serve you faithfully and not try to bite your arm off every day or kick your brains out no white man can break a wild mustang to the best advantage  why is that  i dont know to be truthful i have an idea its bad temper and lack of patience just wait till you see this navajo go at silvermane  after mescal and piute drove down the sheep jack accompanied naab to the corral  ive brought up your saddle said naab and you can put it on any mustang here  what a pleasure it was to be in the saddle again and to feel strength to remain there he rode with august all over the western end of the plateau they came at length to a strip of ground higher than the bordering forest which was comparatively free of cedars and brush and when august had surveyed it once he slapped his knee with satisfaction  fine better than i hoped for this stretch is about a mile long and narrow at this end now jack you see the other side faces the rim this side the forest and at the end here is a wall of rock luckily it curves in a half circle which will save us work well cut cedars drag them in line and make a big corral against the rock from the opening in the corral well build two fences of trees then well chase silvermane till hes done run him down into this level and turn him inside the fence no horse can break through a close line of cedars hell run till hes in the corral and then well rope him  great said jack all enthusiasm but isnt it going to take a lot of work  rather said august dryly itll take a week to cut and drag the cedars let alone to tire out that wild stallion when the finish comes you want to be on that ledge where well have the corral  they returned to camp and prepared supper mescal and piute soon arrived and later dave and billy on jaded mustangs black bolly limped behind stretching a long halter an unhappy mustang with dusty foamstained coat and hanging head  not bad said august examining the lame leg shell be fit in a few days long before we need her to help run down silvermane bring the liniment and a cloth one of you and put her in the sheepcorral tonight  mescals love for the mustang shone in her eyes while she smoothed out the crumpled mane and petted the slender neck  bolly to think youd do it and bolly dropped her head as though really ashamed  when darkness fell they gathered on the rim to watch the signals a fire blazed out of the black void below and as they waited it brightened and flamed higher  ugh said piute pointing across to the dark line of cliffs  of course hed see it first laughed naab dave have you caught it yet jack see if you can make out a fire over on echo cliffs  no i dont see any light except that white star have you seen it  long ago replied naab here sight along my finger and narrow your eyes down  i believe i see ityes im sure  good how about you mescal  yes she replied  jack was amused for dave insisted that he had been next to the indian and billy claimed priority to all of them to these men bred on the desert keen sight was preeminently the chief of gifts  jack look sharp said august peon is blanketing his fire see the flicker one twoone twoone now for the answer  jack peered out into the shadowy space starstudded above ebony below far across the depths shone a pinpoint of steady light the indian grunted again august vented his ha and then jack saw the light blink like a star go out for a second and blink again  thats what i like to see said august were answered now alls over but the work  work it certainly was as jack discovered next day he helped the brothers cut down cedars while august hauled them into line with his roan what with this labor and the necessary camp duties nearly a week passed and in the mean time black bolly recovered from her lameness  twice the workers saw silvermane standing on open high ridges restive and suspicious with his silver mane flying and his head turned over his shoulder watching always watching  itd be worth something to find out how long that stallion could go without water commented dave but well make his tongue hang out tomorrow itd serve him right to break him with black bolly  daylight came warm and misty veils unrolled from the desert a purple curtain lifted from the eastern crags then the red sun burned  dave and billy naab mounted their mustangs and each led another mount by a halter  well go to the ridge cut silvermane out of his band and warm him up then well drive him down to this end  hare in his eagerness found the time very tedious while august delayed about camp punching new holes in his saddlegirth shortening his stirrups and smoothing kinks out of his lasso at last he saddled the roan and also black bolly mescal came out of her tent ready for the chase she wore a short skirt of buckskin and leggings of the same material her hair braided and fastened at the back was bound by a double band closely fitting her black head hare walked leading two mustangs by the halters and naab and mescal rode each of them followed by two other spare mounts august tied three mustangs at one point along the level stretch and three at another then he led mescal and jack to the top of the stone wall above the corral where they had good view of a considerable part of the plateau  the eastern rise of ground a sage and juniper slope was in plain sight hare saw a white flash then silvermane broke out of the cedars into the sage one of the brothers raced him half the length of the slope and then the other coming out headed him off down toward the forest soon the pounding of hoofs sounded through the trees nearer and nearer silvermane came out straight ahead on the open level he was running easily  he hasnt opened up yet said august  hare watched the stallion with sheer fascination he ran seemingly without effort what a stride he had how beautifully his silver mane waved in the wind he veered off to the left out of sight in the brush while dave and billy galloped up to the spot where august had tied the first three mustangs here they dismounted changed saddles to fresh horses and were off again  the chase now was close and all downhill for the watchers silvermane twinkled in and out among the cedars and suddenly stopped short on the rim he wheeled and coursed away toward the crags and vanished but soon he reappeared for billy had cut across and faced him about again he struck the level stretch dave was there in front of him he shot away to the left and flashed through the glades beyond the brothers saved their steeds content to keep him cornered in that end of the plateau then august spurred his roan into the scene of action silvermane came out on the one piece of rising ground beyond the level and stood looking backward toward the brothers when the great roan crashed through the thickets into his sight he leaped as if he had been stung and plunged away  the naabs had hemmed him in a triangle dave and billy at the broad end august at the apex and now the real race began august chased him up and down along the rim across to the long line of cedars always in the end heading him for the open stretch down this he fled with flying mane only to be checked by the relentless brothers to cover this broad end of the open required riding the like of which hare had never dreamed of the brothers taking advantage of the brief periods when the stallion was going toward august changed their tired mustangs for fresh ones  ho mescal rolled out augusts voice that was the call for mescal to put black bolly after silvermane her fleetness made the other mustangs seem slow all in a flash she was round the corral with silvermane between her and the long fence of cedars uttering a piercing snort of terror the gray stallion lunged out for the first time panicstricken and lengthened his stride in a wonderful way he raced down the stretch with his head over his shoulder watching the little black seeing her gaining he burst into desperate headlong flight he saved nothing he had found his match he won that first race down the level but it had cost him his best if he had been fresh he might have left black bolly far behind but now he could not elude her  august naab let him run this time and silvermane keeping close to the fence passed the gate ran down to the rim and wheeled the black mustang was on him again holding him in close to the fence driving him back down the stretch  the brothers remorselessly turned him and now mescal forcing the running caught him lashed his haunches with her whip and drove him into the gate of the corral  august and his two sons were close behind and blocked the gate silvermanes race was nearly run  hold here boys said august ill go in and drive him round and round till hes done then when i yell you stand aside and rope him as he comes out  silvermane ran round the corral tore at the steep scaly walls fell back and began his weary round again and yet again then as sense and courage yielded gradually to unreasoning terror he ran blindly every time he passed the guarded gateway his eyes were wilder and his stride more labored  now yelled august naab  mescal drew out of the opening and dave and billy pulled away one on each side their lassoes swinging loosely  silvermane sprang for the opening with something of his old speed as he went through yellow loops flashed in the sun circling narrowing and he seemed to run straight into them one loop whipped close round his glossy neck the other caught his head daves mustang staggered under the violent shock went to his knees struggled up and held firmly bills mount slid on his haunches and spilled his rider from the saddle silvermane seemed to be climbing into the air then august naab darting through the gate in a cloud of dust shot his lasso catching the right foreleg silvermane landed hard his hoofs striking fire from the stones and for an instant strained in convulsive struggle then fell heaving and groaning in a twinkling billy loosened his lasso over a knot making of it a halter and tied the end to a cedar stump  the naabs stood back and gazed at their prize  silvermane was badly spent he was wet with foam but no fleck of blood marred his mane his superb coat showed scratches but none cut into the flesh after a while he rose panting heavily and trembling in every muscle he was a beaten horse the noble head was bowed yet he showed no viciousness only the fear of a trapped animal he eyed black bolly and then the halter as though he had divined the fatal connection between them   viii the breaker of wild mustangs   for a few days after the capture of silvermane a time full to the brim of excitement for hare he had no word with mescal save for morning and evening greetings when he did come to seek her with a purpose which had grown more impelling since august naabs arrival he learned to his bewilderment that she avoided him she gave him no chance to speak with her alone her accustomed restingplace on the rim at sunset knew her no more early after supper she retired to her tent  hare nursed a grievance for fortyeight hours and then taking advantage of piutes absence on an errand down to the farm and of the naabs strenuous day with four vicious wild horses in the corral at one time he walked out to the pasture where mescal shepherded the flock  mescal why are you avoiding me he asked what has happened  she looked tired and unhappy and her gaze instead of meeting his wandered to the crags  nothing she replied  but there must be something you have given me no chance to talk to you and i wanted to know if youd let me speak to father naab  to father naab whywhat about  about you of courseand methat i love you and want to marry you  she turned white nono  hare paused blankly not so much at her refusal as at the unmistakable fear in her face  whynot he asked presently with an odd sense of trouble there was more here than mescals habitual shyness  because hell be terribly angry  angryi dont understand why angry  the girl did not answer and looked so forlorn that hare attempted to take her in his arms she resisted and broke from him  you must nevernever do that again  hare drew back sharply  why not whats wrong you must tell me mescal  i remembered she hung her head  rememberedwhat  i am pledged to marry father naabs eldest son  for a moment hare did not understand he stared at her unbelievingly  what did you say he asked slowly  mescal repeated her words in a whisper  butbut mescali love you you let me kiss you said hare stupidly as if he did not grasp her meaning you let me kiss you he repeated  oh jack i forgot she wailed it was so new so strange to have you up here it was like a kind of dream and afterafter you kissed me ii found out  what mescal  her silence answered him  but mescal if you really love me you cant marry any one else said hare it was the simple persistence of a simple swain  oh you dont know you dont know its impossible  impossible hares anger flared up you let me believe i had won you what kind of a girl are you you were not true your actions were lies  not lies she faltered and turned her face from him  with no gentle hand he grasped her arm and forced her to look at him but the misery in her eyes overcame him and he roughly threw his arms around her and held her close  it cant be a lie you do care for melove me look at me he drew her head back from his breast her face was pale and drawn her eyes closed tight with tears forcing a way out under the long lashes her lips were parted he bowed to their sweet nearness he kissed them again and again while the shade of the cedars seemed to whirl about him i love you mescal you are minei will have youi will keep youi will not let him have you  she vibrated to that like a keen strung wire under a strong touch all in a flash the trembling shamestricken girl was transformed she leaned back in his arms supple pliant with quivering life and for the first time gave him wideopen level eyes in which there were now no tears no shyness no fear but a dark smouldering fire  you do love me mescal  ii couldnt help it  there was a pause tense with feeling  mescal tell meabout your being pledged he said at last  i gave him my promise because there was nothing else to do i was pledged toto him in the church at white sage it cant be changed ive got to marryfather naabs eldest son  eldest son echoed jack suddenly mindful of the implication why thats snap naab ah i begin to see light thatmescal  i hate him  you hate him and youre pledged to marry him god mescal id utterly forgotten snap naab already has a wife  youve also forgotten that were mormons  are you a mormon he queried bluntly  ive been raised as one  thats not an answer are you one do you believe any man under gods sky ought to have more than one wife at a time  no but ive been taught that it gave woman greater glory in heaven there have been men here before you men who talked to me and i doubted before i ever saw you and afterwardi knew  would not father naab release you  release me why he would have taken me as a wife for himself but for mother mary she hates me so he pledged me to snap  does august naab love you  love me no not in the way you meanperhaps as a daughter but mormons teach duty to church first and say such love comesto the wivesafterward but it doesntnot in the women ive seen theres mother ruthher heart is broken she loves me and i can tell  when was thisthis marriage to be  i dont know father naab promised me to his son when he came home from the navajo range it would be soon if they found out that you and ijack snap naab would kill you  the sudden thought startled the girl her eyes betrayed her terror  i mightnt be so easy to kill said hare darkly the words came unbidden his first answer to the wild influences about him mescal im sorrymaybe ive brought you unhappiness  no no to be with you has been like sitting there on the rim watching the desert the greatest happiness i have ever known i used to love to be with the children but mother mary forbade when i am down there which is seldom im not allowed to play with the children any more  what can i do asked hare passionately  dont speak to father naab dont let him guess dont leave me here alone she answered low it was not the navajo speaking in her now love had sounded depths hitherto unplumbed a quick soft impulsiveness made the contrast sharp and vivid  how can i help but leave you if he wants me on the cattle ranges  i dont know you must think he has been so pleased with what youve done hes had mormons up here and two men not of his church and they did nothing youve been ill besides youre different he will keep me with the sheep as long as he can for two reasonsbecause i drive them best he says and because snap naabs wife must be persuaded to welcome me in her home  ill stay if i have to get a relapse and go down on my back again declared jack i hate to deceive him but mescal pledged or noti love you and i wont give up hope  her hands flew to her face again and tried to hide the dark blush  mescal theres one question i wish youd answer does august naab think hell make a mormon of me is that the secret of his wonderful kindness  of course he believes hell make a mormon of you thats his religion hes felt that way over all the strangers who ever came out here but hed be the same to them without his hopes i dont know the secret of his kindness but i think he loves everybody and everything and jack hes so good i owe him all my life he would not let the navajos take me he raised me kept me taught me i cant break my promise to him hes been a father to me and i love him  i think i love him too replied hare simply  with an effort he left her at last and mounted the grassy slope and climbed high up among the tottering yellow crags and there he battled with himself whatever the charm of mescals surrender and the insistence of his love stern hammerstrokes of fairness duty honor beat into his brain his debt to the man who had saved him it was a longdrawnout battle not to be won merely by saying right was right he loved mescal she loved him and something born in him with his new health with the breath of this sage and juniper forest with the sight of purple canyons and silent beckoning desert made him fiercely tenacious of all that life had come to mean for him he could not give her upand yet  twilight forced hare from his lofty retreat and he trod his way campward weary and jaded but victorious over himself he thought he had renounced his hope of mescal he returned with a resolve to be true to august and to himself bitterness he would not allow himself to feel and yet he feared the rising in him of a new spirit akin to that of the desert itself intractable and free  well jack we rode down the last of silvermanes band said august at supper the navajos came up and helped us out tomorrow youll see some fun when we start to break silvermane as soon as thats done ill go leaving the indians to bring the horses down when theyre broken  are you going to leave silvermane with me asked jack  surely why in three days if i dont lose my guess hell be like a lamb those desert stallions can be made into the finest kind of saddlehorses ive seen one or two i want you to stay up here with the sheep youre getting well youll soon be a strapping big fellow then when we drive the sheep down in the fall you can begin life on the cattle ranges driving wild steers theres where youll grow lean and hard like an iron bar youll need that horse too my lad  whybecause hes fast queried jack quickly answering to the implied suggestion  august nodded gloomily i havent the gift of revelation but ive come to believe martin cole holderness is building an outpost for his riders close to seeping springs he has no water if he tries to pipe my water the pause was not a threat it implied the mormons doubt of himself then dene is on the march this way hes driven some of marshalls cattle from the range next to mine dene got away with about a hundred head the barefaced robber sold them in lund to a buying company from salt lake  is he openly an outlaw a rustler inquired hare  everybody knows it and hes finding white sage and vicinity warmer than it was every time he comes in he and his band shoot up things pretty lively now the mormons are slow to wrath but they are awakening all the way from salt lake to the border outlaws have come in theyll never get the power on this desert that they had in the places from which theyve been driven men of the holderness type are more to be dreaded hes a rancher greedy unscrupulous but hard to corner in dishonesty dene is only a bad man a gunfighter he and all his ilk will get run out of utah did you ever hear of plummer john slade boone helm any of those bad men  no  well they were men to fear plummer was a sheriff in idaho a man high in the estimation of his townspeople but he was the leader of the most desperate band of criminals ever known in the west and he instigated the murder of or killed outright more than one hundred men slade was a bad man fatal on the draw helm was a killing machine these men all tried utah and had to get out so will dene have to get out but im afraid therell be warm times before that happens when you get in the thick of it youll appreciate silvermane  i surely will but i cant see that wild stallion with a saddle and a bridle eating oats like any common horse and being led to water  well hell come to your whistle presently if im not greatly mistaken you must make him love you jack it can be done with any wild creature be gentle but firm teach him to obey the slightest touch of rein to stand when you throw your bridle on the ground to come at your whistle always remember this hes a desertbred horse he can live on scant browse and little water never break him of those best virtues in a horse never feed him grain if you can find a little patch of browse never give him a drink till he needs it thats onetenth as often as a tame horse some day youll be caught in the desert and with these qualities of endurance silvermane will carry you out  silvermane snorted defiance from the cedar corral next morning when the naabs and indians and hare appeared a halfnaked sinewy navajo with a face as changeless as a bronze mask sat astride augusts blindfolded roan charger he rode bareback except for a blanket strapped upon the horse he carried only a long thick halter with a loop and a knot when august opened the improvised gate with its sharp bayonetlike branches of cedar the indian rode into the corral the watchers climbed to the knoll silvermane snorted a blast of fear and anger augusts huge roan showed uneasiness he stamped and shook his head as if to rid himself of the blinders  into the farthest corner of densely packed cedar boughs silvermane pressed himself and watched the indian rode around the corral circling closer and closer yet appearing not to see the stallion many rounds he made closer he got and always with the same steady gait silvermane left his corner and tried another the old unwearying round brought charger and the navajo close by him silvermane pranced out of his thicket of boughs he whistled he wheeled with his shiny hoofs lifting in an hour the indian was edging the outer circle of the corral with the stallion pivoting in the centre ears laid back eyes shooting sparks fight in every line of him and the circle narrowed inward  suddenly the navajo sent the roan at silvermane and threw his halter it spread out like a lasso and the loop went over the head of the stallion slipped to the knot and held fast while the rope tightened silvermane leaped up forehoofs pawing the air and his long shrill cry was neither whistle snort nor screech but all combined he came down missing charger with his hoofs sliding off his haunches the indian his bronze muscles rippling closehauled on the rope making half hitches round his bony wrist  in a whirl of dust the roan drew closer to the gray and silvermane began a mad race around the corral the roan ran with him nose to nose when silvermane saw he could not shake him he opened his jaws rolled back his lip in an ugly snarl his white teeth glistening and tried to bite but the indians moccasined foot shot up under the stallions ear and pressed him back then the roan hugged silvermane so close that half the time the navajo virtually rode two horses but for the rigidity of his arms and the play and sudden tension of his legmuscles the indians work would have appeared commonplace so dexterous was he so perfectly at home in his dangerous seat suddenly he whooped and august naab hauled back the gate and the two horses neck and neck thundered out upon the level stretch  good cried august let him rip now navvy all over but the work jack i feared silvermane would spear himself on some of those dead cedar spikes in the corral hes safe now  jack watched the horses plunge at breakneck speed down the stretch circle at the forest edge and come tearing back silvermane was pulling the roan faster than he had ever gone in his life but the dark indian kept his graceful seat the speed slackened on the second turn and decreased as mile after mile the imperturbable indian held roan and gray side to side and let them run  the time passed but hares interest in the breaking of the stallion never flagged he began to understand the indian and to feel what the restraint and drag must be to the horse never for a moment could silvermane elude the huge roan the tight halter the relentless navajo gallop fell to trot and trot to jog and jog to walk and hour by hour without whip or spur or word the breaker of desert mustangs drove the wild stallion if there were cruelty it was in his implacable slow patience his farsighted purpose silvermane would have killed himself in an hour he would have cut himself to pieces in one headlong dash but that steel arm suffered him only to wear himself out late that afternoon the navajo led a dripping drooping foamlashed stallion into the corral tied him with the halter and left him  later silvermane drank of the water poured into the corral trough and had not the strength or spirit to resent the navajos caressing hand on his mane  next morning the indian rode again into the corral on blindfolded charger again he dragged silvermane out on the level and drove him up and down with remorseless machinelike persistence at noon he took him back tied him up and roped him fast silvermane tried to rear and kick but the saddle went on strapped with a flash of the darkskinned hands then again silvermane ran the level stretch beside the giant roan only he carried a saddle now at the first he broke out with free wild stride as if to run forever from under the hateful thing but as the afternoon waned he crept weariedly back to the corral  on the morning of the third day the navajo went into the corral without charger and roped the gray tied him fast and saddled him then he loosed the lassoes except the one around silvermanes neck which he whipped under his foreleg to draw him down silvermane heaved a groan which plainly said he never wanted to rise again swiftly the indian knelt on the stallions head his hands flashed there was a scream a click of steel on bone and proud silvermane jumped to his feet with a bit between his teeth  the navajo firmly in the saddle rose with him and silvermane leaped through the corral gate and out upon the stretch lengthening out with every stride and settling into a wild despairing burst of speed the white mane waved in the wind the halfnaked navajo swayed to the motion horse and rider disappeared in the cedars  they were gone all day toward night they appeared on the stretch the indian rode into camp and dismounting handed the bridlerein to naab he spoke no word his dark impassiveness invited no comment silvermane was dustcovered and sweatstained his silver crest had the same proud beauty his neck still the splendid arch his head the noble outline but his was a broken spirit  here my lad said august naab throwing the bridlerein over hares arm what did i say once about seeing you on a great gray horse ah well take him and know this youve the swiftest horse in this desert country     ix the scent of desertwater   soon the shepherds were left to a quiet unbroken by the whistle of wild mustangs the whoop of hunters the ring of ironshod hoofs on the stones the scream of an eagle the bleating of sheep the bark of a coyote were once more the only familiar sounds accentuating the silence of the plateau for hare time seemed to stand still he thought but little his whole life was a matter of feeling from without he rose at dawn never failing to see the red sun tip the eastern crags he glowed with the touch of cold springwater and the morning air he trailed silvermane under the cedars and thrilled when the stallion answering his call thumped the ground with hobbled feet and came his way learning day by day to be glad at sight of his master he rode with mescal behind the flock he hunted hour by hour crawling over the fragrant brown mats of cedar through the sage and juniper up the grassy slopes he rode back to camp beside mescal drove the sheep and put silvermane to his fleetest to beat black bolly down the level stretch where once the gray even with freedom at stake had lost to the black then back to camp and fire and curling blue smoke a supper that testified to busy piutes farmward trips sunset on the rim endless changing desert the wind in the cedars bright stars in the blue and sleepso time stood still  mescal and hare were together or never far apart from dawn to night until the sheep were in the corral every moment had its duty from campwork and care of horses to the many problems of the flock so that they earned the rest on the rimwall at sundown only a touch of hands bridged the chasm between them they never spoke of their love of mescals future of jacks return to hearth a glance and a smile scarcely sad yet not altogether happy was the substance of their dream where jack had once talked about the canyon and desert he now seldom spoke at all from watching mescal he had learned that to see was enough but there were moments when some association recalled the past and the strangeness of the present faced him then he was wont to question mescal  what are you thinking of he asked curiously interrupting their silence she leaned against the rocks and kept a changeless tranquil unseeing gaze on the desert the level eyes were full of thought of sadness of mystery they seemed to look afar  then she turned to him with puzzled questioning look and enigmatical reply thinking asked her eyes i wasnt thinking were her words  i fanciedi dont know exactly what he went on you looked so earnest do you ever think of going to the navajos  no  or across that painted desert to find some place you seem to know or see  no  i dont know why but mescal sometimes i have the queerest ideas when i catch your eyes watching watching you look at once happy and sad you see something out there that i cant see your eyes are haunted ive a feeling that if id look into them id see the sun setting the clouds coloring the twilight shadows changing and then back of that the secret of it allof youoh i cant explain but it seems so  i never had a secret except the one you know she answered you ask me so often what i think about and you always ask me when were here she was silent for a pause i dont think at all till you make me its beautiful out there but thats not what it is to me i cant tell you when i sit down here all within me isis somehow stilled i watchand its different from what it is now since youve made me think then i watch and i see thats all  it came to hare afterward with a little start of surprise that mescals purposeless yet allsatisfying watchful gaze had come to be part of his own experience it was inscrutable to him but he got from it a fancy which he tried in vain to dispel that something would happen to them out there on the desert  and then he realized that when they returned to the campfire they seemed freed from this spell of the desert the blazelit circle was shut in by the darkness and the immensity of their wild environment because for the hour it could not be seen lost its paralyzing effect hare fell naturally into a talkative mood mescal had developed a vivacity an ambition which contrasted strongly with her silent moods she became alive and curious human like the girls he had known in the east and she fascinated him the more for this complexity  the july rains did not come the mists failed the dews no longer freshened the grass and the hot sun began to tell on shepherds and sheep both sought the shade the flowers withered firstall the bluebells and lavender patches of primrose and paleyellow lilies and white thistleblossoms only the deep magenta of cactus and vermilion of indian paintbrush flowers of the sun survived the heat day by day the shepherds scanned the sky for stormclouds that did not appear the spring ran lower and lower at last the ditch that carried water to the corral went dry and the margin of the pool began to retreat then mescal sent piute down for august naab  he arrived at the plateau the next day with dave and at once ordered the breaking up of camp  it will rain some time he said but we cant wait any longer dave when did you last see the blue star waterhole  on the trip in from silver cup ten days ago the waterhole was full then  will there be water enough now  weve got to chance it theres no water here and no springs on the upper range where we can drive sheep weve got to go round under the star  thats so replied august his fears needed confirmation because his hopes always influenced his judgment till no hope was left i wish i had brought zeke and george itll be a hard drive though weve got jack and mescal to help  hot as it was august naab lost no time in the start piute led the train on foot and the flock used to following him got under way readily dave and mescal rode along the sides and august with jack came behind with the packburros bringing up the rear wolf circled them all keeping the flanks close in heading the lambs that strayed and ever vigilant made the drive orderly and rapid  the trail to the upper range was wide and easy of ascent the first of it winding under crags the latter part climbing long slopes it forked before the summit where dark pine trees showed against the sky one fork ascending the other which piute took beginning to go down it admitted of no extended view being shut in for the most part on the left but there were times when hare could see a curving stream of sheep on half a mile of descending trail once started down the flock could not be stopped that was as plain as piutes hard task there were times when hare could have tossed a pebble on the indian just below him yet there were more than three thousand sheep strung out in line between them clouds of dust rolled up sheets of gravel and shale rattled down the inclines the clatter clatter clatter of little hoofs the steady baabaabaa filled the air save for the crowding of lambs off the trail and a jamming of sheep in the corners the drive went on without mishap hare was glad to see the lambs scramble back bleating for their mothers and to note that though peril threatened at every steep turn the steady downflow always made space for the sheep behind he was glad too when through a wide break ahead his eye followed the face of a vast cliff down to the red ground below and he knew the flock would soon be safe on the level  a blast as from a furnace smote hare from this open break in the wall the air was dustladen and carried besides the smell of dust and the warm breath of desert growths a dank odor that was unpleasant  the sheep massed in a flock on the level and the drivers spread to their places the route lay under projecting red cliffs between the base and enormous sections of wall that had broken off and fallen far out there was no weathering slope the wind had carried away the smaller stones and particles and had cut the huge pieces of pinnacle and tower into hollowed forms this zone of rim merged into another of strange contrast the sloping red stream of sand which flowed from the wall of the canyon  piute swung the flock up to the left into an amphitheatre and there halted the sheep formed a densely packed mass in the curve of the wall dave naab galloped back toward august and hare and before he reached them shouted out the waterholes plugged  what yelled his father  plugged filled with stone and sand  was it a cavein  i reckon not theres been no rain  august spurred his roan after dave and hare kept close behind them till they reined in on a muddy bank what had once been a waterhole was a red and yellow heap of shale fragments of stones gravel and sand there was no water and the sheep were bleating august dismounted and climbed high above the hole to examine the slope soon he strode down with giant steps his huge fists clinched shaking his gray mane like a lion  ive found the tracks somebody climbed up and rolled the stones started the cavein who  holdernesss men they did the same for martin coles waterhole at rocky point how old are the tracks  two days perhaps we cant follow them what can be done  some of holdernesss men are mormons and others are square fellows they wouldnt stand for such work as this and somebody ought to ride in there and tell them  and get shot up by the men paid to do the dirty work no i wont hear of it this amounts to nothing we seldom use this hole only twice a year when driving the flock but it makes me fear for silver cup and seeping springs  it makes me fear for the sheep if this wind doesnt change  ah i had forgotten the river scent its not strong tonight we might venture if it wasnt for the strip of sand well camp here and start the drive at dawn  the sun went down under a crimson veil a dull glow spread fanshaped upward twilight faded to darkness with the going down of the wind august naab paced to and fro before his tired and thirsty flock  id like to know said hare to dave why those men filled up this waterhole  holderness wants to cut us off from silver cup spring and this was a halfway waterhole probably he didnt know we had the sheep upland but he wouldnt have cared hes set himself to get our cattle range and hell stop at nothing prospects look black for us father never gives up he doesnt believe yet that we can lose our water he prays and hopes and sees good and mercy in his worst enemies  if holderness works as far as silver cup how will he go to work to steal another mans range and water  hell throw up a cabin send in his men drive in ten thousand steers  well will his men try to keep you away from your own water or your cattle  not openly theyll pretend to welcome us and drive our cattle away in our absence you see there are only five of us to ride the ranges and wed need five times five to watch all the stock  then you cant stop this outrage  theres only one way said dave significantly tapping the black handle of his colt holderness thinks he pulls the wool over our eyes by talking of the cattle company that employs him hes the company himself and hes hand and glove with dene  and i suppose if your father and you boys were to ride over to holdernesss newest stand and tell him to get off there would be a fight  wed never reach him now that is if we went together one of us alone might get to see him especially in white sage if we all rode over to his ranch wed have to fight his men before we reached the corrals you yourself will find it pretty warm when you go out with us on the ranges and if you make white sage youll find it hot youre called denes spy there and the rustlers are still looking for you i wouldnt worry about it though  why not id like to know inquired hare with a short laugh  well if youre like the other gentiles who have come into utah you wont have scruples about drawing on a man father says the draw comes natural to you and youre as quick as he is then he says you can beat any rifle shot he ever saw and that longbarrelled gun youve got will shoot a mile so if it comes to shootingwhy you can shoot if you want to runwhos going to catch you on that whitemaned stallion we talked about you george and i were mighty glad youre well and can ride with us  long into the night jack hare thought over this talk it opened up a vista of the rangelife into which he was soon to enter he tried to silence the voice within that cried out eager and reckless for the long rides on the windy open the years of his illness returned in fancy the narrow room with the lamp and the book and the tears over stories and dreams of adventure never to be for such as he and now how wonderful was life it was after all to be full for him it was already full already he slept on the ground open to the sky he looked up at a wild black cliff mountainhigh with its windworn star of blue he felt himself on the threshold of the desert with that subtle mystery waiting he knew himself to be close to strenuous action on the ranges companion of these sombre mormons exposed to their peril making their cause his cause their life his life what of their friendship their confidence was he worthy would he fail at the pinch what a man he must become to approach their simple estimate of him because he had found health and strength because he could shoot because he had the fleetest horse on the desert were these reasons for their friendship no these were only reasons for their trust august naab loved him mescal loved him dave and george made of him a brother they shall have my life he muttered  the bleating of the sheep heralded another day with the brightening light began the drive over the sand under the cliff the shade was cool and fresh there was no wind the sheep made good progress but the broken line of shade crept inward toward the flock and passed it the sun beat down and the wind arose a red haze of fine sand eddied about the toiling sheep and shepherds piute trudged ahead leading the kingram old socker the leader of the flock mescal and hare rode at the right turning their faces from the sandfilled puffs of wind august and dave drove behind wolf as always took care of the stragglers an hour went by without signs of distress and with half the fivemile trip at his back august naabs voice gathered cheer the sun beat hotter another hour told a different storythe sheep labored they had to be forced by urge of whip by knees of horses by wolfs threatening bark they stopped altogether during the frequent hot sandblasts and could not be driven so time dragged the flock straggled out to a long irregular line rams refused to budge till they were ready sheep lay down to rest lambs fell but there was an end to the belt of sand and august naab at last drove the lagging trailers out upon the stony bench  the sun was about two hours past the meridian the red walls of the desert were closing in the vshaped split where the colorado cut through was in sight the trail now was wide and unobstructed and the distance short yet august naab ever and anon turned to face the canyon and shook his head in anxious foreboding  it quickly dawned upon hare that the sheep were behaving in a way new and singular to him they packed densely now crowding forward many raising their heads over the haunches of others and bleating they were not in their usual calm pattering hurry but nervous excited and continually facing west toward the canyon noses up  on the top of the next little ridge hare heard silvermane snort as he did when led to drink there was a scent of water on the wind hare caught it a damp muggy smell the sheep had noticed it long before and now under its nearer stronger influence began to bleat wildly to run faster to crowd without aim  theres work ahead keep them packed and going turn the wheelers ordered august  what had been a drive became a flight and it was well so long as the sheep headed straight up the trail piute had to go to the right to avoid being run down mescal rode up to fill his place hare took his cue from dave and rode along the flank crowding the sheep inward august cracked his whip behind for half a mile the flock kept to the trail then as if by common consent they sheered off to the right with this move august and dave were transformed from quiet almost to frenzy they galloped to the fore and into the very faces of the turning sheep and drove them back then the rearguard of the flock curved outward  drive them in roared august  hare sent silvermane at the deflecting sheep and frightened them into line  wolf no longer had power to chase the stragglers they had to be turned by a horse all along the flank noses pointed outward here and there sheep wilder than the others leaped forward to lead a widening wave of bobbing woolly backs mescal engaged one point hare another dave another and august naabs roan thundered up and down the constantly broken line all this while as the shepherds fought back the sheep the flight continued faster eastward farther canyonward each side gained but the flock gained more toward the canyon than the drivers gained toward the oasis  by augusts hoarse yells by daves stern face and ceaseless swift action by the increasing din hare knew terrible danger hung over the flock what it was he could not tell he heard the roar of the river rapids and it seemed that the sheep heard it with him they plunged madly they had gone wild from the scent and sound of water their eyes gleamed red their tongues flew out there was no aim to the rush of the great body of sheep but they followed the leaders and the leaders followed the scent and the drivers headed them off rode them down ceaselessly riding forward to check one outbreak wheeling backward to check another  the flight became a rout hare was in the thick of dust and din of the terrorstricken jumping mob of the everstarting everwidening streams of sheep he rode and yelled and fired his colt the dust choked him the sun burned him the flying pebbles cut his cheek once he had a glimpse of black bolly in a melee of dust and sheep daves mustang blurred in his sight augusts roan seemed to be double then silvermane of his own accord was out before them all  the sheep had almost gained the victory their keen noses were pointed toward the water nothing could stop their flight but still the drivers dashed at them ever fighting never wearying never ceasing  at the last incline where a gentle slope led down to a dark break in the desert the rout became a stampede left and right flanks swung round the line lengthened and round the struggling horses kneedeep in woolly backs split the streams to flow together beyond in one resistless river of sheep mescal forced bolly out of danger dave escaped the right flank august and hare swept on with the flood till the horses sighting the dark canyon halted to stand like rocks  will they run over the rim yelled hare horrified his voice came to him as a whisper august naab sweatstained in red dust haggard gray locks streaming in the wind raised his arms above his head hopeless  the long nodding line of woolly forms lifting like the crest of a yellow wave plunged out and down in rounded billow over the canyon rim with din of hoofs and bleats the sheep spilled themselves over the precipice and an awful deafening roar boomed up from the river like the spreading thunderous crash of an avalanche  how endless seemed that fatal plunge the last line of sheep pressing close to those gone before and yet impelled by the strange instinct of life turned their eyes too late on the brink carried over by their own momentum  the sliding roar ceased its echo muffled and hollow pealed from the cliffs then rumbled down the canyon to merge at length in the sullen dull continuous sound of the rapids  hare turned at last from that narrow ironwalled cleft the depth of which he had not seen and now had no wish to see and his eyes fell upon a little navajo lamb limping in the trail of the flock headed for the canyon as sure as its mother in purpose he dismounted and seized it to find to his infinite wonder and gladness that it wore a string and bell round its neck it was mescals pet     x riding the ranges   the shepherds were home in the oasis that evening and next day the tragedy of the sheep was a thing of the past no other circumstance of hares four months with the naabs had so affected him as this swift inevitable sweeping away of the flock nothing else had so vividly told him the nature of this country of abrupt heights and depths he remembered august naabs magnificent gesture of despair and now the man was cheerful again he showed no sign of his great loss his tasks were many and when one was done he went on to the next if hare had not had many proofs of this mormons feeling he would have thought him callous august naab trusted god and men loved animals did what he had to do with all his force and accepted fate the tragedy of the sheep had been only an incident in a tragical lifethat hare divined with awe  mescal sorrowed and wolf mourned in sympathy with her for their occupation was gone but both brightened when august made known his intention to cross the river to the navajo range to trade with the indians for another flock he began his preparations immediately the snowfreshets had long run out of the river the water was low and he wanted to fetch the sheep down before the summer rains he also wanted to find out what kept his son snap so long among the navajos  ill take billy and go at once dave you join george and zeke out on the silver cup range take jack with you brand all the cattle you can before the snow flies get out of denes way if he rides over and avoid holdernesss men ill have no fights but keep your eyes sharp for their doings  it was a relief to hare that snap naab had not yet returned to the oasis for he felt a sense of freedom which otherwise would have been lacking he spent the whole of a long calm summer day in the orchard and the vineyard the fruit season was at its height grapes plums pears melons were ripe and luscious midsummer was vacationtime for the children and they flocked into the trees like birds the girls were picking grapes mother ruth enlisted jack in her service at the peartrees mescal came too and caught the golden pears he threw down and smiled up at him wolf was there and noddle black bolly pushed her black nose over the fence and whinnied for apples the turkeys strutted the peafowls preened their beautiful plumage the guineahens ran like quail save for those frowning red cliffs hare would have forgotten where he was the warm sun the yellow fruit the merry screams of children the joyous laughter of girls were pleasant reminders of autumn picnic days long gone but in the face of those dominating windscarred walls he could not forget  that night hare endeavored to see mescal alone for a few moments to see her once more with unguarded eyes to whisper a few words to say goodbye but it was impossible  on the morrow he rode out of the red cliff gate with dave and the packhorses a dull ache in his heart for amid the cheering crowd of children and women who bade them goodbye he had caught the wave of mescals hand and a look of her eyes that would be with him always what might happen before he returned if he ever did return for he knew now as well as he could feel silvermanes easy stride that out there under the white glare of desert the white gleam of the slopes of coconina was wild life awaiting him and he shut his teeth and narrowed his eyes and faced it with an eager joy that was in strange contrast to the pang in his breast  that morning the wind dipped down off the vermillion cliffs and whipped west there was no scent of riverwater and hare thought of the fatality of the sheepdrive when for one day out of the year a moistened dank breeze had met the flock on the narrow bench soon the bench lay far behind them and the strip of treacherous sand and the maze of sculptured cliff under the blue star and the hummocky low ridges beyond with their dry white washes silvermane kept on in front already hare had learned that the gray would have no horse before him his pace was swift steady tireless dave was astride his navajo mount an indianbred horse half mustang which had to be held in with a firm rein the pack train strung out far behind trotting faithfully along with the white packs like the humps of camels nodding up and down jack and dave slackened their gait at the foot of the stony divide it was an ascent of miles so long that it did not appear steep here the packtrain caught up and thereafter hung at the heels of the riders  from the broad bare summit jack saw the silver cup valleyrange with eyes which seemed to magnify the winding trail the long red wall the green slopes the dots of sage and cattle then he made allowance for months of unobstructed vision he had learned to see his eyes had adjusted themselves to distance and dimensions  silver cup spring lay in a bright green spot close under a break in the rocky slope that soon lost its gray cliff in the shaggy cedared side of coconina  the camp of the brothers was situated upon this cliff in a split between two sections of wall well sheltered from the north and west winds was a grassy plot which afforded a good survey of the valley and the trails dave and jack received glad greetings from zeke and george and silvermane was an object of wonder and admiration zeke who had often seen the gray and chased him too walked round and round him stroking the silver mane feeling the great chest muscles slapping his flanks  well well silvermane to think id live to see you wearing a saddle and bridle hes even bigger than i thought theres a horse hare never will be another like him in this desert if dene ever sees that horse hell chase him to the great salt basin denes crazy about fast horses hes from kentucky somebody said and knows a horse when he sees one  how are things queried dave  we cant complain much replied zeke though weve wasted some time on old whitefoot hes been chasing our horses its been pretty hot and dry most of the cattle are on the slopes fair browse yet theres a bunch of steers gone up on the mountain and some more round toward the saddle or the canyon  been over seeping springs way  yes no change since your trip holdernesss cattle are ranging in the upper valley george found tracks near the spring we believe somebody was watching there and made off when we came up  well see holdernesss men when we get to riding out put in george and some of denes too zeke met twospot chance and culver below at the spring one day sort of surprised them  what day was that  lets see thiss friday it was last monday  what were they doing over here  said they were tracking a horse that had broken his hobbles but they seemed uneasy and soon rode off  did either of them ride a horse with one shoe shy  now i think of it yes zeke noticed the track at the spring  well chance and culver had been out our way declared dave i saw their tracks and they filled up the blue star waterholeand cost us three thousand sheep  then he related the story of the drive of the sheep the finding of the plugged waterhole the scent of the colorado and the plunge of the sheep into the canyon  weve saved one mescals belled lamb he concluded  neither zeke nor george had a word in reply hare thought their silence unnatural neither did the masklike stillness of their faces change but hare saw in their eyes a pointed clear flame vibrating like a compassneedle a mere glimmering spark  id like to know continued dave calmly poking the fire who hired denes men to plug the waterhole dene couldnt do that he loves a horse and any man who loves a horse couldnt fill a waterhole in this desert  hare entered upon his new duties as a rangerider with a zeal that almost made up for his lack of experience he bade fair to develop into a righthand man for dave under whose watchful eye he worked his natural qualifications were soon shown he could ride though his seat was awkward and clumsy compared to that of the desert rangers a fault that dave said would correct itself as time fitted him close to the saddle and to the swing of his horse his sight had become extraordinarily keen for a newcomer on the ranges and when experience had taught him the landmarks the trails the distances the difference between smoke and dust and haze when he could distinguish a band of mustangs from cattle and rangeriders from outlaws or indians in a word when he had learned to know what it was that he saw to trust his judgment he would have acquired the basic feature of a riders training but he showed no gift for the lasso that other essential requirement of his new calling  its funny said dave patiently you cant get the hang of it maybe its born in a fellow now handling a gun seems to come natural for some fellows and youre one of them if only you could get the rope away as quick as you can throw your gun  jack kept faithfully at it unmindful of defeats often chagrined when he missed some easy opportunity not improbably he might have failed altogether if he had been riding an ordinary horse or if he had to try roping from a fiery mustang but silvermane was as intelligent as he was beautiful and fleet the horse learned rapidly the agile turns and sudden stops necessary and as for free running he never got enough out on the range silvermane always had his head up and watched his life had been spent in watching he saw cattle riders mustangs deer coyotes every moving thing so that hare in the chasing of a cow had but to start silvermane and then he could devote himself to the handling of his rope it took him ten times longer to lasso the cow than it took silvermane to head the animal dave laughed at some of jacks exploits encouraged him often praised his intent if not his deed and always after a run nodded at silvermane in mute admiration  branding the cows and yearlings and tame steers which watered at silver cup and never wandered far away was play according to daves version wait till we get after the wild steers up on the mountain and in the canyons he would say when jack dropped like a log at supper work it certainly was for him at night he was so tired that he could scarcely crawl into bed his back felt as if it were broken his legs were raw and his bones ached many mornings he thought it impossible to arise but always he crawled out grim and haggard and hobbled round the campfire to warm his sore and bruised muscles then when zeke and george rode in with the horses the days work began during these weeks of his hardening up as dave called it hare bore much pain but he continued well and never missed a day at the most trying time when for a few days he had to be helped on and off silvermanefor he insisted that he would not stay in campthe brothers made his work as light as possible they gave him the branding outfit to carry a runningiron and a little pot with charcoal and bellows and with these he followed the riders at a convenient distance and leisurely pace  some days they branded one hundred cattle by october they had august naabs crudely fashioned cross on thousands of cows and steers still the stock kept coming down from the mountain driven to the valley by cold weather and snowcovered grass it was well into november before the riders finished at silver cup and then arose a question as to whether it would be advisable to go to seeping springs or to the canyons farther west along the slope of coconina george favored the former but dave overruled him  fathers orders he said he wants us to ride seeping springs last because hell be with us then and snap too were going to have trouble over there  hows this branding stock going to help the matter any id like to know inquired george we mormons never needed it  father says well all have to come to it holdernesss stock is branded perhaps hes marked a good many steers of ours we cant tell but if we have our own branded well know whats ours if he drives our stock well know it if dene steals it can be proved that he steals  well what then do you think hell care for that or holderness either  no only it makes this difference both things will then be barefaced robbery weve never been able to prove anything though we boys know we dont need any proof father gives these men the benefit of a doubt weve got to stand by him i know george your hands begun to itch for your gun so does mine but weve orders to obey  many gullies and canyons headed up on the slope of coconina west of silver cup and ran down to open wide on the flat desert they contained plots of white sage and bunches of rich grass and cold springs the steers that ranged these ravines were wild as wolves and in the tangled thickets of juniper and manzanita and jumbles of weathered cliff they were exceedingly difficult to catch  well it was that hare had received his initiation and had become inured to rough incessant work for now he came to know the real stuff of which these mormons were made no obstacle barred them they penetrated the gullies to the last step they rode weathered slopes that were difficult for deer to stick upon they thrashed the bayonetguarded manzanita copses they climbed into labyrinthine fastnesses penetrating to every nook where a steer could hide miles of sliding slope and marblebottomed streambeds were ascended on foot for cattle could climb where a horse could not climbing was arduous enough yet the hardest and most perilous toil began when a wild steer was cornered they roped the animals on moving slopes of weathered stone and branded them on the edges of precipices  the days and weeks passed how many no one counted or cared the circle of the sun daily lowered over the south end of coconina and the black snowclouds crept down the slopes frost whitened the ground at dawn and held half the day in the shade winter was close at the heels of the long autumn  as for hare true to august naabs assertion he had lost flesh and suffered and though the process was heartbreaking in its severity he hung on till he hardened into a leather lunged wiremuscled man capable of keeping pace with his companions  he began his day with the dawn when he threw off the frostcoated tarpaulin the icy water brought him a glow of exhilaration he drank in the spiced cold air and there was the spring of the deerhunter in his step as he went down the slope for his horse he no longer feared that silvermane would run away the grays bell could always be heard near camp in the mornings and when hare whistled there came always the answering thump of hobbled feet when silvermane saw him striding through the cedars or across the grassy belt of the valley he would neigh his gladness hare had come to love silvermane and talked to him and treated him as if he were human  when the mustangs were brought into camp the days work began the same work as that of yesterday and yet with endless variety with everchanging situations that called for quick wits steel arms stout hearts and unflagging energies the darkening blue sky and the suntipped crags of vermillion cliffs were signals to start for camp they ate like wolves sat for a while around the campfire a ragged weary silent group and soon lay down their dark faces in the shadow of the cedars  in the beginning of this toilfilled time hare had resolutely set himself to forget mescal and he had succeeded at least for a time when he was so sore and weary that he scarcely thought at all but she came back to him and then there was seldom an hour that was not hers the long months which seemed years since he had seen her the change in him wrought by labor and peril the deepening friendship between him and dave even the love he bore silvermanethese instead of making dim the memory of the darkeyed girl only made him tenderer in his thought of her  snow drove the riders from the canyoncamp down to silver cup where they found august naab and snap who had ridden in the day before  now you couldnt guess how many cattle are back there in the canyons said dave to his father  i havent any idea answered august dubiously  five thousand head  dave his fathers tone was incredulous  yes you know we havent been back in there for years the stock has multiplied rapidly in spite of the lions and wolves not only that but theyre safe from the winter and are not likely to be found by dene or anybody else  how do you make that out  the first cattle we drove in used to come back here to silver cup to winter then they stopped coming and we almost forgot them well theyve got a trail round under the saddle and they go down and winter in the canyon in summer they head up those rocky gullies but they cant get up on the mountain so it isnt likely any one will ever discover them they are wild as deer and fatter than any stock on the ranges  good thats the best news ive had in many a day now boys well ride the mountain slope toward seeping springs drive the cattle down and finish up this branding somebody ought to go to white sage id like to know whats going on what holderness is up to what dene is doing if theres any stock being driven to lund  i told you id go said snap naab  i dont want you to replied his father i guess it can wait till spring then well all go in i might have thought to bring you boys out some clothes and boots youre pretty ragged jack there especially looks like a scarecrow has he worked as hard as he looks  father he never lost a day replied dave warmly and you know what riding is in these canyons  august naab looked at hare and laughed itd be funny wouldnt it if holderness tried to slap you now i always knew youd do jack and now youre one of us and youll have a share with my sons in the cattle  but the generous promise failed to offset the feeling aroused by the presence of snap naab with the first sight of snaps sharp face and strange eyes hare became conscious of an inward heat which he had felt before but never as now when there seemed to be an actual flame within his breast yet snap seemed greatly changed the red flush the swollen lines no longer showed in his face evidently in his absence on the navajo desert he had had no liquor he was goodnatured lively much inclined to joking and he seemed to have entirely forgotten his animosity toward hare it was easy for hare to see that the mans evil nature was in the ascendancy only when he was under the dominance of drink but he could not forgive he could not forget mescals dark beautiful eyes haunted him even now she might be married to this man perhaps that was why snap appeared to be in such cheerful spirits suspense added its burdensome insistent question but he could not bring himself to ask august if the marriage had taken place for a day he fought to resign himself to the inevitability of the mormon custom to forget mescal and then he gave up trying this surrender he felt to be something crucial in his life though he could not wholly understand it it was the darkening of his spirit the death of boyish gentleness the concluding step from youth into a forced manhood the desert regeneration had not stopped at turning weak lungs vitiated blood and flaccid muscles into a powerful man it was at work on his mind his heart his soul they answered more and more to the call of some outside everpresent fiercely subtle thing  thenceforth he no longer vexed himself by trying to forget mescal if she came to mind he told himself the truth that the weeks and months had only added to his love and though it was bittersweet there was relief in speaking the truth to himself he no longer blinded himself by hoping striving to have generous feelings toward snap naab he called the inward fire by its real namejealousyand knew that in the end it would become hatred  on the third morning after leaving silver cup the riders were working slowly along the slope of coconina and hare having driven down a bunch of cattle found himself on an open ridge near the temporary camp happening to glance up the valley he saw what appeared to be smoke hanging over seeping springs  that cant be dust he soliloquized looks blue to me  he studied the hazy bluish cloud for some time but it was so many miles away that he could not be certain whether it was smoke or not so he decided to ride over and make sure none of the naabs was in camp and there was no telling when they would return so he set off alone he expected to get back before dark but it was of little consequence whether he did or not for he had his blanket under the saddle and grain for silvermane and food for himself in the saddlebags  long before silvermanes easy trot had covered half the distance hare recognized the cloud that had made him curious it was smoke he thought that rangeriders were camping at the springs and he meant to see what they were about after three hours of brisk travel he reached the top of a low rolling knoll that hid seeping springs he remembered the springs were up under the red wall and that the pool where the cattle drank was lower down in a clump of cedars he saw smoke rising in a column from the cedars and he heard the lowing of cattle  something wrong here he muttered following the trail he rode through the cedars to come upon the dry hole where the pool had once been there was no water in the flume the bellowing cattle came from beyond the cedars down the other side of the ridge he was not long in reaching the open and then one glance made all clear  a new pool large as a little lake shone in the sunlight and round it a jostling horned mass of cattle were pressing against a high corral the flume that fed water to the pool was fenced all the way up to the springs  jack slowly rode down the ridge with eyes roving under the cedars and up to the wall not a man was in sight  when he got to the fire he saw that it was not many hours old and was surrounded by fresh boot and horse tracks in the dust piles of slender pine logs trimmed flat on one side were proof of somebodys intention to erect a cabin in a rage he flung himself from the saddle it was not many moments work for him to push part of the fire under the fence and part of it against the pile of logs the pitchpines went off like rockets driving the thirsty cattle back  im going to trail those horsetracks said hare  he tore down a portion of the fence enclosing the flume and gave silvermane a drink then put him to a fast trot on the white trail the tracks he had resolved to follow were cleancut a few inches of snow had fallen in the valley and melting had softened the hard ground silvermane kept to his gait with the tirelessness of a desert horse august naab had once said fifty miles a day would be play for the stallion all the afternoon hare watched the trail speed toward him and the end of coconina rise above him long before sunset he had reached the slope of the mountain and had begun the ascent half way up he came to the snow and counted the tracks of three horses at twilight he rode into the glade where august naab had waited for his navajo friends there in a sheltered nook among the rocks he unsaddled silvermane covered and fed him built a fire ate sparingly of his meat and bread and rolling up in his blanket was soon asleep  he was up and off before sunrise and he came out on the western slope of coconina just as the shadowy valley awakened from its misty sleep into daylight soon the pink cliffs leaned out glimmering and vast to change from gloomy gray to rosy glow and then to brighten and to redden in the morning sun  the snow thinned and failed but the ironcut horsetracks showed plainly in the trail at the foot of the mountain the tracks left the white sage trail and led off to the north toward the cliffs hare searched the red sagespotted waste for holdernesss ranch he located it a black patch on the rising edge of the valley under the wall and turned silvermane into the tracks that pointed straight toward it  the sun cleared coconina and shone warm on his back the pink cliffs lifted higher and higher before him from the ridgetops he saw the black patch grow into cabins and corrals as he neared the ranch he came into rolling pastureland where the bleached grass shone white and the cattle were ranging in the thousands this range had once belonged to martin cole and hare thought of the bitter mormon as he noted the snug cabins for the riders the rambling picturesque ranchhouse the large corrals and the long flume that ran down from the cliff there was a corral full of shaggy horses and another full of steers and two lines of cattle one going into a pondcorral and one coming out the air was gray with dust a bunch of yearlings were licking at huge lumps of brown rocksalt a wagonful of cowhides stood before the ranchhouse  hare reined in at the door and helloed  a redfaced ranger with sandy hair and twinkling eyes appeared  hello stranger get down an come in he said  is holderness here asked hare  no hes been to lund with a bunch of steers i reckon hell be in white sage by now im snood the foreman is it a job ridin you want  no  say thet hoss he exclaimed his gaze of friendly curiosity had moved from hare to silvermane you can corral me if it aint thet sevier range stallion  yes said hare  snoods whoop brought three riders to the door and when he pointed to the horse they stepped out with goodnatured grins and admiring eyes  i never seen him but onct said one  lordy what a hoss snood walked round silvermane if i owned this ranch id trade it for that stallion i know silvermane he an i hed some chases over in nevada an stranger who might you be  im one of august naabs riders  denes spy snood looked hare over carefully with much interest and without any show of illwill ive heerd of you an what might one of naabs riders want of holderness  i rode in to seeping springs yesterday said hare eying the foreman there was a new pond fenced in our cattle couldnt drink there were a lot of trimmed logs somebody was going to build a cabin i burned the corrals and logsand i trailed fresh tracks from seeping springs to this ranch  the hl you did shouted snood and his face flamed see here stranger youre the second man to accuse some of my riders of such dirty tricks thats enough for me i was foreman of this ranch till this minute i was foreman but there were things gain on thet i didnt know of i kicked on thet deal with martin cole i quit i steal no mans water is thet good with you  snoods query was as much a challenge as a question he bit savagely at his pipe hare offered his hand  your word goes dave naab said you might be holdernesss foreman but you werent a liar or a thief id believe it even if dave hadnt told me  them fellers you tracked rode in here yesterday theyre gone now ive no more to say except i never hired them  im glad to hear it goodday snood im in something of a hurry  with that hare faced about in the direction of white sage once clear of the corrals he saw the village closer than he had expected to find it he walked silvermane most of the way and jogged along the rest so that he reached the village in the twilight memory served him well he rode in as august naab had ridden out and arrived at the bishops barnyard where he put up his horse then he went to the house it was necessary to introduce himself for none of the bishops family recognized in him the young man they had once befriended the old bishop prayed and reminded him of the laying on of hands the women served him with food the young men brought him new boots and garments to replace those that had been worn to tatters then they plied him with questions about the naabs whom they had not seen for nearly a year they rejoiced at his recovered health they welcomed him with warm words  later hare sought an interview alone with the bishops sons and he told them of the loss of the sheep of the burning of the new corrals of the tracks leading to holdernesss ranch in turn they warned him of his danger and gave him information desired by august naab holdernesss grasp on the outlying ranges and waterrights had slowly and surely tightened every month he acquired new territory he drove cattle regularly to lund and it was no secret that much of the stock came from the eastern slope of coconina he could not hire enough riders to do his work a suspicion that he was not a cattleman but a rustler had slowly gained ground it was scarcely hinted but it was believed his friendship with dene had become offensive to the mormons who had formerly been on good footing with him denes killing of martin cole was believed to have been at holdernesss instigation cole had threatened holderness then dene and cole had met in the main street of white sage coles death ushered in the bloody time that he had prophesied denes band had grown no man could say how many men he had or who they were chance and culver were openly his lieutenants and whenever they came into the village there was shooting there were ugly rumors afloat in regard to their treatment of mormon women the wives and daughters of once peaceful white sage dared no longer venture outofdoors after nightfall there was more money in coin and more whiskey than ever before in the village lund and the few villages northward were terrorized as well as white sage it was a bitter story  the bishop and his sons tried to persuade hare next morning to leave the village without seeing holderness urging the futility of such a meeting  i will see him said hare he spent the morning at the cottage and when it came time to take his leave he smiled into the anxious faces if i werent able to take care of myself august naab would never have said so  had hare asked himself what he intended to do when he faced holderness he could not have told his feelings were pentin bound but at the bottom something rankled his mind seemed steeped in still thunderous atmosphere  how well he remembered the quaint wide street the gray church as he rode many persons stopped to gaze at silvermane he turned the corner into the main thoroughfare a new building had been added to the several stores mustangs stood bridles down before the doors men lounged along the railings  as he dismounted he heard the loungers speak of his horse and he saw their leisurely manner quicken he stepped into the store to meet more men among them august naabs friend abe hare might never have been in white sage for all the recognition he found but he excited something keener than curiosity he asked for spurs a claspknife and some other necessaries and he contrived when momentarily out of sight behind a pile of boxes to whisper his identity to abe the mormon was dumbfounded when he came out of his trance he showed his gladness and at a question of hares he silently pointed toward the saloon  hare faced the open door the room had been enlarged it was now on a level with the store floor and was blue with smoke foul with the fumes of rum and noisy with the voices of dark rugged men  a man in the middle of the room was dancing a jig  hello whos this he said straightening up  it might have been the stopping of the dance or the quick spark in hares eyes that suddenly quieted the room hare had once vowed to himself that he would never forget the scarred face it belonged to the outlaw chance  the sight of it flashed into the gulf of hares mind like a meteor into black night a sudden madness raced through his veins  hello dont you know me he said with a long step that brought him close to chance  the outlaw stood irresolute was this an old friend or an enemy his beady eyes scintillated and twitched as if they sought to look him over yet dared not because it was only in the face that intention could be read  the stillness of the room broke to a hoarse whisper from some one  look how he packs his gun  another man answering whispered theres not six men in utah who pack a gun thet way  chance heard these whispers for his eye shifted downward the merest fraction of a second the brick color of his face turned a dirty white  do you know me demanded hare  chances answer was a spasmodic jerking of his hand toward his hip hares arm moved quicker and chances colt went spinning to the floor  too slow said hare then he flung chance backward and struck him blows that sent his head with sodden thuds against the log wall chance sank to the floor in a heap  hare kicked the outlaws gun out of the way and wheeled to the crowd holderness stood foremost his tall form leaning against the bar his clear eyes shining like light on ice  do you know me asked hare curtly  holderness started slightly i certainly dont he replied  you slapped my face once hare leaned close to the rancher slap it nowyou rustler  in the slow guarded instant when hares gaze held holderness and the other men a low murmuring ran through the room  denes spy suddenly burst out holderness  hare slapped his face then he backed a few paces with his right arm held before him almost as high as his shoulder the wrist rigid the fingers quivering  dont try to draw holderness thets august naabs trick with a gun whispered a man hurriedly  holderness i made a bonfire over at seeping springs said hare i burned the new corrals your men built and i tracked them to your ranch snood threw up his job when he heard it hes an honest man and no honest man will work for a waterthief a cattlerustler a sheepkiller youre shown up holderness leave the country before some one kills youunderstand before some one kills you  holderness stood motionless against the bar his eyes fierce with passionate hate  hare backed step by step to the outside door his right hand still high his look holding the crowd bound to the last instant then he slipped out scattered the group round silvermane and struck hard with the spurs  the gray never before spurred broke down the road into his old wild speed  men were crossing from the corner of the green square one a compact little fellow swarthy his dark hair long and flowing with jaunty and alert air was dene the outlaw leader he stopped with his companions to let the horse cross  hare guided the thundering stallion slightly to the left silvermane swerved and in two mighty leaps bore down on the outlaw dene saved himself by quickly leaping aside but even as he moved silvermane struck him with his left foreleg sending him into the dust  at the street corner hare glanced back yelling men were rushing from the saloon and some of them fired after him the bullets whistled harmlessly behind hare then the corner house shut off his view  silvermane lengthened out and stretched lower with his white mane flying and his nose pointed level for the desert     xi the deserthawk   toward the close of the next day jack hare arrived at seeping springs a pile of gray ashes marked the spot where the trimmed logs had lain round the pool ran a black circle hard packed into the ground by many hoofs even the board flume had been burned to a level with the glancing sheet of water hare was slipping silvermanes bit to let him drink when he heard a halloo dave naab galloped out of the cedars and presently august naab and his other sons appeared with a packtrain  now youve played bob exclaimed dave he swung out of his saddle and gripped hare with both hands i know what youve done i know where youve been father will be furious but dont you care  the other naabs trotted down the slope and lined their horses before the pool the sons stared in blank astonishment the father surveyed the scene slowly and then fixed wrathful eyes on hare  what does this mean he demanded with the sonorous roll of his angry voice  hare told all that had happened  august naabs gloomy face worked and his eaglegaze had in it a strange farseeing light his mind was dwelling upon his mystic power of revelation  i seei see he said haltingly  kiyiii yelled dave naab with all the power of his lungs his head was back his mouth wide open his face red his neck corded and swollen with the intensity of his passion  be stillboy ordered his father hare this was madnessbut tell me what you learned  briefly hare repeated all that he had been told at the bishops and concluded with the killing of martin cole by dene  august naab bowed his head and his giant frame shook under the force of his emotion martin cole was the last of his lifelong friends  thisthis outlawyou say you ran him down asked naab rising haggard and shaken out of his grief  yes he didnt recognize me or know what was coming till silvermane was on him but he was quick and fell sidewise silvermanes knee sent him sprawling  what will it all lead to asked august naab and in his extremity he appealed to his eldest son  the bars are down said snap naab with a click of his long teeth  father began dave naab earnestly jack has done a splendid thing the news will fly over utah like wildfire mormons are slow they need a leader but they can follow and they will we cant cure these evils by hoping and praying weve got to fight  daves right dad it means fight cried george with his fist clinched high  youve been wrong father in holding back said zeke naab his lean jaw bulging this holderness will steal the water and meat out of our childrens mouths weve got to fight  lets ride to white sage put in snap naab and the little flecks in his eyes were dancing ill throw a gun on dene i can get to him weve been tolerable friends hes wanted me to join his band ill kill him  he laughed as he raised his right hand and swept it down to his left side the blue colt lay on his outstretched palm denes life and holdernesss too hung in the balance between two deadly snaps of this desertwolfs teeth he was one of the naabs and yet apart from them for neither religion nor friendship nor life itself mattered to him  august naabs huge bulk shook again not this time with grief but in wrestling effort to withstand the fiery influence of this unholy fighting spirit among his sons  i am forbidden  his answer was gentle but its very gentleness breathed of his battle over himself of allegiance to something beyond earthly duty well drive the cattle to silver cup he decided and then go home i give up seeping springs perhaps this valley and water will content holderness  when they reached the oasis hare was surprised to find that it was the day before christmas the welcome given the longabsent riders was like a celebration much to hares disappointment mescal did not appear the homecoming was not joyful to him because it lacked her welcoming smile  christmas day ushered in the short desert winter ice formed in the ditches and snow fell but neither long resisted the reflection of the sun from the walls the early morning hours were devoted to religious services at midday dinner was served in the big room of august naabs cabin at one end was a stone fireplace where logs blazed and crackled  in all his days hare had never seen such a bountiful board yet he was unable to appreciate it to share in the general thanksgiving dominating all other feeling was the fear that mescal would come in and take a seat by snap naabs side when snap seated himself opposite with his pale little wife hare found himself waiting for mescal with an intensity that made him dead to all else the girls judith esther rebecca came running gayly in clad in their best dresses with bright ribbons to honor the occasion rebecca took the seat beside snap and hare gulped with a hard contraction of his throat mescal was not yet a mormons wife he seemed to be lifted upward to grow lightheaded with the blessed assurance then mescal entered and took the seat next to him she smiled and spoke and the blood beat thick in his ears  that moment was happy but it was as nothing to its successor under the tablecover mescals hand found his and pressed it daringly and gladly her hand lingered in his all the time august naab spent in carving the turkeylingered there even though snap naabs hawk eyes were never far away in the warm touch of her hand in some subtle thing that radiated from her hare felt a change in the girl he loved a few months had wrought in her some indefinable difference even as they had increased his love to its full volume and depth had his absence brought her to the realization of her womans heart  in the afternoon hare left the house and spent a little while with silvermane then he wandered along the wall to the head of the oasis and found a seat on the fence the next few weeks presented to him a situation that would be difficult to endure he would be near mescal but only to have the truth forced cruelly home to him every sane momentthat she was not for him out on the ranges he had abandoned himself to dreams of her they had been beautiful they had made the long hours seem like minutes but they had forged chains that could not be broken and now he was hopelessly fettered  the clatter of hoofs roused him from a reverie which was half sad half sweet mescal came tearing down the level on black bolly she pulled in the mustang and halted beside hare to hold out shyly a red scarf embroidered with navajo symbols in white and red beads  ive wanted a chance to give you this she said a little christmas present  for a few seconds hare could find no words  did you make it for me mescal he finally asked how good of you ill keep it always  put it on nowlet me tie itthere  but child suppose hethey saw it  i dont care who sees it  she met him with clear level eyes her curt crisp speech was full of meaning he looked long at her with a yearning denied for many a day her face was the same yet wonderfully changed the same in line and color but different in soul and spirit the old sombre shadow lay deep in the eyes but to it had been added gleam of will and reflection of thought the whole face had been refined and transformed  mescal whats happened youre not the same you seem almost happy have youhas hegiven you up  dont you know mormons better than that the thing is the sameso far as theyre concerned  but mescalare you going to marry him for gods sake tell me  never it was a womans word instant inflexible desperate with a deep breath hare realized where the girl had changed  still youre promised pledged to him howll you get out of it  i dont know how but ill cut out my tongue and be dumb as my poor peon before ill speak the word thatll make me snap naabs wife  there was a long silence mescal smoothed out bollys mane and hare gazed up at the walls with eyes that did not see them  presently he spoke im afraid for you snap watched us today at dinner  hes jealous  suppose he sees this scarf  mescal laughed defiantly it was bewildering for hare to hear her  hellmescal i may yet come to this hares laugh echoed mescals as he pointed to the enclosure under the wall where the graves showed bare and rough  her warm color fled but it flooded back rich mantling brow and cheek and neck  snap naab will never kill you she said impulsively  mescal  she swiftly turned her face away as his hand closed on hers  mescal do you love me  the trembling of her fingers and the heaving of her bosom lent his hope conviction mescal he went on these past months have been years years of toiling thinking changing but always loving im not the man you knew im wild im starved for a sight of you i love you mescal my desert flower  she raised her free hand to his shoulder and swayed toward him he held her a moment clasped tight and then released her  im quite mad he exclaimed in a passion of selfreproach what a risk im putting on you but i couldnt help it look at me just onceplease mescal just one look now go  the drama of the succeeding days was of absorbing interest hare had liberty there was little work for him to do save to care for silvermane he tried to hunt foxes in the caves and clefts he rode up and down the broad space under the walls he sought the open desert only to be driven in by the bitter biting winds then he would return to the big livingroom of the naabs and sit before the burning logs this spacious room was warm light pleasant and was used by every one in leisure hours mescal spent most of her time there she was engaged upon a new frock of buckskin and over this she bent with her needle and beads when there was a chance hare talked with her speaking one language with his tongue a far different one with his eyes when she was not present he looked into the glowing red fire and dreamed of her  in the evenings when snap came in to his wooing and drew mescal into a corner hare watched with covert glance and smouldering jealousy somehow he had come to see all things and all people in the desert glass and his symbol for snap naab was the deserthawk snaps eyes were as wild and piercing as those of a hawk his nose and mouth were as the beak of a hawk his hands resembled the claws of a hawk and the spurs he wore always bloody were still more significant of his ruthless nature then snaps courting of the girl the cool assurance the unhastening ease were like the slow rise the sail and the poise of a deserthawk before the downward lightningswift swoop on his quarry  it was intolerable for hare to sit there in the evenings to try to play with the children who loved him to talk to august naab when his eye seemed ever drawn to the quiet couple in the corner and his ear was unconsciously strained to catch a passing word that hour was a miserable one for him yet he could not bring himself to leave the room he never saw snap touch her he never heard mescals voice he believed that she spoke very little when the hour was over and mescal rose to pass to her room then his doubt his fear his misery were as though they had never been for as mescal said goodnight she would give him one look swift as a flash and in it were womanliness and purity and something beyond his comprehension her indian serenity and mysticism veiled yet suggested some secret some power by which she might yet escape the iron band of this mormon rule hare could not fathom it in that goodnight glance was a meaning for him alone if meaning ever shone in womans eyes and it said i will be true to you and to myself  once the idea struck him that as soon as spring returned it would be an easy matter and probably wise for him to leave the oasis and go up into utah far from the desertcanyon country but the thought refused to stay before his consciousness a moment new life had flushed his veins here he loved the dreamy sleepy oasis with its mellow sunshine always at rest on the glistening walls he loved the cedarscented plateau where hope had dawned and the windswept sandstrips where hard outofdoor life and work had renewed his wasting youth he loved the canyon winding away toward coconina opening into wide abyss and always more than all he loved the painted desert with its everchanging pictures printed in sweeping dust and bare peaks and purple haze he loved the beauty of these places and the wildness in them had an affinity with something strange and untamed in him he would never leave them when his blood had cooled when this tumultuous thrill and swell had worn themselves out happiness would come again  early in the winter snap naab had forced his wife to visit his fathers house with him and she had remained in the room whitefaced passionately jealous while he wooed mescal then had come a scene hare had not been present but he knew its results snap had been furious his father grave mescal tearful and ashamed the wife found many ways to interrupt her husbands lovemaking she sent the children for him she was taken suddenly ill she discovered that the corral gate was open and his creamcolored pinto dearest to his heart was running loose she even set her cottage on fire  one sunday evening just before twilight hare was sitting on the porch with august naab and dave when their talk was interrupted by snaps loud calling for his wife at first the sounds came from inside his cabin then he put his head out of a window and yelled plainly he was both impatient and angry it was nearly time for him to make his sunday call upon mescal  somethings wrong muttered dave  hester hester yelled snap  mother ruth came out and said that hester was not there  where is she snap banged on the windowsill with his fists find her somebodyhester  son this is the sabbath called father naab gravely lower your voice now whats the matter  matter bawled snap giving way to rage when i was asleep hester stole all my clothes shes hid themshes run offtheres not a dn thing for me to put on ill  the roar of laughter from august and dave drowned the rest of the speech hare managed to stifle his own mirth snap pulled in his head and slammed the window shut  jack said august even among mormons the course of true love never runs smooth  hare finally forgot his bitter humor in pity for the wife snap came to care not at all for her messages and tricks and he let nothing interfere with his evening beside mescal it was plain that he had gone far on the road of love whatever he had been in the beginning of the betrothal he was now a lover eager importunate his hawks eyes were softer than hare had ever seen them he was obliging kind gay an altogether different snap naab he groomed himself often and wore clean scarfs and left off his bloody spurs for eight months he had not touched the bottle when spring approached he was madly in love with mescal and the marriage was delayed because his wife would not have another woman in her home  once hare heard snap remonstrating with his father  if she dont come to time soon ill keep the kids and send her back to her father  dont be hasty son let her have time replied august women must be humored ill wager shell give in before the cottonwood blows and thats not long  it was hares habit as the days grew warmer to walk a good deal and one evening as twilight shadowed the oasis and grew black under the towering walls he strolled out toward the fields while passing snaps cottage hare heard a womans voice in passionate protest and a mans in strident anger later as he stood with his arm on silvermane a womans scream at first highpitched then suddenly faint and smothered caused him to grow rigid and his hand clinched tight when he went back by the cottage a low moaning confirmed his suspicion  that evening snap appeared unusually bright and happy and he asked his father to name the day for the wedding august did so in a loud voice and with evident relief then the quaint mormon congratulations were offered to mescal to hare watching the strange girl with the distressingly keen intuition of an unfortunate lover she appeared as pleased as any of them that the marriage was settled but there was no shyness no blushing confusion when snap bent to kiss herhis first kissshe slightly turned her face so that his lips brushed her cheek yet even then her selfcommand did not break for an instant it was a task for hare to pretend to congratulate her nevertheless he mumbled something she lifted her long lashes and there deep beneath the shadows was unutterable anguish it gave him a shock he went to his room convinced that she had yielded and though he could not blame her and he knew she was helpless he cried out in reproach and resentment she had failed him as he had known she must fail he tossed on his bed and thought he lay quiet wideopen eyes staring into the darkness and his mind burned and seethed through the hours of that long night he learned what love had cost him  with the morning light came some degree of resignation several days went slowly by bringing the first of april which was to be the weddingday august naab had said it would come before the cottonwoods shed their white floss and their buds had just commenced to open the day was not a holiday and george and zeke and dave began to pack for the ranges yet there was an air of jollity and festivity snap naab had a springy step and jaunty mien once he regarded hare with a slow smile  piute prepared to drive his new flock up on the plateau the women of the household were busy and excited the children romped  the afternoon waned into twilight and hare sought the quiet shadows under the wall near the river trail he meant to stay there until august naab had pronounced his son and mescal man and wife the dull roar of the rapids borne on a faint puff of westerly breeze was lulled into a soothing murmur a radiant white star peeped over the black rim of the wall the solitude and silence were speaking to hares heart easing his pain when a soft patter of moccasined feet brought him bolt upright  a slender form rounded the corner wall it was mescal the white dog wolf hung close by her side swiftly she reached hare  mescal he exclaimed  hush speak softly she whispered fearfully her hands were clinging to his  jack do you love me still  more than womans sweetness was in the whisper the portent of indefinable motive made hare tremble like a shaking leaf  good heavens you are to be married in a few minuteswhat do you mean where are you going this buckskin suitand wolf with youmescal  theres no timeonly a wordhurrydo you love me still she panted with great shining eyes close to his  love you with all my soul  listen she whispered and leaned against him a fresh breeze bore the boom of the river she caught her breath quickly i love youi love yougoodbye  she kissed him and broke from his clasp then silently like a shadow with the white dog close beside her she disappeared in the darkness of the river trail  she was gone before he came out of his bewilderment he rushed down the trail he called her name the gloom had swallowed her and only the echo of his voice made answer     xii echo cliffs   when thought came clearly to him he halted irresolute for mescals sake he must not appear to have had any part in her headlong flight or any knowledge of it  with stealthy footsteps he reached the cottonwoods stole under the gloomy shade and felt his way to a point beyond the twinkling lights then peering through the gloom until assured he was safe from observation and taking the dark side of the house he gained the hall and his room he threw himself on his bed and endeavored to compose himself to quiet his vibrating nerves to still the triumphant bellbeat of his heart for a while all his being swung to the palpitating consciousness of joymescal had taken her freedom she had escaped the swoop of the hawk  while hare lay there trying to gather his shattered senses the merry sound of voices and the music of an accordion hummed from the big livingroom next to his presently heavy boots thumped on the floor of the hall then a hand rapped on his door  jack are you there called august naab  yes  come along then  hare rose opened the door and followed august the room was bright with lights the table was set and the naabs large and small were standing expectantly as hare found a place behind them snap naab entered with his wife she was as pale as if she were in her shroud hare caught mother ruths pitying subdued glance as she drew the frail little woman to her side when august naab began fingering his bible the whispering ceased  why dont they fetch her he questioned  judith esther bring her in said mother mary calling into the hallway  quick footsteps and the girls burst in impetuously exclaiming mescals not there  where is she then demanded august naab going to the door mescal he called  succeeding his authoritative summons only the cheery sputter of the woodfire broke the silence  she hadnt put on her white frock went on judith  her buckskins arent hanging where they always are continued esther  august naab laid his bible on the table i always feared it he said simply  shes gone cried snap naab he ran into the hall into mescals room and returned trailing the white weddingdress the time we thought she spent to put this on shes been  he choked over the words and sank into a chair face convulsed hands shaking weak in the grip of a grief that he had never before known suddenly he flung the dress into the fire his wife fell to the floor in a dead faint then the deserthawk showed his claws his hands tore at the close scarf round his throat as if to liberate a fury that was stifling him his face lost all semblance to anything human he began to howl to rave to curse and his father circled him with iron arm and dragged him from the room  the children were whimpering the wives lamenting the quiet men searched the house and yard and corrals and fields but they found no sign of mescal after long hours the excitement subsided and all sought their beds  morning disclosed the facts of mescals flight she had dressed for the trail a knapsack was missing and food enough to fill it wolf was gone noddle was not in his corral the peon slave had not slept in his shack there were moccasintracks and burrotracks and dogtracks in the sand at the river crossing and one of the boats was gone this boat was not moored to the opposite shore questions arose had the boat sunk had the fugitives crossed safely or had they drifted into the canyon dave naab rode out along the river and saw the boat a mile below the rapids bottom side up and lodged on a sandbar  she got across and then set the boat loose said august thats the indian of her if she went up on the cliffs to the navajos maybe well find her if she went into the painted desert a grave shake of his shaggy head completed his sentence  morning also disclosed snap naab once more in the clutch of his demon drunk and unconscious lying like a log on the porch of his cottage  this means ruin to him said his father he had one chance he was mad over mescal and if he had got her he might have conquered his thirst for rum  he gave orders for the sheep to be driven up on the plateau and for his sons to ride out to the cattle ranges he bade hare pack and get in readiness to accompany him to the navajo cliffs there to search for mescal  the river was low as the spring thaws had not yet set in and the crossing promised none of the hazard so menacing at a later period billy naab rowed across with the saddle and packs then august had to crowd the lazy burros into the water silvermane went in with a rush and charger took to the river like an old duck august and jack sat in the stern of the boat while billy handled the oars they crossed swiftly and safely the three burros were then loaded two with packs the other with a heavy waterbag  see there said august pointing to tracks in the sand the imprints of little moccasins reassured hare for he had feared the possibility suggested by the upturned boat perhaps itll be better if i never find her continued naab if i bring her back snaps as likely to kill her as to marry her but i must try to find her only what to do with her  give her to me interrupted jack  hare  i love her  naabs stern face relaxed well im beat though i dont see why you should be different from all the others it was that time you spent with her on the plateau i thought you too sick to think of a woman  mescal cares for me said hare  ah that accounts hare did you play me fair  we tried to though we couldnt help loving  she would have married snap but for you  yes but i couldnt help that you brought me out here and saved my life i know what i owe you mescal meant to marry your son when i left for the range last fall but shes a true woman and couldnt august naab if we ever find her will you marry her to himnow  that depends did you know she intended to run  i never dreamed of it i learned it only at the last moment i met her on the river trail  you should have stopped her  hare maintained silence  you should have told me went on naab  i couldnt im only human  well well im not blaming you hare i had hot blood once but im afraid the desert will not be large enough for you and snap shes pledged to him you cant change the mormon church for the sake of peace id give you mescal if i could snap will either have her or kill her im going to hunt this desert in advance of him because hell trail her like a hound it would be better to marry her to him than to see her dead  im not so sure of that  hare your nose is on a blood scent like a wolfs i can seeive always seenwell remember its man to man between you now  during this talk they were winding under echo cliffs gradually climbing and working up to a level with the desert which they presently attained at a point near the head of the canyon the trail swerved to the left following the base of the cliffs the tracks of noddle and wolf were plainly visible in the dust hare felt that if they ever led out into the immense airy space of the desert all hope of finding mescal must be abandoned  they trailed the tracks of the dog and burro to bitter seeps a shallow spring of alkali and there lost all track of them the path up the cliffs to the navajo ranges was bare timeworn in solid rock and showed only the imprint of age desertward the ridges of shale the washes of copper earth baked in the sun gave no sign of the fugitives course august naab shrugged his broad shoulders and pointed his horse to the cliff it was dusk when they surmounted it  they camped in the lee of an uplifting crag when the wind died down the night was no longer unpleasantly cool and hare finding august naab uncommunicative and sleepy strolled along the rim of the cliff as he had been wont to do in the sheepherding days he could scarcely dissociate them from the present for the bittersweet smell of tree and bush the almost inaudible sigh of breeze the opening and shutting of the great white stars in the blue dome the silence the sense of the invisible void beneath himall were thoughtprovoking parts of that past of which nothing could ever be forgotten and it was a silence which brought much to the ear that could hear it was a silence penetrated by faint and distant sounds by mourning wolf or moan of wind in a splintered crag weird and low an inarticulate voice it wailed up from the desert winding along the hollow trail freeing itself in the wide air and dying away he had often heard the scream of lion and cry of wildcat but this was the strange sound of which august naab had told him the mysterious call of canyon and desert night  daylight showed echo cliffs to be of vastly greater range than the sister plateau across the river the roll of cedar level the heave of craggy ridge the dip of whitesage valley gave this side a diversity widely differing from the two steps of the vermillion tableland august naab followed a trail leading back toward the river for the most part thick cedars hid the surroundings from hares view occasionally however he had a backward glimpse from a high point or a wide prospect below where the trail overlooked an oval hemmedin valley  about midday august naab brushed through a thicket and came abruptly on a declivity he turned to his companion with a wave of his hand  the navajo camp he said eschtah has lived there for many years its the only permanent navajo camp i know these indians are nomads most of them live wherever the sheep lead them this plateau ranges for a hundred miles farther than any white man knows and everywhere in the valleys and green nooks will be found navajo hogans thats why we may never find mescal  hares gaze travelled down over the tips of cedar and crag to a pleasant vale dotted with round moundlike whitestreaked hogans from which lazy floating columns of blue smoke curled upward mustangs and burros and sheep browsed on the white patches of grass brightred blankets blazed on the cedar branches there was slow colorful movement of indians passing in and out of their homes the scene brought irresistibly to hare the thought of summer of long warm afternoons of leisure that took no stock of time  on the way down the trail they encountered a flock of sheep driven by a little navajo boy on a brown burro it was difficult to tell which was the more surprised the longeared burro which stood stockstill or the boy who first kicked and pounded his shaggy steed and then jumped off and ran with black locks flying farther down indian girls started up from their tasks and darted silently into the shade of the cedars august naab whooped when he reached the valley and indian braves appeared to cluster round him shake his hand and hares and lead them toward the centre of the encampment  the hogans where these desert savages dwelt were all alike only the chiefs was larger from without it resembled a mound of clay with a few white logs half imbedded shining against the brick red august naab drew aside a blanket hanging over a door and entered beckoning his companion to follow inured as hare had become to the smell and smart of woodsmoke for a moment he could not see or scarcely breathe so thick was the atmosphere a fire the size of which attested the desert indians love of warmth blazed in the middle of the hogan and sent part of its smoke upward through a round hole in the roof eschtah with blanket over his shoulders his lean black head bent sat near the fire he noted the entrance of his visitors but immediately resumed his meditative posture and appeared to be unaware of their presence  hare followed augusts example sitting down and speaking no word his eyes however roved discreetly to and fro eschtahs three wives presented great differences in age and appearance the eldest was a wrinkled parchmentskinned old hag who sat sightless before the fire the next was a solid square squaw employed in the task of combing a naked boys hair with a comb made of stiff thin roots tied tightly in a round bunch judging from the youngsters actions and grimaces this combing process was not a pleasant one the third wife much younger had a comely face and long braids of black hair of which evidently she was proud she leaned on her knees over a flat slab of rock and holding in her hands a long oval stone she rolled and mashed corn into meal there were young braves handsome in their bronzeskinned way with bands binding their straight thick hair silver rings in their ears silver bracelets on their wrists silver buttons on their moccasins there were girls who looked up from their blanketweaving with shy curiosity and then turned to their frames strung with long threads under their nimble fingers the woolcarrying needles slipped in and out and the colored stripes grew apace then there were younger boys and girls all brighteyed and curious and babies sleeping on blankets where the walls and ceiling were not covered with buckskin garments weapons and blankets hare saw the white woodribs of the hogan structure it was a work of art this circular house of forked logs and branches interwoven into a dome arched and strong and all covered and cemented with clay  at a touch of augusts hand hare turned to the old chief and awaited his speech it came with the uplifting of eschtahs head and the offering of his hand in the white mans salute augusts replies were slow and labored he could not speak the navajo language fluently but he understood it  the white prophet is welcome was the chiefs greeting does he come for sheep or braves or to honor the navajo in his home  eschtah he seeks the flower of the desert replied august naab mescal has left him her trail leads to the bitter waters under the cliff and then is as a birds  eschtah has waited yet mescal has not come to him  she has not been here  mescals shadow has not gladdened the navajos door  she has climbed the crags or wandered into the canyons the white father loves her he must find her  eschtahs braves and mustangs are for his friends use the navajo will find her if she is not as the grain of drifting sand but is the white prophet wise in his years let the flower of the desert take root in the soil of her forefathers  eschtahs wisdom is great but he thinks only of indian blood mescal is half white and her ways have been the ways of the white man nor does eschtah think of the white mans love  the desert has called where is the white prophets vision white blood and red blood will not mix the indians blood pales in the white mans stream or it burns red for the sun and the waste and the wild eschtahs forefathers sleeping here in the silence have called the desert flower  it is true but the white man is bound he cannot be as the indian he does not content himself with life as it is he hopes and prays for change he believes in the progress of his race on earth therefore eschtahs white friend smelts mescal he has brought her up as his own he wants to take her home to love her better to trust to the future  the white mans ways are white mans ways eschtah understands he remembers his daughter lying here he closed her dead eyes and sent word to his white friend he named this child for the flower that blows in the wind of silent places eschtah gave his granddaughter to his friend she has been the bond between them now she is flown and the white father seeks the navajo let him command eschtah has spoken  eschtah pressed into naabs service a band of young braves under the guidance of several warriors who knew every trail of the range every waterhole every cranny where even a wolf might hide they swept the riverend of the plateau and working westward scoured the levels ridges valleys climbed to the peaks and sent their indian dogs into the thickets and caves from eschtahs encampment westward the hogans diminished in number till only one here and there was discovered hidden under a yellow wall or amid a clump of cedars all the indians met with were sternly questioned by the chiefs their dwellings were searched and the ground about their waterholes was closely examined mile after mile the plateau was covered by these indians who beat the brush and penetrated the fastnesses with a hunting instinct that left scarcely a rabbitburrow unrevealed the days sped by the circle of the sun arched higher the patches of snow in high places disappeared and the search proceeded westward they camped where the night overtook them sometimes near water and grass sometimes in bare dry places to the westward the plateau widened rugged ridges rose here and there and seared crags split the sky like sharp sawteeth and after many miles of wild upranging they reached a divide which marked the line of eschtahs domain  naabs dogged persistence and the navajos faithfulness carried them into the country of the moki indians a tribe classed as slaves by the proud race of eschtah here they searched the villages and ancient tombs and ruins but of mescal there was never a trace  hare rode as diligently and searched as indefatigably as august but he never had any real hope of finding the girl to hunt for her however despite its hopelessness was a melancholy satisfaction for never was she out of his mind  nor was the months hard riding with the navajos without profit he made friends with the indians and learned to speak many of their words then a whole host of desert tricks became part of his accumulating knowledge in climbing the crags in looking for water and grass in loosing silvermane at night and searching for him at dawn in marking tracks on hard ground in all the sight and feeling and smell of desert things he learned much from the navajos the whole outward life of the indian was concerned with the material aspect of naturedust rock air wind smoke the cedars the beasts of the desert these things made up the indians day the navajos were worshippers of the physical the sun was their supreme god in the mornings when the gray of dawn flushed to rosy red they began their chant to the sun at sunset the navajos were watchful and silent with faces westward the moki indians also hare observed had their morning service to the great giver of light in the gloom of early dawn before the pink appeared in the east and all was whitening gray the mokis emerged from their little mud and stone huts and sat upon the roofs with blanketed and drooping heads  one day august naab showed in few words how significant a factor the sun was in the lives of desert men  weve got to turn back he said to hare the suns getting hot and the snow will melt in the mountains if the colorado rises too high we cant cross  they were two days in riding back to the encampment eschtah received them in dignified silence expressive of his regret when their time of departure arrived he accompanied them to the head of the nearest trail which started down from saweep peak the highest point of echo cliffs it was the navajos outlook over the painted desert  mescal is there said august naab shes there with the slave eschtah gave her he leads mescal who can follow him there  the old chieftain reined in his horse beside the timehollowed trail and the same hand that waved his white friend downward swept up in slow stately gesture toward the illimitable expanse it was a warriors salute to an unconquered world hare saw in his falcon eyes the still gleam the brooding fire the mystical passion that haunted the eyes of mescal  the slave without a tongue is a wolf he scents the trails and the waters eschtahs eyes have grown old watching here but he has seen no indian who could follow mescals slave eschtah will lie there but no indian will know the path to the place of his sleep mescals trail is lost in the sand no man may find it eschtahs words are wisdom look  to search for any living creatures in that borderless domain of colored dune of shifting cloud of sand of purple curtain shrouding mesa and dome appeared the vainest of all human endeavors it seemed a veritable rainbow realm of the sun at first only the beauty stirred harehe saw the copper belt close under the cliffs the white beds of alkali and washes of silt farther out the windploughed canyons and dustencumbered ridges ranging west and east the scalloped slopes of the flat tableland rising low the tips of volcanic peaks leading the eye beyond to veils and vapors hovering over blue clefts and dim line of level lanes and so on and on out to the vast unknown then hare grasped a little of its meaning it was a sunpainted sungoverned world here was deep and majestic nature eternal and unchangeable but it was only through eschtahs eyes that he saw its parched slopes its terrifying desolateness its sleeping death  when the old chieftains lips opened hare anticipated the austere speech the import that meant only pain to him and his whole inner being seemed to shrink  the white prophets child of red blood is lost to him said eschtah the flower of the desert is as a grain of drifting sand     xiii the sombre line   august naab hoped that mescal might have returned in his absence but to hare such hope was vain the women of the oasis met them with gloomy faces presaging bad news and they were reluctant to tell it mescals flight had been forgotten in the sterner and sadder misfortune that had followed  snap naabs wife lay dangerously ill the victim of his drunken frenzy for days after the departure of august and jack the man had kept himself in a stupor then his store of drink failing he had come out of his almost senseless state into an insane frenzy he had tried to kill his wife and wreck his cottage being prevented in the nick of time by dave naab the only one of his brothers who dared approach him then he had ridden off on the white sage trail and had not been heard from since  the mormon put forth all his skill in surgery and medicine to save the life of his sons wife but he admitted that he had grave misgivings as to her recovery but these in no manner affected his patience gentleness and cheer while there was life there was hope said august naab he bade hare after he had rested awhile to pack and ride out to the range and tell his sons that he would come later  it was a relief to leave the oasis and hare started the same day and made silver cup that night as he rode under the lowbranching cedars toward the bright campfire he looked about him sharply but not one of the four faces ruddy in the glow belonged to snap naab  hello jack called dave naab into the dark i knew that was you silvermane sure rings bells when he hoofs it down the stones howre you and dad and did you find mescal ill bet that desert child led you clear to the little colorado  hare told the story of the fruitless search  its no more than we expected said dave the man doesnt live who can trail the peon mescals like a captured wild mustang thats slipped her halter and gone free shell die out there on the desert or turn into a stalk of the indian cactus for which shes named its a pity for shes a good girl too good for snap  whats your news inquired hare  oh nothing much replied dave with a short laugh the cattle wintered well weve had little to do but hang round and watch zeke and i chased old whitefoot one day and got pretty close to seeping springs we met joe stube a rider who was once a friend of zekes hes with holderness now and he said that holderness had rebuilt the corrals at the spring also he has put up a big cabin and he has a dozen riders there stube told us snap had been shooting up white sage he finished up by killing snood they got into an argument about you  about me  yes it seems that snood took your part and snap wouldnt stand for it too bad snood was a good fellow theres no use talking snaps going too farhe is dave did not conclude his remark and the silence was more significant than any utterance  what will the mormons in white sage say about snaps killing snood  theyve said a lot this evenbreak business goes all right among gunfighters but the mormons call killing murder theyve outlawed culver and snap will be outlawed next  your father hinted that snap would find the desert too small for him and me  jack you cant be too careful ive wanted to speak to you about it snap will ride in here some day and then daves pause was not reassuring  and it was only on the third day after daves remark that hare riding down the mountain with a deer he had shot looked out from the trail and saw snaps cream pinto trotting toward silver cup beside snap rode a tall man on a big bay when hare reached camp he reported to george and zeke what he had seen and learned in reply that dave had already caught sight of the horsemen and had gone down to the edge of the cedars while they were speaking dave hurriedly ran up the trail  its snap and holderness he called out sharply whats snap doing with holderness whats he bringing him here for  i dont like the looks of it replied zeke deliberately  jack what whatll you do asked dave suddenly  do what can i do im not going to run out of camp because of a visit from men who dont like me  it might be wisest  do you ask me to run to avoid a meeting with your brother  no the dull red came to daves cheek but will you draw on him  certainly not hes august naabs son and your brother  yes and youre my friend which snap wont think of will you draw on holderness then  for the life of me dave i cant tell you replied hare pacing the trail something must break loose in me before i can kill a man id draw i suppose in selfdefence but what good would it do me to pull too late dave this thing is what ive feared im not afraid of snap or holderness not that way i mean im not ready look here would either of them shoot an unarmed man  lord i hope not i dont think so but youre packing your gun  hare unbuckled his cartridgebelt which held his colt and hung it over the pommel of his saddle then he sat down on one of the stone seats near the campfire  there they come whispered zeke and he rose to his feet followed by george  steady you fellows said dave with a warning glance ill do the talking  holderness and snap appeared among the cedars and trotting out into the glade reined in their mounts a few paces from the fire dave naab stood directly before hare and george and zeke stepped aside  howdy boys called out holderness with a smile which was like a gleam of light playing on a frozen lake his amber eyes were steady their gaze contracted into piercing yellow points dave studied the cattleman with cool scorn but refusing to speak to him addressed his brother  snap what do you mean by riding in here with this fellow  im holdernesss new foreman were just looking round replied snap the hard lines the sullen shade the hawkbeak cruelty had returned tenfold to his face and his glance was like a living leaping flame  new foreman exclaimed dave his jaw dropped and he stared in amazement noyou cant mean thatyoure drunk  thats what i said growled snap  youre a liar shouted dave a crimson blot blurring with the brown on his cheeks he jumped off the ground in his fury  its true naab hes my new foreman put in holderness suavely a hundred a monthin goldand ive got as good a place for you  well by gd daves arms came down and his face blanched to his lips holderness  i know what youd say interrupted the ranchman  but stop it i know youre game and whats the use of fighting im talking business ill  you cant talk business or anything else to me said dave naab and he veered sharply toward his brother say it again snap naab youve hired out to ride for this man  thats it  youre going against your father your brothers your own flesh and blood  i cant see it that way  then youre a drunken easilyled fool this mans no rancher hes a rustler he ruined martin cole the father of your first wife hes stolen our cattle hes jumped our waterrights hes trying to break us for gods sake aint you a man  things have gone bad for me replied snap sullenly shifting in his saddle i reckon ill do better to cut out alone for myself  you crooked cur but youre only my halfbrother after all i always knew youd come to something bad but i never thought youd disgrace the naabs and break your fathers heart now then what do you want here be quick thiss our range and you and your boss cant ride here you cant even water your horses out with it  at this hare who had been so absorbed as to forget himself suddenly felt a cold tightening of the skin of his face and a hard swell of his breast the dance of snaps eyes the downward flit of his hand seemed instantaneous with a red flash and loud report instinctively hare dodged but the light impact of something like a puff of air gave place to a tearing hot agony then he slipped down back to the stone with a bloody hand fumbling at his breast  dave leaped with tigerish agility and knocking up the levelled colt held snap as in a vise george naab gave holdernesss horse a sharp kick which made the mettlesome beast jump so suddenly that his rider was nearly unseated zeke ran to hare and laid him back against the stone  cool down there ordered zeke hes done for  my godmy god cried dave in a broken voice notnot dead  shot through the heart  dave naab flung snap backward almost off his horse dn you run or ill kill you and you holderness remember if we ever meet againyou draw he tore a branch from a cedar and slashed both horses they plunged out of the glade and clattering over the stones brushing the cedars disappeared dave groped blindly back toward his brothers  zeke thiss awful another murder by snap and my friend whos to tell father  then hare sat up leaning against the stone his shirt open and his bare shoulder bloody his face was pale but his eyes were smiling cheer up dave im not dead yet  sure hes not said zeke he ducked none too soon or too late and caught the bullet high up in the shoulder  dave sat down very quietly without a word and the hand he laid on hares knee shook a little  when i saw george go for his gun went on zeke i knew thered be a lively time in a minute if it wasnt stopped so i just said jack was dead  do you think they came over to get me asked hare  no doubt replied dave lifting his face and wiping the sweat from his brow i knew that from the first but i was so dazed by snaps going over to holderness that i couldnt keep my wits and i didnt mark snap edging over till too late  listen i hear horses said zeke looking up from his task over hares wound  its billy up on the home trail added george yes and theres father with him good lord must we tell him about snap  some one must tell him answered dave  thatll be you then you always do the talking  august naab galloped into the glade and swung himself out of the saddle i heard a shot whats this whos hurthare whyladhow is it with you  not bad rejoined hare  let me see august thrust zeke aside a bulletholejust missed the bonenot serious tie it up tight ill take him home tomorrow hare whos been here  snap rode in and left his respects  snap already yet i knew iti saw it you had providence with you lad for this wound is not bad snap surprised you then  no i knew it was coming  jack hung his belt and gun on silvermanes saddle said dave he didnt feel as if he could draw on either snap or holderness  holderness  yes snap rode in with holderness hare thought if he was unarmed they wouldnt draw but snap did  was he drunk  no they came over to kill hare dave went on to recount the incident in full andand see here dadthats not all snaps gone to the bad  dave naab hid his face while he told of his brothers treachery the others turned away and hare closed his eyes  for long moments there was silence broken only by the tramp of the old man as he strode heavily to and fro at last the footsteps ceased and hare opened his eyes to see naabs tall form erect his arms uplifted his shaggy head rigid  hare began august presently im responsible for this cowardly attack on you i brought you out here this is the second one beware of the third i seebut tell me do you remember that i said you must meet snap as man to man  yes  dont you want to live  of course  you hold to no mormon creed  why no hare replied wonderingly  what was the reason i taught you my trick with a gun  i suppose it was to help me to defend myself  then why do you let yourself be shot down in cold blood why did you hang up your gun why didnt you draw on snap was it because of his father his brothers his family  partly but not altogether replied hare slowly i didnt know before what i know now my flesh sickened at the thought of killing a man even to save my own life and to killyour son  no son of mine thundered naab remember that when next you meet i dont want your blood on my hands dont stand to be killed like a sheep if you have felt duty to me i release you  zeke finished bandaging the wound making a bed of blankets he lifted hare into it and covered him cautioning him to lie still hare had a sensation of extreme lassitude a deep drowsiness which permeated even to his bones there were intervals of oblivion then a time when the stars blinked in his eyes he heard the wind silvermanes bell the murmur of voices yet all seemed remote from him intangible as things in a dream  he rode home next day drooping in the saddle and fainting at the end of the trail with the strong arm of august naab upholding him his wound was dressed and he was put to bed where he lay sleeping most of the time brooding the rest  in three weeks he was in the saddle again riding out over the red strip of desert toward the range during his convalescence he had learned that he had come to the sombre line of choice either he must deliberately back away and show his unfitness to survive in the desert or he must step across into its dark wilds the stern question haunted him yet he knew a swift decision waited on the crucial moment  he sought lonely rides more than ever and like silvermane he was always watching and listening his duties carried him half way to seeping springs across the valley to the red wall up the slope of coconina far into the forest of stately pines what with silvermanes wonderful scent and sight and his own constant watchfulness there were never rangeriders or wild horses nor even deer near him without his knowledge  the days flew by spring had long since given place to summer the blaze of sun and blast of flying sand were succeeded by the cooling breezes from the mountain october brought the flurries of snow and november the dark stormclouds  hare was the last of the riders to be driven off the mountain the brothers were waiting for him at silver cup and they at once packed and started for home  august naab listened to the details of the rangeriding since his absence with silent surprise holderness and snap had kept away from silver cup after the supposed killing of hare occasionally a group of horsemen rode across the valley or up a trail within sight of dave and his followers but there was never a meeting not a steer had been driven off the range that summer and fall and except for the menace always hanging in the blue smoke over seeping springs the rangeriding had passed without unusual incident  so for hare the months had gone by swiftly though when he looked back afterward they seemed years the winter at the oasis he filled as best he could with the children playing in the yard with silvermane under the sunny lee of the great red wall with any work that offered itself it was during the long evenings when he could not be active that time oppressed him and the memories of the past hurt him a glimpse of the red sunset through the cliffgate toward the west would start the train of thought he both loved and hated the painted desert mescal was there in the purple shadows he dreamed of her in the glowing embers of the logfire he saw her on black bolly with hair flying free to the wind and he could not shut out the picture of her sitting in the corner of the room silent with bowed head while the man to whom she was pledged hung close over her that memory had a sting it was like a spark of fire dropped on the wound in his breast where the deserthawk had struck him it was like a light gleaming on the sombre line he was waiting to cross     xiv wolf   on the anniversary of the night mescal disappeared the mysterious voice which had called to hare so often and so strangely again pierced his slumber and brought him bolt upright in his bed shuddering and listening the dark room was as quiet as a tomb he fell back into his blankets trembling with emotion sleep did not close his eyes again that night he lay in a fever waiting for the dawn and when the gray gloom lightened he knew what he must do  after breakfast he sought august naab may i go across the river he asked  the old man looked up from his carpenters task and fastened his glance on hare mescal  yes  i saw it long ago he shook his head and spread his great hands theres no use for me to say what the desert is if you ever come back youll bring her yes you may go its a mans deed god keep you  hare spoke to no other person he filled one saddlebag with grain another with meat bread and dried fruits strapped a fivegallon leather watersack back of silvermanes saddle and set out toward the river at the crossingbar he removed silvermanes equipments and placed them in the boat at that moment a long howl as of a dog baying the moon startled him from his musings and his eyes sought the riverbank up and down and then the opposite side an animal which at first he took to be a gray timberwolf was running along the sandbar of the landing  pretty white for a wolf he muttered might be a navajo dog  the beast sat down on his haunches and lifting a lean head sent up a doleful howl then he began trotting along the bar every few paces stepping to the edge of the water presently he spied hare and he began to bark furiously  its a dog all right wants to get across said hare where have i seen him  suddenly he sprang to his feet almost upsetting the boat hes like mescals wolf he looked closer his heart beginning to thump and then he yelled kiyi wolf hyer hyer  the dog leaped straight up in the air and coming down began to dash back and forth along the sand with piercing yelps  its wolf mescal must be near cried hare a veil obscured his sight and every vein was like a hot cord wolf wolf im coming  with trembling hands he tied silvermanes bridle to the stern seat of the boat and pushed off in his eagerness he rowed too hard dragging silvermanes nose under water and he had to check himself time and again he turned to call to the dog at length the bow grated on the sand and silvermane emerged with a splash and a snort  wolf old fellow cried hare wheres mescal wolf where is she he threw his arms around the dog wolf whined licked hares face and breaking away ran up the sandy trail and back again but he barked no more he waited to see if hare was following  all right wolfcoming never had hare saddled so speedily nor mounted so quickly he sent silvermane into the willowskirted trail close behind the dog up on the rocky bench and then under the bulging wall wolf reached the level between the canyon and echo cliffs and then started straight west toward the painted desert he trotted a few rods and turned to see if the man was coming  doubt fear uncertainty ceased for hare with the first blast of dustscented air in his face he knew wolf was leading him to mescal he knew that the cry he had heard in his dream was hers that the old mysterious promise of the desert had at last begun its fulfilment he gave one sharp exultant answer to that call the horizon everwidening lay before him and the treeless plains the sunscorched slopes the sandy stretches the massed blocks of black mesas all seemed to welcome him his soul sang within him  for mescal was there far away she must be a mere grain of sand in all that world of drifting sands perhaps ill perhaps hurt but alive waiting for him calling for him crying out with a voice that no distance could silence he did not see the sharp peaks as pitiless barriers nor the mesas and domes as blackfaced death nor the moisturedrinking sands as lifesucking foes to plant and beast and man that painted wonderland had sheltered mescal for a year he had loved it for its color its change its secrecy he loved it now because it had not been a grave for mescal but a home therefore he laughed at the deceiving yellow distances in the foreground of glistening mesas at the deceiving purple distances of the faroff horizon the wind blew a song in his ears the dry desert odors were fragrance in his nostrils the sand tasted sweet between his teeth and the quivering heatwaves veiling the desert in transparent haze framed beautiful pictures for his eyes  wolf kept to the fore for some thirty paces and though he had ceased to stop he still looked back to see if the horse and man were following hare had noted the dog occasionally in the first hours of travel but he had given his eyes mostly to the broken line of sky and desert in the west to the receding contour of echo cliffs to the spread and break of the desert near at hand here and there life showed itself in a gaunt coyote sneaking into the cactus or a horned toad huddling down in the dust or a jeweleyed lizard sunning himself upon a stone it was only when his excited fancy had cooled that hare came to look closely at wolf but for the dogs color he could not have been distinguished from a real wolf his head and ears and tail drooped and he was lame in his right front paw  hare halted in the shade of a stone dismounted and called the dog to him wolf returned without quickness without eagerness without any of the oldtime friendliness of shepherding days his eyes were sad and strange hare felt a sudden foreboding but rejected it with passionate force yet a chill remained lifting wolfs paw he discovered that the ball of the foot was worn through whereupon he called into service a piece of buckskin and fashioning a rude moccasin he tied it round the foot wolf licked his hand but there was no change in the sad light of his eyes he turned toward the west as if anxious to be off  all right old fellow said hare only go slow from the look of that foot i think youve turned back on a long trail  again they faced the west dog leading man following and addressed themselves to a gradual ascent when it had been surmounted hare realized that his ride so far had brought him only through an anteroom the real portal now stood open to the painted desert the immensity of the thing seemed to reach up to him with a thousand lines ridges canyons all ascending out of a purple gulf the arms of the desert enveloped him a chill beneath their warmth  as he descended into the valley keeping close to wolf he marked a straight course in line with a volcanic spur he was surprised when the dog though continually threading jumbles of rock heading canyons crossing deep washes and going round obstructions always veered back to this bearing as true as a compassneedle to its magnet  hare felt the air growing warmer and closer as he continued the descent by midafternoon when he had travelled perhaps thirty miles he was moist from head to foot and silvermanes coat was wet looking backward hare had a blank feeling of loss the sweeping line of echo cliffs had retreated behind the horizon there was no familiar landmark left  sunset brought him to a standstill as much from its sudden glorious gathering of brilliant crimsons splashed with gold as from its warning that the day was done hare made his camp beside a stone which would serve as a windbreak he laid his saddle for a pillow and his blanket for a bed he gave silvermane a nosebag full of water and then one of grain he fed the dog and afterward attended to his own needs when his task was done the desert brightness had faded to gray the warm air had blown away on a cool breeze and night approached he scooped out a little hollow in the sand for his hips took a last look at silvermane haltered to the rock and calling wolf to his side stretched himself to rest he was used to lying on the ground under the open sky out where the wind blew and the sand seeped in yet all these were different on this night he was in the painted desert wolf crept close to him mescal lay somewhere under the bluewhite stars  he awakened and arose before any color of dawn hinted of the day while he fed his fourfooted companions the sky warmed and lightened a tinge of rose gathered in the east the air was cool and transparent he tried to cheer wolf out of his sadeyed forlornness and failed  hare vaulted into the saddle the day had its possibilities and while he had sobered down from his first unthinking exuberance there was still a ring in his voice as he called to the dog  on wolf on old boy  out of the east burst the sun and the gray curtain was lifted by shafts of pink and white and gold flashing westward long trails of color  when they started the actions of the dog showed hare that wolf was not tracking a backtrail but travelling by instinct there were draws which necessitated a search for a crossing and areas of broken rock which had to be rounded and steep flat mesas rising in the path and strips of deep sand and canyons impassable for long distances but the dog always found a way and always came back to a line with the black spur that hare had marked it still stood in sharp relief no nearer than before receding with every step an illusive landmark which hare began to distrust  then quite suddenly it vanished in the ragged blue mass of the ghost mountains hare had seen them several times though never so distinctly the purple tips the bold rockribs the shadowed canyons so sharp and clear in the morning lighthow impossible to believe that these were only the deceit of the desert mirage yet so they were even for the navajos they were spiritmountains  the splintered desertfloor merged into an area of sand wolf slowed his trot and silvermanes hoofs sunk deep dismounting hare labored beside him and felt the heat steal through his boots and burn the soles of his feet hare plodded onward stopping once to tie another moccasin on wolfs worn paw this time the left one and often he pulled the stopper from the waterbag and cooled his parching lips and throat the waves of the sanddunes were as the waves of the ocean he did not look backward dreading to see what little progress he had made ahead were miles on miles of graceful heaps swelling mounds crested ridges all different yet regular and rhythmical drift on drift dune on dune in endless waves wisps of sand were whipped from their summits in white ribbons and wreaths and pale clouds of sand shrouded little hollows the morning breeze rising out of the west approached in a rippling lines like the crest of an inflowing tide  silvermane snorted lifted his ears and looked westward toward a yellow pall which swooped up from the desert  sandstorm said hare and calling wolf he made for the nearest rock that was large enough to shelter them the whirling sandcloud mushroomed into an enormous desert covering engulfing the dunes obscuring the light the sunlight failed the day turned to gloom then an eddying fog of sand and dust enveloped hare his last glimpse before he covered his face with a silk handkerchief was of sheets of sand streaming past his shelter the storm came with a low soft hissing roar like the sound in a seashell magnified breathing through the handkerchief hare avoided inhaling the sand which beat against his face but the finer dust particles filtered through and stifled him at first he felt that he would suffocate and he coughed and gasped but presently when the thicker sandclouds had passed he managed to get air enough to breathe then he waited patiently while the steady seeping rustle swept by and the band of his hat sagged heavier and the load on his shoulders had to be continually shaken off and the weighty trap round his feet crept upward when the light fine touch ceased he removed the covering from his face to see himself standing nearly to his knees in sand and silvermanes back and the saddle burdened with it the storm was moving eastward a dull red now with the sun faintly showing through it like a ball of fire  well wolf old boy how many storms like that will we have to weather asked hare in a cheery tone which he had to force he knew these sandstorms were but vagaries of the desertwind before the hour closed he had to seek the cover of a stone and wait for another to pass then he was caught in the open with not a shelter in sight he was compelled to turn his back to a third storm the worst of all and to bear as best he could the heavy impact of the first blow and the succeeding rush and flow of sand after that his head drooped and he wearily trudged beside silvermane dreading the interminable distance he must cover before once more gaining hard ground but he discovered that it was useless to try to judge distance on the desert what had appeared miles at his last look turned out to be only rods  it was good to get into the saddle again and face clear air far away the black spur again loomed up now surrounded by groups of mesas with sageslopes tinged with green that surely meant the end of this long trail the faint spots of green lent suggestion of a desert waterhole there mescal must be hidden in some shady canyon hare built his hopes anew  so he pressed on down a plain of bare rock dotted by huge bowlders and out upon a level floor of scant sage and greasewood where a few living creatures a deserthawk sailing low lizards darting into holes and a swiftly running groundbird emphasized the lack of life in the waste he entered a zone of claydunes of violet and heliotrope hues and then a belt of lava and cactus reddish points studded the desert and here and there were meagre patches of white grass far away myriads of cactus plants showed like a troop of distorted horsemen as he went on the grass failed and streams of jagged lava flowed downward beds of cinders told of the fury of a volcanic fire soon hare had to dismount to make moccasins for wolfs hind feet and to lead silvermane carefully over the cracked lava for a while there were strips of ground bare of lava and harboring only an occasional bunch of cactus but soon every foot free of the reddish iron bore a projecting mass of fierce spikes and thorns the huge barrelshaped cacti and thickets of slender darkgreen rods with bayonet points and broad leaves with yellow spines drove hare and his sorefooted fellowtravellers to the lava  hare thought there must be an end to it some time yet it seemed as though he were never to cross that black forbidding inferno blistered by the heat pierced by the thorns lame from long toil on the lava he was sorely spent when once more he stepped out upon the bare desert on pitching camp he made the grievous discovery that the waterbag had leaked or the water had evaporated for there was only enough left for one more day he ministered to thirsty dog and horse in silence his mind revolving the grim fact of his situation  his little fire of greasewood threw a wan circle into the surrounding blackness not a sound hinted of life he longed for even the bark of a coyote silvermane stooped motionless with tired head wolf stretched limply on the sand hare rolled into his blanket and stretched out with slow aching relief  he dreamed he was a boy roaming over the green hills of the old farm wading through dewy cloverfields and fishing in the connecticut river it was the long vacationtime an endless freedom then he was at the swimminghole and playmates tied his clothes in knots and with shouts of glee ran up the bank leaving him there to shiver  when he awakened the blazing globe of the sun had arisen over the eastern horizon and the red of the desert swathed all the reach of valley  hare pondered whether he should use his water at once or dole it out that ball of fire in the sky a glazed circle like iron at white heat decided for him the sun would be hot and would evaporate such water as leakage did not claim and so he shared alike with wolf and gave the rest to silvermane  for an hour the mocking lilac mountains hung in the air and then paled in the intense light the day was soundless and windless and the heatwaves rose from the desert like smoke for hare the realities were the baked clay flats where silvermane broke through at every step the beds of alkali which sent aloft clouds of powdered dust the deep gullies full of round bowlders thickets of mesquite and prickly thorn which tore at his legs the weary detour to head the canyons the climb to get between two bridging mesas and always the haunting presence of the sadeyed dog his unrealities were the shimmering sheets of water in every low place the baseless mountains floating in the air the green slopes rising close at hand beautiful buttes of dark blue riding the open sand like monstrous barks at sea the changing outlines of desert shapes in pink haze and veils of purple and white lustreall illusions all mysterious tricks of the mirage  in the heat of midday hare yielded to its influence and reined in his horse under a slatebank where there was shade his face was swollen and peeling and his lips had begun to dry and crack and taste of alkali then wolf pattered on silvermane kept at his heels hare dozed in the saddle his eyes burned in their sockets from the glare and it was a relief to shut out the barren reaches so the afternoon waned  silvermane stumbled jolting hare out of his stupid lethargy before him spread a great field of bowlders with not a slope or a ridge or a mesa or an escarpment not even a tip of a spur rose in the background he rubbed his sore eyes was this another illusion  when silvermane started onward hare thought of the navajos custom to trust horse and dog in such an emergency they were desertbred beyond human understanding were their sight and scent he was at the mercy now of wolfs instinct and silvermanes endurance resignation brought him a certain calmness of soul cold as the touch of an icy hand on fevered cheek he remembered the desert secret in mescals eyes he was about to solve it he remembered august naabs words its a mans deed if so he had achieved the spirit of it if not the letter he remembered eschtahs tribute to the wilderness of painted wastes there is the grave of the navajo and no one knows the trail to the place of his sleep he remembered the something evermore about to be the unknown always subtly calling now it was revealed in the stonefettering grip of the desert it had opened wide to him bright with its face of danger beautiful with its painted windows inscrutable with its alluring call bidding him enter it had closed behind him now he looked upon it in its iron order its strange ruins racked by fire its inevitable remorselessness     xv desert night   the gray stallion finding the rein loose on his neck trotted forward and overtook the dog and thereafter followed at his heels with the setting of the sun a slight breeze stirred and freshened as twilight fell rolling away the sultry atmosphere then the black desert night mantled the plain  for a while this blackness soothed the pain of hares sunblinded eyes it was a relief to have the unattainable horizon line blotted out but byandby the opaque gloom brought home to him as the day had never done the reality of his solitude he was alone in this immense place of barrenness and his dumb companions were the world to him wolf pattered onward a silent guide and silvermane followed never lagging surefooted in the dark faithful to his master all the love hare had borne the horse was as nothing to that which came to him on this desert night in and out round and round ever winding ever zigzagging silvermane hung close to wolf and the sandy lanes between the bowlders gave forth no sound dog and horse free to choose their trail trotted onward miles and miles into the night  a pale light in the east turned to a glow then to gold and the round disc of the moon silhouetted the black bowlders on the horizon it cleared the dotted line and rose an oval orangehued strange moon not mellow nor silvery nor gloriously brilliant as hare had known it in the past but a vast deadgold melancholy orb rising sadly over the desert to hare it was the crowning reminder of lifelessness it fitted this world of dull gleaming stones  silvermane went lame and slackened his trot causing hare to rein in and dismount he lifted the right forefoot the one the horse had favored and found a stone imbedded tightly in the cloven hoof he pried it out with his knife and mounted again wolf shone faintly far ahead and presently he uttered a mournful cry which sent a chill to the riders heart the silence had been oppressive before now it was terrible it was not a silence of life it had been broken suddenly by wolfs howl and had closed sharply after it without echo it was a silence of death  hare took care not to fall behind wolf again he had no wish to hear that cry repeated the dog moved onward with silent feet the horse wound after him with hoofs padded in the sand the moon lifted and the desert gleamed the bowlders grew larger and the lanes wider so the night wore on and hares eyelids grew heavy and his whole weary body cried out for rest and forgetfulness he nodded until he swayed in the saddle then righted himself only to doze again the east gave birth to the morning star the whitening sky was the harbinger of day hare could not bring himself to face the light and heat and he stopped at a windworn cave under a shelving rock he was asleep when he rolled out on the sandstrewn floor once he awoke and it was still day for his eyes quickly shut upon the glare he lay sweltering till once more slumber claimed him the dog awakened him with cold nose and low whine another twilight had fallen hare crawled out stiff and sore hungry and parching with thirst he made an attempt to eat but it was a failure there was a dry burning in his throat a dizzy feeling in his brain and there were red flashes before his eyes wolf refused meat and silvermane turned from the grain and lowered his head to munch a few blades of desert grass  then the journey began and the night fell black a cool wind blew from the west the white stars blinked the weird moon rose with its ghastly glow huge bowlders rose before him in grotesque shapes tombs and pillars and statues of natures dead carved by wind and sand but some had life in hares disordered fancy they loomed and towered over him and stalked abroad and peered at him with deepset eyes  hare fought with all his force against this mood of gloom wolf was not a phantom he trotted forward with unerring instinct and he would find water and that meant life silvermane desertsteeled would travel to the furthermost corner of this hell of sandswept stone hare tried to collect all his spirit all his energies but the battle seemed to be going against him all about him was silence breathless silence insupportable silence of ages desert spectres danced in the darkness the wornout moon gleamed golden over the wornout waste desolation lurked under the sable shadows  hare rode on into the night tumbled from his saddle in the gray of dawn to sleep and stumbled in the twilight to his drooping horse his eyes were blind now to the desert shapes his brain burned and his tongue filled his mouth silvermane trod ever upon wolfs heels he had come into the kingdom of his desertstrength he lifted his drooping head and lengthened his stride weariness had gone and he snorted his welcome to something on the wind then he passed the limping dog and led the way  hare held to the pommel and bent dizzily forward in the saddle silvermane was going down step by step with metallic clicks upon flinty rock whether he went down or up was all the same to hare he held on with closed eyes and whispered to himself down and down step by step cracking the stones with ironshod hoofs the gray stallion worked his perilous way surefooted as a mountainsheep then he stopped with a great slow heave and bent his head  the black bulge of a canyon rim blurred in hares hot eyes a trickling sound penetrated his tired brain his ears had grown like his eyesfalse only another delusion as he had been tortured with the sight of lake and stream now he was to be tortured with the sound of running water yet he listened for it was sweet even in its mockery what a clear musical tinkle like silver bells tossing on the wind he listened soft murmuring flow babble and gurgle little hollow fall and splash  suddenly silvermane lifting his head broke the silence of the canyon with a great sigh of content it pierced the dull fantasy of hares mind it burst the gloomy spell the sigh and the snort which followed were silvermanes triumphant signals when he had drunk his fill  hare fell from the saddle the gray dog lay stretched low in the darkness hare crawled beside him and reached out with his hot hands smooth cool marble rock growing slippery then wet led into running water he slid forward on his face and wonderful cold thrills quivered over his burning skin he drank and drank until he could drink no more then he lay back upon the rock the madness of his brain went out with the light of the stars and he slept  when he awoke red canyon walls leaned far above him to a gap spanned by blue sky a song of rushing water murmured near his ears he looked down a spring gushed from a crack in the wall silvermane cropped green bushes and wolf sat on his haunches waiting but no longer with sad eyes and strange mien hare raised himself looking again and again and slowly gathered his wits the crimson blur had gone from his eyes and the burning from his skin and the painful swelling from his tongue  he drank long and deeply and rising with clearing thoughts and thankful heart he kissed wolfs white head and laid his arms round silvermanes neck he fed them and ate himself not without difficulty for his lips were puffed and his tongue felt like a piece of rope when he had eaten his strength came back  at a word wolf with a wag of his tail splashed into the gravelly stream bed hare followed on foot leading silvermane there were little beds of pebbles and beaches of sand and short steps down which the water babbled the canyon was narrow and tortuous hare could not see ahead or below for the projecting red cliffs growing higher as he descended walled out the view the blue stream of sky above grew bluer and the light and shade less bright for an hour he went down steadily without a check and the farther down the rougher grew the way bowlders wedged in narrow places made foaming waterfalls silvermane clicked down confidently  the slender stream of water swelled by seeping springs and little rills gained the dignity of a brook it began to dash merrily and hurriedly downward the depth of the falls the height of cliffs and the size of the bowlders increased in the descent wolf splashed on unmindful there was a new spirit in his movements and when he looked back for his laboring companions there was friendly protest in his eyes silvermanes mien plainly showed that where a dog could go he could follow silvermanes blood was heated the desert was an old story to him it had only tired him and parched his throat this canyon of downward steps and falls with everdeepening drops was new to him and roused his mettle and from his long training in the wilds he had gained a marvellous surefootedness  the canyon narrowed as it deepened the jutting walls leaned together shutting out the light the sky above was now a ribbon of blue only to be seen when hare threw back his head and stared straight up  itll be easier climbing up silvermane he pantedif we ever get the chance  the sand and gravel and shale had disappeared all was bare cleanwashed rock in many places the brook failed as a trail for it leaped down in white sheets over mossy cliffs hare faced these walls in despair but wolf led on over the ledges and silvermane followed nothing daunted at last hare shrank back from a hole which defied him utterly even wolf hesitated the canyon was barely twenty feet wide the floor ended in a precipice the stream leaped out and fell into a dark cleft from which no sound arose on the right there was a shelf of rock it was scarce half a foot broad at the narrowest and then apparently vanished altogether hare stared helplessly up at the slanting shutin walls  while he hesitated wolf pattered out upon the ledge and silvermane stamped restlessly with a desperate fear of losing his beloved horse hare let go the bridle and stepped upon the ledge he walked rapidly for a slow step meant uncertainty and a false one meant death he heard the sharp ring of silvermanes shoes and he listened in agonized suspense for the slip the snort the crash that he feared must come but it did not come seeing nothing except the narrow ledge yet feeling the blue abyss beneath him he bent all his mind to his task and finally walked out into lighter space upon level rock to his infinite relief silvermane appeared rounding a corner out of the dark passage and was soon beside him  hare cried aloud in welcome  the canyon widened there was a clear demarcation where the red walls gave place to yellow the brook showed no outlet from its subterranean channel sheer exhaustion made hare almost forget his mission the strength of his resolve had gone into mechanical toil he kept on conscious only of the smart of bruised hands and feet and the ache of laboring lungs  time went on and the sun hung in the midst of the broadening belt of blue sky a long slant of yellow slope led down to a sagecovered level which hare crossed pleased to see blooming cacti and wondering at their slender lofty green stems shining with gold flowers he descended into a ravine which became precipitous here he made only slow advance at the bottom he found himself in a wonderful lane with an almost level floor here flowed a shallow stream bordered by green willows wolf took the direction of the flowing water hares thoughts were all of mescal and his hopes began to mount his heart to beat high  he gazed ahead with straining eyes presently there was not a break in the walls a drowsy hum of falling water came to hare strange reminder of the oasis the dull roar of the colorado and of mescal  his flagging energies leaped into life with the canyon suddenly opening to bright light and blue sky and beautiful valley white and gold in blossom green with grass and cottonwood on a flowerscented wind rushed that muffled roar again like distant thunder  wolf dashed into the cottonwoods silvermane whistled with satisfaction and reached for the long grass  for hare the light held something more than beauty the breeze something more than sweet scent of water and blossom both were charged with meaningwith suspense  wolf appeared in the open leaping upon a slender browngarbed form  mescal cried hare  with a cry she ran to him her arms outstretched her hair flying in the wind her dark eyes wild with joy     xvi thunder river   for an instant hares brain reeled and mescals broken murmurings were meaningless then his faculties grew steady and acute he held the girl as if he intended never to let her go mescal clung to him with a wildness that gave him anxiety for her reason there was something almost fierce in the tension of her arms in the blind groping for his face  mescal its jack safe and well he said let me look at you  at the sound of his voice all her rigid strength changed to a yielding weakness she leaned back supported by his arms and looked at him hare trembled before the dusky level glance he remembered so well and as tears began to flow he drew her head to his shoulder he had forgotten to prepare himself for a different mescal despite the quivering smile of happiness her eyes were strained with pain the oval contour the rich bloom of her face had gone beauty was there still but it was the ghost of the old beauty  jackis itreally you she asked  he answered with a kiss  she slipped out of his arms breathless and scarlet tell me all  theres much to tell but not before you kiss me it has been more than a year  only a year have i been gone only a year  yes a year but its past now kiss me mescal one kiss will pay for that long year though it broke my heart  shyly she raised her hands to his shoulders and put her lips to his yes youve found me jack thank god just in time  mescal whats wrong arent you well  pretty well but if you had not come soon i should have starved  starved let me get my saddlebagsi have bread and meat  wait im not so hungry now i mean very soon i should not have had any food at all  but your peonthe dumb indian surely he could find something to eat what of him where is he  my peon is dead he has been dead for months i dont know how many  dead what was the matter with him  i never knew i found him dead one morning and i buried him in the sand  mescal led hare under the cottonwoods and pointed to the indians grave now green with grass farther on in a circle of trees stood a little hogan skilfully constructed out of brush the edge of a red blanket peeped from the door a burntout fire smoked on a stone fireplace and blackened earthen vessels lay near the white seeds of the cottonwoods were flying light as feathers plumtrees were pink in blossom there were vines twining all about through the openings in the foliage shone the blue of sky and red of cliff patches of blossoming bowers were here and there lit to brilliance by golden shafts of sunlight the twitter of birds and hum of bees were almost drowned in the soft roar of water  is that the colorado i hear asked hare  no thats thunder river the colorado is farther down in the grand canyon  farther down mescal i must have come a mile from the rim where are we  we are almost at the colorado and directly under the head of coconina we can see the mountain from the break in the valley below  come sit by me here under this tree tell mehow did you ever get here  then mescal told him how the peon had led her on a long trail from bitter seeps how they had camped at desert waterholes and on the fourth day descended to thunder river  i was quite happy at first its always summer down here there were rabbits birds beaver and fruitwe had enough to eat i explored the valley with wolf or rode noddle up and down the canyon then my peon died and i had to shift for myself there came a time when the beaver left the valley and wolf and i had to make a rabbit serve for days i knew then id have to get across the desert to the navajos or starve in the canyon i hesitated about climbing out into the desert for i wasnt sure of the trail to the waterholes noddle wandered off up the canyon and never came back after he was gone and i knew i couldnt get out i grew homesick the days werent so bad because i was always hunting for something to eat but the nights were lonely i couldnt sleep i lay awake listening to the river and at last i could hear whispering and singing and music and strange sounds and low thunder always low thunder i wasnt really frightened only lonely and the canyon was so black and full of mutterings sometimes id dream i was back on the plateau with you jack and bolly and the sheep and when id awake in the loneliness id cry right out  mescal i heard those cries said hare  it was strangethe way i felt i believe if id never known andand loved you jack id have forgotten home after id been here a while i seemed to be drifting drifting it was as if i had lived in the canyon long before and was remembering the feeling was strong but always thoughts of you and of the big world brought me back to the present with its loneliness and fear of starvation then i wanted you and id cry out i knew i must send wolf home how hard it was to make him go but at last he trotted off looking backward and iwaited and waited  she leaned against him the hand which had plucked at his sleeve dropped to his fingers and clung there hare knew how her story had slighted the perils and privations of that long year she had grown lonely in the canyon darkness she had sent wolf away and had waitedall was said in that but more than any speech the look of her and the story told in the thin brown hands touched his heart not for an instant since his arrival had she altogether let loose of his fingers or coat or arm she had lived so long alone in this weird world of silence and moving shadows and murmuring water that she needed to feel the substance of her hopes to assure herself of the reality of the man she loved  my mustangbollytell me of her said mescal  bollys fine sleek and fat and lazy shes been in the fields ever since you left not a bridle on her many times have i seen her poke her black muzzle over the fence and look down the lane shed never forget you mescal  oh how i want to see her tell meeverything  wait a little let me fetch silvermane and well make a fire and eat then  tell me now  well mescal its soon told then came the story of events growing out of her flight when he told of the shooting at silver cup mescal rose with heaving bosom and blazing eyes  it was nothingi wasnt hurt much only the intention was bad we saw no more of snap or holderness the worst of it all was that snaps wife died  oh i am sorrysorry poor father naab how he must hate me the cause of it all but i couldnt stayi couldnt marry snap  dont blame yourself mescal what snap might have done if you had married him is guesswork he might have left drink alone a while longer but he was bad clean through i heard dave naab tell him that snap would have gone over to holderness sooner or later and now hes a rustler if not worse  then those men think snap killed you  yes  whats going to happen when you meet snap or any of them  somebody will be surprised replied hare with a laugh  jack its no laughing matter she fastened her hands in the lapels of his coat and her eyes grew sad you can never hang up your gun again  no but perhaps i can keep out of their way especially snaps mescal youve forgotten silvermane and how he can run  i havent forgotten he can run but he cant beat bolly she said this with a hint of her old spirit jackyou want to take me back home  of course what did you expect when you sent wolf  i didnt expect i just wanted to see you or somebody and i thought of the navajos couldnt i live with them why cant we stay here or in a canyon across the colorado where theres plenty of game  im going to take you home and father naab shall marry youtoto me  startled mescal fell back upon his shoulder and did not stir nor speak for a long time diddid you tell him  yes  what did he say was he angry tell me  he was kind and good as he always is he said if i found you then the issue would be between snap and me as man to man you are still pledged to snap in the mormon church and that cant be changed i dont suppose even if hes outlawed that it could be changed  snap will not let any grass grow in the trails to the oasis said mescal once he finds ive come back to life hell have me you dont know him jack im afraid to go home  my dear theres no other place for us to go we cant live the life of indians  but jack think of me watching you ride out from home think of me always looking for snap i couldnt endure it ive grown weak in this year of absence  mescal look at me his voice rang as he held her face to face we must decide everything nowsay you love me  yesyes  say it  ilove youjack  say youll marry me  i will marry you  then listen ill get you out of this canyon and take you home you are mine and ill keep you he held her tightly with strong arms his face paled his eyes darkened i dont want to meet snap naab i shall try to keep out of his way i hope i can but mescal im yours now your happinessperhaps your lifedepends on me that makes a difference understand  silvermane walked into the glade with a saddlegirth so tight that his master unbuckled it only by dint of repeated effort evidently the rich grass of thunder river canyon appealed strongly to the desert stallion  here silver how do you expect to carry us out if you eat and drink like that hare removed the saddle and tethered the gray to one of the cottonwoods wolf came trotting into camp proudly carrying a rabbit  mescal can we get across the colorado and find a way up over coconina asked hare  yes im sure we can my peon never made a mistake about directions theres no trail but navajos have crossed the river at this season and worked up a canyon  the shadows had gathered under the cliffs and the rosy light high up on the ramparts had chilled and waned when hare and mescal sat down to their meal wolf lay close to the girl and begged for morsels then in the twilight they sat together content to be silent listening to the low thunder of the river long after mescal had retired into her hogan hare lay awake before her door with his head in his saddle and listened to the low roll the dull burr the dreamy hum of the tumbling waters the place was like the oasis only infinitely more hidden under the cliffs a few stars twinkled out of the dark blue and one hung beaconlike on the crest of a noble crag there were times when he imagined the valley was as silent as the desert night and other times when he imagined he heard the thundering roll of avalanches and the tramp of armies then the voices of mescals solitude spoke to himglorious laughter and low sad wails of woe sweet songs and whispers and murmurs his last waking thoughts were of the haunting sound of thunder river and that he had come to bear mescal away from its loneliness  he bestirred himself at the first glimpse of day and when the gray mists had lifted to wreathe the crags it was light enough to begin the journey mescal shed tears at the grave of the faithful peon he loved this canyon she said softly hare lifted her upon silvermane he walked beside the horse and wolf trotted on before they travelled awhile under the flowering cottonwoods on a trail bordered with green tufts of grass and great starshaped lilies the river was still hidden but it filled the grove with its soft thunder gradually the trees thinned out hard stony ground encroached upon the sand bowlders appeared in the way and presently when silvermane stepped out of the shade of the cottonwoods hare saw the lower end of the valley with its ragged vent  look back said mescal  hare saw the river bursting from the base of the wall in two white streams which soon united below and leaped down in a continuous cascade step by step the stream plunged through the deep gorge a broken foaming raceway and at the lower end of the valley it took its final leap into a blue abyss and then found its way to the colorado hidden underground  the flowerscented breeze and the rumbling of the river persisted long after the valley lay behind and above but these failed at length in the close air of the huge abutting walls the light grew thick the stones cracked like deep bellstrokes the voices of man and girl had a hollow sound and echo silvermane clattered down the easy trail at a gait which urged hare now and then from walk to run soon the gully opened out upon a plateau through the centre of which in a black gulf wound the red colorado sullenvoiced booming never silent nor restful here were distances by which hare could begin to comprehend the immensity of the canyon and he felt lost among the great terraces leading up to mesas that dwarfed the echo cliffs all was bare rock of many hues burning under the sun  jack this is mescal said the girl pointing to some towering plants  all over the sunny slopes cacti lifted slender shafts unfolding in spiral leaves as they shot upward and bursting at the top into plumes of yellow flowers the blossoming stalks waved in the wind and black bees circled round them  mescal ive always wanted to see the flower of the desert from which youre named its beautiful  hare broke a dead stalk of the cactus and was put to instant flight by a stream of bees pouring with angry buzz from the hollow centre two big fellows were so persistent that he had to beat them off with his hat  you shouldnt despoil their homes said mescal with a peal of laughter  ill break another stalk and get stung if youll laugh again replied hare  they traversed the remaining slope of the plateau and entering the head of a ravine descended a steep cleft of flinty rock rock so hard that silvermanes iron hoofs not so much as scratched it then reaching a level they passed out to rounded sand and the river  its a little high said hare dubiously mescal i dont like the looks of those rapids  only a few hundred rods of the river could be seen in front of hare the current was swift but not broken above where the canyon turned the river sheered out with a majestic roll and falling in a wide smooth curve suddenly narrowed into a leaping crest of reddish waves below hare was a smaller rapid where the broken water turned toward the nearer side of the river but with an accompaniment of twisting swirls and vicious waves  i guess wed better risk it said hare grimly recalling the hot rock the sand and lava of the desert  its safe if silvermane is a good swimmer replied mescal we can take the river above and cut across so the current will help  silvermane loves the water hell make this crossing easily but he cant carry us both and its impossible to make two trips ill have to swim  without wasting more words and time over a task which would only grow more formidable with every look and thought hare led silvermane up the sandbar to its limit he removed his coat and strapped it behind the saddle his belt and revolver and boots he hung over the pommel  how about wolf id forgotten him  never fear for him hell stick close to me  now mescal theres the point we want to make that bar see it  surely we can land above that  ill be satisfied if we get even there you guide him for it and mescal heres my gun try to keep it from getting wet balance it on the pommelso come silver come wolf  keep upstream called mescal as hare plunged in dont drift below us  in two steps silvermane went in to his saddle and he rolled with a splash and a snort sinking mescal to her hips his nose level with the water mane and tail floating he swam powerfully with the current  for hare the water was just cold enough to be delightful after the long hot descent but its quality was strange keeping upstream of the horse and even with mescal he swam with long regular strokes for perhaps onequarter of the distance but when they reached the swirling eddies he found that he was tiring the water was thick and heavy it compressed his lungs and dragged at his feet he whirled round and round in the eddies and saw silvermane doing the same only by main force could he breast his way out of these whirlpools when a wave slapped his face he tasted sand and then he knew what the strange feeling meant there was sand here as on the desert even in the depths of the canyon he could not escape it as the current grew rougher he began to feel that he could scarcely spread his arms in the wide stroke changing the stroke he discovered that he could not keep up with silvermane and he changed back again gradually his feet sank lower and lower the water pressed tighter round him his arms seemed to grow useless then he remembered a saying of august naab that the navajos did not attempt to swim the river when it was in flood and full of sand he ceased to struggle and drifting with the current soon was close to silvermane and grasped a saddle strap  not there called mescal he might strike you hang to his tail  hare dropped behind and catching silvermanes tail held on firmly the stallion towed him easily the waves dashed over him and lapped at mescals waist the current grew stronger sweeping silvermane down out of line with the black wall which had frowned closer and closer mescal lifted the rifle and resting the stock on the saddle held it upright the roar of the rapids seemed to lose its volume and presently it died in the splashing and slapping of broken water closer at hand mescal turned to him with bright eyes curving her hand about her lips she shouted  cant make the bar weve got to go through this side of the rapids hang on  in the swelling did hare felt the resistless pull of the current as he held on with both hands hard pressed to keep his grasp silvermane dipped over a low fall in the river then hare was riding the rushing water of an incline it ended below in a redcrested wave and beyond was a chaos of curling breakers hare had one glimpse of mescal crouching low shoulders narrowed and head bent then with one white flash of the stallions mane against her flying black hair she went out of sight in leaping waves and spray hare was thrown forward into the backlash of the wave the shock blinded him stunned him almost tore his arms from his body but his hands were so twisted in silvermanes tail that even this could not loosen them the current threw him from wave to wave he was dragged through a caldron blind from stinging blows deaf from the tremendous roar then the fierce contention of waves lessened the threshing of crosscurrents straightened and he could breathe once more silvermane dragged him steadily and finally his feet touched the ground he could scarcely see so full were his eyes of the sandy water but he made out mescal rising from the river on silvermane as with loud snorts he climbed to a bar hare staggered up and fell on the sand  jack are you all right inquired mescal  all right only pounded out of breath and my eyes are full of sand how about you  i dont think i ever was any wetter replied mescal laughing it was hard to stick on holding the rifle that first wave almost unseated me i was afraid we might strike the rocks but the water was deep silvermane is grand jack wolf swam out above the rapids and was waiting for us when we landed  hare wiped the sand out of his eyes and rose to his feet finding himself little the worse for the adventure mescal was wringing the water from the long straight braids of her hair she was smiling and a tint of color showed in her cheeks the wet buckskin blouse and short skirt clung tightly to her slender form she made so pretty a picture and appeared so little affected by the peril they had just passed through that hare yielding to a tender rush of pride and possession kissed the pink cheeks till they flamed  all wet said he you and i clothes food gunseverything  its hot and well soon dry returned mescal heres the canyon and creek we must follow up to coconina my peon mapped them in the sand for me one day itll probably be a long climb  hare poured the water out of his boots pulled them on and helping mescal to mount silvermane he took the bridle over his arm and led the way into a blackmouthed canyon through which flowed a stream of clear water wolf splashed and pattered along beside him beyond the marble rock this canyon opened out to great breadth and wonderful walls hare had eyes only for the gravelly bars and shallow levels of the creek intent on finding the easy going for his horse he strode on and on thoughtless of time nor did he talk to mescal for the work was hard and he needed his breath splashing the water hammering the stones silvermane ever kept his nose at hares elbow they climbed little ridges making short cuts from point to point they threaded miles of narrow winding creek floor and passed under ferny cliffs and over grassy banks and through thickets of yellow willow as they wound along the course of the creek always up and up the great walls imperceptibly lowered their rims the warm sun soared to the zenith jumble of bowlders stretches of white gravel ridges of sage blocks of granite thickets of manzanita long yellow slopes crumbling crags clumps of cedar and lines of pinonall were passed in the persistent plodding climb the canon grew narrower toward its source the creek lost its volume patches of snow gleamed in sheltered places at last the yellowstreaked walls edged out upon a grassy hollow and the great dark pines of coconina shadowed the snow  were up panted hare what a climb five hours one more daythen home  silvermanes ears shot up and wolf barked two gray deer loped out of a thicket and turned inquisitively reaching for his rifle hare threw back the lever but the action clogged it rasped with the sound of crunching sand and the cartridge could not be pressed into the chamber or ejected he fumbled about the breach of the gun and his brow clouded  sand out of commission he exclaimed mescal i dont like that  use your colt suggested mescal  the distance was too great hare missed and the deer bounded away into the forest  hare built a fire under a sheltering pine where no snow covered the soft mat of needles and while mescal dried the blankets and roasted the last portion of meat he made a windbreak of spruce boughs when they had eaten not forgetting to give wolf a portion hare fed silvermane the last few handfuls of grain and tied him with a long halter on the grassy bank the daylight failed and darkness came on apace the old familiar roar of the wind in the pines was disturbing it might mean only the lull and crash of the breaking nightgusts and it might mean the north wind storm and snow it whooped down the hollow scattering the few scruboak leaves it whirled the red embers of the fire away into the dark to sputter in the snow and blew the burning logs into a white glow mescal slept in the shelter of the spruce boughs with wolf snug and warm beside her hare stretched his tired limbs in the heat of the blaze  when he awakened the fire was low and he was numb with cold he took care to put on logs enough to last until morning then he lay down once more but did not sleep the dawn came with a gray shade in the forest it was a cloud and it rolled over him soft tangible moist and cool and passed away under the pines with its vanishing the dawn lightened mescal if were on the spur of coconina its only ten miles or so to silver cup said hare as he saddled silvermane mount now and well go up out of the hollow and get our bearings  while ascending the last step to the rim hare revolved in his mind the probabilities of marking a straight course to silver cup  oh jack exclaimed mescal suddenly vermillion cliffs and home  ive travelled in a circle replied hare  mescal was enraptured at the scene vermillion cliffs shone red as a rose the split in the wall marking the oasis defined its outlines sharply against the sky miles of the colorado river lay in sight hare knew he stood on the highest point of coconina overhanging the grand canyon and the painted desert thousands of feet below he noted the wondrous abyss sleeping in blue mist at his feet while he gazed across to the desert awakening in the first red rays of the rising sun  mescal your thunder river canyon is only one little crack in the rocks it is lost in this chasm said hare  its lost surely i can t even see the tip of the peak that stood so high over the valley  once more turning to the left hare ran his eye over the vermillion cliffs and the strip of red sand shining under them and so calculating his bearings he headed due north for silver cup what with the snow and the soggy ground the first mile was hard going for hare and silvermane often sank deep once off the level spur of the mountain they made better time for the snow thinned out on the slope and gradually gave way to the brown dry aisles of the forest hare mounted in front of mescal and put the stallion to an easy trot after two hours of riding they struck a bridletrail which hare recognized as one leading down to the spring in another hour they reached the steep slope of coconina and saw the familiar red wall across the valley and caught glimpses of gray sage patches down through the pines  i smell smoke said hare  the boys must be at the spring rejoined mescal  maybe i want to be sure whos there well leave the trail and slip down through the woods to the left i wish we could get down on the home side of the spring but we cant weve got to pass it  with many a pause to peer through openings in the pines hare traversed a diagonal course down the slope crossed the line of cedars and reached the edge of the valley a mile or more above silver cup then he turned toward it still cautiously leading silvermane under cover of the fringe of cedars  mescal there are too many cattle in the valley he said looking at her significantly  they cant all be ours thats sure she replied what do you think  holderness with the word hares face grew set and stern he kept on cautiously leading the horse under the cedars careful to avoid breaking brush or rattling stones occasionally whispering to wolf and so worked his way along the curve of the woody slope till further progress was checked by the bulging wall of rock  only cattle in the valley no horses he said ive a good chance to cut across this cube and reach the trail if i take time to climb up and see whos at the spring maybe the chance will be gone i dont believe dave and the boys are there  he pondered a moment then climbed up in front of mescal and directed the gray out upon the valley soon he was among the grazing cattle he felt no surprise to see the h brand on their flanks  jack look at that brand said mescal pointing to a whiteflanked steer theres an old brand like a cross father naabs cross and a new brand a single bar together they make an h  mescal youve hit it i remember that steer he was a very devil to brand hes the property of august naab and holderness has added the bar making a clumsy h what a rustlers trick it wouldnt deceive a child  they had reached the cedars and the trail when wolf began to sniff suspiciously at the wind  look whispered mescal calling hares attention from the dog look a new corral  bending back to get in line with her pointing finger hare looked through a network of cedar boughs to see a fence of stripped pines farther up were piles of unstripped logs and close by the spring there was a new cabin with smoke curling from a stone chimney hare guided silvermane off the trail to softer ground and went on he climbed the slope passed the old pool now a mudpuddle and crossed the dry wash to be brought suddenly to a halt wolf had made an uneasy stand with his nose pointing to the left and silvermane pricked up his ears presently hare heard the stamping of hoofs off in the cedars and before he had fully determined the direction from which the sound came three horses and a man stepped from the shade into a sunlit space  as luck would have it hare happened to be well screened by a thick cedar and since there was a possibility that he might remain unseen he chose to take it silvermane and wolf stood still in their tracks hare felt mescals hands tighten on his coat and he pressed them to reassure her peeping out from his covert he saw a man in his shirtsleeves leading the horsesa slender cleanfaced darkhaired mandene the blood beat hotly in hares temples and he gripped the handle of his colt it seemed a fatal chance that sent the outlaw to that trail he was whistling he had two halters in one hand and with the other he led his bay horse by the mane then hare saw that he wore no belt he was unarmed on the horses were only the halters and clinking hobbles hare dropped his colt back into its holster  dene sauntered on whistling dixie when he reached the trail instead of crossing it as hare had hoped he turned into it and came down  hare swung the switch he had broken from an aspen and struck silvermane a stinging blow on the flanks the gray leaped forward the crash of brush and rattle of hoofs stampeded denes horses in a twinkling but the outlaw paled to a ghastly white and seemed rooted to the trail it was not fear of a man or a horse that held dene fixed in his starting eyes was the terror of the supernatural  the shoulder of the charging stallion struck dene and sent him spinning out of the trail in a backward glance hare saw the outlaw fall then rise unhurt to shake his fists wildly and to run yelling toward the cabin     xvii the swoop of the hawk   jack the saddles slipping cried mescal clinging closer to him what luck hare muttered through clinched teeth and pulled hard on the bridle but the mouth of the stallion was iron regardless of the sawing bit he galloped on hare called steadily whoa there silver whoaslow nowwhoaeasy and finally halted him hare swung down and as he lifted mescal off the saddle slipped to the ground  lucky not to get a spill the girth snapped it was wet and dried out hare hurriedly began to repair the break with buckskin thongs that he found in a saddlebag  listen hear the yells oh hurry cried mescal  ive never ridden bareback suppose you go ahead with silver and ill hide in the cedars till dark then walk home  nono theres time but hurry  its got to be strong muttered hare holding the strap over his knee and pulling the laced knot with all his strength for well have to ride some if it comes loosegoodbye  silvermanes broad chest muscles rippled and he stamped restlessly the dog whined and looked back mescal had the blanket smooth on the gray when hare threw the saddle over him the yells had ceased but clattering hoofs on the stony trail were a greater menace while hares brown hands worked swiftly over buckle and strap mescal climbed to a seat behind the saddle  get into the saddle said hare leaping astride and pressing forward over the pommel slip downthere and hold to me go silver  the rapid pounding of the stallions hoofs drowned the clatter coming up the trail a backward glance relieved hare for dustclouds some few hundred yards in the rear showed the position of the pursuing horsemen he held in silvermane to a steady gallop the trail was uphill and steep enough to wind even a desert racer if put to his limit  look back cried mescal can you see them is snap with them  i cant see for trees replied hare over his shoulder theres dustwere far in the leadnever fear mescal the leads all we want  cedars grew thickly all the way up the steeper part of the divide and ended abruptly at a pathway of stone where the ascent became gradual when silvermane struck out of the grove upon this slope hare kept turning keen glances rearward the dust cloud rolled to the edge of the cedars and out of it trooped halfadozen horsemen who began to shoot as soon as they had reached the open bullets zipped along the red stone cutting little puffs of red dust and sung through the air  good god cried hare theyre firing on us theyd shoot a woman  has it taken you so long to learn that  hare slashed his steed with the switch but silvermane needed no goad or spur he had been shot at before and the whistle of one bullet was sufficient to stretch his gallop into a run then distance between him and his pursuers grew wider and wider and soon he was out of range the yells of the rustlers seemed at first to come from baffled rage but mescals startled cry shoveled their meaning other horsemen appeared ahead and to the right of him tearing down the ridge to the divide evidently they had been returning from the western curve of coconina  the direction in which silvermane was stretching was the only possible one for hare if he swerved off the trail to the left it would be upon rough rising ground not only must he outride this second band to the point where the trail went down on the other side of the divide but also he must get beyond it before they came within rifle range  now silver go go fast as the noble stallion was speeding he answered to the call he was in the open now free of stones and brush with the spang of rifles in the air the wind rushed into hares ears filling them with a hollow roar the ground blurred by in reddish sheets the horsemen cut down the half mile to a quarter lessened that swept closer and closer till hare recognized chance and culver and snap naab on his creamcolored pinto seeing that they could not head the invincible stallion they sheered more to the right but silvermane thundered on crossing the line ahead of them a full three hundred yards and went over the divide drawing them in behind him  then at the sharp crack of the rifles leaden messengers whizzed high in the air over horse and riders and skipped along the red shale in front of the running dog  ohsilvermane cried hare it was just a call as if the horse were human and knew what that pace meant to his master the stern business of the race had ceased to rest on hare silvermane was out to the front he was like a levelrushing thunderbolt hare felt the instantaneous pause between his long low leaps the gather of mighty muscles the strain the tension then the quivering expulsion of force it was a perilous ride down that red slope not so much from the hissing bullets as from the washes and gullies which silvermane sailed over in magnificent leaps hare thrilled with savage delight in the wonderful prowess of his desert king in the primal instinct of joy at escaping with the woman he loved  outrun he cried with blazing eyes mescals white face was pressed close to his shoulder silver has beaten them theyll hang on till we reach the sandstrip hoping the slowdown will let them come up in time but theyll be far too late  the rustlers continued on the trail firing desultorily till silvermane so far distanced them that even the necessary lapse into a walk in the red sand placed him beyond range when they arrived at the strip  theyve turned back mescal were safe why you look as you did the day the bear ran for you  id rather a bear got me than snap jack did you see him  see him rather ill bet he nearly killed his pinto mescal what do you think of silvermane now can he run can he outrun bolly  yesyes oh jack how ill love him look back again are we safe will we ever be safe  it was still daylight when they rounded the portal of the oasis and entered the lane with the familiar wall on one side the peeled fencepickets on the other wolf dashed on ahead and presently a chorus of barks announced that he had been met by the other dogs silvermane neighed shrilly and the horses and mustangs in the corrals trooped noisily to the lower sides and hung inquisitive heads over the top bars  a navajo whom hare remembered stared with axe idle by the woodpile then judith naab dropped a bundle of sticks and with a cry of gladness ran from the house before silvermane had come to a full stop mescal was off she put her arms around his neck and kissed him then she left judith to dart to the corral where a little black mustang had begun to whistle and stamp and try to climb over the bars  august naab bareheaded with shaggy locks shaking at every step strode off the porch and his great hands lifted hare from the saddle  every day ive watched the river for you he said his eyes were warm and his grasp like a vise  mescalchild he continued as she came running to him safe and well hes brought you back thank the lord he took her to his breast and bent his gray head over her  then the crowd of big and little naabs burst from the house and came under the cottonwoods to offer noisy welcome to mescal and hare  jack you look done up said dave naab solicitously when the first greetings had been spoken and mother ruth had led mescal indoors silvermane toohes wet and winded hes been running  yes a little replied hare as he removed the saddle from the weary horse  ah whats this questioned august naab with his hand on silvermanes flank he touched a raw groove and the stallion flinched hare a bullet made that  yes  then you didnt ride in by the navajo crossing  no i came by silver cup  silver cup how on earth did you get down there  we climbed out of the canyon up over coconina and so made the spring  naab whistled in surprise and he flashed another keen glance over hare and his horse your story can wait i know about what it isafter you reached silver cup come in come in dave will look out for the stallion  but hare would allow no one else to attend to silvermane he rubbed the tired gray gave him a drink at the trough led him to the corral and took leave of him with a caress like mescals then he went to his room and bathed himself and changed his clothes afterward presenting himself at the suppertable to eat like one famished mescal and he ate alone as they had been too late for the regular hour the womenfolk waited upon them as if they could not do enough there were pleasant words and smiles but in spite of them something sombre attended the meal there was a shadow in each face each step was slow each voice subdued naab and his sons were waiting for hare when he entered the sitting room and after his entrance the door was closed they were all quiet and stern especially the father tell us all said naab simply  while hare was telling his adventures not a word or a move interrupted him till he spoke of silvermanes running dene down  thats the second time rolled out naab the stallion will kill him yet  hare finished his story  what dont you owe to that whirlwind of a horse exclaimed dave naab no other comment on hare or silvermane was offered by the naabs  you knew holderness had taken in silver cup inquired hare  august naab nodded gloomily  i guess we knew it replied dave for him while i was in white sage and the boys were here at home holderness rode to the spring and took possession i called to see him on my way back but he wasnt around snap was there the boss of a bunch of riders dene too was there  did you go right into camp asked hare  sure i was looking for holderness there were eighteen or twenty riders in the bunch i talked to several of them mormons good fellows they used to be also i had some words with dene he said i shore was sorry snap got to my spy first i wanted him bad an im shore goin to have his white horse snap and dene all of them thought you were number thirtyone in dads cemetery  not yet said hare dene certainly looked as if he saw a ghost when silvermane jumped for him well hes at silver cup now theyre all there whats to be done about it theyre openly thieves the new brand on all your stock proves that  such a trick we never heard of replied august naab if we had we might have spared ourselves the labor of branding the stock  but that new brand of holdernesss upon yours proves his guilt  its not now a question of proof its one of possession holderness has stolen my water and my stock  they are worse than rustlers firing on mescal and me proves that  why didnt you unlimber the long rifle interposed dave curiously  i got it full of water and sand that reminds me i must see about cleaning it i never thought of shooting back silvermane was running too fast  jack you can see i am in the worst fix of my life said august naab my sons have persuaded me that i was pushed off my ranges too easily ive come to believe martin cole certainly his prophecy has come true dave brought news from white sage and its almost unbelievable holderness has proclaimed himself or has actually got himself elected sheriff he holds office over the mormons from whom he steals scarcely a day goes by in the village without a killing the mormons north of lund finally banded together hanged some rustlers and drove the others out many of them have come down into our country and holderness now has a strong force but the mormons will rise against him i know it i see it i am waiting for it we are godfearing lifeloving men slow to wrath but  the deep rolling burr in his voice showed emotion too deep for words  they need a leader replied hare sharply  august naab rose with haggard face and his eyes had the look of a man accused  dad figures this way put in dave on the one hand we lose our water and stock without bloodshed we have a living in the oasis theres little here to attract rustlers so we may live in peace if we give up our rights on the other hand suppose dad gets the navajos down here and we join them and go after holderness and his gang theres going to be an allfired bloody fight of course wed wipe out the rustlers but some of us would get killedand there are the wives and kids see  the force of august naabs argument for peace entirely aside from his christian repugnance to the shedding of blood was plainly unassailable  remember what snap said asked hare suddenly one man to kill dene therefore one man to kill holderness that would break the power of this band  ah youve said it replied dave raising a tense arm its a oneman job dn snap he could have done it if he hadnt gone to the bad but it wont be easy i tried to get holderness he was wise and his men politely said they had enjoyed my call but i wasnt to come again  one man to kill holderness repeated hare  august naab cast at the speaker one of his farseeing glances then he shook himself as if to throw off the grip of something hard and inevitable im still master here he said and his voice showed the conquest of his passions  i give up silver cup and my stock maybe that will content holderness  some days went by pleasantly for hare as he rested from his long exertions naabs former cheer and that of his family reasserted itself once the decision was made and the daily life went on as usual the sons worked in the fields by day and in the evening played at pitching horseshoes on the bare circle where the children romped the women went on baking sewing and singing august naabs prayers were more fervent than ever and he even prayed for the soul of the man who had robbed him mescals cheeks soon rounded out to their old contour and her eyes shone with a happier light than hare had ever seen there the races between silvermane and black bolly were renewed on the long stretch under the wall and mescal forgot that she had once acknowledged the superiority of the gray the cottonwoods showered silken floss till the cabins and grass were white the birds returned to the oasis the sun kissed warm color into the cherries and the distant noise of the river seemed like the humming of a swarm of bees  here jack said august naab one morning get a spade and come with me theres a break somewhere in the ditch  hare went with him out along the fence by the alfalfa fields and round the corner of red wall toward the irrigating dam  well jack i suppose youll be asking me for mescal one of these days said naab  yes replied hare  theres a little story to tell you about mescal when the day comes  tell it now  no not yet im glad you found her i never knew her to be so happy not even when she was a child but somehow theres a better feeling between her and my womenfolk the old antagonism is gone well well life is so i pray that things may turn out well for you and her but i feari seem to seehare im a poor man once more i cant do for you what id like still well see well hope  hare was perfectly happy the old mormons hint did not disturb him even the thought of snap naab did not return to trouble his contentment the full present was sufficient for hare and his joy bubbled over bringing smiles to augusts grave face never had a summer afternoon in the oasis been so fair the green fields the red walls the blue sky all seemed drenched in deeper richer hues the windsong in the crags the rivermurmur from the canyon filled hares ears with music to be alive to feel the sun to see the colors to hear the sounds was beautiful and to know that mescal awaited him was enough  work on the washedout bank of the ditch had not gone far when naab raised his head as if listening  did you hear anything he asked  no replied hare  the roar of the river is heavy here maybe i was mistaken i thought i heard shots then he went on spading clay into the break but he stopped every moment or so uneasily as if he could not get rid of some disturbing thought suddenly he dropped the spade and his eyes flashed  judith judith here he called wheeling with a sudden premonition of evil hare saw the girl running along the wall toward them her face was white as death she wrung her hands and her cries rose above the sound of the river naab sprang toward her and hare ran at his heels  father father she panted comequickthe rustlersthe rustlers snapdeneohhurry theyve killed davetheyve got mescal  death itself shuddered through hares veins and then a raging flood of fire he bounded forward to be flung back by naabs arm  fool would you throw away your life go slowly well slip through the fields under the trees  sick and cold hare hurried by naabs side round the wall and into the alfalfa there were moments when he was weak and trembling others when he could have leaped like a tiger to rend and kill  they left the fields and went on more cautiously into the grove the screaming and wailing of women added certainty to their doubt and dread  i see only the womenthe childrennotheres a manzeke said hare bending low to gaze under the branches  go slow muttered naab  the rustlers rode offafter mescalshes gone panted judith  hare spurred by the possibilities in the halfcrazed girls speech cast caution to the winds and dashed forward into the glade naabs heavy steps thudded behind him  in the corner of the porch scared and stupefied children huddled in a heap george and billy bent over dave who sat whitefaced against the steps blood oozed through the fingers pressed to his breast zeke was trying to calm the women  my god dave cried hare youre not hard hit dont say it  hard hitjackold fellow replied dave with a pale smile his face was white and clammy  august naab looked once at him and groaned my son my son  dadi got chance and culverthere they lie in the roadnot bungled either  hare saw the inert forms of two men lying near the gate one rested on his face arm outstretched with a colt gripped in the stiff hand the other lay on his back his spurs deep in the ground as if driven there in his last convulsion  august naab and zeke carried the injured man into the house the women and children followed and hare with billy and george entered last  dadim shot clean throughlow down said dave as they laid him on a couch its just as well ias any onesomebody had tostart this fight  naab got the children and the girls out of the room the women were silent now except daves wife who clung to him with low moans he smiled upon all with a quick intent smile then he held out a hand to hare  jack we gotto begood friends dont forgetthatwhen you meetholderness he shot mefrom behind chance and culverand after i felli killed them bothtrying to get him youwont hang upyour gunagainwill you  hare wrung the cold hand clasping his so feebly no dave no then he fled from the room for an hour he stood on the porch waiting in dumb misery george and zeke came noiselessly out followed by their father  its all over hare another tragedy had passed by this man of the desert and left his strength unshaken but his deadly quiet and the gloom of his iron face were more terrible to see than any grief  father and you hare come out into the road said george  another motionless form lay beyond chance and culver it was that of a slight man flat on his back his arms wide his long black hair in the dust under the white level brow the face had been crushed into a bloody curve  dene burst from hare in a whisper  killed by a horse exclaimed august naab ah what horse  silvermane replied george  who rode my horsetell mequick cried hare in a frenzy  it was mescal listen let me tell you how it all happened i was out at the forge when i heard a bunch of horses coming up the lane i wasnt packing my gun but i ran anyway when i got to the house there was dave facing snap dene and a bunch of rustlers i saw chance at first but not holderness there must have been twenty men  i came after mescal thats what snap was saying  you cant have her dave answered  well shore take her an we want silvermane too said dene  so youre a horsethief as well as a rustler asked dave  naab i aint in any mind to fool snap wants the girl an i want silvermane an that damned spy that come back to life  then holderness spoke from the back of the crowd naab youd better hurry if you dont want the house burned  dave drew and holderness fired from behind the men dave fell raised up and shot chance and culver then dropped his gun  with that the women in the house began to scream and mescal ran out saying shed go with snap if theyd do no more harm  all right said snap get a horse hurryhurry  then dene dismounted and went toward the corral saying i shore want silvermane  mescal reached the gate ahead of dene let me get silvermane hes wild he doesnt know you hell kick you if you go near him she dropped the bars and went up to the horse he was rearing and snorting she coaxed him down and then stepped up on the fence to untie him when she had him loose she leaped off the fence to his back screaming as she hit him with the halter silvermane snorted and jumped and in three jumps he was going like a bullet dene tried to stop him and was knocked twenty feet he was raising up when the stallion ran over him he never moved again once in the lane silvermane got goinglord how he did run mescal hung low over his neck like an indian he was gone in a cloud of dust before snap and the rustlers knew what had happened snap came to first and yelling and waving his gun spurred down the lane the rest of the rustlers galloped after him  august naab placed a sympathetic hand on hares shaking shoulder  you see lad things are never so bad as they seem at first snap might as well try to catch a bird as silvermane     xviii the heritage of the desert   mescals far out in front by this time depend on it hare went on naab that trick was the cunning indian of her shell ride silvermane into white sage tomorrow night then shell hide from snap the bishop will take care of her shell be safe for the present in white sage now we must bury these men tomorrowmy son then  what then hare straightened up  unutterable pain darkened the flame in the mormons gaze for an instant his face worked spasmodically only to stiffen into a stony mask it was the old conflict once more the neverending war between flesh and spirit and now the flesh had prevailed  the time has come said george naab  yes replied his father harshly  a great calm settled over hare his blood ceased to race his mind to riot in august naabs momentous word he knew the old man had found himself at last he had learned the lesson of the desertto strike first and hard  zeke hitch up a team said august naab nowait a moment here comes piute lets hear what he has to say  piute appeared on the zigzag clifftrail driving a burro at dangerous speed  hes sighted silvermane and the rustlers suggested george as the shepherd approached  naab translated the excited indians mingling of navajo and piute languages to mean just what george had said snap ahead of riderssilvermane far far ahead of snaprunning fastdamn  mescals pushing him hard to make the sandstrip said george  piutethree fires tonightlookout point this order meant the execution of august naabs hurrysignal for the navajos and after he had given it he waved the indian toward the cliff and lapsed into a silence which no one dared to break  naab consigned the bodies of the rustlers to the famous cemetery under the red wall he laid dene in grave thirtyone it was the grave that the outlaw had promised as the last restingplace of denes spy chance and culver he buried together it was noteworthy that no mormon rites were conferred on culver once a mormon in good standing nor were any prayers spoken over the open graves  what did august naab intend to do that was the question in hares mind as he left the house it was a silent day warm as summer though the sun was overcast with gray clouds the birds were quiet in the trees there was no bray of burro or clarioncall of peacock even the hum of the river had fallen into silence hare wandered over the farm and down the red lane brooding over the issue naabs few words had been full of meaning the cold gloom so foreign to his nature had been even more impressive his had been the revolt of the meek the gentle the loving the administering the spiritual uses of his life had failed  hare recalled what the desert had done to his own nature how it had bred in him its impulse to fight to resist to survive if he a stranger of a few years could be moulded in the flaming furnace of its fiery life what then must be the cast of august naab born on the desert and sleeping five nights out of seven on the sands for sixty years  the desert hare trembled as he grasped all its meaning then he slowly resolved that meaning there were the measureless distances to narrow the eye and teach restraint the untrodden trails the shifting sands the thorny brakes the broken lava to pierce the flesh the heights and depths unscalable and unplumbed and over all the sun red and burning  the parched plants of the desert fought for life growing far apart sending enormous roots deep to pierce the sand and split the rock for moisture arming every leaf with a barbed thorn or poisoned sap never thriving and ever thirsting  the creatures of the desert endured the sun and lived without water and were at endless war the hawk had a keener eye than his fellow of more fruitful lands sharper beak greater spread of wings and claws of deeper curve for him there was little to eat a rabbit now a rockrat then nature made his swoop like lightning and it never missed its aim the gaunt wolf never failed in his sure scent in his silent hunt the lizard flicked an invisible tongue into the heart of a flower and the bee he caught stung with a poisoned sting the battle of life went to the strong  so the desert trained each of its wild things to survive no eye of the desert but burned with the flame of the sun to kill or to escape deaththat was the dominant motive to fight barrenness and heatthat was stern enough but each creature must fight his fellow  what then of the men who drifted into the desert and survived they must of necessity endure the wind and heat the drouth and famine they must grow lean and hard keeneyed and silent the weak the humble the sacrificing must be winnowed from among them as each man developed he took on some aspect of the desertholderness had the amber clearness of its distances in his eyes its deceit in his soul august naab the magnificence of the desertpine in his giant form its strength in his heart snap naab the cast of the hawkbeak in his face its cruelty in his nature but all shared alike in the common element of survivalferocity august naab had subdued his to the promptings of a christlike spirit yet did not his very energy his wonderful tirelessness his will to achieve his power to resist partake of that fierceness moreover after many struggles he too had been overcome by the deserts call for blood his mystery was no longer a mystery always in those moments of revelation which he disclaimed he had seen himself as faithful to the desert in the end  hares slumbers that night were broken he dreamed of a great gray horse leaping in the sky from cloud to cloud with the lightning and the thunder under his hoofs the stormwinds sweeping from his silver mane he dreamed of mescals brooding eyes they were dark gateways of the desert open only to him and he entered to chase the alluring stars deep into the purple distance he dreamed of himself waiting in serene confidence for some unknown thing to pass he awakened late in the morning and found the house hushed the day wore on in a repose unstirred by breeze and sound in accord with the mourning of august naab at noon a solemn procession wended its slow course to the shadow of the red cliff and as solemnly returned  then a longdrawn piercing indian whoop broke the midday hush it heralded the approach of the navajos in singlefile they rode up the lane and when the falconeyed eschtah dismounted before his white friend the line of his warriors still turned the corner of the red wall next to the chieftain rode scarbreast the grim warlord of the navajos his followers trailed into the grove their sinewy bronze bodies almost naked glistened wet from the river full a hundred strong were they a silent leanlimbed desert troop  the white prophets fires burned bright said the chieftain eschtah is here  the navajo is a friend replied naab the white man needs counsel and help he has fallen upon evil days  eschtah sees war in the eyes of his friend  war chief war let the navajo and his warriors rest and eat then we shall speak  a single command from the navajo broke the waiting files of warriors mustangs were turned into the fields packs were unstrapped from the burros blankets spread under the cottonwoods when the afternoon waned and the shade from the western wall crept into the oasis august naab came from his cabin clad in buckskins with a large blue colt swinging handle outward from his left hip he ordered his sons to replenish the fire which had been built in the circle and when the fierceeyed indians gathered round the blaze he called to his women to bring meat and drink  hares unnatural calmness had prevailed until he saw naab stride out to front the waiting indians then a ripple of cold passed over him he leaned against a tree in the shadow and watched the grayfaced giant stalking to and fro before his indian friends a long while he strode in the circle of light to pause at length before the chieftains and to break the impressive silence with his deep voice  eschtah sees before him a friend stung to his heart men of his own color have long injured him yet have lived the mormon loved his fellows and forgave five sons he laid in their graves yet his heart was not hardened his firstborn went the trail of the firewater and is an outcast from his people many enemies has he and one is a chief he has killed the white mans friends stolen his cattle and his water today the white man laid another son in his grave what thinks the chief would he not crush the scorpion that stung him  the old navajo answered in speech which when translated was as stately as the mormons  eschtah respects his friend but he has not thought him wise the white prophet sees visions of things to come but his blood is cold he asks too much of the white mans god he is a chief he has an eye like the lightning an arm strong as the pine yet he has not struck eschtah grieves he does not wish to shed blood for pleasure but eschtahs friend has let too many selfish men cross his range and drink at his springs only a few can live on the desert let him who has found the springs and the trails keep them for his own let him who came too late go away to find for himself to prove himself a warrior or let his bones whiten in the sand the navajo counsels his white friend to kill  the great eschtah speaks wise words said naab the white prophet is richer for them he will lay aside the prayers to his unseeing god and will seek his foe  it is well  the white mans foe is strong went on the mormon he has many men they will fight if eschtah sends his braves with his friend there will be war many braves will fall the white prophet wishes to save them if he can he will go forth alone to kill his foe if the sun sets four times and the white man is not here then eschtah will send his great warchief and his warriors they will kill whom they find at the white mans springs and thereafter half of all the white mans cattle that were stolen shall be eschtahs so that he watch over the water and range  eschtah greets a chief answered the indian the white prophet knows he will kill his enemy but he is not sure he will return he is not sure that the little braves of his foe will fly like the winds yet he hopes so he holds the navajo back to the last eschtah will watch the sun set four times if his white friend returns he will rejoice if he does not return the navajo will send his warriors on the trail  august naab walked swiftly from the circle of light into the darkness his heavy steps sounded on the porch and in the hallway his three sons went toward their cabins with bowed heads and silent tongues eschtah folded his blanket about him and stalked off into the gloom of the grove followed by his warriors  hare remained in the shadow of the cottonwood where he had stood unnoticed he had not moved a muscle since he had heard august naabs declaration that one word of naabs intention alone had arrested him for it had struck into his heart and mind it had paralyzed him with the revelation it brought for hare now knew as he had never known anything before that he would forestall august naab avenge the death of dave and kill the rustler holderness through blinding shock he passed slowly into cold acceptance of his heritage from the desert  the two long years of his desert training were as an open page to hares unveiled eyes the life he owed to august naab the strength built up by the old mans knowledge of the healing power of plateau and rangethese lay in a long curve between the day naab had lifted him out of the white sage trail and this day of the mormons extremity a long curve with holdernesss insulting blow at the beginning his murder of a beloved friend at the end for hare remembered the blow and never would he forget daves last words yet unforgetable as these were it was duty rather than revenge that called him this was august naabs hour of need hare knew himself to be the tool of inscrutable fate he was the one to fight the old desertscarred mormons battle hare recalled how humbly he had expressed his gratitude to naab and the apparent impossibility of ever repaying him and then naabs reply lad you can never tell how one man may repay another hare could pay his own debt and that of the many wanderers who had drifted across the sands to find a home with the mormon these men stirred in their graves and from out the shadow of the cliff whispered the voice of mescals nameless father is there no one to rise up for this old hero of the desert  softly hare slipped into his room putting on coat and belt and catching up his rifle he stole out again stealthily like an indian in the darkness of the wagonshed he felt for his saddle and finding it he groped with eager hands for the grainbox raising the lid he filled a measure with grain and emptied it into his saddlebag then lifting the saddle he carried it out of the yard through the gate and across the lane to the corrals the wilder mustangs in the far corral began to kick and snort and those in the corral where black bolly was kept trooped noisily to the bars bolly whinnied and thrust her black muzzle over the fence hare placed a caressing hand on her while he waited listening and watching it was not unusual for the mustangs to get restless at any time and hare was confident that this would pass without investigation  gradually the restless stampings and suspicious snortings ceased and hare letting down the bars led bolly out into the lane it was the work of a moment to saddle her his bridle hung where he always kept it on the pommel and with nimble fingers he shortened the several straps to fit bollys head and slipped the bit between her teeth then he put up the bars of the gate  before mounting he stood a moment thinking coolly deliberately numbering the several necessities he must not forgetgrain for bolly food for himself his colt and winchester cartridges canteen matches knife he inserted a hand into one of his saddlebags expecting to find some strips of meat the bag was empty he felt in the other one and under the grain he found what he sought the canteen lay in the coil of his lasso tied to the saddle and its heavy canvas covering was damp to his touch with that he thrust the long winchester into its saddlesheath and swung his leg over the mustang  the house of the naabs was dark and still the dying councilfire cast flickering shadows under the black cottonwoods where the navajos slept the faint breeze that rustled the leaves brought the low sullen roar of the river  hare guided bolly into the thick dust of the lane laid the bridle loosely on her neck for her to choose the trail and silently rode out into the lonely desert night     xix unleashed   hare listening breathlessly rode on toward the gateway of the cliffs and when he had passed the corner of the wall he sighed in relief spurring bolly into a trot he rode forward with a strange elation he had slipped out of the oasis unheard and it would be morning before august naab discovered his absence perhaps longer before he divined his purpose then hare would have a long start he thrilled with something akin to fear when he pictured the old mans rage and wondered what change it would make in his plans hare saw in mind naab and his sons and the navajos sweeping in pursuit to save him from the rustlers  but the future must take care of itself and he addressed all the faculties at his command to cool consideration of the present the strip of sand under the blue star had to be crossed at nighta feat which even the navajos did not have to their credit yet hare had no shrinking he had no doubt he must go on as he had been drawn to the painted desert by a voiceless call so now he was urged forward by something nameless  in the blackness of the night it seemed as if he were riding through a vaulted hall swept by a current of air the night had turned cold the stars had brightened icily the rumble of the river had died away when bollys ringing trot suddenly changed to a noiseless floundering walk she had come upon the sand hare saw the blue star in the cliff and once more loosed the rein on bollys neck she stopped and champed her bit and turned her black head to him as if to intimate that she wanted the guidance of a sure arm but as it was not forthcoming she stepped onward into the yielding sand  with hands resting idly on the pommel hare sat at ease in the saddle the billowy dunes reflected the pale starlight and fell away from him to darken in obscurity so long as the blue star remained in sight he kept his sense of direction when it had disappeared he felt himself lost bollys course seemed as crooked as the jagged outline of the cliffs she climbed straight up little knolls descended them at an angle turned sharply at windwashed gullies made winding detours zigzagged levels that shone like a polished floor and at last so it seemed to hare she doubled back on her trail the black cliff receded over the waves of sand the stars changed positions travelled round in the blue dome and the few that he knew finally sank below the horizon bolly never lagged she was like the homewardbound horse indifferent to direction because sure of it eager to finish the journey because now it was short hare was glad though not surprised when she snorted and cracked her ironshod hoof on a stone at the edge of the sand he smiled with tightening lips as he rode into the shadow of a rock which he recognized bolly had crossed the treacherous belt of dunes and washes and had struck the trail on the other side  the long level of windcarved rocks under the cliffs the ridges of the desert the miles of slow ascent up to the rough divide the gradual descent to the cedarsthese stretches of his journey took the night hours and ended with the brightening gray in the east within a mile of silver cup spring hare dismounted to tie folded pads of buckskin on bollys hoofs when her feet were muffled he cautiously advanced on the trail for the matter of a hundred rods or more then sheered off to the right into the cedars he led bolly slowly without rattling a stone or snapping a twig and stopped every few paces to listen there was no sound other than the wind in the cedars presently with a gasp he caught the dull gleam of a burnedout campfire then his movements became as guarded as noiseless as those of a scouting indian the dawn broke over the red wall as he gained the trail beyond the spring  he skirted the curve of the valley and led bolly a little way up the wooded slope to a dense thicket of aspens in a hollow this thicket encircled a patch of grass hare pressed the lithe aspens aside to admit bolly and left her there free he drew his rifle from its sheath and after assuring himself that the mustang could not be seen or heard from below he bent his steps diagonally up the slope  every foot of this ground he knew and he climbed swiftly until he struck the mountain trail then descending he entered the cedars at last he reached a point directly above the cliffcamp where he had spent so many days and this he knew overhung the cabin built by holderness he stole down from tree to tree and slipped from thicket to thicket the sun red as blood raised a bright crescent over the red wall the soft mists of the valley began to glow and move cattle were working in toward the spring never brushing a branch never dislodging a stone hare descended the slope his eyes keener his ears sharper with every step soon the edge of the gray stone cliff below shut out the lower level of cedars while resting he listened then he marked his course down the last bit of slanting ground to the cliff bench which faced the valley this space was open rough with crumbling rock and dead cedar brusha difficult place to cross without sound deliberate in his choice of steps very slow in moving hare went on with a stealth which satisfied even his intent ear when the wide gray strip of stone drew slowly into the circle of his downcast gaze he sank to the ground with a slight trembling in all his limbs there was a thick bush on the edge of the cliff in three steps he could reach it and unseen himself look down upon the camp  a little cloud or smoke rose lazily and capped a slender column of blue sounds were wafted softly upward the low voices of men in conversation a merry whistle and then the humming of a tune hares mouth was dry and his temples throbbed as he asked himself what it was best to do the answer came instantaneously as though it had lain just below the level of his conscious thought ill watch till holderness walks out into sight jump up with a yell when he comes give him time to see me to draw his gunthen kill him  hare slipped to the bush drew in a deep long breath that stilled his agitation and peered over the cliff the crude shingles of the cabin first rose into sight then beyond he saw the corral with a number of shaggy mustangs and a great gray horse hare stared blankly as in a dream he saw the proud arch of a splendid neck the graceful wave of a whitecrested mane  silvermane my god he gasped suddenly they caught himafter all  he fell backward upon the cliff and lay there with hands clinching his rifle shudderingly conscious of a blow trying to comprehend its meaning  silvermane they caught himafter all he kept repeating then in a flash of agonized understanding he whispered mescal mescal  he rolled upon his face shutting out the blue sky his body stretched stiff as a bent spring released from its compress and his nails dented the stock of his rifle then this rigidity softened to sobs that shook him from head to foot he sat up haggard and wildeyed  silvermane had been captured probably by rustlers waiting at the western edge of the sandstrip mescal had fallen into the hands of snap naab but mescal was surely alive and snap was there to be killed his long career of unrestrained cruelty was in its last daysomething told hare that this thing must and should be the stern deliberation of his intent to kill holderness the passion of his purpose to pay his debt to august naab were as nothing compared to the gathering might of this new resolve suddenly he felt free and strong as an untamed lion broken free from his captors  from the cover of the bush he peered again over the cliff the cabin with its closed door facing him was scarcely two hundred feet down from his hidingplace one of the rustlers sang as he bent over the campfire and raked the coals around the pots others lounged on a bench waiting for breakfast some rolled out of their blankets they stretched and yawned and pulling on their boots made for the spring the last man to rise was snap naab and he had slept with his head on the threshold of the door evidently snap had made mescal a prisoner in the cabin and no one could go in or out without stepping upon him the rustlerforeman of holdernesss company had slept with his belt containing two colts nor had he removed his boots hare noted these details with grim humor now the tall holderness face shining goldred beard agleam rounded the cabin whistling hare watched the rustlers sit down to breakfast and here and there caught a loudspoken word and marked their leisurely carefree manner snap naab took up a pan of food and a cup of coffee carried them into the cabin and came out shutting the door  after breakfast most of the rustlers set themselves to their various tasks hare watched them with the eyes of a lynx watching deer several men were arranging articles for packing and their actions were slow to the point of laziness others trooped down toward the corral holderness rolled a cigarette and stooped over the campfire to reach a burning stick snap naab stalked to and fro before the door of the cabin he alone of the rustlers band showed restlessness and more than once he glanced up the trail that led over the divide toward his fathers oasis holderness sent expectant glances in the other direction toward seeping springs once his clear voice rang out  i tell you naab theres no hurry well ride in tomorrow  a thousand thoughts flitted through hares minda steady stream of questions and answers why did snap look anxiously along the oasis trail it was not that he feared his father or his brothers alone but there was always the menace of the navajos why was holderness in no hurry to leave silver cup why did he lag at the spring when if he expected riders from his ranch he could have gone on to meet them obviously saving time and putting greater distance between him and the men he had wronged was it utter fearlessness or only a deepplayed game holderness and his rustlers all except the gloomy naab were blind to the peril that lay beyond the divide how soon would august naab strike out on the white sage trail would he come alone whether he came alone or at the head of his hardriding navajos he would arrive too late holdernesss life was not worth a pinch of the ashes he flecked so carelessly from his cigarette snap naabs gloom his long stride his nervous hand always on or near the butt of his colt spoke the keenness of his desert instinct for him the sun had arisen red over the red wall had he harmed mescal why did he keep the cabin door shut and guard it so closely  while hare watched and thought the hours sped by holderness lounged about and snap kept silent guard the rustlers smoked slept and moved about the day waned and the shadow of the cliff crept over the cabin to hare the time had been as a moment he was amazed to find the sun had gone down behind coconina if august naab had left the oasis at dawn he must now be near the divide unless he had been delayed by a windstorm at the strip of sand hare longed to see the roan charger come up over the crest he longed to see a file of navajos plumes waving dark mustangs gleaming in the red light sweep down the stony ridge toward the cedars if they come he whispered ill kill holderness and snap and any man who tries to open that cabin door  so he waited in tense watchfulness his gaze alternating between the wavy line of the divide and the camp glade out in the valley it was still daylight but under the cliff twilight had fallen all day hare had strained his ears to hear the talk of the rustlers and it now occurred to him that if he climbed down through the split in the cliff to the bench where dave and george had always hidden to watch the spring he would be just above the camp this descent involved risk but since it would enable him to see the cabin door when darkness set in he decided to venture the moment was propitious for the rustlers were bustling around cooking dinner unrolling blankets and moving to and fro from spring and corral hare crawled back a few yards and along the cliff until he reached the split it was a narrow steep crack which he well remembered going down was attended with two dangerslosing his hold and the possible rattling of stones face foremost he slipped downward with the gliding sinuous movement of a snake and reaching the grassy bench he lay quiet jesting voices and loud laughter from below reassured him he had not been heard his new position afforded every chance to see and hear and also gave means of rapid noiseless retreat along the bench to the cedars lying flat he crawled stealthily to the bushy fringe of the bench  a bright fire blazed under the cliff men were moving and laughing the cabin door was open mescal stood leaning back from snap naab struggling to release her hands  let me untie them i say growled snap  mescal tore loose from him and stepped back her hands were bound before her and twisting them outward she warded him off her dishevelled hair almost hid her dark eyes they burned in a level glance of hate and defiance she was a little lioness quivering with fiery life fight in every line of her form  all right dont eat thenstarve said snap  ill starve before i eat what you give me  the rustlers laughed holderness blew out a puff of smoke and smiled snap glowered upon mescal and then upon his amiable companions one of them a ruddyfaced fellow walked toward mescal  cool down snap cool down he said were not goin to stand for a girl starvin she aint eat a bite yet here miss let me untie your handsthere    say naab dn you her wrists are black an blue  look out your gun yelled snap  with a swift movement mescal snatched the mans colt from its holster and was raising it when he grasped her arm she winced and dropped the weapon  you little indian devil exclaimed the rustler in a rapt admiration sorry to hurt you an moren sorry to spoil your aim thet wasnt kind to throw my own gun on me jest after id played the gentleman now was it  i didntintendto shootyou panted mescal  naab if thiss your mormon kind of wifeexcuse me though i aint denyin shes the sassiest an sweetest little cat i ever seen  we mormons dont talk about our women or hear any talk returned snap a dancing fury in his pale eyes youre from nebraska  yep jest a plain nebraska rustler cattlethief an all round nogood customer though i aint taken to houndin women yet  for answer snap naabs right hand slowly curved upward before him and stopped taut and inflexible while his strange eyes seemed to shoot sparks  see here naab why do you want to throw a gun on me asked the rustler coolly havent you shot enough of your friends yet i reckon ive no right to interfere in your affairs i was only protestin friendly like for the little lady shes game an shes called your hand an its not a straight hand thets all an dn if i care whether you are a mormon or not ill bet a hoss holderness will back me up  snap hes right put in holderness smoothly you neednt be so touchy about mescal shes showed what little use shes got for you if you must rope her around like you do a mustang be easy about it lets have supper now mescal you sit here on the bench and behave yourself i dont want you shooting up my camp  snap turned sullenly aside while holderness seated mescal near the door and fetched her food and drink the rustlers squatted round the campfire and conversation ceased in the business of the meal  to hare the scene had brought a storm of emotions joy at the sight of mescal blessed relief to see her unscathed pride in her fighting spiritthese came side by side with gratitude to the kind nebraska rustler strange deepening insight into holdernesss game unextinguishable whitehot hatred of snap naab and binding all was the evermounting will to rescue mescal which was held in check by an inexorable judgment he must continue to wait and he did wait with blind faith in the something to be keeping ever in mind the last resortthe rifle he clutched with eager hands meanwhile the darkness descended the fire sent forth a brighter blaze and the rustlers finished their supper mescal arose and stepped across the threshold of the cabin door  hold on ordered snap as he approached with swift strides stick out your hands  some of the rustlers grumbled and one blurted out aw no snap dont tie her upno  who says no hissed the mormon with snapping teeth as he wheeled upon them his colt seemed to leap forward and suddenly quivered at armslength gleaming in the ruddy firerays  holderness laughed in the muzzle of the weapon go ahead snap tie up your lady love what a tame little wife shes going to make you tie her up but do it without hurting her  the rustlers growled or laughed at their leaders order snap turned to his task mescal stood in the doorway and shrinkingly extended her clasped hands holderness whirled to the fire with a look which betrayed his game snap bound mescals hands securely thrust her inside the cabin and after hesitating for a long moment finally shut the door  its funny about a woman now aint it said nebraska confidentially to a companion one minnit shell snatch you baldheaded the next shell melt in your mouth like sugar an ill be darned if the changeablest one aint the kind to hold a feller longest but its hl i was married onct not any more for mine a pal i had used to say thet whiskey riled him thet rattlesnake pisen het up his blood some but it took a woman to make him plumb bad dn if it aint so when theres a woman around theres somethin allus comin off  but the strain instead of relaxing became portentous holderness suddenly showed he was ill at ease he appeared to be expecting arrivals from the direction of seeping springs snap naab leaned against the side of the door his narrow gaze cunningly studying the rustlers before him more than any other he had caught a foreshadowing like the deserthawk he could see afar suddenly he pressed back against the door half opening it while he faced the men  stop commanded holderness the change in his voice was as if it had come from another man you dont go in there  im going to take the girl and ride to white sage replied naab in slow deliberation  bah you say that only for the excuse to get into the cabin with her you tried it last night and i blocked you shut the door naab or somethingll happen  theres more going to happen than ever you think of holderness dont interfere now im going  well go aheadbut you wont take the girl  snap naab swung off the step slamming the door behind him  soho he exclaimed sneeringly thats why youve made me foreman eh his clawlike hand moved almost imperceptibly upward while his pale eyes strove to pierce the strength behind holdernesss effrontery the rustler chief had a trump card to play one that showed in his sardonic smile  naab you dont get the girl  maybe youll get her hissed snap  i always intended to  surely never before had passion driven snaps hand to such speed his colt gleamed in the campfire light click click click the hammer fell upon empty chambers  hl he shrieked  holderness laughed sarcastically  thats where youre going he cried heres to naabs trick with a gunbah and he shot his foreman through the heart  snap plunged upon his face his hands beat the ground like the shuffling wings of a wounded partridge his fingers gripped the dust spread convulsively straightened and sank limp  holderness called through the door of the cabin mescal ive rid you of your wouldbe husband cheerup then pointing to the fallen man he said to the nearest bystanders some of you drag that out for the coyotes  the first fellow who bent over snap happened to be the nebraska rustler and he curiously opened the breech of the sixshooter he picked up no shells he said he pulled snaps second colt from his belt and unbreeched that no shells well dn me he surveyed the group of grim men not one of whom had any reply  holderness again laughed harshly and turning to the cabin he fastened the door with a lasso  it was a long time before hare recovered from the starting revelation of the plot which had put mescal into holdernesss power bad as snap naab had been he would have married her and such a fate was infinitely preferable to the one that now menaced her hare changed his position and settled himself to watch and wait out the night every hour holderness and his men tarried at silver cup hastened their approaching doom hares strange prescience of the fatality that overshadowed these men had received its first verification in the sudden taking off of snap naab the deepscheming holderness confident that his strong band meant sure protection sat and smoked and smiled beside the campfire he had not caught even a hint of snap naabs suggested warning yet somewhere out on the oasis trail rode a man who once turned from the saving of life to the lust to kill would be as immutable as death itself behind him waited a troop of navajos swift as eagles merciless as wolves desert warriors with the sunheated blood of generations in their veins as hare waited and watched with all his inner being cold he could almost feel pity for holderness his doom was close twice when the rustler chief had sauntered nearer to the cabin door as if to enter hare had covered him with the rifle waiting waiting for the step upon the threshold but holderness always checked himself in time and hares finger eased its pressure upon the trigger  the night closed in black the clouded sky gave forth no starlight the wind rose and moaned through the cedars one by one the rustlers rolled in their blankets and all dropped into slumber while the campfire slowly burned down the night hours wore on to the soft wail of the breeze and the wild notes of faroff trailing coyotes  hare watching sleeplessly saw one of the prone figures stir the man raised himself very cautiously he glanced at his companions and looked long at holderness who lay squarely in the dimming light then he softly lowered himself hare wondered what the rustler meant to do presently he again lifted his head and turned it as if listening intently his companions were motionless in deepbreathing sleep gently he slipped aside his blankets and began to rise he was slow and guarded of movement it took him long to stand erect he stepped between the rustlers with stockinged feet which were as noiseless as an indians and he went toward the cabin door  he softly edged round the sleeping holderness showing a glinting sixshooter in his hand hares resolve to kill him before he reached the door was checked what did it mean this rustlers stealthy movements his passing by holderness with his drawn weapon again doom hovered over the rustler chief if he stirredhare knew instantly that this softly stepping man was a mormon he was true to snap naab to the woman pledged in his creed he meant to free mescal  if ever hare breathed a prayer it was then what if one of the band awakened as the rustler turned at the door his dark face gleamed in the flickering light he unwound the lasso and opened the door without a sound  hare whispered heavens if he goes in shell scream that will wake holdernessthen i must shooti must  but the mormon rustler added wisdom to his cunning and stealth  hist he whispered into the cabin hist  mescal must have been awake she must have guessed instantly the meaning of that low whisper for silently she appeared in the doorway silently she held forth her bound hands the man untied the bonds and pointed into the cedars toward the corral swift and soundless as a flitting shadow mescal vanished in the gloom the mormon stole with wary unhurried steps back to his bed and rolled in his blankets  hare rose unsteadily wavering in the hot grip of a moment that seemed to have but one issuethe killing of holderness mescal would soon be upon silvermane far out on the white sage trail and this time there would be no sandstrip to trap her but hare could not kill the rustler while he was sleeping and he could not awaken him without revealing to his men the escape of the girl hare stood there on the bench gazing down on the blanketed holderness why not kill him now ending forever his power and trust to chance for the rest no no hare flung the temptation from him to ward off pursuit as long as possible to aid mescal in every way to some safe hidingplace and then to seek holdernessthat was the forethought of a man who had learned to wait  under the dark projection of the upper cliff hare felt his way to the cedar slope and the trail and then he went swiftly down into the little hollow where he had left bolly the darkness of the forest hindered him but he came at length to the edge of the aspen thicket he penetrated it and guided toward bolly by a suspicious stamp and neigh he found her and quieted her with a word he rode down the hollow out upon the level valley  the clouds had broken somewhat letting pale light down through rifts all about him cattle were lying in a thick gloom it was penetrable for only a few rods the ground was like a cushion under bollys hoofs giving forth no sound the mustang threw up her head causing hare to peer into the nightfog rapid hoofbeats broke the silence a vague gray shadow moved into sight he saw silvermane and called as loudly as he dared the stallion melted into the misty curtain the beating of hoofs softened and ceased hare spurred bolly to her fleetest he had a long silent chase but it was futile and unnecessarily hard on the mustang so he pulled her in to a trot  hare kept bolly to this gait the remainder of the night and when the eastern sky lightened he found the trail and reached seeping springs at dawn silvermanes tracks were deep in the clay at the drinkingtrough he rested a few moments gave bolly sparingly of grain and water and once more took to the trail  from the ridge below the spring he saw silvermane beyond the valley miles ahead of him this day seemed shorter than the foregoing one it passed while he watched silvermane grow smaller and smaller and disappear on the looming slope of coconina hares fear that mescal would run into the riders holderness expected from his ranch grew less and less after she had reached the cover of the cedars that she would rest the stallion at the navajo pool on the mountain he made certain late in the night he came to the camping spot and found no trace to prove that she had halted there even to let silvermane drink so he tied the tired mustang and slept until daylight  he crossed the plateau and began the descent before he was halfway down the warm bright sun had cleared the valley of vapor and shadow far along the winding white trail shone a speck it was silvermane almost out of sight  ten milesfifteen more maybe said hare mescal will soon be in the village  again hours of travel flew by like winged moments thoughts of time distance monotony fatigue purpose were shut out from his mind a rushing kaleidoscopic dance of images filled his consciousness but they were all of mescal safety for her had unsealed the fountain of happiness  it was near sundown when he rode black bolly into white sage and took the back road and the pasture lane to bishop caldwells cottage john one of the bishops sons was in the barnyard and ran to open the gate  mescal cried hare  safe replied the mormon  have you hidden her  shes in a secret cave a mormon hidingplace for women only a few men know of its existence rest easy for shes absolutely safe  thank god then thats settled hare drew a long deep breath  mescal told us what happened how she got caught at the sandstrip and escaped from holderness at silver cup was dene hurt  silvermane killed him  good god how things come about i saw you run dene down that time here in white sage it must have been written did holderness shoot snap naab  yes  what of old naab wont he come down here now to lead us mormons against the rustlers  he called the navajos across the river he meant to take the trail alone and kill holderness keeping the indians back a few days if he failed to return then they were to ride out on the rustlers but his plan must be changed for i came ahead of him  for what mescal  no for holderness  youll kill him  yes  hell be coming soonwhen  tomorrow possibly by daylight he wants mescal theres a chance naab may have reached silver cup before holderness left but i doubt it  may i know your plan the mormon hesitated while his strong brown face flashed with daring inspiration iive a good reason  plan yes hide bolly and silvermane in the little arbor down in the orchard ill stay outside tonight sleep a littlefor im dead tiredand watch in the morning holderness will come here with his men perhaps not openly at first to drag mescal away hell mean to use strategy ill meet him when he comesthats all  its well i ask you not to mention this to my father come in now you need food and rest later ill hide bolly and silvermane in the arbor  hare met the bishop and his family with composure but his arrival following so closely upon mescals increased their alarm they seemed repelled yet fascinated by his face hare ate in silence john caldwell did not come in to supper his brothers mysteriously left the table before finishing the meal a subdued murmur of voices floated in at the open window  darkness found hare wrapped in a blanket under the trees he needed sleep that would loose the strange deadlock of his thoughts clear the blur from his eyes ease the pain in his head and weariness of limbsall these weaknesses of which he had suddenly become conscious time and again he had almost wooed slumber to him when soft footsteps on the gravel paths low voices the gentle closing of the gate brought him back to the unreal listening wakefulness the sounds continued late into the night and when he did fall asleep he dreamed of them he awoke to a dawn clearer than the light from the noonday sun in his ears was the ringing of a bell he could not stand still and his movements were subtle and swift his hands took a peculiar tenacious hold of everything he chanced to touch he paced his hidden walk behind the arbor at every turn glancing sharply up and down the road thoughts came to him clearly yet one was dominant the morning was curiously quiet the sons of the bishop had strangely disappeareda sense of imminent catastrophe was in the air  a band of horsemen closely grouped turned into the road and trotted forward some of the men wore black masks holderness rode at the front his redgold beard shining in the sunlight the steady clipcrop of hoofs and clinking of iron stirrups broke the morning quiet holderness with two of his men dismounted before the bishops gate the others of the band trotted on down the road the ring of holdernesss laugh preceded the snap of the gatelatch  hare stood calm and cold behind his green covert watching the three men stroll up the garden path holderness took a cigarette from his lips as he neared the porch and blew out circles of white smoke bishop caldwell tottered from the cottage rapping the porchfloor with his cane  goodmorning bishop greeted holderness blandly baring his head  to you sir quavered the old man with his wavering blue eyes fixed on the spurred and belted rustler holderness stepped out in front of his companions a superb man courteous smiling entirely at his ease  i rode in to  hare leaped from his hidingplace  holderness  the rustler pivoted on whirling heels  denes spy he exclaimed aghast swift changes swept his mobile features fear flickered in his eyes as he faced his foe then came wonder a glint of amusement dark anger and the terrible instinct of death impending  naabs trick hissed hare with his hand held high the suggestion in his words the meaning in his look held the three rustlers transfixed the surprise was his strength  in holdernesss amber eyes shone his desperate calculation of chances hares fateful glance impossible to elude his strung form slightly crouched his cold deliberate mention of naabs trick and more than all the poise of that quivering hand filled the rustler with a terror that he could not hide  he had been bidden to draw and he could not summon the force  naabs trick repeated hare mockingly  suddenly holderness reached for his gun  hares hand leapt like a lightning stroke gleam of bluespurt of redcrash  holderness swayed with blond head swinging backward the amber of his eyes suddenly darkened the life in them glazed like a log he fell clutching the weapon he had half drawn     xx the rage of the old lion   take holderness awayquick ordered hare a thin curl of blue smoke floated from the muzzle of his raised weapon  the rustlers started out of their statuelike immobility and lifting their dead leader dragged him down the garden path with his spurs clinking on the gravel and ploughing little furrows  bishop go in now they may return said hare he hurried up the steps to place his arm round the tottering old man  was that holderness  yes replied hare  the deeds of the wicked return unto them gods will  hare led the bishop indoors the sittingroom was full of wailing women and crying children none of the young men were present again hare made note of their inexplicable absence he spoke soothingly to the frightened family the little boys and girls yielded readily to his persuasion but the women took no heed of him  where are your sons asked hare  i dont know replied the bishop they should be here to stand by you its strange i dont understand last night my sons were visited by many men coming and going in twos and threes till late they didnt sleep in their beds i know not what to think  hare remembered john caldwells enigmatic face  have the rustlers really come asked a young woman whose eyes were red and cheeks tearstained  they have nineteen in all i counted them answered hare  the young woman burst out weeping afresh and the wailing of the others answered her hare left the cottage he picked up his rifle and went down through the orchard to the hidingplace of the horses silvermane pranced and snorted his gladness at sight of his master the desert king was fit for a grueling race black bolly quietly cropped the long grass hare saddled the stallion to have him in instant readiness and then returned to the front of the yard  he heard the sound of a gun down the road then another and several shots following in quick succession a distant angry murmuring and trampling of many feet drew hare to the gate riderless mustangs were galloping down the road several frightened boys were fleeing across the square not a man was in sight three more shots cracked and the low murmur and trampling swelled into a hoarse uproar hare had heard that sound before it was the tumult of mobviolence a black dense throng of men appeared crowding into the main street and crossing toward the square the procession had some order it was led and flanked by mounted men but the upflinging of many arms the craning of necks and the leaping of men on the outskirts of the mass the pressure inward and the hideous roar proclaimed its real character  by heaven exclaimed hare the mormons have risen against the rustlers i understand now john caldwell spent last night in secretly rousing his neighbors they have surprised the rustlers now what  hare vaulted the fence and ran down the road a compact mob of men a hundred or more had halted in the village under the widespreading cottonwoods hare suddenly grasped the terrible significance of those outstretched branches and out of the thought grew another which made him run at bursting breakneck speed  open up let me in he yelled to the thickly thronged circle right and left he flung men make way his piercing voice stilled the angry murmur fierce men with weapons held aloft fell back from his face  denes spy they cried  the circle opened and closed upon him he saw bound rustlers under armed guard four still forms were on the ground holderness lay outstretched a darkred blot staining his gray shirt flintyfaced mormons ruthless now as they had once been mild surrounded the rustlers john caldwell stood foremost with ashen lips breaking bitterly into speech  mormons this is denes spy the man who killed holderness  the listeners burst into the short stern shout of men proclaiming a leader in war  whats the game demanded hare  a fair trial for the rustlers then a rope replied john caldwell the low ominous murmur swelled through the crowd again  there are two men here who have befriended me i wont see them hanged  pick them out a strange ripple of emotion made a fleeting break in john caldwells hard face  hare eyed the prisoners  nebraska step out here said he  i reckon youre mistaken replied the rustler his blue eyes intently on hare i never seen you before an i aint the kind of a feller to cheat the man you mean  i saw you untie the girls hands  you did well dn me  nebraska if i save your life will you quit rustling cattle you werent cut out for a thief  will i dn me ill be straight an decent ill take a job ridin for you stranger an prove it  cut him loose from the others said hare he scrutinized the line of rustlers several were masked in black take off those masks  no those men go to their graves masked again the strange twinge of pain crossed john caldwells face  ah i see exclaimed hare then quickly i couldnt recognize the other man anyhow i dont know him but mescal can tell he saved her and ill save him but how  every rustler except the masked ones standing stern and silent clamored that he was the one to be saved  hurry back home said caldwell in hares ear tell them to fetch mescal find out and hurry back time presses the mormons are wavering youve got only a few minutes  hare slipped out of the crowd sped up the road jumped the fence on the run and burst in upon the bishop and his family  no dangerdont be alarmedalls well he panted the rustlers are captured i want mescal quick where is she fetch her somebody  one of the women glided from the room hare caught the clicking of a latch the closing of a door hollow footfalls descending on stone and dying away under the cottage they rose again ending in swiftly pattering footsteps like a whirlwind mescal came through the hall black hair flying dark eyes beaming  my darling oblivious of the mormons he swung her up and held her in his arms mescal mescal  when he raised his face from the tumbling mass of her black hair the bishop and his family had left the room  listen mescal be calm im safe the rustlers are prisoners one of them released you from holderness tell me which one  i dont know replied mescal ive tried to think i didnt see his face i cant remember his voice  think think hell be hanged if you dont recall something to identify him he deserves a chance holdernesss crowd are thieves murderers but two were not all bad that showed the night you were at silver cup i saved nebraska  were you at silver cup jack  hush dont interrupt me we must save this man who saved you think mescal think  oh i cant whathow shall i remember  something about him think of his coat his sleeve you must remember something did you see his hands  yes i didwhen he was loosing the cords said mescal eagerly long strong fingers i felt them too he has a sharp rough wart on one hand i dont know which he wears a leather wristband  thats enough hare bounded out upon the garden walk and raced back to the crowded square the uneasy circle stirred and opened for him to enter he stumbled over a pile of lassoes which had not been there when he left the stony mormons waited the rustlers coughed and shifted their feet john caldwell turned a gray face hare bent over the three dead rustlers lying with holderness and after a moment of anxious scrutiny he rose to confront the line of prisoners  hold out your hands  one by one they complied the sixth rustler in the line a tall fellow completely masked refused to do as he was bidden twice hare spoke the rustler twisted his bound hands under his coat  lets see them said hare quickly he grasped the fellows arm and received a violent push that almost knocked him over grappling with the rustler he pulled up the bound hands in spite of fierce resistance and there were the long fingers the sharp wart the laced wristband heres my man he said  no hoarsely mumbled the rustler the perspiration ran down his corded neck his breast heaved convulsively  you fool cried hare dumfounded and resentful i recognized you would you rather hang than live whats your secret  he snatched off the black mask the bishops eldest son stood revealed  good god cried hare recoiling from that convulsed face  brother oh i feared this groaned john caldwell  the rustlers broke out into curses and harsh laughter    you mormons see him paul caldwell son of a bishop thought he was shepherdin sheep  dn you hare shouted the guilty mormon in passionate fury and shame why didnt you hang me why didnt you bury me unknown  caldwell i cant believe it cried hare slowly coming to himself but you dont hang here come out of the crowd make way men  the silent crowd of mormons with lowered and averted eyes made passage for hare and caldwell then cold stern voices in sharp questions and orders went on with the grim trial leading the bowed and stricken mormon hare drew off to the side of the townhall and turned his back upon the crowd the constant trampling of many feet the harsh medley of many voices swelled into one dreadful sound it passed away and a long hush followed but this in turn was suddenly broken by an outcry  the navajos the navajos  hare thrilled at that cry and his glance turned to the eastern end of the village road where a column of mounted indians four abreast was riding toward the square  naab and his indians shouted hare naab and his indians no fear his call was timely for the aroused mormons ignorant of naabs pursuit fearful of hostile navajos were handling their guns ominously  but there came a cry of recognitionaugust naab  onward came the band naab in the lead on his spotted roan the mustangs were spent and lashed with foam naab reined in his charger and the keeneyed navajos closed in behind him the old mormons eagle glance passed over the dark forms dangling from the cottonwoods to the files of waiting men  where is he  there answered john caldwell pointing to the body of holderness  who robbed me of my vengeance who killed the rustler naabs stentorian voice rolled over the listening multitude in it was a hunger of thwarted hate that held men mute he bent a downward gaze at the dead holderness as if to make sure of the ghastly reality then he seemed to rise in his saddle and his broad chest to expand i knowi saw it allblind i was not to believe my own eyes where is he where is hare  some one pointed hare out naab swung from his saddle and scattered the men before him as if they had been sheep his shaggy gray head and massive shoulders towered above the tallest there  hare felt again a cold sense of fear he grew weak in all his being he reeled when the gray shaggy giant laid a huge hand on his shoulder and with one pull dragged him close was this his kind mormon benefactor this man with the awful eyes  you killed holderness roared naab  yes whispered hare  you heard me say id go alone you forestalled me you took upon yourself my work speak  idid  by what right  my debtdutyyour familydave  boy boy youve robbed me naab waved his arm from the gaping crowd to the swinging rustlers youve led these whitelivered mormons to do my work how can i avenge my sonsseven sons  his was the rage of the old desertlion he loosed hare and strode in magnificent wrath over holderness and raised his brawny fists  eighteen years i prayed for wicked men he rolled out one by one i buried my sons i gave my springs and my cattle then i yielded to the lust for blood i renounced my religion i paid my soul to everlasting hell for the life of my foe but hes dead killed by a wild boy i sold myself to the devil for nothing  august naab raved out his unnatural rage amid awed silence his revolt was the flood of years undammed at the last the ferocity of the desert spirit spoke silently in the hanging rustlers in the ruthlessness of the vigilantes who had destroyed them but it spoke truest in the sonorous roll of the old mormons wrath  august young hare saved two of the rustlers spoke up an old friend hoping to divert the angry flood paul caldwell there he was one of them the others gone  naab loomed over him what he roared his friend edged away repeating his words and jerking his thumb backward toward the bishops son  judas iscariot thundered naab false to thyself thy kin and thy god thrice traitor why didnt you get yourself killed  why are you left ahh for mea rustler for me to killwith my own handsa rope therea rope  i wanted them to hang me hoarsely cried caldwell writhing in naabs grasp  hare threw all his weight and strength upon the mormons iron arm naab naab for gods sake hear he saved mescal this man thief traitor false mormonwhatever he ishe saved mescal  august naabs eyes were bloodshot one shake of his great body flung hare off he dragged paul caldwell across the grass toward the cottonwood as easily as if he were handling an empty grainsack  hare suddenly darted after him august augustlook look he cried he pointed a shaking finger down the square the old bishop came tottering over the grass leaning on his cane shading his eyes with his hand august see the bishops coming pauls father do you hear  hares appeal pierced naabs frenzied brain the mormon elder saw his old bishop pause and stare at the dark shapes suspended from the cottonwoods and hold up his hands in horror  naab loosed his hold his frame seemed wrenched as though by the passing of an evil spirit and the reaction left his face transfigured  paul its your father the bishop he said brokenly be a man he must never know naab spread wide his arms to the crowd men listen he said of all of us mormons i have lost most suffered most then hear me bishop caldwell must never know of his sons guilt he would sink under it keep the secret paul will be a man again i know i see for mormons august naab has the gift of revelation     xxi mescal   summer gleams of golden sunshine swam under the glistening red walls of the oasis shadows from white clouds like sails on a deepblue sea darkened the broad fields of alfalfa circling columns of smoke were wafted far above the cottonwoods and floated in the still air the desertred color of navajo blankets brightened the grove  halfnaked bronze indians lolled in the shade lounged on the cabin porches and stood about the sunny glade in idle groups they wore the dress of peace a single blacktipped white eagle feather waved above the band binding each black head they watched the merry children tumble round the playground silvermane browsed where he listed under the shady trees and many a sinewy red hand caressed his flowing mane black bolly neighed her jealous displeasure from the corral and the other mustangs trampled and kicked and whistled defiance across the bars the peacocks preened their gorgeous plumage and uttered their clarion calls the belligerent turkeygobblers sidled about ruffling their feathers the blackbirds and swallows sang and twittered their happiness to find old nests in the branches and under the eaves over all boomed the dull roar of the colorado in flood  it was the morning of mescals weddingday  august naab for once without a task sat astride a peeled log of driftwood in the lane and hare stood beside him  five thousand steers lad why do you refuse them theyre worth ten dollars a head today in salt lake city a good start for a young man  no im still in your debt  then share alike with my sons in work and profit  yes i can accept that  good jack i see happiness and prosperity for you do you remember that night on the white sage trail ah well the worst is over we can look forward to better times its not likely the rustlers will ride into utah again but this desert will never be free from strife  tell me of mescal said hare  ah yes im coming to that naab bent his head over the log and chipped off little pieces with his knife jack will you come into the mormon church  long had hare shrunk from this question which he felt must inevitably come and now he met it as bravely as he could knowing he would pain his friend  no august i cant he replied i feeldifferently from mormons aboutabout women if it wasnt for that i look upon you as a father ill do anything for you except that no one could pray to be a better man than you your work your religion your life why ive no words to say what i feel teach me what little you can of them august but dont ask methat  well well sighed naab the gray clearness of his eagle eyes grew shadowed and his worn face was sad it was the look of a strong wise man who seemed to hear doubt and failure knocking at the gate of his creed but he loved life too well to be unhappy he saw it too clearly not to know there was nothing wholly good wholly perfect wholly without error the shade passed from his face like the cloudshadow from the sunlit lane  you ask about mescal he mused theres little more to tell  but her fathercan you tell me more of him  little more than ive already told he was evidently a man of some rank i suspected that he ruined his life and became an adventurer his health was shattered when i brought him here but he got well after a year or so he was a splendid handsome fellow he spoke very seldom and i dont remember ever seeing him smile his favorite walk was the river trail i came upon him there one day and found him dying he asked me to have a care of mescal and he died muttering a spanish word a womans name i think  ill cherish mescal the more said hare  cherish her yes my bible will this day give her a name we know she has the blood of a great chief beautiful she is and good i raised her for the mormon church but god disposes after all and i  a shrill screeching sound split the warm stillness the longdrawnout bray of a burro  jack look down the lane if it isnt noddle  under the shady line of the red wall a little gray burro came trotting leisurely along with one long brown ear standing straight up the other hanging down over his nose  by george its noddle exclaimed hare hes climbed out of the canyon wont this please mescal  hey mother mary called naab toward the cabin send mescal out heres a weddingpresent  with laughing wonder the womenfolk flocked out into the yard mescal hung back shyeyed roses dyeing the brown of her cheeks  mescals weddingpresent from thunder river just arrived called naab cheerily yet deepvoiced with the happiness he knew the tidings would give a dusty dirty shaggy starved lopeared lazy burronoddle  mescal flew out into the lane and with a strange broken cry of joy that was half a sob she fell upon her knees and clasped the little burros neck noddle wearily flapped his long brown ears wearily nodded his white nose then evidently considering the incident closed he went lazily to sleep  noddle dear old noddle murmured mescal with farseeing thoughtmirroring eyes for you to come back today from our canyon  oh the long dark nights with the thunder of the river and the lonely voices they come back to me wolf wolf heres noddle the same faithful old noddle  august naab married mescal and hare at noon under the shade of the cottonwoods eschtah magnificent in robes of state stood up with them the many members of naabs family and the grave navajos formed an attentive circle around them the ceremony was brief at its close the mormon lifted his face and arms in characteristic invocation  almighty god we entreat thy blessing upon this marriage many and inscrutable are thy ways strange are the workings of thy will wondrous the purpose with which thou hast brought this man and this woman together watch over them in the new path they are to tread help them in the trials to come and in thy good time when they have reached the fulness of days when they have known the joy of life and rendered their service gather them to thy bosom in that eternal home where we all pray to meet thy chosen ones of good yea and the evil ones purified in thy mercy amen  happy congratulations of the mormon family a merry romp of children flinging flowers marriagedance of singing navajosthese with the feast spread under the cottonwoods filled the warm noonhours of the day  then the chief eschtah raised his lofty form and turned his eyes upon the bride and groom  eschtahs hundred summers smile in the face of youth the arm of the white chief is strong the kiss of the flower of the desert is sweet let mescal and jack rest their heads on one pillow and sleep under the trees and chant when the dawn brightens in the east out of his wise years the navajo bids them love while they may daughter of my race take the blessing of the navajo  jack lifted mescal upon black bolly and mounted silvermane piute grinned till he shook his earrings and started the pack burros toward the plateau trail wolf pattered on before turning his white head impatient of delay amid tears and waving of hands and cheers they began the zigzag ascent  when they reached the old camp on the plateau the sun was setting behind the painted desert with hands closely interwoven they watched the color fade and the mustering of purple shadows  twilight fell piute raked the red coals from the glowing centre of the campfire wolf crouched all his long white length his sharp nose on his paws watching mescal hare watched her too the night shone in her eyes the light of the fire the old brooding mystic desertspirit and something more the thump of silvermanes hobbled hoofs was heard in the darkness bollys bell jangled musically the sheep were bleating a lonesome coyote barked the white stars blinked out of the blue and the night breeze whispered softly among the cedars
