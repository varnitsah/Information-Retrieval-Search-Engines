54950146	1601  conversation as it was by the social fireside in the time of the tudors   by mark twain     introduction  born irreverent scrawled mark twain on a scratch pad like all other people i have ever known or heard ofi am hoping to remain so while there are any reverent irreverences left to make fun of holograph manuscript of samuel l clemens in the collection of the f j meine  mark twain was just as irreverent as he dared be and 1601 reveals his richest expression of sovereign contempt for overstuffed language genteel literature and conventional idiocies later when a magazine editor apostrophized o that we had a rabelais mark impishly and anonymouslysubmitted 1601 and that same editor a praiser of rabelais scathingly abused it and the sender in this episode as in many others mark twain the bad boy of american literature revealed his huge delight in blasting the shams of contemporary hypocrisy too there was always the spirit of tom sawyer deviltry in marks makeup that prompted him as he himself boasted to see how much holy indignation he could stir up in the world   who wrote 1601  the correct and complete title of 1601 as first issued was date 1601 conversation as it was by the social fireside in the time of the tudors for many years after its anonymous first issue in 1880 its authorship was variously conjectured and widely disputed in boston william t ball one of the leading theatrical critics during the late 90s asserted that it was originally written by an english actor name not divulged who gave it to him balls original it was said looked like a newspaper strip in the way it was printed and may indeed have been a proof pulled in some newspaper office in st louis william marion reedy editor of the st louis mirror had seen this famous tour de force circulated in the early 80s in galleyproof form he first learned from eugene field that it was from the pen of mark twain  many people said reedy thought the thing was done by field and attributed as a joke to mark twain field had a perfect genius for that sort of thing as many extant specimens attest and for that sort of practical joke but to my thinking the humor of the piece is too mellownot hard and bright and bitterto be eugene fields reedys opinion hits off the fundamental difference between these two great humorists one half suspects that reedy was thinking of fields french crisis  but twain first claimed his bantling from the fog of anonymity in 1906 in a letter addressed to mr charles orr librarian of case library cleveland said clemens in the course of his letter dated july 30 1906 from dublin new hampshire  the title of the piece is 1601 the piece is a supposititious conversation which takes place in queen elizabeths closet in that year between the queen ben jonson beaumont sir walter raleigh the duchess of bilgewater and one or two others and is not as john hay mistakenly supposes a serious effort to bring back our literature and philosophy to the sober and chaste elizabeths time if there is a decent word findable in it it is because i overlooked it i hasten to assure you that it is not printed in my published writings   twitting the rev joseph twichell  the circumstances of how 1601 came to be written have since been officially revealed by albert bigelow paine in mark twain a bibliography 1912 and in the publication of mark twains notebook 1935  1601 was written during the summer of 1876 when the clemens family had retreated to quarry farm in elmira county new york here mrs clemens enjoyed relief from social obligations the children romped over the countryside and mark retired to his octagonal study which perched high on the hill looked out upon the valley below it was in the famous summer of 1876 too that mark was putting the finishing touches to tom sawyer before the close of the same year he had already begun work on the adventures of huckleberry finn published in 1885 it is interesting to note the use of the title the duke of bilgewater in huck finn when the duchess of bilgewater had already made her appearance in 1601 sandwiched between his two great masterpieces tom sawyer and huck finn the writing of 1601 was indeed a strange interlude  during this prolific period mark wrote many minor items most of them rejected by howells and read extensively in one of his favorite books pepys diary like many another writer mark was captivated by pepys style and spirit and he determined says albert bigelow paine in his mark twain a biography to try his hand on an imaginary record of conversation and court manners of a bygone day written in the phrase of the period the result was fireside conversation in the time of queen elizabeth or as he later called it 1601 the conversation recorded by a supposed pepys of that period was written with all the outspoken coarseness and nakedness of that rank day when fireside sociabilities were limited only to the loosened fancy vocabulary and physical performance and not by any bounds of convention  it was written as a letter continues paine to that robust divine rev joseph twichell who unlike howells had no scruples about marks elizabethan breadth of parlance  the rev joseph twichell marks most intimate friend for over forty years was pastor of the asylum hill congregational church of hartford which mark facetiously called the church of the holy speculators because of its wealthy parishioners here mark had first met joe at a social and their meeting ripened into a glorious life long friendship twichell was a man of about marks own age a profound scholar a devout christian yet a man with an exuberant sense of humor and a profound understanding of the frailties of mankind the rev mr twichell performed the marriage ceremony for mark twain and solemnized the births of his children joe his friend counseled him on literary as well as personal matters for the remainder of marks life it is important to catch this brief glimpse of the man for whom this masterpiece was written for without it one can not fully understand the spirit in which 1601 was written or the keen enjoyment which mark and joe derived from it   save me one  the story of the first issue of 1601 is one of finesse state diplomacy and surreptitious printing  the rev joe twichell for whose delectation the piece had been written apparently had pocketed the document for four long years then in 1880 it came into the hands of john hay later secretary of state presumably sent to him by mark twain hay pronounced the sketch a masterpiece and wrote immediately to his old cleveland friend alexander gunn prince of connoisseurs in art and literature the following correspondence reveals the fine diplomacy which made the name of john hay known throughout the world   department of state  washington june 21 1880  dear gunn  are you in cleveland for all this week if you will say yes by return mail i have a masterpiece to submit to your consideration which is only in my hands for a few days  yours very much worritted by the depravity of christendom  hay   the second letter discloses hays own high opinion of the effort and his deep concern for its safety    june 24 1880  my dear gunn  here it is it was written by mark twain in a serious effort to bring back our literature and philosophy to the sober and chaste elizabethan standard but the taste of the present day is too corrupt for anything so classic he has not yet been able even to find a publisher the globe has not yet recovered from downeys inroad and they wont touch it  i send it to you as one of the few lingering relics of that race of appreciative critics who know a good thing when they see it  read it with reverence and gratitude and send it back to me for mark is impatient to see once more his wandering offspring  yours  hay   in his third letter one can almost hear hays chuckle in the certainty that his diplomatic if somewhat wicked suggestion would bear fruit   washington d cjuly 7 1880  my dear gunn  i have your letter and the proposition which you make to pull a few proofs of the masterpiece is highly attractive and of course highly immoral i cannot properly consent to it and i am afraid the great many would think i was taking an unfair advantage of his confidence please send back the document as soon as you can and if in spite of my prohibition you take these proofs save me one  very truly yours  john hay    thus was this elizabethan dialogue poured into the moulds of cold type according to merle johnson mark twains bibliographer it was issued in pamphlet form without wrappers or covers there were 8 pages of text and the pamphlet measured 7 by 8 12 inches only four copies are believed to have been printed one for hay one for gunn and two for twain  in the matter of humor wrote clemens referring to hays delicious notes what an unsurpassable touch john hay had   humor at west point  the first printing of 1601 in actual book form was donne at ye academie press in 1882 west point new york under the supervision of lieut c e s wood then adjutant of the u s military academy  in 1882 mark twain and joe twichell visited their friend lieut wood at west point where they learned that wood as adjutant had under his control a small printing establishment on marks return to hartford wood received a letter asking if he would do mark a great favor by printing something he had written which he did not care to entrust to the ordinary printer wood replied that he would be glad to oblige on april 3 1882 mark sent the manuscript  i enclose the original of 1603 sic as you suggest i am afraid there are errors in it also heedlessness in antiquated spellinges stuck on often at end of words where they are not strictly necessary etc i would go through the manuscript but i am too much driven just now and it is not important anyway i wish you would do me the kindness to make any and all corrections that suggest themselves to you  sincerely yours  s l clemens   charles erskine scott wood recalled in a foreword which he wrote for the limited edition of 1601 issued by the grabhorn press how he felt when he first saw the original manuscript when i read it writes wood i felt that the character of it would be carried a little better by a printing which pretended to the eye that it was contemporaneous with the pretended conversation  i wrote mark that for literary effect i thought there should be a species of forgery though of course there was no effort to actually deceive a scholar mark answered that i might do as i likedthat his only object was to secure a number of copies as the demand for it was becoming burdensome but he would be very grateful for any interest i brought to the doing  well tucker foreman of the printing shop and i soaked some handmade linen paper in weak coffee put it as a wet bundle into a warm room to mildew dried it to a dampness approved by tucker and he printed the copy on a hand press i had special punches cut for such elizabethan abbreviations as the a e o and u when followed by m or nand for the commonly and stupidly pronounced ye  the only editing i did was as to the spelling and a few old english words introduced the spelling if i remember correctly is mine but the text is exactly as written by mark i wrote asking his view of making the spelling of the period and he was enthusiastictelling me to do whatever i thought best and he was greatly pleased with the result  thus was printed in a de luxe edition of fifty copies the most curious masterpiece of american humor at one of americas most dignified institutions the united states military academy at west point  1601 was so bepraised by the archaeological scholars of a quarter of a century ago wrote clemens in his letter to charles orr that i was rather inordinately vain of it at that time it had been privately printed in several countries among them japan a sumptuous edition on large paper roughedged was made by lieut c e s wood at west point an edition of 50 copiesand distributed among popes and kings and such people in england copies of that issue were worth twenty guineas when i was there six years ago and none to be had   from the depths  mark twains irreverence should not be misinterpreted it was an irreverence which bubbled up from a deep passionate insight into the wellsprings of human nature in 1601 as in the man that corrupted hadleyburg and in the mysterious stranger he tore the masks off human beings and left them cringing before the public view with the deftness of a master surgeon clemens dealt with human emotions and delighted in exposing human nature in the raw  the spirit and the language of the fireside conversation were rooted deep in mark twains nature and in his life as c e s wood who printed 1601 at west point has pertinently observed  if i made a guess as to the intellectual ferment out of which 1601 rose i would say that marks intellectual structure and subconscious graining was from anglosaxons as primitive as the common man of the tudor period he came from the banks of the mississippifrom the flatboatmen pilots roustabouts farmers and village folk of a rude primitive peopleas lincoln did  he was finished in the mining camps of the west among stage drivers gamblers and the men of 49 the simple roughness of a frontier people was in his blood and brain  words vulgar and offensive to other ears were a common language to him anyone who ever knew mark heard him use them freely forcibly picturesquely in his unrestrained conversation such language is forcible as all primitive words are refinement seems to make for weaknessor let us say a cutting edgebut the old vulgar monosyllabic words bit like the blow of a pioneers axand mark was like that then i think 1601 came out of marks instinctive humor satire and hatred of puritanism but there is more than this with all its humor there is a sense of real delight in what may be called obscenity for its own sake whitman and the bible are no more obscene than nature herselfno more obscene than a manure pile out of which come roses and cherries every word used in 1601 was used by our own rude pioneers as a part of their vocabularyand no word was ever invented by man with obscene intent but only as language to express his meaning no act of nature is obscene in itselfbut when such words and acts are dragged in for an ulterior purpose they become offensive as everything out of place is offensive i think he delighted too in shockinggiving resounding slaps on what chaucer would quite simply call the bare erse  quite aside from this chaucerian erse slapping clemens had also a semiserious purpose that of reproducing a past time as he saw it in shakespeare dekker jonson and other writers of the elizabethan era fireside conversation was an exercise in scholarship illumined by a keen sense of character it was made especially effective by the artistic arrangement of widelygathered material into a compressed picture of a phase of the manners and even the minds of the men and women in the spacious times of great elizabeth  mark twain made of 1601 a very smart and fascinating performance carried over almost to grotesqueness just to show it was not done for mere delight in the frank naturalism of the functions with which it deals that mark twain had made considerable study of this frankness is apparent from chapter four of a yankee at king arthurs court where he refers to the conversation at the famous round table thus  many of the terms used in the most matteroffact way by this great assemblage of the first ladies and gentlemen of the land would have made a comanche blush indelicacy is too mild a term to convey the idea however i had read tom jones and roderick random and other books of that kind and knew that the highest and first ladies and gentlemen in england had remained little or no cleaner in their talk and in the morals and conduct which such talk implies clear up to one hundred years ago in fact clear into our own nineteenth centuryin which century broadly speaking the earliest samples of the real lady and the real gentleman discoverable in english historyor in european history for that mattermay be said to have made their appearance suppose sir walter scott instead of putting the conversation into the mouths of his characters had allowed the characters to speak for themselves we should have had talk from rebecca and ivanhoe and the soft lady rowena which would embarrass a tramp in our day however to the unconsciously indelicate all things are delicate  mark twains interest in history and in the depiction of historical periods and characters is revealed through his fondness for historical reading in preference to fiction and through his other historical writings even in the hilarious youthful days in san francisco paine reports that clemens however was never quite ready for sleep then as ever he would prop himself up in bed light his pipe and lose himself in english or french history until his sleep conquered paine tells us too that leckys european morals was an old favorite  the notes to the prince and the pauper show again how carefully clemens examined his historical background and his interest in these materials some of the more important sources are noted humes history of england timbs curiosities of london j hammond trumbulls blue laws true and false apparently mark twain relished it for as bernard devoto points out the book is always mark twain its parodies of tudor speech lapse sometimes into a callow satisfaction in that idiommark hugely enjoys his nathlesses and beshrews and marrys the writing of 1601 foreshadows his fondness for this treatment       do you suppose the liberties and the brawn of these states have to      do only with delicate ladywords  with gloved gentleman words                               walt whitman an american primer  although 1601 was not matched by any similar sketch in his published works it was representative of mark twain the man he was no emaciated literary teatosser bronzed and weatherbeaten son of the west mark was a mans man and that significant fact is emphasized by the several phases of marks rich life as steamboat pilot printer miner and frontier journalist  on the virginia city enterprise mark learned from editor r m daggett that when it was necessary to call a man names there were no expletives too long or too expressive to be hurled in rapid succession to emphasize the utter want of character of the man assailed there were typesetters there who could hurl anathemas at bad copy which would have frightened a bengal tiger the news editor could damn a mutilated dispatch in twentyfour languages  in san francisco in the sizzling sixties we catch a glimpse of mark twain and his buddy steve gillis pausing in doorways to sing the doleful ballad of the neglected lover an old piece of uncollected erotica one morning when a dog began to howl steve awoke to find his roommate standing in the door that opened out into a back garden holding a big revolver his hand shaking with cold and excitement relates paine in his biography  come here steve he said im so chilled through i cant get a bead on him  sam said steve dont shoot him just swear at him you can easily kill him at any range with your profanity  steve gillis declares that mark twain let go such a scorching singeing blast that the brutes owner sold him the next day for a mexican hairless dog  nor did marks geysers of profanity cease spouting after these gay and youthful days in san francisco with clemens it may truly be said that profanity was an arta pyrotechnic art that entertained nations  it was my duty to keep buttons on his shirts recalled katy leary lifelong housekeeper and friend in the clemens menage and hed swear something terrible if i didnt if he found a shirt in his drawer without a button on hed take every single shirt out of that drawer and throw them right out of the window rain or shineout of the bathroom window theyd go i used to look out every morning to see the snowflakesanything white out theyd fly oh hed swear at anything when he was on a rampage hed swear at his razor if it didnt cut right and mrs clemens used to send me around to the bathroom door sometimes to knock and ask him what was the matter well id go and knock id say mrs clemens wants to know whats the matter and then hed say to me kind of low in a whisper like did she hear me katy yes id say every word oh well he was ashamed then he was afraid of getting scolded for swearing like that because mrs clemens hated swearing but his swearing never seemed really bad to katy leary it was sort of funny and a part of him somehow she said sort of amusing it wasand gaynot like real swearing cause he swore like an angel  in his later years at stormfield mark loved to play his favorite billiards it was sometimes a wonderful and fearsome thing to watch mr clemens play billiards relates elizabeth wallace he loved the game and he loved to win but he occasionally made a very bad stroke and then the varied picturesque and unorthodox vocabulary acquired in his more youthful years was the only thing that gave him comfort gently slowly with no profane inflexions of voice but irresistibly as though they had the headwaters of the mississippi for their source came this stream of unholy adjectives and choice expletives  marks vocabulary ran the whole gamut of life itself in paris in his appearance in 1879 before the stomach club a jolly lot of gay wags marks address reports paine obtained a wide celebrity among the clubs of the world though no line of it not even its title has ever found its way into published literature it is rumored to have been called some remarks on the science of onanism  in berlin mark asked henry w fisher to accompany him on an exploration of the berlin royal library where the librarian having learned that clemens had been the kaisers guest at dinner opened the secret treasure chests for the famous visitor one of these guarded treasures was a volume of grossly indecent verses by voltaire addressed to frederick the great too much is enough mark is reported to have said when fisher translated some of the verses i would blush to remember any of these stanzas except to tell krafftebing about them when i get to vienna when fisher had finished copying a verse for him mark put it into his pocket saying livy marks wife olivia is so busy mispronouncing german these days she cant even attempt to get at this  in his letters too howells observed he had the southwestern the lincolnian the elizabethan breadth of parlance which i suppose one ought not to call coarse without calling ones self prudish and i was often hiding away in discreet holes and corners the letters in which he had loosed his bold fancy to stoop on rank suggestion i could not bear to burn them and i could not after the first reading quite bear to look at them i shall best give my feeling on this point by saying that in it he was shakespearean            with a nigger squat on her safetyvalve                          john hay pike county ballads  is there any other explanation asks van wyck brooks of his elizabethan breadth of parlance mr howells confesses that he sometimes blushed over mark twains letters that there were some which to the very day when he wrote his eulogy on his dead friend he could not bear to reread perhaps if he had not so insisted in former years while going over mark twains proofs upon having that swearing out in an instant he would never had had cause to suffer from his having loosed his bold fancy to stoop on rank suggestion mark twains verbal rabelaisianism was obviously the expression of that vital sap which not having been permitted to inform his work had been driven inward and left there to ferment no wonder he was always indulging in orgies of forbidden words consider the famous book 1601 that fireside conversation in the time of queen elizabeth is there any obsolete verbal indecency in the english language that mark twain has not painstakingly resurrected and assembled there he whose blood was in constant ferment and who could not contain within the narrow bonds that had been set for him the riotous exuberance of his nature had to have an escapevalve and he poured through it a fetid stream of meaningless obscenitythe waste of a priceless psychic material thus brooks lumps 1601 with mark twains bawdry and interprets it simply as another indication of frustration   figs for fig leaves  of course the writing of such a piece as 1601 raised the question of freedom of expression for the creative artist  although little discussed at that time it was a question which intensely interested mark and for a fuller appreciation of marks position one must keep in mind the year in which 1601 was written 1876 there had been nothing like it before in american literature there had appeared no caldwells no faulkners no hemingways victorian england was gushing tennyson in the united states polite letters was a cult of the brahmins of boston with william dean howells at the helm of the atlantic louisa may alcott published little women in 186869 and little men in 1871 in 1873 mark twain led the van of the debunkers scraping the gilt off the lily in the gilded age  in 1880 mark took a few pot shots at license in art and literature in his tramp abroad i wonder why some things are for instance art is allowed as much indecent license today as in earlier timesbut the privileges of literature in this respect have been sharply curtailed within the past eighty or ninety years fielding and smollet could portray the beastliness of their day in the beastliest language we have plenty of foul subjects to deal with in our day but we are not allowed to approach them very near even with nice and guarded forms of speech but not so with art the brush may still deal freely with any subject however revolting or indelicate it makes a body ooze sarcasm at every pore to go about rome and florence and see what this last generation has been doing with the statues these works which had stood in innocent nakedness for ages are all figleaved now yes every one of them nobody noticed their nakedness before perhaps nobody can help noticing it now the figleaf makes it so conspicuous but the comical thing about it all is that the figleaf is confined to cold and pallid marble which would be still cold and unsuggestive without this sham and ostentatious symbol of modesty whereas warmblooded paintings which do really need it have in no case been furnished with it  at the door of the ufizzi in florence one is confronted by statues of a man and a woman noseless battered black with accumulated grimethey hardly suggest human beingsyet these ridiculous creatures have been thoughtfully and conscientiously figleaved by this fastidious generation you enter and proceed to that mostvisited little gallery that exists in the world and there against the wall without obstructing rag or leaf you may look your fill upon the foulest the vilest the obscenest picture the world possessestitians venus it isnt that she is naked and stretched out on a bedno it is the attitude of one of her arms and hand if i ventured to describe the attitude there would be a fine howlbut there the venus lies for anybody to gloat over that wants toand there she has a right to lie for she is a work of art and art has its privileges i saw young girls stealing furtive glances at her i saw young men gaze long and absorbedly at her i saw aged infirm men hang upon her charms with a pathetic interest how i should like to describe herjust to see what a holy indignation i could stir up in the worldjust to hear the unreflecting average man deliver himself about my grossness and coarseness and all that  in every gallery in europe there are hideous pictures of blood carnage oozing brains putrefactionpictures portraying intolerable sufferingpictures alive with every conceivable horror wrought out in dreadful detailand similar pictures are being put on the canvas every day and publicly exhibitedwithout a growl from anybodyfor they are innocent they are inoffensive being works of art but suppose a literary artist ventured to go into a painstaking and elaborate description of one of these grisly thingsthe critics would skin him alive well let it go it cannot be helped art retains her privileges literature has lost hers somebody else may cipher out the whys and the wherefores and the consistencies of iti havent got time   professor scents pornography  unfortunately 1601 has recently been tagged by professor edward wagenknecht as the most famous piece of pornography in american literature like many another uninformed prof w is like the little boy who is shocked to see naughty words chalked on the back fence and thinks they are pornography the initiated after years of wading through the mire will recognize instantly the significant difference between filthy filth and funny filth dirt for dirts sake is something else again pornography an eminent american jurist has pointed out is distinguished by the leer of the sensualist  the words which are criticised as dirty observed justice john m woolsey in the united states district court of new york lifting the ban on ulysses by james joyce are old saxon words known to almost all men and i venture to many women and are such words as would be naturally and habitually used i believe by the types of folk whose life physical and mental joyce is seeking to describe neither was there pornographic intent according to justice woolsey nor was ulysses obscene within the legal definition of that word  the meaning of the word obscene the justice indicated as legally defined by the courts is tending to stir the sex impulses or to lead to sexually impure and lustful thoughts  whether a particular book would tend to excite such impulses and thoughts must be tested by the courts opinion as to its effect on a person with average sex instinctswhat the french would call lhomme moyen sensuelwho plays in this branch of legal inquiry the same role of hypothetical reagent as does the reasonable man in the law of torts and the learned man in the art on questions of invention in patent law  obviously it is ridiculous to say that the leer of the sensualist lurks in the pages of mark twains 1601   droll story  in a way observed william marion reedy 1601 is to twains whole works what the droll stories are to balzacs it is better than the privately circulated ribaldry and vulgarity of eugene field is indeed an essay in a sort of primordial humor such as we find in rabelais or in the plays of some of the lesser stars that drew their light from shakespeares urn it is humor or fun such as one expects let us say from the peasants of thomas hardy outside of hardys books and though it be filthy it yet hath a splendor of mere animalism of good spirits i would say it is scatalogical rather than erotic save for one touch toward the end indeed it seems more of rabelais than of boccaccio or masuccio or aretinois brutally british rather than lasciviously latinate as to the subjects but sumptuous as regards the language  immediately upon first reading john hay later secretary of state had proclaimed 1601 a masterpiece albert bigelow paine mark twains biographer likewise acknowledged its greatness when he said 1601 is a genuine classic as classics of that sort go it is better than the gross obscenities of rabelais and perhaps in some day to come the taste that justified gargantua and the decameron will give this literary refugee shelter and setting among the more conventional writing of mark twain human taste is a curious thing delicacy is purely a matter of environment and point of view  it depends on who writes a thing whether it is coarse or not wrote clemens in his notebook in 1879 i built a conversation which could have happenedi used words such as were used at that time1601 i sent it anonymously to a magazine and how the editor abused it and the sender  but that man was a praiser of rabelais and had been saying o that we had a rabelais i judged that i could furnish him one  then i took it to one of the greatest best and most learned of divines rev joseph h twichell and read it to him he came within an ace of killing himself with laughter for between you and me the thing was dreadfully funny i dont often write anything that i laugh at myself but i can hardly think of that thing without laughing that old divine said it was a piece of the finest kind of literary artand david gray of the buffalo courier said it ought to be printed privately and left behind me when i died and then my fame as a literary artist would last  franklin j meine      the first printing     verbatim reprint   date 1601  conversation as it was by the social fireside in the time of the tudors

the stink and heavens artillery hath shook the globe in admiration of it  then was there a silence and each did turn him toward the worshipful sr walter ralegh that browned embattled bloody swashbuckler who rising up did smile and simpering say  sr wmost gracious maisty twas i that did it but indeed it was so poor and frail a note compared with such as i am wont to furnish yt in sooth i

bear with me please your grace till i can make amends  then delivered he himself of such a godless and rockshivering blast that all were fain to stop their ears and following it did come so dense and foul a stink that that which went before did seem a poor and trifling thing beside it then saith he feigning that he blushed and was confused i perceive that i am weak today and cannot justice do unto

similitude of a mans member wilted and limber whereat ye queene did laugh and say widows in england doe wear prickes too but betwixt the thighs and not wilted neither till coition hath done that office for them master shaxpur did likewise observe how yt ye sieur de montaine hath also spoken of a certain emperor of such mighty prowess that he did take ten maidenheddes in ye compass of a single night ye while his empress did entertain two and twenty lusty knights between her sheetes yet was not satisfied whereat ye merrie countess granby saith a ram is yet ye emperors superior sith he wil

controversy followed as concerning the most just way to spell the word ye contention running high betwixt ye learned bacon and ye ingenious jonson until at last ye old lady margery wearying of it all saith gentles what mattereth it how ye shall spell the word i warrant ye when ye use your bollocks ye shall not think of it and my lady granby be ye content let the spelling be ye shall enjoy the

shifts turned up delay is meet for naught but dalliance boccaccio hath a story of a priest that did beguile a maid into his cell then knelt him in a corner to pray for grace to be rightly thankful for this tender maidenhead ye lord had sent him but ye abbot spying through ye keyhole did see a tuft of brownish hair with fair white flesh about it wherefore when ye priests prayer was done his chance was gone forasmuch as ye little maid had but ye one cunt and that was already occupied to her content  then conversed they of religion and ye mightie work ye old dead luther did doe by ye grace of god then next about poetry and master shaxpur did rede a part of his king henry iv ye which it seemeth unto me is not of ye value of an arsefull of ashes yet they praised it bravely one and all  ye same did rede a portion of his venus and adonis to their prodigious admiration whereas i being sleepy and fatigued withal did deme it but paltry stuff and was the more discomforted in that ye blody bucanier had got his wind again and did turn his mind to farting with such villain zeal that presently i was like to choke once more god damn this windy ruffian and all his breed i wolde that hell

margery there mouthing religion whores from ye cradle  in time came they to discourse of cervantes and of the new painter rubens that is beginning to be heard of fine words and daintywrought phrases from the ladies now one or two of them being in other days pupils of that poor ass lille himself and i marked how that jonson and shaxpur did fidget to discharge some venom of sarcasm yet dared they not in the presence the queenes grace being ye very flower of ye euphuists herself but behold these be they yt having a specialty and admiring it in themselves be jealous when a neighbor doth essaye it nor can abide it in them long wherefore twas observable yt ye quene waxed uncontent and in time labord grandiose speeche out of ye mouth of lady alice who manifestly did mightily pride herself thereon did quite exhauste ye quenes endurance who listened till ye gaudy speeche was done then lifted up her brows and with vaste irony mincing saith o shit whereat they alle did laffe but not ye lady alice yt olde foolish bitche  now was sr walter minded of a tale he once did hear ye ingenious margrette of navarre relate about a maid which being like to suffer rape by an olde archbishoppe did smartly contrive a device to save her maidenhedde and said to him first my lord i prithee take out thy holy tool and piss before me which doing lo his member felle and would not rise again     footnotes to frivolity  the historical consistency of 1601 indicates that twain must have given the subject considerable thought the author was careful to speak only of men who conceivably might have been in the virgin queens closet and engaged in discourse with her   the characters  at this time 1601 queen elizabeth was 68 years old she speaks of having talked to old rabelais in her youth this might have been possible as rabelais died in 1552 when the queen was 19 years old  among those in the party were shakespeare at that time 37 years old ben jonson 27 and sir walter raleigh 49 beaumont at the time was 17 not 16 he was admitted as a member of the inner temple in 1600 and his first translations those from ovid were first published in 1602 therefore if one were holding strictly to the year date neither by age nor by fame would beaumont have been eligible to attend such a gathering of august personages in the year 1601 but the point is unimportant   the elizabethan writers  in the conversation shakespeare speaks of montaignes essays these were first published in 1580 and successive editions were issued in the years following the third volume being published in 1588 in england montaigne was early popular it was long supposed that the autograph of shakespeare in a copy of florios translation showed his study of the essays the autograph has been disputed but divers passages and especially one in the tempest show that at first or second hand the poet was acquainted with the essayist encyclopedia brittanica  the company at the queens fireside discoursed of lilly or lyly english dramatist and novelist of the elizabethan era whose novel euphues published in two parts euphues or the anatomy of wit 1579 and euphues and his england 1580 was a literary sensation it is said to have influenced literary style for more than a quarter of a century and traces of its influence are found in shakespeare columbia encyclopedia  the introduction of ben jonson into the party was wholly appropriate if one may call to witness some of jonsons writings the subject under discussion was one that jonson was acquainted with in the alchemist   act i scene i  face believet i will

ist you buy      the windmill blown down by the witches fart      or saint george that o did break the dragons heart   good old english custom  that certain types of english society have not changed materially in their freedom toward breaking wind in public can be noticed in some comparatively recent literature frank harris in my life vol 2 ch xiii tells of lady marriott wife of a judge advocate general being compelled to leave her own table at which she was entertaining sir robert fowler then the lord mayor of london because of the suffocating and nauseating odors there he also tells of an instance in parliament and of a rather brilliant bon mot spoken upon that occasion  while fowler was speaking finchhatton had shewn signs of restlessness towards the end of the speech he had moved some three yards away from the baronet as soon as fowler sat down finchhatton sprang up holding his handkerchief to his nose  mr speaker he began and was at once acknowledged by the speaker for it was a maiden speech and as such was entitled to precedence by the courteous custom of the house i know why the right honourable member from the city did not conclude his speech with a proposal the only way to conclude such a speech appropriately would be with a motion   aeolian crepitations  but society had apparently degenerated sadly in modern times and even in the era of elizabeth for at an earlier date it was a seriousnay capitaloffense to break wind in the presence of majesty the emperor claudius hearing that one who had suppressed the urge while paying him court had suffered greatly thereby intended to issue an edict allowing to all people the liberty of giving vent at table to any distension occasioned by flatulence  martial too book xii epigram lxxvii tells of the embarrassment of one who broke wind while praying in the capitol  one day while standing upright addressing his prayers to jupiter aethon farted in the capitol men laughed but the father of the gods offended condemned the guilty one to dine at home for three nights since that time miserable aethon when he wishes to enter the capitol goes first to paterclius privies and farts ten or twenty times yet in spite of this precautionary crepitation he salutes jove with constricted buttocks martial also book iv epigram lxxx ridicules a woman who was subject to the habit saying  your bassa fabullus has always a child at her side calling it her darling and her plaything and yetmore wondershe does not care for children what is the reason then bassa is apt to fart for which she could blame the unsuspecting infant  the tale is told too of a certain woman who performed an aeolian crepitation at a dinner attended by the witty monsignieur dupanloup bishop of orleans and that when to cover up her lapse she began to scrape her feet upon the floor and to make similar noises the bishop said do not trouble to find a rhyme madam  nay worthier names than those of any yet mentioned have discussed the matter herodotus tells of one such which was the precursor to the fall of an empire and a change of dynastythat which amasis discharges while on horseback and bids the envoy of apries king of egypt catch and deliver to his royal master even the exact manner and posture of amasis author of this insult is described  st augustine the city of god xiv24 cites the instance of a man who could command his rear trumpet to sound at will which his learned commentator fortifies with the example of one who could do so in tune  benjamin franklin in his letter to the royal academy of brussels has canvassed suggested remedies for alleviating the stench attendant upon these discharges  my prize question therefore should be to discover some drug wholesome andnot disagreeable to be mixed with our common food or sauces that shall render the natural discharges of wind from our bodies not only inoffensive but agreeable as perfumes  that this is not a chimerical project  altogether impossible may appear from these considerations that we already have some knowledge of means capable of varying that smell he that dines on stale flesh especially with much addition of onions shall be able to afford a stink that no company can tolerate while he that has lived for some time on vegetables only shall have that breath so pure as to be insensible of the most delicate noses and if he can manage so as to avoid the report he may anywhere give vent to his griefs unnoticed but as there are many to whom an entire vegetable diet would be inconvenient  as a little quick lime thrown into a jakes will correct the amazing quantity of fetid air arising from the vast mass of putrid matter contained in such places and render it pleasing to the smell who knows but that a little powder of lime or some other equivalent taken in our food or perhaps a glass of lime water drank at dinner may have the same effect on the air produced in and issuing from our bowels  one curious commentary on the text is that elizabeth should be so fond of investigating into the authorship of the exhalation in question when she was inordinately fond of strong and sweet perfumes in fact she was responsible for the tremendous increase in importations of scents into england during her reign   ye boke of ye sieur michael de montaine  there is a curious admixture of error and misunderstanding in this part of the sketch in the first place the story is borrowed from montaigne where it is told inaccurately and then further corrupted in the telling  it was not the good widows of perigord who wore the phallus upon their coifs it was the young married women of the district near montaignes home who paraded it to view upon their foreheads as a symbol says our essayist of the joy they derived therefrom if they became widows they reversed its position and covered it up with the rest of their headdress  the emperor mentioned was not an emperor he was procolus a native of albengue on the genoese coast who with bonosus led the unsuccessful rebellion in gaul against emperor probus even so keen a commentator as cotton has failed to note the error  the empress montaigne does not say his empress was messalina third wife of the emperor claudius who was uncle of caligula and fosterfather to nero furthermore in her case the charge is that she copulated with twentyfive in a single night and not twentytwo as appears in the text montaigne is right in his statistics if original sources are correct whereas the author erred in transcribing the incident  as for proculus it has been noted that he was associated with bonosus who was as renowned in the field of bacchus as was proculus in that of venus gibbon decline and fall of the roman empire the feat of proculus is told in his own words in vopiscus hist augustine p 246 where he recounts having captured one hundred sarmatian virgins and unmaidened ten of them in one night together with the happenings subsequent thereto  concerning messalina there appears to be no question but that she was a nymphomaniac and that while empress of rome she participated in some fearful debaucheries the question is what to believe for much that we have heard about her is almost certainly apocryphal  the author from whom montaigne took his facts is the elder pliny who in his natural history book x chapter 83 says other animals become sated with veneral pleasures man hardly knows any satiety messalina the wife of claudius caesar thinking this a palm quite worthy of an empress selected for the purpose of deciding the question one of the most notorious women who followed the profession of a hired prostitute and the empress outdid her after continuous intercourse night and day at the twentyfifth embrace  but pliny notwithstanding his great attainments was often a retailer of stale gossip and in like case was aurelius victor another writer who heaped much odium on her name again there is a great hiatus in the annals of tacitus a true historian at the period covering the earlier days of the empress while suetonius bitter as he may be is little more than an anecdotist juvenal another of her detractors is a prejudiced witness for he started out to satirize female vice and naturally aimed at high places dio also tells of messalinas misdeeds but his work is under the same limitations as that of suetonius furthermore none but pliny mentions the excess under consideration  however where there is much smoke there must be a little fire and based upon the superimposed testimony of the writers of the period there appears little doubt but that messalina was a nymphomaniac that she prostituted herself in the public stews naked and with gilded nipples and that she did actually marry her chief adulterer silius while claudius was absent at ostia and that the wedding was consummated in the presence of a concourse of witnesses this was the straw that broke the camels back claudius hastened back to rome silius was dispatched and messalina lacking the willpower to destroy herself was killed when an officer ran a sword through her abdomen just as it appeared that claudius was about to relent   then spake ye damned windmill sir walter  raleigh is thoroughly in character here this observation is quite in keeping with the general veracity of his account of his travels in guiana one of the most mendacious accounts of adventure ever told naturally the scholarly researches of westermarck have failed to discover this people perhaps lady helen might best be protected among the jibaros of ecuador where the men marry when approaching forty  ben jonson in his conversations observed that sr w raughlye esteemed more of fame than of conscience   ye virgin queene  grave historians have debated for centuries the pretensions of elizabeth to the title the virgin queen and it is utterly impossible to dispose of the issue in a note however the weight of opinion appears to be in the negative many and great were the difficulties attending the marriage of a protestant princess in those troublous times and elizabeth finally announced that she would become wedded to the english nation and she wore a ring in token thereof until her death however more or less open liaisons with essex and leicester as well as a host of lesser courtiers her ardent temperament and her imperious temper are indications that cannot be denied in determining any estimate upon the point in question  ben jonson in his conversations with william drummond of hawthornden says  queen elizabeth never saw herself after she became old in a true glass they painted her and sometymes would vermillion her nose she had allwayes about christmass evens set dice that threw sixes or five and she knew not they were other to make her win and esteame herself fortunate that she had a membrana on her which made her uncapable of man though for her delight she tried many at the coming over of monsieur there was a french chirurgion who took in hand to cut it yett fear stayed her and his death  it was a subject which again intrigued clemens when he was abroad with w h fisher whom mark employed to nose up everything pertaining to queen elizabeths manly character   boccaccio hath a story  the author does not pay any great compliment to raleighs memory here there is no such tale in all boccaccio the nearest related incident forms the subject matter of dineos novel the fourth of the first day of the decameron   old sr nicholas throgmorton  the incident referred to appears to be sir nicholas throgmortons trial for complicity in the attempt to make lady jane grey queen of england a charge of which he was acquitted this so angered queen mary that she imprisoned him in the tower and fined the jurors from one to two thousand pounds each her action terrified succeeding juries so that sir nicholass brother was condemned on no stronger evidence than that which had failed to prevail before while sir nicholass defense may have been brilliant it must be admitted that the evidence was weak he was later released from the tower and under elizabeth was one of a group of commissioners sent by that princess into scotland to foment trouble with mary queen of scots when the attempt became known elizabeth repudiated the acts of her agents but sir nicholas having anticipated this possibility had sufficient foresight to secure endorsement of his plan by the council and so outwitted elizabeth who was playing a twofaced role and cecil one of the greatest statesmen who ever held the post of principal minister perhaps it was this incident to which the company referred which might in part explain elizabeths rejoinder however he had been restored to confidence ere this and had served as ambassador to france   to save his doters maidenhedde  elizabeth throckmorton or throgmorton daughter of sir nicholas was one of elizabeths maids of honor when it was learned that she had been debauched by raleigh sir walter was recalled from his command at sea by the queen and compelled to marry the girl this was not in that olde daie as the text has it for it happened only eight years before the date of this purported conversation when elizabeth was sixty years old     partial bibliography  the various printings of 1601 reveal how mark twains fireside conversation has become a part of the american printers lore but more important its many printings indicate that it has become a popular bit of american folklore particularly for men and women who have a feeling for mark twain apparently it appeals to the typographer who devotes to it his worthy art as well as to the job printer who may pull a crudely printed proof the gay procession of curious printings of 1601 is unique in the history of american printing  indeed the story of the various printings of 1601 is almost legendary in the days of the jour printer so i am told wellthumbed copies were carried from print shop to print shop for more than a quarter century now it has been one of
