39996068	the interpreters of genesis and the interpreters of nature  essay 4 from science and hebrew tradition   by thomas henry huxley    our fabulist warns those who in quarrels interpose of the fate which is probably in store for them and in venturing to place myself between so powerful a controversialist as mr gladstone and the eminent divine whom he assaults with such vigour in the last number of this review 1 i am fully aware that i run great danger of verifying gays prediction moreover it is quite possible that my zeal in offering aid to a combatant so extremely well able to take care of himself as m reville may be thought to savour of indiscretion  two considerations however have led me to face the double risk the one is that though in my judgment m reville is wholly in the right in that part of the controversy to which i propose to restrict my observations nevertheless he as a foreigner has very little chance of making the truth prevail with englishmen against the authority and the dialectic skill of the greatest master of persuasive rhetoric among englishspeaking men of our time as the queens proctor intervenes in certain cases between two litigants in the interests of justice so it may be permitted me to interpose as a sort of uncommissioned science proctor my second excuse for my meddlesomeness is that important questions of natural sciencerespecting which neither of the combatants professes to speak as an expertare involved in the controversy and i think it is desirable that the public should know what it is that natural science really has to say on these topics to the best belief of one who has been a diligent student of natural science for the last forty years  the original prolegomenes de lhistoire des religions has not come in my way but i have read the translation of m revilles work published in england under the auspices of professor max muller with very great interest it puts more fairly and clearly than any book previously known to me the view which a man of strong religious feelings but at the same time possessing the information and the reasoning power which enable him to estimate the strength of scientific methods of inquiry and the weight of scientific truth may be expected to take of the relation between science and religion  in the chapter on the primitive revelation the scientific worth of the account of the creation given in the book of genesis is estimated in terms which are as unquestionably respectful as in my judgment they are just and at the end of the chapter on primitive tradition m reville appraises the value of pentateuchal anthropology in a way which i should have thought sure of enlisting the assent of all competent judges even if it were extended to the whole of the cosmogony and biology of genesis     as however the original traditions of nations sprang up in an    epoch less remote than our own from the primitive life it is    indispensable to consult them to compare them and to associate    them with other sources of information which are available    from this point of view the traditions recorded in genesis    possess in addition to their own peculiar charm a value of the    highest order but we cannot ultimately see in them more than a    venerable fragment welldeserving attention of the great    genesis of mankind   mr gladstone is of a different mind he dissents from m revilles views respecting the proper estimation of the pentateuchal traditions no less than he does from his interpretation of those homeric myths which have been the object of his own special study in the latter case mr gladstone tells m reville that he is wrong on his own authority to which in such a matter all will pay due respect in the former he affirms himself to be wholly destitute of that kind of knowledge which carries authority and his rebuke is administered in the name and by the authority of natural science  an air of magisterial gravity hangs about the following passage      but the question is not here of a lofty poem or a skilfully    constructed narrative it is whether natural science in the    patient exercise of its high calling to examine facts finds    that the works of god cry out against what we have fondly    believed to be his word and tell another tale or whether in    this nineteenth century of christian progress it substantially    echoes back the majestic sound which before it existed as a    pursuit went forth into all lands     first looking largely at the latter portion of the narrative    which describes the creation of living organisms and waiving    details on some of which as in v 24 the septuagint seems to    vary from the hebrew there is a grand fourfold division set    forth in an orderly succession of times as follows on the    fifth day     1 the waterpopulation    2 the airpopulation    and on the sixth day    3 the landpopulation of animals    4 the landpopulation consummated in man    now this same fourfold order is understood to have been so    affirmed in our time by natural science that it may be taken as    a demonstrated conclusion and established fact p 696   understood by whom i cannot bring myself to imagine that mr gladstone has made so solemn and authoritative a statement on a matter of this importance without due inquirywithout being able to found himself upon recognised scientific authority but i wish he had thought fit to name the source from whence he has derived his information as in that case i could have dealt with 143 his authority and i should have thereby escaped the appearance of making an attack on mr gladstone himself which is in every way distasteful to me  for i can meet the statement in the last paragraph of the above citation with nothing but a direct negative if i know anything at all about the results attained by the natural science of our time it is a demonstrated conclusion and established fact that the fourfold order given by mr gladstone is not that in which the evidence at our disposal tends to show that the water air and landpopulations of the globe have made their appearance  perhaps i may be told that mr gladstone does give his authoritythat he cites cuvier sir john herschel and dr whewell in support of his case if that has been mr gladstones intention in mentioning these eminent names i may remark that on this particular question the only relevant authority is that of cuvier but great as cuvier was it is to be remembered that as mr gladstone incidentally remarks he cannot now be called a recent authority in fact he has been dead more than half a century and the palaeontology of our day is related to that of his very much as the geography of the sixteenth century is related to that of the fourteenth since 1832 when cuvier died not only a new world but new worlds of ancient life have been discovered and those who have most faithfully carried on the work of the chief founder of palaeontology have done most to invalidate the essentially negative grounds of his speculative adherence to tradition  if mr gladstones latest information on these matters is derived from the famous discourse prefixed to the ossemens fossiles i can understand the position he has taken up if he has ever opened a respectable modern manual of palaeontology or geology i cannot for the facts which demolish his whole argument are of the commonest notoriety but before proceeding to consider the evidence for this assertion we must be clear about the meaning of the phraseology employed  i apprehend that when mr gladstone uses the term waterpopulation he means those animals which in genesis i 21 revised version are spoken of as the great sea monsters and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and i presume that it will be agreed that whales and porpoises sea fishes and the innumerable hosts of marine invertebrated animals are meant thereby so airpopulation must be the equivalent of fowl in verse 20 and every winged fowl after its kind verse 21 i suppose i may take it for granted that by fowl we have here to understand birdsat any rate primarily secondarily it may be that the bats and the extinct pterodactyles which were flying reptiles come under the same head but whether all insects are creeping things of the landpopulation or whether flying insects are to be included under the denomination of winged fowl is a point for the decision of hebrew exegetes lastly i suppose i may assume that landpopulation signifies the cattle and the beasts of the earth and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth in verses 25 and 26 presumably it comprehends all kinds of terrestrial animals vertebrate and invertebrate except such as may be comprised under the head of the airpopulation  now what i want to make clear is this that if the terms waterpopulation airpopulation and landpopulation are understood in the senses here defined natural science has nothing to say in favour of the proposition that they succeeded one another in the order given by mr gladstone but that on the contrary all the evidence we possess goes to prove that they did not whence it will follow that if mr gladstone has interpreted genesis rightly on which point i am most anxious to be understood to offer no opinion that interpretation is wholly irreconcilable with the conclusions at present accepted by the interpreters of naturewith everything that can be called a demonstrated conclusion and established fact of natural science and be it observed that i am not here dealing with a question of speculation but with a question of fact  either the geological record is sufficiently complete to afford us a means of determining the order in which animals have made their appearance on the globe or it is not if it is the determination of that order is little more than a mere matter of observation if it is not then natural science neither affirms nor refutes the fourfold order but is simply silent  the series of the fossiliferous deposits which contain the remains of the animals which have lived on the earth in past ages of its history and which can alone afford the evidence required by natural science of the order of appearance of their different species may be grouped in the manner shown in the lefthand column of the following table the oldest being at the bottom       formations          first known appearance of      quaternary      pliocene      miocene      eocene             vertebrate airpopulation bats      cretaceous      jurassic           vertebrate airpopulation birds and                          pterodactyles      triassic      upper palaeozoic      middle palaeozoic  vertebrate landpopulation amphibia                          reptilia       lower palaeozoic        silurian         vertebrate waterpopulation fishes                          invertebrate air and land                          population flying insects and scorpions        cambrian         invertebrate waterpopulation much                          earlier if eozoon is animal  in the righthand column i have noted the group of strata in which according to our present information the land air and water populations respectively appear for the first time and in consequence of the ambiguity about the meaning of fowl i have separately indicated the first appearance of bats birds flying reptiles and flying insects it will be observed that if fowl means only bird or at most flying vertebrate then the first certain evidence of the latter in the jurassic epoch is posterior to the first appearance of truly terrestrial amphibia and possibly of true reptiles in the carboniferous epoch middle palaeozoic by a prodigious interval of time  the waterpopulation of vertebrated animals first appears in the upper silurian 2 therefore if we found ourselves on vertebrated animals and take fowl to mean birds only or at most flying vertebrates natural science says that the order of succession was water land and airpopulation and notas mr gladstone founding himself on genesis sayswater air landpopulation if a chronicler of greece affirmed that the age of alexander preceded that of pericles and immediately succeeded that of the trojan war mr gladstone would hardly say that this order is understood to have been so affirmed by historical science that it may be taken as a demonstrated conclusion and established fact yet natural science affirms his fourfold order to exactly the same extentneither more nor less  suppose however that fowl is to be taken to include flying insects in that case the first appearance of an airpopulation must be shifted back for long ages recent discovery having shown that they occur in rocks of silurian age hence there might still have been hope for the fourfold order were it not that the fates unkindly determined that scorpionscreeping things that creep on the earth par excellenceturned up in silurian strata nearly at the same time so that if the word in the original hebrew translated fowl should really after all mean cockroachand i have great faith in the elasticity of that tongue in the hands of biblical exegetesthe order primarily suggested by the existing evidence       2 land and airpopulation      1 waterpopulation  and mr gladstones order       3 landpopulation      2 airpopulation      1 waterpopulation  can by no means be made to coincide as a matter of fact then the statement so confidently put forward turns out to be devoid of foundation and in direct contradiction of the evidence at present at our disposal 3  if stepping beyond that which may be learned from the facts of the successive appearance of the forms of animal life upon the surface of the globe in so far as they are yet made known to us by natural science we apply our reasoning faculties to the task of finding out what those observed facts mean the present conclusions of the interpreters of nature appear to be no less directly in conflict with those of the latest interpreter of genesis  mr gladstone appears to admit that there is some truth in the doctrine of evolution and indeed places it under very high patronage       i contend that evolution in its highest form has not been a      thing heretofore unknown to history to philosophy or to      theology i contend that it was before the mind of saint paul      when he taught that in the fulness of time god sent forth his      son and of eusebius when he wrote the preparation for the      gospel and of augustine when he composed the city of god      p 706  has any one ever disputed the contention thus solemnly enunciated that the doctrine of evolution was not invented the day before yesterday has any one ever dreamed of claiming it as a modern innovation is there any one so ignorant of the history of philosophy as to be unaware that it is one of the forms in which speculation embodied itself long before the time either of the bishop of hippo or of the apostle to the gentiles is mr gladstone of all people in the world disposed to ignore the founders of greek philosophy to say nothing of indian sages to whom evolution was a familiar notion ages before paul of tarsus was born but it is ungrateful to cavil at even the most oblique admission of the possible value of one of those affirmations of natural science which really may be said to be a demonstrated conclusion and established fact i note it with pleasure if only for the purpose of introducing the observation that if there is any truth whatever in the doctrine of evolution as applied to animals mr gladstones gloss on genesis in the following passage is hardly happy     god created    a the waterpopulation    b the airpopulation     and they receive his benediction v 2023     6 pursuing this regular progression from the lower to the    higher from the simple to the complex the text now gives us    the work of the sixth day which supplies the landpopulation    air and water having been already supplied pp 695 696  the gloss to which i refer is the assumption that the airpopulation forms a term in the order of progression from lower to higher from simple to complexthe place of which lies between the waterpopulation below and the landpopulation aboveand i speak of it as a gloss because the pentateuchal writer is nowise responsible for it  but it is not true that the airpopulation as a whole is lower or less complex than the landpopulation on the contrary every beginner in the study of animal morphology is aware that the organisation of a bat of a bird or of a pterodactyle presupposes that of a terrestrial quadruped and that it is intelligible only as an extreme modification of the organisation of a terrestrial mammal or reptile in the same way winged insects if they are to be counted among the airpopulation presuppose insects which were wingless and therefore as creeping things were part of the landpopulation thus theory is as much opposed as observation to the admission that natural science endorses the succession of animal life which mr gladstone finds in genesis on the contrary a good many representatives of natural science would be prepared to say on theoretical grounds alone that it is incredible that the airpopulation should have appeared before the landpopulationand that if this assertion is to be found in genesis it merely demonstrates the scientific worthlessness of the story of which it forms a part  indeed we may go further it is not even admissible to say that the waterpopulation as a whole appeared before the air and the landpopulations according to the authorised version genesis especially mentions among the animals created on the fifth day great whales in place of which the revised version reads great sea monsters far be it from me to give an opinion which rendering is right or whether either is right all i desire to remark is that if whales and porpoises dugongs and manatees are to be regarded as members of the waterpopulation and if they are not what animals can claim the designation then that much of the waterpopulation has as certainly originated later than the landpopulation as bats and birds have for i am not aware that any competent judge would hesitate to admit that the organisation of these animals shows the most obvious signs of their descent from terrestrial quadrupeds  a similar criticism applies to mr gladstones assumption that as the fourth act of that orderly succession of times enunciated in genesis the landpopulation consummated in man  if this means simply that man is the final term in the evolutional series of which he forms a part i do not suppose that any objection will be raised to that statement on the part of students of natural science but if the pentateuchal author goes further than this and intends to say that which is ascribed to him by mr gladstone i think natural science will have to enter a caveat it is not by any means certain that mani mean the species homo sapiens of zoological terminologyhas consummated the landpopulation in the sense of appearing at a later period of time than any other let me make my meaning clear by an example from a morphological point of view our beautiful and useful contemporaryi might almost call him colleaguethe horse equus caballus is the last term of the evolutional series to which he belongs just as homo sapiens is the last term of the series of which he is a member if i want to know whether the species equus caballus made its appearance on the surface of the globe before or after homo sapiens deduction from known laws does not help me there is no reason that i know of why one should have appeared sooner or later than the other if i turn to observation i find abundant remains of equus caballus in quaternary strata perhaps a little earlier the existence of homo sapiens in the quaternary epoch is also certain evidence has been adduced in favour of mans existence in the pliocene or even in the miocene epoch it does not satisfy me but i have no reason to doubt that the fact may be so nevertheless indeed i think it is quite possible that further research will show that homo sapiens existed not only before equus caballus but before many other of the existing forms of animal life so that if all the species of animals have been separately created man in this case would by no means be the consummation of the landpopulation  i am raising no objection to the position of the fourth term in mr gladstones orderon the facts as they stand it is quite open to any one to hold as a pious opinion that the fabrication of man was the acme and final achievement of the process of peopling the globe but it must not be said that natural science counts this opinion among her demonstrated conclusions and established facts for there would be just as much or as little reason for ranging the contrary opinion among them  it may seem superfluous to add to the evidence that mr gladstone has been utterly misled in supposing that his interpretation of genesis receives any support from natural science but it is as well to do ones work thoroughly while one is about it and i think it may be advisable to point out that the facts as they are at present known not only refute mr gladstones interpretation of genesis in detail but are opposed to the central idea on which it appears to be based  there must be some position from which the reconcilers of science and genesis will not retreat some central idea the maintenance of which is vital and its refutation fatal even if they now allow that the words the evening and the morning have not the least reference to a natural day but mean a period of any number of millions of years that may be necessary even if they are driven to admit that the word creation which so many millions of pious jews and christians have held and still hold to mean a sudden act of the deity signifies a process of gradual evolution of one species from another extending through immeasurable time even if they are willing to grant that the asserted coincidence of the order of nature with the fourfold order ascribed to genesis is an obvious error instead of an established truth they are surely prepared to make a last stand upon the conception which underlies the whole and which constitutes the essence of mr gladstones fourfold division set forth in an orderly succession of times it is that the animal species which compose the waterpopulation the airpopulation and the landpopulation respectively originated during three distinct and successive periods of time and only during those periods of time  this statement appears to me to be the interpretation of genesis which mr gladstone supports reduced to its simplest expression period of time is substituted for day originated is substituted for created and any order required for that adopted by mr gladstone it is necessary to make this proviso for if day may mean a few million years and creation may mean evolution then it is obvious that the order 1 waterpopulation 2 airpopulation 3 landpopulation may also mean 1 waterpopulation 2 landpopulation 3 airpopulation and it would be unkind to bind down the reconcilers to this detail when one has parted with so many others to oblige them  but even this sublimated essence of the pentateuchal doctrine if it be such remains as discordant with natural science as ever  it is not true that the species composing any one of the three populations originated during any one of three successive periods of time and not at any other of these  undoubtedly it is in the highest degree probable that animal life appeared first under aquatic conditions that terrestrial forms appeared later and flying animals only after land animals but it is at the same time testified by all the evidence we possess that the great majority if not the whole of the primordial species of each division have long since died out and have been replaced by a vast succession of new forms hundreds of thousands of animal species as distinct as those which now compose our water land and airpopulations have come into existence and died out again throughout the aeons of geological time which separate us from the lower palaeozoic epoch when as i have pointed out our present evidence of the existence of such distinct populations commences if the species of animals have all been separately created then it follows that hundreds of thousands of acts of creative energy have occurred at intervals throughout the whole time recorded by the fossiliferous rocks and during the greater part of that time the creation of the members of the water land and airpopulations must have gone on contemporaneously  if we represent the water land and airpopulations by a b and c respectively and take vertical succession on the page to indicate order in time then the following schemes will roughly shadow forth the contrast i have been endeavouring to explain       genesis as interpreted by      nature as interpreted by           mr gladstone                 natural science             b b b                         c1 a3 b2                c c c                         c  a2 b1                a a a                         b  a1 b                                              a  a  a  so far as i can see there is only one resource left for those modern representatives of sisyphus the reconcilers of genesis with science and it has the advantage of being founded on a perfectly legitimate appeal to our ignorance it has been seen that on any interpretation of the terms waterpopulation and landpopulation it must be admitted that invertebrate representatives of these populations existed during the lower palaeozoic epoch no evolutionist can hesitate to admit that other land animals and possibly vertebrates among them may have existed during that time of the history of which we know so little and further that scorpions are animals of such high organisation that it is highly probable their existence indicates that of a long antecedent landpopulation of a similar character  then since the landpopulation is said not to have been created until the sixth day it necessarily follows that the evidence of the order in which animals appeared must be sought in the record of those older palaeozoic times in which only traces of the waterpopulation have as yet been discovered  therefore if any one chooses to say that the creative work took place in the cambrian or laurentian epoch in exactly that manner which mr gladstone does and natural science does not affirm natural science is not in a position to disprove the accuracy of the statement only one cannot have ones cake and eat it too and such safety from the contradiction of science means the forfeiture of her support  whether the account of the work of the first second and third days in genesis would be confirmed by the demonstration of the truth of the nebular hypothesis whether it is corroborated by what is known of the nature and probable relative antiquity of the heavenly bodies whether if the hebrew word translated firmament in the authorised version really means expanse the assertion that the waters are partly under this expanse and partly above it would be any more confirmed by the ascertained facts of physical geography and meteorology than it was before whether the creation of the whole vegetable world and especially of grass herb yielding seed after its kind and tree bearing fruit before any kind of animal is affirmed by the apparently plain teaching of botanical palaeontology that grasses and fruittrees originated long subsequently to animals all these are questions which if i mistake not would be answered decisively in the negative by those who are specially conversant with the sciences involved and it must be recollected that the issue raised by mr gladstone is not whether by some effort of ingenuity the pentateuchal story can be shown to be not disprovable by scientific knowledge but whether it is supported thereby      there is nothing then in the criticisms of dr reville but     what rather tends to confirm than to impair the oldfashioned     belief that there is a revelation in the book of genesis     p 694  the form into which mr gladstone has thought fit to throw this opinion leaves me in doubt as to its substance i do not understand how a hostile criticism can under any circumstances tend to confirm that which it attacks if however mr gladstone merely means to express his personal impression as one wholly destitute of that kind of knowledge which carries authority that he has destroyed the value of these criticisms i have neither the wish nor the right to attempt to disturb his faith on the other hand i may be permitted to state my own conviction that so far as natural science is involved m revilles observations retain the exact value they possessed before mr gladstone attacked them   trusting that i have now said enough to secure the author of a wise and moderate disquisition upon a topic which seems fated to stir unwisdom and fanaticism to their depths a fuller measure of justice than has hitherto been accorded to him i retire from my selfappointed championship with the hope that i shall not hereafter be called upon by m reville to apologise for damage done to his strong case by imperfect or impulsive advocacy but perhaps i may be permitted to add a word or two on my own account in reference to the great question of the relations between science and religion since it is one about which i have thought a good deal ever since i have been able to think at all and about which i have ventured to express my views publicly more than once in the course of the last thirty years  the antagonism between science and religion about which we hear so much appears to me to be purely factitiousfabricated on the one hand by shortsighted religious people who confound a certain branch of science theology with religion and on the other by equally shortsighted scientific people who forget that science takes for its province only that which is susceptible of clear intellectual comprehension and that outside the boundaries of that province they must be content with imagination with hope and with ignorance  it seems to me that the moral and intellectual life of the civilised nations of europe is the product of that interaction sometimes in the way of antagonism sometimes in that of profitable interchange of the semitic and the aryan races which commenced with the dawn of history when greek and phoenician came in contact and has been continued by carthaginian and roman by jew and gentile down to the present day our art except perhaps music and our science are the contributions of the aryan but the essence of our religion is derived from the semite in the eighth century bc in the heart of a world of idolatrous polytheists the hebrew prophets put forth a conception of religion which appears to me to be as wonderful an inspiration of genius as the art of pheidias or the science of aristotle  and what doth the lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god  if any socalled religion takes away from this great saying of micah i think it wantonly mutilates while if it adds thereto i think it obscures the perfect ideal of religion  but what extent of knowledge what acuteness of scientific criticism can touch this if any one possessed of knowledge or acuteness could be absurd enough to make the attempt will the progress of research prove that justice is worthless and mercy hateful will it ever soften the bitter contrast between our actions and our aspirations or show us the bounds of the universe and bid us say go to now we comprehend the infinite a faculty of wrath lay in those ancient israelites and surely the prophets staff would have made swift acquaintance with the head of the scholar who had asked micah whether peradventure the lord further required of him an implicit belief in the accuracy of the cosmogony of genesis  what we are usually pleased to call religion nowadays is for the most part hellenised judaism and not unfrequently the hellenic element carries with it a mighty remnant of oldworld paganism and a great infusion of the worst and weakest products of greek scientific speculation while fragments of persian and babylonian or rather accadian mythology burden the judaic contribution to the common stock  the antagonism of science is not to religion but to the heathen survivals and the bad philosophy under which religion herself is often wellnigh crushed and for my part i trust that this antagonism will never cease but that to the end of time true science will continue to fulfil one of her most beneficent functions that of relieving men from the burden of false science which is imposed upon them in the name of religion  this is the work that m reville and men such as he are doing for us this is the work which his opponents are endeavouring consciously or unconsciously to hinder     footnotes  footnote 1 the nineteenth century  footnote 2 earlier if more recent announcements are correct  footnote 3 it may be objected that i have not put the case fairly inasmuch as the solitary insects wing which was discovered twelve months ago in silurian rocks and which is at present the sole evidence of insects older than the devonian epoch came from strata of middle silurian age and is therefore older than the scorpions which within the last two years have been found in upper silurian strata in sweden britain and the united states but no one who comprehends the nature of the evidence afforded by fossil remains would venture to say that the nondiscovery of scorpions in the middle silurian strata up to this time affords any more ground for supposing that they did not exist than the nondiscovery of flying insects in the upper silurian strata up to this time throws any doubt on the certainty that they existed which is derived from the occurrence of the wing in the middle silurian in fact i have stretched a point in admitting that these fossils afford a colourable pretext for the assumption that the land and airpopulation were of contemporaneous origin
