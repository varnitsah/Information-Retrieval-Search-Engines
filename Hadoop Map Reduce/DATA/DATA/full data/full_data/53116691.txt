53116691	unknown to history  a story of the captivity of mary of scotland   by  charlotte m yonge      preface   in p 58 of vol ii of the second edition of miss stricklands life of mary queen of scots or p 100 vol v of burtons history of scotland will be found the report on which this tale is founded  if circumstances regarding the queens captivity and babingtons plot have been found to be omitted as well as many interesting personages in the suite of the captive queen it must be remembered that the art of the storyteller makes it needful to curtail some of the incidents which would render the narrative too complicated to be interesting to those who wish more for a view of noted characters in remarkable situations than for a minute and accurate sifting of facts and evidence

    chapter i  the little waif   on a spring day in the year 1568 mistress talbot sat in her lodging at hull an upper chamber with a large latticed window glazed with the circle and diamond leading perpetuated in dutch pictures and opening on a carved balcony whence had she been so minded she could have shaken hands with her opposite neighbour  there was a richly carved mantelpiece with a seacoal fire burning in it for though it was may the sea winds blew cold and there was a fishy odour about the town such as it was well to counteract  the floor was of slippery polished oak the walls hung with leather gilded in some places and depending from cornices whose ornaments proved to an initiated eye that this had once been the refectory of a small priory or cell broken up at the reformation  of furniture there was not much only an open cupboard displaying two silver cups and tankards a saucepan of the same metal a few tall slender venetian glasses a little pewter and some rare shells  a few highbacked chairs were ranged against the wall there was a tall armory ie a linenpress of dark oak guarded on each side by the twisted weapons of the sea unicorn and in the middle of the room stood a large solidlooking table adorned with a brown earthenware beaupot containing a stiff posy of roses southernwood gillyflowers pinks and pansies of small dimensions  on hooks against the wall hung a pair of spurs a shield a breastplate and other pieces of armour with an open helmet bearing the dog the wellknown crest of the talbots of the shrewsbury line  on the polished floor near the window were a childs cart a little boat some whelks and limpets  their owner a stout boy of three years old in a tight borderless round cap and homespun madderdyed frock lay fast asleep in a big wooden cradle scarcely large enough however to contain him as he lay curled up sucking his thumb and hugging to his breast the soft fragment of a seabirds downy breast if he stirred his mothers foot was on the rocker as she sat spinning but her spindle danced languidly on the floor as if feeble was her hand and silly her thread while she listened anxiously for every sound in the street below  she wore a dark blue dress with a small lace ruff opening in front deep cuffs to match and a white apron likewise edged with lace and a coif bent down in the centre over a sweet countenance matronly though youthful and now full of wistful expectancy not untinged with anxiety and sorrow  susan hardwicke was a distant kinswoman of the famous bess of hardwicke and had formed one of the little court of gentlewomen with whom great ladies were wont to surround themselves  there she met richard talbot the second son of a relative of the earl of shrewsbury a young man who with the indifference of those days to service by land or sea had been at one time a gentleman pensioner of queen mary at another had sailed under some of the great mariners of the western main  there he had acquired substance enough to make the offer of his hand to the dowerless susan no great imprudence and as neither could be a subject for ambitious plans no obstacle was raised to their wedding  he took his wife home to his old fathers house in the precincts of sheffield park where she was kindly welcomed but wealth did not so abound in the family but that when opportunity offered he was thankful to accept the command of the mastiff a vessel commissioned by queen elizabeth but built manned and maintained at the expense of the earl of shrewsbury  it formed part of a small squadron which was cruising on the eastern coast to watch over the intercourse between france and scotland whether in the interest of the imprisoned mary or of the lords of the congregation  he had obtained lodgings for mistress susan at hull so that he might be with her when he put into harbour and she was expecting him for the first time since the loss of their second child a daughter whom he had scarcely seen during her little life of a few months  moreover there had been a sharp storm a few days previously and experience had not hardened her to the anxieties of a sailors wife she had been down once already to the quay and learnt all that the old sailors could tell her of chances and conjectures and when her boy began to fret from hunger and weariness she had left her servingman gervas to watch for further tidings  yet so does one trouble drive out another that whereas she had a few days ago dreaded the sorrow of his return she would now have given worlds to hear his step  hark what is that in the street  oh folly  if the mastiff were in would not gervas have long ago brought her the tidings  should she look over the balcony only to be disappointed again  ah she had been prudent for the sounds were dying away  nay there was a foot at the door  gervas with ill news  no no it bounded as never did gervass step  it was coming up  she started from the chair quivering with eagerness as the door opened and in hurried her suntanned sailor  she was in his arms in a trance of joy  that was all she knew for a moment and then it was as if something else were given back to her no it was not a dream  it was substance  in her arms was a little swaddled baby in her ears its feeble wail mingled with the glad shout of little humfrey as he scrambled from the cradle to be uplifted in his fathers arms  what is this she asked gazing at the infant between terror and tenderness as its weak cry and exhausted state forcibly recalled the last hours of her own child  it is the only thing we could save from a wreck off the spurn said her husband  scottish as i take it  the rogues seem to have taken to their boats leaving behind them a poor woman and her child  i trust they met their deserts and were swamped  we saw the fluttering of her coats as we made for the humber and i sent goatley and jaques in the boat to see if anything lived  the poor wench was gone before they could lift her up but the little one cried lustily though it has waxen weaker since  we had no milk on board and could only give it bits of soft bread soaked in beer and i misdoubt me whether it did not all run out at the corners of its mouth  this was interspersed with little humfreys eager outcries that little sister was come again and mrs talbot the tears running down her cheeks hastened to summon her one womanservant colet to bring the porringer of milk  captain talbot had only hurried ashore to bring the infant and show himself to his wife  he was forced instantly to return to the wharf but he promised to come back as soon as he should have taken order for his men and for the mastiff which had suffered considerably in the storm and would need to be refitted  colet hastily put a manchet of fresh bread a pasty and a stoup of wine into a basket and sent it by her husband gervas after their master and then eagerly assisted her mistress in coaxing the infant to swallow food and in removing the soaked swaddling clothes which the captain and his crew had not dared to meddle with  when captain talbot returned as the rays of the setting sun glanced high on the roofs and chimneys little humfrey stood peeping through the tracery of the balcony watching for him and shrieking with joy at the first glimpse of the seabirds feather in his cap  the spotless homespun cloth and the trenchers were laid for supper a festive capon was prepared by the choicest skill of mistress susan and the little shipwrecked stranger lay fast asleep in the cradle  all was well with it now mrs talbot said  nothing had ailed it but cold and hunger and when it had been fed warmed and dressed it had fallen sweetly asleep in her arms appeasing her heartache for her own little sue while humfrey fully believed that father had brought his little sister back again  the child was in truth a girl apparently three or four months old she had been rolled up in mrs talbots babys clothes and her own long swaddling bands hung over the back of a chair where they had been dried before the fire  they were of the finest woollen below and cambric above and the outermost were edged with lace whose quality mrs talbot estimated very highly  see she added what we found within  a popish relic is it not colet and mistress gale were for making away with it at once but it seemed to me that it was a token whereby the poor babes friends may know her again if she have any kindred not lost at sea  the token was a small gold cross of peculiar workmanship with a crystal in the middle through which might be seen some mysterious object neither husband nor wife could make out but which they agreed must be carefully preserved for the identification of their little waif  mrs talbot also produced a strip of writing which she had found sewn to the inmost band wrapped round the little body but it had no superscription and she believed it to be either french latin or high dutch for she could make nothing of it  indeed the good ladys education had only included reading writing needlework and cookery and she knew no language but her own  her husband had been taught latin but his acquaintance with modern tongues was of the nautical order and entirely oral and vernacular  however it enabled him to aver that the letterif such it werewas neither scottish french spanish nor high or low dutch  he looked at it in all directions and shook his head over it  who can read it for us asked mrs talbot  shall we ask master heatherthwayte he is a scholar and he said he would look in to see how you fared  at suppertime i trow said richard rather grimly the smell of thy stew will bring him down in good time  nay dear sir i thought you would be fain to see the good man and he lives but poorly in his garret  scarce while he hath good wives like thee to boil his pot for him said richard smiling  tell me hath he heard aught of this gear thou hast not laid this scroll before him  no colet brought it to me only now having found it when washing the swaddlingbands stitched into one of them  then hark thee good wife not one word to him of the writing  might he not interpret it  not he  i must know more about it ere i let it pass forth from mine hands or any strange eye fall upon it ha in good time  i hear his step on the stair  the captain hastily rolled up the scroll and put it into his pouch while mistress susan felt as if she had made a mistake in her hospitality yet almost as if her husband were unjust towards the good man who had been such a comfort to her in her sorrow but there was no lack of cordiality or courtesy in richards manner when after a short quick knock there entered a figure in hat cassock gown and bands with a pleasant though grave countenance the complexion showing that it had been tanned and sunburnt in early youth although it wore later traces of a sedentary student life and it might be of less genial living than had nourished the upgrowth of that sturdilybuilt frame  master joseph heatherthwayte was the greatly underpaid curate of a small parish on the outskirts of hull  he contrived to live on some pounds10 per annum in the attic of the house where the talbots lodgedand not only to live but to be full of charitable deeds mostly at the expense of his own appetite  the square cut of his bands and the uncompromising roundness of the hat which he doffed on his entrance marked him as inclined to the puritan party which being that of apparent progress attracted most of the ardent spirits of the time  captain talbots inclinations did not lie that way but he respected and liked his fellowlodger and his vexation had been merely the momentary disinclination of a man to be interrupted especially on his first evening at home  he responded heartily to master heatherthwaytes warm pressure of the hand and piously expressed congratulation on his safety mixed with condolence on the grief that had befallen him  and you have been a good friend to my poor wife in her sorrow said richard for the which i thank you heartily sir  truly sir i could have been her scholar with such edifying resignation did she submit to the dispensation returned the clergyman uttering these long words in a broad northern accent which had nothing incongruous in it to richards ears and taking advantage of the ladys absence on hospitable tasks intent to speak in her praise  little humfrey on his fathers knee comprehending that they were speaking of the recent sorrow put in his piece of information that father had brought little sister back from the sea  ah child said master heatherthwayte in the ponderous tone of one unused to children thou hast yet to learn the words of the holy david i shall go to him but he shall not return to me  bring not that thought forward master heatherthwayte said richard i am well pleased that my poor wife and this little lad can take the poor little one as a solace sent them by god as she assuredly is  mean you then to adopt her into your family asked the minister  we know not if she hath any kin said richard and at that moment susan entered followed by the man and maid each bearing a portion of the meal which was consumed by the captain and the clergyman as thoroughly hungry men eat and there was silence till the capons bones were bare and two large tankards had been filled with xeres sack captured in a spanish ship the only good thing that ever came from spain quoth the sailor  then he began to tell how he had weathered the storm on the berwickshire coast but he was interrupted by another knock followed by the entrance of a small pale spare man with the lightest possible hair very short and almost invisible eyebrows he had a round ruff round his neck and a black scholarly gown belted round his waist with a girdle in which he carried writing tools  ha cuthbert langston art thou there said the captain rising thou art kindly welcome  sit down and crush a cup of sack with master heatherthwayte and me  thanks cousin returned the visitor i heard that the mastiff was come in and i came to see whether all was well  it was kindly done lad said richard while the others did their part of the welcome though scarcely so willingly  cuthbert langston was a distant relation on the mothers side of richard a young scholar who after his education at oxford had gone abroad with a noblemans son as his pupil and on his return instead of taking holy orders as was expected had obtained employment in a merchants countinghouse at hull for which his knowledge of languages eminently fitted him  though he possessed none of the noble blood of the talbots the employment was thought by mistress susan somewhat derogatory to the family dignity and there was a strong suspicion both in her mind and that of master heatherthwayte that his change of purpose was due to the change of religion in england although he was a perfectly regular churchgoer  captain talbot however laughed at all this and though he had not much in common with his kinsman always treated him in a cousinly fashion  he too had heard a rumour of the foundling and made inquiry for it upon which richard told his story in greater detail and his wife asked what the poor mother was like  i saw her not he answered but goatley thought the poor woman to whom she was bound more like to be nurse than mother judging by her years and her garments  the mother may have been washed off before said susan lifting the little one from the cradle and hushing it weep not poor babe thou hast found a mother here  saw you no sign of the crew asked master heatherthwayte  none at all  the vessel i knew of old as the brig bride of dunbar one of the craft that ply between dunbar and the french ports  and how think you  were none like to be saved  i mean to ride along the coast tomorrow to see whether aught can be heard of them but even if their boats could live in such a sea they would have evil hap among the wreckers if they came ashore  i would not desire to be a shipwrecked man in these parts and if i had a scottish or a french tongue in my head so much the worse for me  ah master heatherthwayte said susan should not a man give up the sea when he is a husband and father  tush dame  with gods blessing the good ship mastiff will ride out many another such gale  tell thy mother little numpy that an english sailor is worth a dozen french or scottish lubbers  sir said master heatherthwayte the pious trust of the former part of your discourse is contradicted by the boast of the latter end  nay sir minister what doth a sailor put his trust in but his god foremost and then his good ship and his brave men  it should be observed that all the three men wore their hats and each made a reverent gesture of touching them  the clergyman seemed satisfied by the answer and presently added that it would be well if master and mistress talbot meant to adopt the child that she should be baptized  how now said richard we are not so near any coast of turks or infidels that we should deem her sprung of heathen folk  assuredly not said cuthbert langston whose quick lightcoloured eyes had spied the reliquary in mistress susans workbasket if this belongs to her  by your leave kinswoman and he lifted it in his hand with evident veneration and began examining it  it is babylonish gold an accursed thing exclaimed master heatherthwayte  beware master talbot and cast it from thee  nay said richard that shall i not do  it may lead to the discovery of the childs kindred  why my master what harm think you it will do to us in my dames casket  or what right have we to make away with the little ones property  his common sense was equally far removed from the horror of the one visitor as from the reverence of the other and so it pleased neither master langston was the first to speak observing that the relic made it evident that the child must have been baptized  a popish baptism said master heatherthwayte with chrism and taper and words and gestures to destroy the pure simplicity of the sacrament  controversy here seemed to be setting in and the infant cause of it here setting up a cry susan escaped under pretext of putting humfrey to bed in the next room and carried off both the little ones  the conversation then fell upon the voyage and the captain described the impregnable aspect of the castle of dumbarton which was held for queen mary by her faithful partisan lord flemyng  on this cuthbert langston asked whether he had heard any tidings of the imprisoned queen and he answered that it was reported at leith that she had wellnigh escaped from lochleven in the disguise of a lavender or washerwoman  she was actually in the boat and about to cross the lake when a rude oarsman attempted to pull aside her muffler and the whiteness of the hand she raised in selfprotection betrayed her so that she was carried back  if she had reached dumbarton he said she might have mocked at the lords of the congregation  nay she might have been in that very brig whose wreck i beheld  and well would it have been for scotland and england had it been the will of heaven that so it should fall out observed the puritan  or it may be said the merchant that the poor ladys escape was frustrated by providence that she might be saved from the rocks of the spurn  the poor lady truly  say rather the murtheress quoth heatherthwayte  say rather the victim and scapegoat of other mens plots protested langston  come come sirs says talbot well have no high words here on what heaven only knoweth  poor lady she is in all sooth if sackless poorer still if guilty so i know not what matter there is for falling out about  in any sort i will not have it at my table he spoke with the authority of the captain of a ship and the two visitors scarce knowing it submitted to his decision of manner but the harmony of the evening seemed ended  cuthbert langston soon rose to bid goodnight first asking his cousin at what hour he proposed to set forth for the spurn to which richard briefly replied that it depended on what had to be done as to the repairs of the ship  the clergyman tarried behind him to say master talbot i marvel that so godly a man as you have ever been should be willing to harbour one so popishly affected and whom many suspect of being a seminary priest  master heatherthwayte returned the captain my kinsman is my kinsman and my house is my house  no offence sir but i brook not meddling  the clergyman protested that no offence was intended only caution and betook himself to his own bare chamber high above  no sooner was he gone than captain talbot again became absorbed in the endeavour to spell out the mystery of the scroll with his elbows on the table and his hands over his ears nor did he look up till he was touched by his wife when he uttered an impatient demand what she wanted now  she had the little waif in her arms undressed and with only a woollen coverlet loosely wrapped round her and without speaking she pointed to the little shoulderblades where two marks had been indelibly madeon one side the crowned monogram of the blessed virgin on the other a device like the labarum only that the upright was surmounted by a fleurdelis  richard talbot gave a sort of perplexed grunt of annoyance to acknowledge that he saw them  poor little maid how could they be so cruel  they have been branded with a hot iron said the lady  they that parted from her meant to know her again returned talbot  surely they are popish marks added mistress susan  look you here dame sue i know you for a discreet woman  keep this gear to yourself both the letter and the marks  who hath seen them  i doubt me whether even colet has seen this mark  that is well  keep all out of sight  many a man has been brought into trouble for a less matter swelled by prating tongues  have you made it out  not i  it may be only the childs horoscope or some old wifes charm that is here sewn up and these marks may be naught but some sailors freak but on the other hand they may be concerned with perilous matter so the less said the better  should they not be shown to my lord or to her graces council  im not going to run my head into trouble for making a coil about what may be naught  thats what befell honest mark walton  he thought he had seized matter of state and went up to master walsingham swelling like an indian turkeycock with his secret letters and behold they turned out to be a dutch fishwifes charm to bring the herrings  i can tell you he has rued the work he made about it ever since  on the other hand let it get abroad through yonder prating fellow heatherthwayte or any other that master richard talbot had in his house a child with i know not what popish tokens and a scroll in an unknown tongue and i should be had up in gyves for suspicion of treason or may be harbouring the prince of scotland himself when it is only some poor scottish archers babe  you would not have me part with the poor little one  am i a turk or a pagan  no  only hold thy peace as i shall hold mine until such time as i can meet some one whom i can trust to read this riddle  tell mewhat like is the child  wouldst guess it to be of gentle or of clownish blood if women can tell such things  of gentle blood assuredly cried the lady so that he smiled and said i might have known that so thou wouldst answer  nay but see her little hands and fingers and the mould of her dainty limbs  no scottish fisher clown was her father i dare be sworn  her skin is as fair and fine as my humfreys and moreover she has always been in hands that knew how a babe should be tended any woman can tell you that  and what like is she in your womans eyes  what complexion doth she promise  her hair what she has of it is dark her eyesbless themare of a deep blue or purple such as most babes have till they take their true tint  there is no guessing  humfreys eyes were once like to be brown now are they as blue as thine own  i understand all that said captain talbot smiling  if she have kindred they will know her better by the sign manual on her tender flesh than by her face  and who are they  who are they echoed the captain rolling up the scroll in despair here take it susan and keep it safe from all eyes  whatever it may be it may serve thereafter to prove her true name  and above all not a word or breath to heatherthwayte or any of thy gossips wear they coif or bands  ah sir that you will mistrust the good man  i said not i mistrust any one only that i will have no word of all this go forth  not one  thou heedest me wife  verily i do sir i will be mute     chapter ii  evil tidings   after giving orders for the repairs of the mastiff and the disposal of her crew master richard talbot purveyed himself of a horse at the hostel and set forth for spurn head to make inquiries along the coast respecting the wreck of the bride of dunbar and he was joined by cuthbert langston who said his house had had dealings with her owners and that he must ascertain the fate of her wares  his good lady remained in charge of the mysterious little waif over whom her tender heart yearned more and more while her little boy hovered about in serene contemplation of the treasure he thought he had recovered  to him the babe seemed really his little sister to his mother if she sometimes awakened pangs of keen regret yet she filled up much of the dreary void of the last few weeks  mrs talbot was a quiet reserved woman not prone to gadding abroad and she had made few acquaintances during her sojourn at hull but every creature she knew or might have known seemed to her to drop in that day and bring at least two friends to inspect the orphan of the wreck and demand all particulars  the little girl was clad in the swaddling garments of mrs talbots own children and the mysterious marks were suspected by no one far less the letter which susan for securitys sake had locked up in her nearly empty steelbound money casket  the opinions of the gossips varied some thinking the babe might belong to some of the queen of scotlands party fleeing to france others fathering her on the refugees from the persecutions in flanders a third party believing her a mere fishermans child and one lean lanternjawed old crone mistress rotherford observing take my word mrs talbot and keep her not with you  they that are cast up by the sea never bring good with them  the court of female inquiry was still sitting when a heavy tread was heard and colet announced a servingman from bridgefield had ridden post haste to speak with madam and the messenger booted and spurred with the mastiff badge on his sleeve and the hat he held in his hand followed closely  what news nathanael she asked as she responded to his greeting  ill enough news mistress was the answer  master richards ship be in they tell me  yes but he is rid out to make inquiry for a wreck said the lady is all well with my good fatherinlaw  he ails less in body than in mind so please you  being that master humfrey was thrown by blackfoot the beast being scared by a flash of lightning and never spoke again  master humfrey  ay mistress  pitched on his head against the south gatepost  i saw how it was with him when we took him up and he never so much as lifted an eyelid but died at the turn of the night  heaven rest his soul  heaven rest his soul echoed susan and the ladies around chimed in they had come for one excitement and here was another  there  see but what i said quoth mrs rotherford uplifting a skinny finger to emphasise that the poor little flotsome had already brought evil  nay said the portly wife of a merchant begging your pardon this may be a fat instead of a lean sorrow  leaves the poor gentleman heirs mrs talbot  oh no said susan with tears in her eyes  his wife died two years back and her chrisom babe with her  he loved her too well to turn his mind to wed again and now he is with her for aye  and she covered her face and sobbed regardless of the congratulations of the merchants wife and exclaiming oh the poor old lady  in sooth mistress said nathanael who had stood all this time as if he had by no means emptied his budget of ill news poor old madam fell down all of a heap on the floor and when the wenches lifted her they found she was stricken with the dead palsy and she has not spoken and theres no one knows what to do for the poor old squire is like one distraught sitting by her bed like an image on a monument with the tears flowing down his old cheeks  but says he to me get you to hull nat and take madams palfrey and a couple of sumpter beasts and bring my good daughter talbot back with you as fast as she and the babes may brook  i made bold to say and master richard your worship then he groaned somewhat and said if my sons ship be come in he must do as her graces service permits but meantime he must spare us his wife for she is sorely needed here  and he looked at the bed so as it would break your heart to see for since old nurse took hath been doited theres not been a wench about the house that can do a hands turn for a sick body  susan knew this was true for her motherinlaw had been one of those bustling managing housewives who prefer doing everything themselves to training others and she was appalled at the idea of the probable desolation and helplessness of the bereaved household  it was far too late to start that day even had her husband been at home for the horses sent for her had to rest  the visitors would fain have extracted some more particulars about the old squires age his kindred to the great earl and the amount of estate to which her husband had become heir  there were those among them who could not understand susans genuine grief and there were others whose consolations were no less distressing to one of her reserved character she made brief answer that the squire was threescore and fifteen years old his wife nigh about his age that her husband was now their only child that he was descended from a son of the great earl john killed at the bridge of chatillon that he held the estate of bridgefield in fief on tenure of military service to the head of his family  she did not know how much it was worth by the year but she must pray the good ladies to excuse her as she had many preparations to make  volunteers to assist her in packing her mails were made but she declined them all and rejoiced when left alone with colet to arrange for what would be probably her final departure from hull  it was a blow to find that she must part from her servantwoman who as well as her husband gervas was a native of hull  not only were they both unwilling to leave but the inland country was to their imagination a wild unexplored desert  indeed colet had only entered mrs talbots service to supply the place of a maid who bad sickened with fever and ague and had to be sent back to her native hallamshire  ere long mr heatherthwayte came down to offer his consolation and still more his advice that the little foundling should be at once baptizedconditionally if the lady preferred it  the reformed of imperfect theological training and as such joseph heatherthwayte must be classed were apt to view the ceremonial of the old baptismal form symbolical and beautiful as it was as almost destroying the efficacy of the rite  moreover there was a further impression that the church by which the child was baptized had a right to bring it up and thus the clergyman was urgent with the lady that she should seize this opportunity for the little ones baptism  not without my husbands consent and knowledge she said resolutely  master talbot is a good man but somewhat careless of sound doctrine as be the most of seafaring men  susan had been a little nettled by her husbands implied belief that she was influenced by the minister so there was double resolution as well as some offence in her reply that she knew her duty as a wife too well to consent to such a thing without him  as to his being careless he was a true and godfearing man and mr heatherthwayte should know better than to speak thus of him to his wife  mr heatherthwaytes real piety and goodness had made him a great comfort to susan in her lonely grief but he had not the delicate tact of gentle blood and had not known where to stop and as he stood half apologising and half exhorting she felt that her richard was quite right and that he could be both meddling and presuming he was exceedingly in the way of her packing too and she was at her wits end to get rid of him when suddenly humfrey managed to pinch his fingers in a box and set up such a yell as seconded by the frightened baby was more than any masculine ears could endure and drove master heatherthwayte to beat a retreat  mistress susan was well on in her work when her husband returned and as she expected was greatly overcome by the tidings of his brothers death  he closely questioned nathanael on every detail and could think of nothing but the happy days he had shared with his brother and of the grief of his parents  he approved of all that his wife had done and as the damage sustained by the mastiff could not be repaired under a month he had no doubt about leaving his crew in the charge of his lieutenant while he took his family home  so busy were both and so full of needful cares the one in giving up her lodging the other in leaving his men that it was impossible to inquire into the result of his researches for the captain was in that mood of suppressed grief and vehement haste in which irrelevant inquiry is perfectly unbearable  it was not till late in the evening that richard told his wife of his want of success in his investigations  he had found witnesses of the destruction of the ship but he did not give them full credit  the fellows say the ship drove on the rock and that they saw her boats go down with every soul on board and that they would not lie to an officer of her grace  heaven pardon me if i do them injustice in believing they would lie to him sooner than to any one else  they are rogues enough to take good care that no poor wretch should survive even if he did chance to come to land  then if there be no one to claim her we may bring up as our own the sweet babe whom heaven hath sent us  not so fast dame  thou wert wont to be more discreet  i said not so but for the nonce till i can come by the rights of that scroll theres no need to make a coil  let no one know of it or of the trinketthou hast them safe  laid up with the indian gold chain thy wedding gift dear sir  tis well  my motherah me he added catching himself up little like is she to ask questions poor soul  then susan diffidently told of master heatherthwaytes earnest wish to christen the child and what certainly biased her a good deal the suggestion that this would secure her to their own religion  there is something in that said richard specially after what cuthbert said as to the golden toy yonder  if times changed againwhich heaven forfendthat fellow might give us trouble about the matter  you doubt him then sir she asked  i relished not his ways on our ride today said richard  sure i am that he had some secret cause for being so curious about the wreck  i suspect him of some secret commerce with the queen of scots folk  yet you were on his side against mr heatherthwayte said susan  i would not have my kinsman browbeaten at mine own table by the selfconceited son of a dalesman even if he have got a round hat and geneva band  ah well one good thing is we shall leave both of them well behind us though i would it were for another cause  something in the remonstrance had however so worked on richard talbot that before morning be declared that hap what hap if he and his wife were to bring up the child she should be made a good protestant christian before they left the house and there should be no more ado about it  it was altogether illogical and untheological but master heatherthwayte was delighted when in the very early morning his devotions were interrupted and he was summoned by the captain himself to christen the child  richard and his wife were sponsors but the question of name had never occurred to any one  however in the pause of perplexity when the response lagged to name this child little humfrey a delighted spectator broke out again with little sis  and forthwith cicely if thou art not already baptized was uttered over the child and cicely became her name  it cost susan a pang as it had been that of her own little daughter but it was too late to object and she uttered no regret but took the child to her heart as sent instead of her who had been taken from her  master heatherthwayte bade them good speed and master langston stood at the door of his office and waved them a farewell both alike unconscious of the rejoicing with which they were left behind mistress talbot rode on the palfrey sent for her use with the little stranger slung to her neck for securitys sake  her boy rode a cockhorse before his father but a restingplace was provided for him on a sort of pannier on one of the sumpter beasts  what these animals could not carry of the household stuff was left in colets charge to be despatched by carriers and the travellers jogged slowly on through deep yorkshire lanes often halting to refresh the horses and supply the wants of the little children at homely wayside inns their entrance usually garnished with an archway formed of the jawbones of whales which often served for gateposts in that eastern part of yorkshire and thus they journeyed with frequent halts until they came to the derbyshire borders  bridgefield house stood on the top of a steep slope leading to the river dun with a high arched bridge and a mill below it  from the bridge proceeded one of the magnificent avenues of oaktrees which led up to the lordly lodge full four miles off right across sheffield park  the bridgefield estate had been a younger sons portion and its owners had always been regarded as gentlemen retainers of the head of their name the earl of shrewsbury  tudor jealousy had forbidden the marshalling of such a meine as the old feudal lords had loved to assemble and each generation of the bridgefield talbots had become more independent than the former one  the father had spent his younger days as esquire to the late earl but had since become a justice of the peace and took rank with the substantial landowners of the country humfrey his eldest son had been a gentleman pensioner of the queen till his marriage and richard though beginning his career as page to the present earls first wife had likewise entered the service of her majesty though still it was understood that the head of their name had a claim to their immediate service and had he been called to take up arms they would have been the first to follow his banner  indeed a pair of spurs was all the annual rent they paid for their estate which they held on this tenure as well as on paying the heriard horse on the death of the head of the family and other contributions to their lords splendour when he knighted his son or married his daughter  in fact they stood on the borderland of that feudal retainership which was being rapidly extinguished  the estate carved out of the great sheffield property was sufficient to maintain the owner in the dignities of an english gentleman and to portion off the daughters provided that the superfluous sons shifted for themselves as richard had hitherto done  the house had been ruined in the time of the wars of the roses and rebuilt in the later fashion with a friendlylooking front containing two large windows and a porch projecting between them  the hall reached to the top of the house and had a waggon ceiling with mastiffs alternating with roses on portcullises at the intersections of the timbers  this was the family sitting and dining room and had a huge chimney never devoid of a wood fire  one end had a butteryhatch communicating with the kitchen and offices at the other was a small room sacred to the master of the house niched under the broad staircase that led to the upper rooms which opened on a gallery running round three sides of the hall  outside on the southern side of the house was a garden of potherbs with the green walks edged by a few bright flowers for beaupots and posies  this had stone walls separating it from the paddock which sloped down to the river and was a good deal broken by ivycovered rocks  adjoining the stables were farm buildings and barns for there were several fields for tillage along the riverside and the mill and two more farms were the property of the bridgefield squire so that the inheritance was a very fair one wedged in as it were between the river and the great chase of sheffield up whose stately avenue the riding party looked as they crossed the bridge richard having become more silent than ever as he came among the familiar rocks and trees of his boyhood and knew he should not meet that hearty welcome from his brother which had never hitherto failed to greet his return  the house had that strange air of forlornness which seems to proclaim sorrow within  the great court doors stood open and a big rough deerhound at the sound of the approaching hoofs rose slowly up and began a series of long deepmouthed barks with pauses between sounding like a knell  one or two men and maids ran out at the sound and as the travellers rode up to the horseblock an old graybearded servingman came stumbling forth with oh  master diccon woe worth the day  how does my mother asked richard as he sprang off and set his boy on his feet  no worse sir but she hath not yet spoken a wordback thunderah sir the poor dog knows you  for the great hound had sprung up to richard in eager greeting but then as soon as he heard his voice the creature drooped his ears and tail and instead of continuing his demonstrations of joy stood quietly by only now and then poking his long rough nose into richards hand knowing as well as possible that though not his dear lost master he was the next thing  mistress susan and the infant were lifted downa hurried question and answer assured them that the funeral was over yesterday  my lady countess had come down and would have it so my lord was at court and sir gilbert and his brothers had been present but the old servants thought it hard that none nearer in blood should be there to lay their young squire in his grave nor to support his father who poor old man had tottered and been so like to swoon as he passed the hall door that sir gilbert and old diggory could but help him back again fearing lest he too might have a stroke  it was a great grief to richard who had longed to look on his brothers face again but he could say nothing only he gave one hand to his wife and the other to his son and led them into the hall which was in an indescribable state of confusion  the trestles which had supported the coffin were still at one end of the room the long tables were still covered with cloths trenchers knives cups and the remains of the funeral baked meats and there were overthrown tankards and stains of wine on the cloth as though whatever else were lacking the talbot retainers had not missed their revel  one of the dishevelled roughlooking maidens began some hurried muttering about being so distraught and not looking for madam so early but susan could not listen to her and merely putting the babe into her arms came with her husband up the stairs leaving little humfrey with nathanael  richard knocked at the bedroom door and receiving no answer opened it  there in the tapestryhung chamber was the huge old bedstead with its solid posts  in it lay something motionless but the first thing the husband and wife saw was the bent head which was lifted up by the burly but broken figure in the chair beside it  the two knotted old hands clasped the arms of the chair and the squire prepared to rise his lip trembling under his white beard and emotion working in his dejected features  they were beforehand with him  ere he could rise both were on their knees before him while richard in a broken voice cried father o father  thank god that thou art come my son said the old man laying his hands on his shoulders with a gleam of joy for as they afterwards knew he had sorely feared for richards ship in the storm that had caused humfreys death  i looked for thee my daughter he added stretching out one hand to susan who kissed it  now it may go better with her  speak to thy mother richard she may know thy voice  alas no the recently active ready old lady was utterly stricken and as yet held in the deadly grasp of paralysis unconscious of all that passed around her  susan found herself obliged at once to take up the reins and become head nurse and housekeeper  the old squire trusted implicitly to her and helplessly put the keys into her hands and the servingmen and maids in some shame at the condition in which the hall had been found bestirred themselves to set it in order so that there was a chance of the ordinary appearance of things being restored by suppertime when richard hoped to persuade his father to come down to his usual place  long before this however a trampling had been heard in the court and a shrill voice well known to richard and susan was heard demanding come home is shemaster diccon too  more shame for you you sluttish queans and lazy lubbers never to have let me know but none of you have any respect  a visit from my lady countess was a greater favour to such a household as that of bridgefield than it would be to a cottage of the present day richard was hurrying downstairs and susan only tarried to throw off the housewifely apron in which she had been compounding a cooling drink for the poor old lady and to wash her hands while humfrey rushing up to her exclaimed mother mother is it the queen  queen elizabeth herself was not inaptly represented by her namesake of hardwicke the queen of hallamshire sitting on her great white mule at the door sideways with her feet on a board as little children now ride and attended by a whole troop of gentlemen ushers maidens prickers and running footmen  she was a woman of the same type as the queen which was of course enough to stamp her as a celebrated beauty and though she had reached middle age her pale clear complexion and delicate features were well preserved  her chin was too sharp and there was something too thin and keen about her nose and lips to promise good temper  she was small of stature but she made up for it in dignity of presence and as she sat there with her rich embroidered green satin farthingale spreading out over the mule her tall ruff standing up fanlike on her shoulders her ridingrod in her hand and her master of the horse standing at her rein while a gentleman usher wielded an enormous longhandled green fan to keep the sun from incommoding her she was perhaps even more magnificent than the maiden queen herself might have been in her more private expeditions indeed she was new to her dignity as countess having been only a few weeks married to the earl her fourth husband captain talbot did not feel it derogatory to his dignity as a gentleman to advance with his hat in his hand to kiss her hand and put a knee to the ground as he invited her to alight an invitation his wife heard with dismay as she reached the door for things were by no means yet as they should be in the hall  she curtsied low and advanced with her son holding her hand but shrinking behind her  ha kinswoman is it thou was her greeting as she too kissed the small shapely white but exceedingly strong hand that was extended to her so thou art come and high time too  thou shouldst never have gone agadding to hull living in lodgings awaiting thine husband forsooth  thou art over young a matron for such gear and so i told diccon talbot long ago  yea madam said richard somewhat hotly and i made answer that my susan was to be trusted and truly no harm has come thereof  ho and you reckon it no harm that thy father and mother were left to a set of feckless brainless idle servingmen and maids in their trouble  why none would so much as have seen to thy brothers poor body being laid in a decent grave had not i been at hand to take order for it as became a distant kinsman of my lord  i tell thee richard there must be no more of these vagabond seafaring ways thou must serve my lord as a true retainer and kinsman is boundnay in reply to a gesture i will not come in i know too well in what ill order the house is like to be  i did but take my ride this way to ask how it fared with the mistress and try if i could shake the squire from his lethargy if mrs susan had not had the grace yet to be here  how do they  then in answer thou must waken him dicconrouse him and tell him that i and my lord expect it of him that he should bear his loss as a true and honest christian man and not pule and moan since he has a son leftay and a grandson  you should breed your boy up to know his manners susan talbot as humfrey resisted an attempt to make him do his reverence to my lady that stout knave of yours wants the rod  methought i heard youd borne another susan  ay as i said it would be as her eye fell on the swaddled babe in a maids arms  no lack of fools to eat up the poor old squires substance  a maid is it  beshrew me if your voyages will find portions for all your wenches  has the leech let blood to thy goodmother susan  there not one amongst you all bears any brains  knew you not how to send up to the castle for master drewitt  farewell  thou wilt be at the lodge tomorrow to let me know how it fares with thy mother when her brain is cleared by further bloodletting  and for the squire let him know that i expect it of him that he shall eat and show himself a man  so saying the great lady departed escorted as far as the avenue gate by richard talbot and leaving the family gratified by her condescension and not allowing to themselves how much their feelings were chafed     chapter iii  the captive   death and sorrow seemed to have marked the house of bridgefield for the old lady never rallied after the bloodletting enjoined by the countesss medical science and her husband though for some months able to creep about the house and even sometimes to visit the fields had lost his memory and became more childish week by week  richard talbot was obliged to return to his ship at the end of the month but as soon as she was laid up for the winter he resigned his command and returned home where he was needed to assume the part of master  in truth he became actually master before the next spring for his father took to his bed with the first winter frosts and in spite of the duteous cares lavished upon him by his son and daughterinlaw passed from his bed to his grave at the christmas feast richard talbot inherited house and lands with the undefined sense of feudal obligation to the head of his name and ere long he was called upon to fulfil those obligations by service to his lord  there had been another act in the great scottish tragedy  queen mary had effected her escape from lochleven but only to be at once defeated and then to cross the solway and throw herself into the hands of the english queen  bolton castle had been proved to be too perilously near the border to serve as her residence and the inquiry at york and afterwards at westminster having proved unsatisfactory elizabeth had decided on detaining her in the kingdom and committed her to the charge of the earl of shrewsbury  to go into the history of that illmanaged investigation is not the purpose of this tale  it is probable that elizabeth believed her cousin guilty and wished to shield that guilt from being proclaimed while her councillors in their dread of the captive wished to enhance the crime in elizabeths eyes and were by no means scrupulous as to the kind of evidence they adduced  however this lies outside our story all that concerns it is that lord shrewsbury sent a summons to his trusty and wellbeloved cousin richard talbot of bridgefield to come and form part of the guard of honour which was to escort the queen of scots to tutbury castle and there attend upon her  all this time no hint had been given that the little cicely was of alien blood  the old squire and his lady had been in no state to hear of the death of their own grandchild or of the adoption of the orphan and susan was too reserved a woman to speak needlessly of her griefs to one so unsympathising as the countess or so flighty as the daughters at the great house  the men who had brought the summons to hull had not been lodged in the house but at an inn where they either had heard nothing of master richards adventure or had drowned their memory in ale for they said nothing and thus without any formed intention of secrecy the childs parentage had never come into question  indeed though without doubt mrs talbot was very loyal in heart to her noble kinsfolk it is not to be denied that she was a good deal more at peace when they were not at the lodge  she tried devoutly to follow out the directions of my lady countess and thought herself in fault when things went amiss but she prospered far more when free from such dictation  she had nothing to wish except that her husband could be more often at home but it was better to have him only a few hours ride from her at chatsworth or tutbury than to know him exposed to the perils of the sea  he rode over as often as he could be spared to see his family and look after his property but his attendance was close and my lord and my lady were exacting with one whom they could thoroughly trust and it was well that in her quiet way mistress susan proved capable of ruling men and maids farm and stable as well as house servants and children to whom another boy was added in the course of the year after her return to bridgefield  in the autumn notice was sent that the queen of scots was to be lodged at sheffield and long trains of waggons and sumpter horses and mules began to arrive bringing her plenishing and household stuff in advance  servants without number were sent on both by her and by the earl to make preparations and on a november day tidings came that the arrival might be expected in the afternoon  commands were sent that the inhabitants of the little town at the park gate should keep within doors and not come forth to give any show of welcome to their lord and lady lest it should be taken as homage to the captive queen but at the manorhouse there was a little family gathering to hail the earl and countess it chiefly consisted of ladies with their children the husbands of most being in the suite of the earl acting as escort or guard to the queen  susan talbot being akin to the family on both sides was there with the two elder children humfrey both that he might greet his father the sooner and that he might be able to remember the memorable arrival of the captive queen and cicely because he had clamoured loudly for her company  lady talbot of the herbert blood wife to the heir was present with two young sistersinlaw lady grace daughter to the earl and mary daughter to the countess who had been respectively married to sir henry cavendish and sir gilbert talbot a few weeks before their respective parents were wedded when the brides were only twelve and fourteen years old there too was mrs babington of dethick the recent widow of a kinsman of lord shrewsbury to whom had been granted the wardship of her son and the little party waiting in the hall also numbered elizabeth and william cavendish the countesss youngest children and many dependants mustered in the background ready for the reception indeed the castle and manorhouse with their offices lodges and outbuildings were an absolute little city in themselves  the castle was still kept in perfect repair for the battle of bosworth was not quite beyond the memory of living mens fathers and besides who could tell whether any day england might not have to be contested inch by inch with the spaniard  so the gray walls stood on the tongue of land in the valley formed by the junction of the rivers sheaf and dun with towers at all the gateways enclosing a space of no less than eight acres and with the actual fortress crisp strong hard and unmouldered in the midst its tallest square tower serving as a lookout place for those who watched to give the first intimation of the arrival  the castle had its population but chiefly of grooms warders and their families  the staterooms high up in that square tower were so exceedingly confined so stern and grim that the grandfather of the present earl had built a manorhouse for his family residence on the sloping ground on the farther side of the dun  this house built of stone timber and brick with two large courts two gardens and three yards covered nearly as much space as the castle itself  a pleasant smooth grass lawn lay in front and on it converged the avenues of oaks and walnuts stretching towards the gates of the park narrowing to the eye into single lines then going absolutely out of sight and the sea of foliage presenting the utmost variety of beautiful tints of orange yellow brown and red  there was a great gateway between two new octagon towers of red brick with battlements and dressings of stone and from this porch a staircase led upwards to the great stonepaved hall with a huge fire burning on the open hearth  around it had gathered the ladies of the talbot family waiting for the reception  the warder on the tower had blown his horn as a signal that the master and his royal guest were within the park and the banner of the talbots had been raised to announce their coming but nearly half an hour must pass while the party came along the avenue from the drawbridge over the sheaf ere they could arrive at the lodge  so the ladies in full state dresses hovered over the fire while the children played in the window seat near at hand  gilbert talbots wife a thin yellowhaired young creature promising to be like her mother the countess had a tongue which loved to run and with the precocity and importance of wifehood at sixteen she dilated to her companions on her mothers constant attendance on the queen and the perpetual plots for that ladys escape  she is as shifty and active as any catamount and at chatsworth she had a scheme for being off out of her bedchamber window to meet a traitor fellow named boll but my husband smelt it out in good time and had the guard beneath my ladys window and the fellows are in gyves and to see the lady the day it was found out not a wry face did she make oh no  twas all my good lord and my sweet sir with her  i promise you butter would not melt in her mouth for my lord treasurer cecil hath been to see her and he has promised to bring her to speech of her majesty  may i be there to see  i promise you twill be diamond cut diamond between them  how did she and my lord treasurer fare together asked mrs babington  well you know theres not a man of them all that is proof against her blandishments  her majesty should have women warders for her twas good sport to see the furrows in his old brow smoothing out against his will as it were while she plied him with her tongue i never saw the queen herself win such a smile as came on his lips but then he is always a sort of master or tutor as it were to the queen  ay on some exclamation from lady talbot she heeds him like no one else she may fling out and run counter to him for the very pleasure of feeling that she has the power but she will come round at last and tis his will that is done in the long run  if this lady could beguile him indeed she might be a free woman in the end  and think you that she did  not she  the lord treasurer is too longheaded and has too strong a hate to all papistry to be beguiled more than for the very moment he was before her  he cannot help the being a man you see and they are all alike when once in her presenceyour lord and father like the rest of them sister grace  mark me if there be not tempests brewing an we be not the sooner rid of this guest of ours  my mother is not the woman to bear it long  dame marys tongue was apt to run on too fast and lady talbot interrupted its career with an amused gesture towards the children  for the little cis babe as she was had all the three boys at her service  humfrey with a paternal air was holding her on the windowseat antony babington was standing to receive the ball that was being tossed to and fro between them but as she never caught it will cavendish was content to pick it up every time and return it to her appearing amply rewarded by her laugh of delight  the two mothers could not but laugh and mrs babington said the brave lads were learning their knightly courtesy early while mary talbot began observing on the want of likeness between cis and either the talbot or hardwicke race  the little girl was much darker in colouring than any of the boys and had a pair of black dark heavy brows that prevented her from being a pretty child  her adopted mother shrank from such observations and was rejoiced that a winding of horns and a shout from the boys announced that the expected arrival was about to take place  the ladies darted to the window and beholding the avenue full of horsemen and horsewomen their accoutrements and those of their escort gleaming in the sun each mother gathered her own chicks to herself smoothed the plumage somewhat ruffled by sport and advanced to the head of the stone steps william cavendish the eldest of the boys being sent down to take his stepfathers rein and hold his stirrup page fashion  clattering and jingling the troop arrived  the earl a stout square man with a long narrow face lengthened out farther by a lightcoloured silky beard which fell below his ruff descended from his steed gave his hat to richard talbot and handed from her horse a hooded and veiled lady of slender proportions who leant on his arm as she ascended the steps  the ladies knelt whether in respect to the heads of the family or to the royal guest may be doubtful  the queen came up the stairs with rheumatic steps declaring however as she did so that she felt the better for her ride and was less fatigued than when she set forth  she had the soft low sweet scottish voice and a thorough scottish accent and language tempered however by french tones and as coming into the warmer air of the hall she withdrew her veil her countenance was seen mary stuart was only thirtyone at this time and her face was still youthful though worn and wearied and bearing tokens of illness the features were far from being regularly beautiful there was a decided cast in one of the eyes and in spite of all that mary talbots detracting tongue had said susans first impression was disappointment  but as the queen greeted the lady whom she already knew and the earl presented his daughter lady grace his stepdaughter elizabeth cavendish and his kinswoman mistress susan talbot the extraordinary magic of her eye and lip beamed on them the queenly grace and dignity joined with a wonderful sweetness impressed them all and each in measure felt the fascination  the earl led the queen to the fire to obtain a little warmth before mounting the stairs to her own apartments and likewise while lady shrewsbury was dismounting and being handed up the stairs by her second stepson gilbert  the ladies likewise knelt on one knee to greet this mighty dame and the children should have done so too but little cis catching sight of captain richard who had come up bearing the earls hat in immediate attendance on him broke out with an exulting cry of father father father trotted with outspread arms right in front of the royal lady embraced the booted leg in ecstasy and then stretching out exclaimed up up  how now malapert poppet exclaimed the countess and though at some distance uplifted her ridingrod  susan was ready to sink into the earth with confusion at the great ladys displeasure but richard had stooped and lifted the little maid in his arms while queen mary turned her face lit up as by a sunbeam and said ah bonnibell art thou fain to see thy father  wilt thou give me one of thy kisses sweet bairnie and as richard held her up to the kind face a goodly child brave sir  thou must let me have her at times for a playfellow wilt come and comfort a poor prisoner little sweeting  the child responded with poor poor stroking the soft delicate cheek but the countess interfered still wrathful  master richard i marvel that you should let her grace be beset by a child who if she cannot demean herself decorously should have been left at home susan hardwicke i thought i had schooled you better  nay madam may not a babes gentle deed of pity be pardoned said mary  oh if it pleasures you madam so be it said lady shrewsbury deferentially but there be children here more worthy of your notice than yonder little blackbrowed wench who hath been allowed to thrust herself forward while others have been kept back from importuning your grace  no child can importune a mother who is cut off from her own said mary eager to make up for the jealousy she had excited  is this bonnie laddie yours madam  ah i should have known it by the resemblance  she held her white hand to receive the kisses of the boys william cavendish under his mothers eye knelt obediently antony babington a fair pretty lad of eight or nine of a beautiful pink and white complexion pressed forward with an eager devotion which made the queen smile and press her delicate hand on his curled locks as for humfrey he retreated behind the shelter of his mothers farthingale where his presence was forgotten by every one else and after the rebuff just administered to cicely there was no inclination to bring him to light or combat with his bashfulness  the introductions over mary gave her hand to the earl to be conducted from the hall up the broad staircase and along the great western gallery to the south front where for many days her properties had been in course of being arranged  lady shrewsbury followed as mistress of the house and behind in order of precedence came the scottish queens household in which the dark keen features of the french and the rufous hues of the scots were nearly equally divided  lady livingstone and mistress seaton two of the queens maries of the same age with herself came next the one led by lord talbot the other by lord livingstone there was also the faithful french marie de courcelles paired with master beatoun comptroller of the household and jean kennedy a stiff scotswoman whose hard outlines did not do justice to her tenderness and fidelity and with her was a tall active keenfaced stripling looked on with special suspicion by the english as willie douglas the contriver of the queens flight from lochleven  two secretaries french and scottish were shrewdly suspected of being priests and there were besides a physician surgeon apothecary with perfumers cooks pantlers scullions lacqueys to the number of thirty besides their wives and attendants these last being permitted of my lords benevolence  they were all eyed askance by the sturdy north country english who naturally hated all strangers above all french and scotch and viewed the band of captives much like a caged herd of wild beasts  when on the way home mistress susan asked her little boy why he would not make his obeisance to the pretty lady he sturdily answered she is no pretty lady of mine  she is an evil woman who slew her husband  poor lady tongues have been busy with her said his father  how sir asked susan amazed do you think her guiltless in the matter  i cannot tell returned richard  all i know is that many who have no mercy on her would change their minds if they beheld her patient and kindly demeanour to all  this was a sort of shock to susan as it seemed to her to prove the truth of little lady talbots words that no one was proof against queen marys wiles but she was happy in having her husband at home once more though as he told her he would be occupied most of each alternate day at sheffield he and another relation having been appointed gentlemen porters which meant that they were to wait in a chamber at the foot of the stairs and keep watch over whatever went in or out of the apartments of the captive and her suite  and said richard who think you came to see me at wingfield none other than cuthbert langston  hath he left his merchandise at hull  ay so he saith  he would fain have had my good word to my lord for a post in the household as comptroller of accounts clerk or the like it seemed as though there were no office he would not take so that he might hang about the neighbourhood of this queen  then you would not grant him your recommendation  nay truly  i could not answer for him and his very anxiety made me the more bent on not bringing him hither  id fain serve in no ship where i know not the honesty of all the crew and cuthbert hath ever had a hankering after the old profession  verily then it were not well to bring him hither  moreover he is a lover of mysteries and schemes said richard he would never be content to let alone the question of our little wenchs birth and would be fretting us for ever about the matter  did he speak of it  yes  he would have me to wit that a nurse and babe had been put on board at dumbarton  well said i and so they must have been since on board they were  is that all thou hast to tell me  and mighty as was the work he would have made of it this was all he seemed to know  i asked in my turn how he came to know thus much about a vessel sailing from a port in arms against the lords of the congregation the allies of her majesty  what said he  that his house had dealings with the owners of the bride of dunbar i like not such dealings and so long as this lady and her train are near us i would by no means have him whispering here and there that she is a scottish orphan  it would chafe my lady countess said susan to whom this was a serious matter  yet doth it not behove us to endeavour to find out her parentage  i tell you i proved to myself that he knew nothing and all that we have to do is to hinder him from making mischief out of that little returned richard impatiently  the honest captain could scarcely have told the cause of his distrust or of his secrecy but he had a general feeling that to let an intriguer like cuthbert langston rake up any tale that could be connected with the party of the captive queen could only lead to danger and trouble     chapter iv  the oak and the oaken hall   the oaks of sheffield park were one of the greatest glories of the place  giants of the forest stretched their huge arms over the turf kept smooth and velvety by the creatures wild and tame that browsed on it and made their covert in the deep glades of fern and copse wood that formed the background  there were not a few whose huge trunks of such girth that two men together could not encompass them with outstretched arms rose to a height of more than sixty feet before throwing out a horizontal branch and these branches almost trees in themselves spread fortyeight feet on each side of the bole lifting a mountain of rich verdure above them and casting a delicious shade upon the ground beneath them beneath one of these noble trees some years after the arrival of the hapless mary stuart a party of children were playing much to the amusement of an audience of which they were utterly unaware namely of sundry members of a deerhunting party a lady and gentleman who having become separated from the rest were standing in the deep bracken which rose nearly as high as their heads and were further sheltered by a rock looking and listening  now then cis bravely done  show how she treats her ladies  who will be her lady  thou must humfrey  no no ill never be a lady said humfrey gruffly  thou then diccon  no no and the little fellow shrank back thou wilt hurt me cis  come then do thou tony  ill not strike too hard  as if a wench could strike too hard  he might have turned that more chivalrously whispered the lady to her companion  what are they about to represent  mort de ma vie the profane little imps  i believe it is my sacred cousin the majesty of england herself  truly the little maid hath a bearing that might serve a queen though she be all too black and beetlebrowed for queen elizabeth  who is she master gilbert  she is cicely talbot daughter to the gentleman porter of your majestys lodge  see to hermark her little dignity with her heather and bluebell crown as she sits on the rock as stately as jewels could make her see her gesture with her hands to mark where the standing ruff ought to be  she hath the true spirit of the comedyah and here cometh young antony with mincing pace with a dockleaf for a fan and a mantle for a farthingale  she speaks now hark  good morrow to you my young mistress began a voice pitched two notes higher than its actual childlike key  thou hast a new farthingale i see  o antony thats not the way to curtseydo it like this  no no thou clumsy fellowback and knees together  never mind cis interposed one of the boyswe shall lose all our play time if you try to make him do it with a grace  curtsies are womens workgo on  where was i  o resuming her dignity after these asides thou hast a new farthingale i see  to do my poor honour to your graces birthday  oh ho  is it so  methought it had been to do honour to my fair mistresss own taper waist  and pray how much an ell was yonder broidered stuff  two crowns ant please your grace returned the supposed lady making a wild conjecture  two crowns thou foolish antony  then recollecting herself two crowns what when mine costs but half  thou presumptuous lavish varletno no wench what right hast thou to wear gowns finer than thy liegeill teach you  wherewith erecting all her talons and clawing frightfully with them in the air the supposed queen bess leapt at the unfortunate maid of honour appeared to tear the imaginary robe and drove her victim on the stage with a great air of violence amid peals of laughter from the other children loud enough to drown those of the elders who could hardly restrain their merriment  gilbert talbot however had been looking about him anxiously all the time and would fain have moved away but a sign from queen mary withheld him as one of the children cried  now show us how she serves her lords  the play seemed well understood between them for the mimic queen again settled herself on her throne while will cavendish calling out now im master hatton began to tread a stately measure on the grass while the queen exclaimed who is this new star of my court what stalwart limbs what graceful tread  who art thou sir  madam i ami am  what is it  an efef  a daddylonglegs mischievously suggested another of the group  no its latin  is it ephraim  no its a fly something like a gnat then at an impatient gesture from her majesty disporting itself in the beams of the noontide sun  bloodsucking whispered the real queen behind the fern  he is not so far out there  see see with what a grace the child holds out her little hand for him to kiss  i doubt me if elizabeth herself could be more stately  but who comes here  im sir philip sydney  no no shouted humfrey sir philip shall not come into this fooling  my father says hes the best knight in england  he is as bad as the rest in flattery to the queen returned young cavendish  ill not have it i say  you may be lord leicester an you will hes but robin dudley  ah began the lad now advancing and shading his eyes  what burnished splendour dazzles my weak sight  is it a second juno that i behold or lovely venus herself  nay there is a wisdom in her that can only belong to the great minerva herself  so youthful too is it hebe descended to this earth  cis smirked and held out a hand saying in an affected tone lord earl are thy wits astray  whose wits would not be perturbed at the mere sight of such exquisite beauty  come and sit at our feet and we will try to restore them said the stage queen but here little diccon the youngest of the party eager for more action called out show us how she treats her lords and ladies together  on which young babington as the lady and humfrey made demonstrations of lovemaking and betrothal upon which their sovereign lady descended on them with furious tokens of indignation abusing them right and left until in the midst the great castle bell pealed forth and caused a flight general being in fact the summons to the school kept in one of the castle chambers by one master snigg or sniggius for the children of the numerous colony who peopled the castle  girls as well as boys were taught there and thus cis accompanied humfrey and diccon and consorted with their companions  queen mary was allowed to hunt and take outofdoor exercise in the park whenever she pleased but lord shrewsbury or one of his sons gilbert and francis never was absent from her for a moment when she went beyond the door of the lesser lodge which the earl had erected for her with a flat leaded and parapeted roof where she could take the air and with only one entrance where was stationed a gentleman porter with two subordinates whose business it was to keep a close watch over every person or thing that went in or out if she had any purpose of losing herself in the thickets of fern or copsewood in the park or holding unperceived conference under shelter of the chase these plans were rendered impossible by the pertinacious presence of one or other of the talbots who acted completely up to their name  thus it was that the queen with gilbert in close attendance had found herself an unseen spectator of the childrens performance which she watched with the keen enjoyment that sometimes made her forget her troubles for the moment  how got the imps such knowledge mused gilbert talbot as he led the queen out on the sward which had been the theatre of their mimicry  do you ask that sir gilbert said the queen with emphasis for indeed it was his wife who had been the chief retailer of scandal about queen elizabeth to the not unwilling ears of herself and his mother and antony babington as my ladys page had but used his opportunities  they are insolent varlets and deserve the rod continued gilbert  you are too ready with the rod you english returned mary  you flog all that is clever and spirited out of your poor children  that is the question madam  have the english been found so deficient in spirit compared with other nations  ah we all know what you english can say for yourselves returned the queen  see what master john coke hath made of the heralds argument before dame renown in his translation  he hath twisted all the other way  yea madam but the french herald had it all his own way before  so it was but just we should have our turn  here a cry from the other hunters greeted them and they found lord shrewsbury some of the ladies and a number of prickers looking anxiously for them  here we are good my lord said the queen who when free from rheumatism was a most active walker  we have only been stalking my sister queens court in small the prettiest and drollest pastime i have seen for many a long day  much had happened in the course of the past years  the intrigues with northumberland and norfolk and the secret efforts of the unfortunate queen to obtain friends and stir up enemies against elizabeth had resulted in her bonds being drawn closer and closer the rising of the north had taken place and cuthbert langston had been heard of as taking a prominent part beneath the sacred banner but he had been wounded and not since heard of and his kindred knew not whether he were among the unnamed dead who loaded the trees in the rear of the army of sussex or whether he had escaped beyond seas  richard talbot still remained as one of the trusted kinsmen of lord shrewsbury on whom that nobleman depended for the execution of the charge which yearly became more wearisome and onerous as hope decayed and plots thickened  though resident in the new lodge with her train it was greatly diminished by the dismissal from time to time of persons who were regarded as suspicious mary still continued on intimate terms with lady shrewsbury and her daughters specially distinguishing with her favour bessie pierrepoint the eldest grandchild of the countess who slept with her and was her plaything and her pupil in french and needlework  the fiction of her being guest and not prisoner had not entirely passed away visitors were admitted and she went in and out of the lodge walked or rode at will only under pretext of courtesy she never was unaccompanied by the earl or one of his sons and they endeavoured to make all private conversation with strangers or persons unauthorised from court impossible to her  the invitation given to little cicely on the arrival had not been followed up  the countess wished to reserve to her own family all the favours of one who might at any moment become the queen of england and she kept susan talbot and her children in what she called their meet place in which that good lady thoroughly acquiesced having her hands much too full of household affairs to run after queens  there was a good deal of talk about this childs play a thing which had much better have been left where it was but in a seclusion like that of sheffield subjects of conversation were not over numerous and every topic which occurred was apt to be worried to shreds  so lady shrewsbury and her daughters heard the queens arch description of the childrens mimicry and instantly conceived a desire to see the scene repeated  the gentlemen did not like it at all their loyalty was offended at the insult to her gracious majesty and besides what might not happen if such sports ever came to her ears however the countess ruled sheffield and mary talbot and bessie cavendish ruled the countess and they were bent on their own way so the representation was to take place in the great hall of the manorhouse and the actors were to be dressed in character from my ladys stores  they will ruin it these clumsy english after their own fashion said queen mary among her ladies  it was the unpremeditated grace and innocent audacity of the little ones that gave the charm  now it will be a mere broad farce worthy of bess of hardwicke  mais que voulez vous  the performance was however laid under a great disadvantage by the absolute refusal of richard and susan talbot to allow their cicely to assume the part of queen elizabeth  they had been dismayed at her doing so in childs play and since she could read fluently write pretty well and cipher a little the good mother had decided to put a stop to this free association with the boys at the castle and to keep her at home to study needlework and housewifery  as to her acting with boys before the assembled households the proposal seemed to them absolutely insulting to any daughter of the talbot line and they had by this time forgotten that she was no such thing  bess cavendish the special spoilt child of the house even rode down armed with her mothers commands but her feudal feeling did not here sway mistress susan  public acting was esteemed an indignity for women and though cis was a mere child all susans womanhood awoke and she made answer firmly that she could not obey my lady countess in this  bess flounced out of the house indignantly telling her she should rue the day and cis herself cried passionately longing after the fine robes and jewels and the presentation of herself as a queen before the whole company of the castle  the harsh system of the time made the good mother think it her duty to requite this rebellion with the rod and to set the child down to her seam in the corner and there sat cis pouting and brooding over what antony babington had told her of what he had picked up when in his pages capacity attending his lady of queen marys admiration of the pretty ways and airs of the little mimic queen bess till she felt as if she were defrauded of her due  the captive queen was her dream and to hear her commendations perhaps be kissed by her would be supreme bliss nay she still hoped that there would be an interference of the higher powers on her behalf which would give her a triumph  no  captain talbot came home saying so mistress sue thou art a steadfast woman to have resisted my ladys will  i knew my good husband that thou wouldst never see our cis even in sport a player  assuredly not and thou hadst the best of it for when mistress bess came in as full of wrath as a petard of powder and made your refusal known my lord himself cried out and shes in the right ot  what a child may do in sport is not fit for a gentlewoman in earnest  then hath not my lord put a stop to the whole  fain would he do so but the countess and her daughters are set on carrying out the sport  they have set master sniggius to indite the speeches and the boys of the school are to take the parts for their autumn interlude  surely that is perilous should it come to the knowledge of those at court  oh i promise you sniggius hath a device for disguising all that could give offence  the queen will become semiramis or zenobia i know not which and my lord of leicester master hatton and the others will be called ninus or longinus or some such heathenish longtailed terms and speak speeches of mighty length  are they to be in latin humfrey  oh no sir said humfrey with a shudder  master sniggius would have had them so but the young ladies said they would have nothing to do with the affair if there were one word of latin uttered  it is bad enough as it is  i am to be philidaspes an assyrian knight and have some speeches to learn at least one is twentyfive lines and not one is less than five  a right requital for thy presumptuous and treasonable game my son said his father teasing him  and who is to be the queen asked the mother  antony babington said humfrey because he can amble and mince more like a wench than any of us  the worse luck for him  he will have more speeches than any one of us to learn  the report of the number of speeches to be learnt took off the sting of ciss disappointment though she would not allow that it did so declaring with truth that she could learn by hearing faster than any of the boys  indeed she did learn all humfreys speeches and antonys to boot and assisted both of them with all her might in committing them to memory  as captain talbot had foretold the boys sport was quite sufficiently punished by being made into earnest  master sniggius was far from merciful as to length and his satire was so extremely remote that queen elizabeth herself could hardly have found out that zenobias fine moral lecture on the vanities of too aspiring ruffs was founded on the box on the ear which rewarded poor lady mary howards display of her rich petticoat nor would her cheeks have tingled when the queen of the eastby a bold adaptationplayed the part of lion in interrupting the interview of our old friends pyramus and thisbe who by an awful anachronism were carried to palmyra it was no plagiarism from midsummer nights dream only drawn from the common stock of playwrights  so shorn of all that was perilous and only understood by the initiated the play took place in the castle hall the largest available place with queen mary seated upon the dais with a canopy of state over her head lady shrewsbury on a chair nearly as high the earl the gentlemen and ladies of their suites drawn up in a circle the servants where they could the earls musicians thundering with drums tooting with fifes twanging on fiddles overhead in a gallery cis and diccon on either side of susan talbot gazing on the stage where much encumbered by hoop and farthingale and arrayed in a yellow curled wig strutted forth antony babington declaiming            great queen zenobia am i            the roman power i defy            at my palmyra in the east            i rule oer every man and beast   here was an allusion couched in the roman power which master antony had missed or he would hardly have uttered it since he was of a roman catholic family though while in the earls household he had to conform outwardly  a slender scholarly lad with a pretty innocent face and a voice that could speak small like a woman came in and announced himself thus            im thisbe an assyrian maid            my robes with jewels overlaid   the stiff colloquy between the two boys encumbered with their dresses shy and awkward and rehearsing their lines like a task was no small contrast to the merry impromptu under the oak and the gay free grace of the children  poor philidaspes acquitted himself worst of all for when done up in a glittering suit of sham armour with a sword and dagger of lath his entire speech though well conned deserted him and he stood redfaced hesitating and ready to cry when suddenly from the midst of the spectators there issued a childish voice go on humfrey             philidaspes am i most valorous knight            ever ready for church and queen to fight   go on i say and she gave a little stamp of impatience to the extreme confusion of the mother and the great amusement of the assembled company  humfrey once started delivered himself of the rest of his oration in a glum and droning voice occasioning fits of laughter such as by no means added to his selfpossession  the excellent sniggius and his company of boys had certainly whether intentionally or not deprived the performance of all its personal sting and most likewise of its interest  such diversion as the spectators derived was such as hippolyta seems to have found in listening to wall lion moonshine and co but like theseus lord shrewsbury was very courteous and complimented both playwright and actors relieved and thankful no doubt that queen zenobia was so unlike his royal mistress  there was nothing so much enforced by queen elizabeth as that strangers should not have resort to sheffield castle  no spectators except those attached to the household and actually forming part of the colony within the park were therefore supposed to be admitted and all of them were carefully kept at a distant part of the hall where they could have no access to the now much reduced train of the scottish queen with whom all intercourse was forbidden  humfrey was therefore surprised when just as he had come out of the tiringroom glad to divest himself of his encumbering and gaudy equipments a man touched him on the arm and humbly said sir i have a humble entreaty to make of you  if you would convey my petition to the queen of scots  i have nothing to do with the queen of scots said the exphilidaspes glancing suspiciously at the mans sleeve where however he saw the silver dog the family badge  she is a charitable lady continued the man who looked like a groom and if she only knew that my poor old aunt is lying famishing she would aid her  pray you good my lord help me to let this scroll reach to her  im no lord and i have naught to do with the queen repeated humfrey while at the same moment antony who had been rather longer in getting out of his female attire presented himself and humfrey pitying the mans distress said this young gentleman is the countesss page  he sometimes sees the queen  the man eagerly told his story how his aunt the widow of a huckster had gone on with the trade till she had been cruelly robbed and beaten and now was utterly destitute needing aid to set herself up again the queen of scots was noted for her beneficent almsgiving and a few silver pieces from her would be quite sufficient to replenish her basket  neither boy doubted a moment  antony had the entree to the presence chamber where on this festival night the earl and countess were sure to be with the queen  he went straightway thither and trained as he was in the usages of the place told his business to the earl who was seated near the queen  lord shrewsbury took the petition from him glanced it over and asked who knew the guy norman who sent it frank talbot answered for him that he was a yeoman pricker and the earl permitted the paper to be carried to mary watching her carefully as she read it when antony had presented it on one knee  poor woman she said it is a piteous case  master beatoun hast thou my purse  here master babington wilt thou be the bearer of this angel for me since i know that the delight of being the bearer will be a reward to thy kind heart  antony gracefully kissed the fair hand and ran off joyously with the queens bounty  little did any one guess what the career thus begun would bring that fair boy     chapter v  the huckstering woman   the huckstering woman tibbott by name was tended by queen marys apothecary and in due time was sent off well provided to the great fair of york whence she returned with a basket of needles pins such as they were bodkins and the like articles wherewith to circulate about hallamshire but the gatewards would not relax their rules so far as to admit her into the park  she was permitted however to bring her wares to the town of sheffield and to bridgefield but she might come no farther  thither antony babington came down to lay out the crown which had been given to him on his birthday and indeed half master sniggiuss scholars discovered needs and came down either to spend or to give advice to the happy owners of groats and testers  so far so good but the hucksterwoman soon made bridgefield part of her regular rounds and took little commissions which she executed for the household of sheffield who were as the cavendish sisters often said in their spleen almost as much prisoners as the queen of scots antony babington was always her special patron and being humfreys great companion and playfellow he was allowed to come in and out of the gates unquestioned to play with him and with cis who no longer went to school but was trained at home in needlework and housewifery  matchmaking began at so early an age that when mistress susan had twice found her and antony babington with their heads together over the lamentable ballad of the cold fish that had been a lady and which sang its own history forty thousand fathom above water she began to question whether the girl were the attraction  he was now an orphan and his wardship and marriage had been granted to the earl who having disposed of all his daughters and stepdaughters except bessie cavendish might very fairly bestow on the daughter of his kinsman so good a match as the young squire of dethick  then should we have to consider of her parentage said richard when his wife had propounded her views  i never can bear in mind that the dear wench is none of ours said susan  thou didst say thou wouldst portion her as if she were our own little maid and i have nine webs ready for her household linen must we speak of her as a stranger  it would scarce be just towards another family to let them deem her of true talbot blood if she were to enter among them said richard though i look on the little merry maid as if she were mine own child but there is no need yet to begin upon any such coil and indeed i would wager that my lady hath other views for young babington  after all parents often know very little of what passes in childrens minds and cis never hinted to her mother that the bond of union between her and antony was devotion to the captive queen  cis had only had a glimpse or two of her riding by when hunting or hawking or when on festive occasions all who were privileged to enter the park were mustered together among whom the talbots ranked high as kindred to both earl and countess but those glimpses had been enough to fill the young heart with romance such as the matteroffact elders never guessed at  antony babington who was often actually in the gracious presence and received occasional smiles and even greetings was immeasurably devoted to the queen and maintained cicelys admiration by his vivid descriptions of the kindness the grace the charms of the royal captive in contrast with the innate vulgarity of their own countess  willie douglas the real roland graeme of the escape from lochleven had long ago been dismissed from marys train with all the other servants who were deemed superfluous but antony had heard the details of the story from jean kennedy mrs kennett as the english were pleased to call her and willie was the hero of his emulative imagination  what would i not do to be like him he fervently exclaimed when he had narrated the story to humfrey and cis as they lay on a nest in the fern one fine autumn day resting after an expedition to gather blackberries for the mothers preserving  i would not be him for anything said humfrey  fie humfrey cried cis would not you dare exile or anything else in a good cause  for a good cause ay said humfrey in his stolid way  and what can be a better cause than that of the fairest of captive queens exclaimed antony hotly  i would not be a traitor returned humfrey as he lay on his back looking up through the chequerwork of the branches of the trees towards the sky  who dares link the word traitor with my name said babington feeling for the imaginary handle of a sword  not i but youll get it linked if you go on in this sort  for shame humfrey again cried cis passionately  why delivering imprisoned princesses always was the work of a true knight  yea but they first defied the giant openly said humfrey  what of that said antony  they did not do it under trust said humfrey  i am not under trust said antony  your father may be a sworn servant of the earl and the queenqueen elizabeth i mean but i have taken no oathsnobody asked me if i would come here  no said humfrey knitting his brows but you see we are all trusted to go in and out as we please on the understanding that we do nought that can be unfaithful to the earl and i suppose it was thus with this same willie douglas  she was his own true and lawful queen cried cis  his first duty was to her  humfrey sat up and looked perplexed but with a sudden thought exclaimed no scots are we thanks be to heaven and what might be loyalty in him would be rank treason in us  how know you that said antony  i have heard those who say that our lawful queen is there and he pointed towards the walls that rose in the distance above the woods  humfrey rose wrathful  then truly you are no better than a traitor and a spaniard and a papist and fists were clenched on both aides while cis flew between pulling down humfreys uplifted hand and crying no no he did not say he thought so only he had heard it  let him say it again growled antony his arm bared  no dont humfrey as if she saw it between his clenched teeth you know you only meant if tony thought so and he didnt  now how can you two be so foolish and unkind to me to bring me out for a holiday to eat blackberries and make heather crowns and then go and spoil it all with folly about papists and spaniards and grownup peoples nonsense that nobody cares about  cis had a rare power over both her comrades and her piteous appeal actually disarmed them since there was no one present to make them ashamed of their own placability  grownup peoples follies were avoided by mutual consent through the rest of the walk and the three children parted amicably when antony had to return to fulfil his pages duties at my lords supper and humfrey and cis carried home their big basket of blackberries  when they entered their own hall they found their mother engaged in conversation with a tall stout and weatherbeaten man whom she announcedsee here my children here is a good friend of your fathers master goatley who was his chief mate in all his voyages and hath now come over all the way from hull to see him  he will be here anon sir so soon as the guard is changed at the queens lodge meantime here are the elder children  diccon who had been kept at home by some temporary damage to his foot and little edward were devouring the sailor with their eyes and humfrey and cis were equally delighted with the introduction especially as master goatley was just returned from the western main and from a curious grasswoven basket which he carried slung to his side produced sundry curiosities in the way of beads shellwork featherwork and a hatchet of stone and even a curious armlet of soft dull gold with pearls set in it  this he had with great difficulty obtained on purpose for mistress talbot who had once cured him of a bad festering hurt received on board ship  the children clustered round in ecstasies of admiration and wonder as they heard of the dark brown atives the curious expedients by which barter was carried on also of cruel spaniards and of savage fishes with all the marvels of flyingfish corals palmtrees humming birdsall that is lesson work to our modern youth but was the most brilliant of living fairy tales at this elizabethan period  humfrey and diccon were ready to rush off to voyage that instant and even little ned cried imitatively in his imperfect language that he would be a tailor  then their father came home and joyfully welcomed and clasped hands with his faithful mate declaring that the sight did him good and they sat down to supper and talked of voyages till the boys eyes glowed and they beat upon their own knees with the enthusiasm that their strict manners bade them repress while their mother kept back her sighs as she saw them becoming infected with that sea fever so dreaded by parents  nay she saw it in her husband himself  she knew him to be grievously weary of a charge most monotonously dull and only varied by suspicions and petty detections and that he was hungering and thirsting for his good ship and to be facing winds and waves  she could hear his longing in the very sound of the ays and brief inquiries by which he encouraged goatley to proceed in the story of voyages and adventures and she could not wonder when goatley said your heart is in it still sir  not one of us all but says it is a pity such a noble captain should be lost as a landsman with nothing to do but to lock the door on a lady  speak not of it my good goatley said richard hastily or you will set me dreaming and make me mad  then it is indeed so returned goatley  wherefore then come you not sir where a crew is waiting for you of as good fellows as ever stepped on a deck and who one and all are longing after such a captain as you are sir  wherefore hold back while still in your prime  ask the mistress there said richard as he saw his susans white face and trembling fingers though she kept her eyes on her work to prevent them from betraying their tears and their wistfulness  o sweet father burst forth humfrey do but go and take me  i am quite old enough  nay humfrey tis no matter of liking said his father not wishing to prolong his wifes suspense  look you here boy my lord earl is captain of all of his name by right of birth and so long as he needs my services i have no right to take them from him  dost see my boy  humfrey reluctantly did see  it was a great favour to be thus argued with and admitted of no reply  mrs talbots heart rejoiced but she was not sorry that it was time for her to carry off diccon and ned to their beds away from the fascinating narrative and she would give no respite though diccon pleaded hard  in fact the danger might be the greatest to him since humfrey though born within the smell of the sea might be retained by the call of duty like his father  to cis at least she thought the sailors conversation could do no harm little foreboding the words that presently ensued  and sir what befell the babe we found in our last voyage off the spurn  it would methinks be about the age of this pretty mistress  richard talbot endeavoured to telegraph a look both of assent and warning but though master goatley would have been sharp to detect the least token of a spanish galleon on the most distant horizon the signal fell utterly short  ay sir  what is it so  bless me the very maiden  and you have bred her up for your own  sir  father cried cis looking from one to the other with eyes and mouth wide open  soh cried the sailor what have i done  i beg your pardon sir if i have overhauled what should have been let alone  but continued the honest but tactless man who could have thought of the like of that and that the pretty maid never knew it  ay ay dear heart  never fear but that the captain will be good father to you all the same  for richard talbot had held out his arm and as cis ran up to him he had seated her on his knee and held her close to him  humfrey likewise started up with an impulse to contradict which was suddenly cut short by a strange flash of memory so all he did was to come up to his father and grasp one of the girls hands as fast as he could she trembled and shivered but there was something in the presence of this strange man which choked back all inquiry and the silence the vehement grasp and the shuddering alarmed the captain lest she might suddenly go off into a fit upon his hands  this is gear for mother said he and taking her up like a baby carried her off followed closely by humfrey  he met susan coming down asking anxiously is she sick  i hope not mother he said but honest goatley thinking no harm hath blurted out that which we had never meant her to know at least not yet awhile and it hath wrought strangely with her  then it is true father said humfrey in rather an awestricken voice while cis still buried her face on the captains breast  yes he said yea my children it is true that god sent us a daughter from the sea and the wreck when he had taken our own little maid to his rest  but we have ever loved our cis as well and hope ever to do so while she is our good child  take her mother and tell the children how it befell if i go not down the fellow will spread it all over the house and happily none were present save humfrey and the little maiden  susan put the child down on her own bed and there with humfrey standing by told the history of the father carrying in the little shipwrecked babe  they both listened with eyes devouring her but they were as yet too young to ask questions about evidences and susan did not volunteer these only when the girl asked then have i no name she answered a godly minister master heatherthwayte gave thee the name of cicely when he christened thee  i marvel who i am said cis gazing round her as if the world were all new to her  it does not matter said humfrey you are just the same to us is she not mother  she is our dear heavensent child said the mother tenderly  but thou art not my true mother nor humfrey nor diccon my brethren she said stretching out her hands like one in the dark  if im not your brother cis ill be your husband and then you will have a real right to be called talbot  thats better than if you were my sister for then you would go away i dont know where and now you will always be mineminemine very own  and as he gave cis a hug in assurance of his intentions his father who was uneasy about the matter looked in again and as susan with tears in her eyes pointed to the children the good man said by my faith the boy has found the way to cut the knotor rather to tie it what say you dame  if we do not get a portion for him we do not have to give one with her so it is as broad as it is long and she remains our dear child  only listen children you are both old enough to keep a secret  not one word of all this matter is to be breathed to any soul till i bid you  not to diccon said humfrey decidedly  nor to antony asked cis wistfully  to antony  no indeed  what has he to do with it  now to your beds children and forget all about this tale  there humfrey broke out cis as soon as they were alone together huckstress tibbott is a wise woman whatever thou mayest say  how said humfrey  mindst thou not the day when i crossed her hand with the tester father gave me  when mother whipped thee for listening to fortunetellers and wasting thy substance  ay i mind it well said humfrey and how thou didst stand simpering at her pack of lies ere mother made thee sing another tune  nay humfrey they were no lies though i thought them so then  she said i was not what i seemed and that the talbots kennel would not always hold one of the noble northern eagles  so humfrey sweet humfrey thou must not make too sure of wedding me  ill wed thee though all the lying old gipsywives in england wore their false throats out in screeching out that i shall not cried humfrey  but she must have known said cis in an awestruck voice the spirits must have spoken with her and said that i am none of the talbots  hath mother heard this asked humfrey recoiling a little but never thinking of the more plausible explanation  oh no no tell her not humfrey tell her not  she said she would whip me again if ever i talked again of the follies that the fortunetelling woman had gulled me with for if they were not deceits they were worse  and thou seest they are worse humfrey  with which awestricken conclusion the children went off to bed     chapter vi  the bewitched whistle   a childs point of view is so different from that of a grown person that the discovery did not make half so much difference to cis as her adopted parents expected  in fact it was like a dream to her  she found her daily life and her surroundings the same and her chief interest wasat least apparentlyhow soon she could escape from psalter and seam to play with little ned and look out for the elder boys returning or watch for the scottish queen taking her daily ride once prompted by antony cis had made a beautiful nosegay of lilies and held it up to the queen when she rode in at the gate on her return from buxton  she had been rewarded by the sweetest of smiles but captain talbot had said it must never happen again or he should be accused of letting billets pass in posies  the whole place was pervaded in fact by an atmosphere of suspicion and the vigilance which might have been endurable for a few months was wearing the spirits and temper of all concerned now that it had already lasted for seven or eight years and there seemed no end to it  moreover in spite of all care it every now and then became apparent that queen mary had some communication with the outer world which no one could trace though the effects endangered the life of queen elizabeth the peace of the kingdom and the existence of the english church  the blame always fell upon lord shrewsbury and who could wonder that he was becoming captiously suspicious and soured in temper so that even such faithful kinsmen as richard talbot could sometimes hardly bear with him and became punctiliously anxious that there should not be the smallest loophole for censure of the conduct of himself and his family  the person on whom master goatleys visit had left the most impression seemed to be humfrey  on the one hand his fathers words had made him enter into his situation of trust and loyalty and perceive something of the constant sacrifice of self to duty that it required and on the other hand he had assumed a position towards cis of which he in some degree felt the force  there was nothing in the opinions of the time to render their semibetrothal ridiculous at the manor house itself gilbert talbot and mary cavendish had been married when no older than he was half their contemporaries were already plighted and the only difference was that in the present harassing state of surveillance in which every one lived the parents thought that to avow the secret so long kept might bring about inquiry and suspicion and they therefore wished it to be guarded till the marriage could be contracted  as cis developed she had looks and tones which so curiously harmonised now with the scotch now with the french element in the royal captives suite and which made captain richard believe that she must belong to some of the families who seemed amphibious between the two courts and her identification as a seaton a flemyng a beatoun or as a member of any of the families attached to the losing cause would only involve her in exile and disgrace  besides there was every reason to think her an orphan and a distant kinsman was scarcely likely to give her such a home as she had at bridgefield where she had always been looked on as a daughter and was now regarded as doubly their own in right of their son  so humfrey was permitted to consider her as peculiarly his own and he exerted this right of property by a certain jealousy of antony babington which amused his parents and teased the young lady nor was he wholly actuated by the jealousy of proprietorship for he knew the devotion with which antony regarded queen mary and did not wholly trust him  his sense of honour and duty to his fathers trust was one thing antonys knighterrantry to the beautiful captive was another each boy thought himself strictly honourable while they moved in parallel lines and could not understand one another yet with the reserve of childhood all that passed between them was a secret till one afternoon when loud angry sounds and suppressed sobs attracted mistress susan to the garden where she found cis crying bitterly and little diccon staring eagerly while a pitched battle was going on between her eldest son and young antony babington who were pommelling each other too furiously to perceive her approach  boys boys fie for shame she cried with a hand on the shoulder of each and they stood apart at her touch though still fiercely looking at one another  see what spectacles you have made of yourselves she continued is this your treatment of your guest humfrey  how is my lords page to show himself at chatsworth tomorrow with such an eye  what is it all about  both combatants eyed each other in sullen silence  tell me cis  tell me diccon  i will know or you shall have the rod as well as humfrey  diccon who was still in the era of timidity instead of secretiveness spoke out  he indicating his brother wanted the packet  what packet exclaimed the mother alarmed  the packet that he another nod towards antony wanted cis to give that witch in case she came while he is at chatsworth  it was the dogwhistle said cis  it hath no sound in it and antony would have me change it for him because huckster tibbott may not come within the gates  i did not want to do so i fear tibbott and when humfrey found me crying he fell on antony  so blame him not mother  if humfrey is a jealous churl and cis a little fool theres no help for it said antony disdainfully turning his back on his late adversary  then let me take charge of this whistle returned the lady moved by the universal habit of caution but antony sprang hastily to intercept her as she was taking from the little girl a small paper packet tied round with coloured yarn but he was not in time and could only exclaim nay nay madam i will not trouble you  it is nothing  master babington said susan firmly you know as well as i do that no packet may pass out of the park unopened  if you wished to have the whistle changed you should have brought it uncovered  i am sorry for the discourtesy and ask your pardon but this parcel may not pass  then said antony with difficulty repressing something much more passionate and disrespectful let me have it again  nay master babington that would not suit with my duty  the boy altogether lost his temper  duty duty he cried  i am sick of the word  all it means is a mere feigned excuse for prying and spying and besetting the most beautiful and unhappy princess in the world for her true faith and true right  master antony babington said susan gravely you had better take care what you are about  if those words of yours had been spoken in my lords hearing they would bring you worse than the rod or bread and water  what care i what i suffer for such a queen exclaimed antony  suffering is a different matter from saying what care i returned the lady as i fear you will learn master antony  o mother sweet mother said cis you will not tell of himbut mother shook her head  prithee dear mother added humfrey seeing no relenting in her countenance i did but mean to hinder cis from being maltreated and a gobetween in this traffic with an old witch not to bring tony into trouble  his face is a telltale humfrey said susan  i meant ere now to have put a piece of beef on it  come in antony and let me wash it  thank you madam i need nothing here said antony stalking proudly off while humfrey exclaiming dont be an ass tonymother no one would care to ask what we had given one another black eyes for in a friendly way tried to hold him back and he did linger when cis added her persuasions to him not to return the spectacle he was at present  if this lady will promise not to betray an unfortunate queen he said as if permission to deal with his bruises were a great reward  oh you foolish boy exclaimed mistress talbot you were never meant for a plotter you have yourself betrayed that you are her messenger  and i am not ashamed of it said antony holding his head high madam madam if you have surprised this from me you are the more bound not to betray her  think lady if you were shut up from your children and friends would you not seek to send tidings to them  child child  heaven knows i am not blaming the poor lady within there  i am only thinking what is right  well said antony somewhat hopefully if that be all give me back the packet or tear it up if you will and there can be no harm done  oh do so sweet mother entreated cis earnestly he will never bid me go to tibbott again  ay said humfrey then no tales will be told  for even he with all his trustworthiness or indeed because of it could not bear to bring a comrade to disgrace but the dilemma was put an end to by the sudden appearance on the scene of captain richard himself demanding the cause of the disturbance and whether his sons had been misbehaving to their guest  dear sir sweet father do not ask entreated cis springing to him and taking his hand as she was privileged to do mother has come and it is all made up and over now  richard talbot however had seen the packet which his wife was holding and her anxious perplexed countenance and the perilous atmosphere of suspicion around him made it incumbent on him to turn to her and say what means this mother  is it as cis would have me believe a mere childish quarrel that i may pass over or what is this packet  master babington saith it is a dogwhistle which he was leaving in charge with cis to exchange for another with huckstress tibbott she answered  feelnay open it and see if it be not sir cried antony  i doubt not that so it is said the captain but you know master babington that it is the duty of all here in charge to let no packet pass the gate which has not been viewed by my lords officers  then sir i will take it back again said antony with a vain attempt at making his brow frank and clear  instead of answering  captain talbot took the knife from his girdle and cut in twain the yarn that bound the packet  there was no doubt about the whistle being there nor was there anything written on the wrapper but perhaps the anxiety in antonys eye or even the old association with boatswains incited mr talbot to put the whistle to his lips  not a sound would come forth  he looked in and saw what led him to blow with all his force when a white roll of paper protruded and on another blast fell out into his hand  he held it up as he found it and looked full at antony who exclaimed in much agitation to keep out the dust  only to keep out the dust it is all gibberishfrom my old writingbooks  that will we see said richard very gravely  mistress be pleased to give this young gentleman some water to wash his face and attend to his bruises keeping him in the guestchamber without speech from any one until i return  master babington i counsel you to submit quietly  i wish and my lord will wish to spare his ward as much scandal as possible and if this be what you say it is mere gibberish from your exercisebooks you will be quit for chastisement for a forbidden act which has brought you into suspicion if not it must be as my lord thinks good  antony made no entreaties  perhaps he trusted that what was unintelligible to himself might pass for gibberish with others perhaps the headache caused by humfreys fists was assisting to produce a state of sullen indifference after his burst of eager chivalry at any rate he let mistress talbot lead him away without resistance  the other children would have followed but their father detained them to hear the particulars of the commission and the capture  richard desired to know from his son whether he had any reason for suspecting underhand measures and when humfrey looked down and hesitated added on your obedience boy this is no slight matter  you will not beat cis father said humfrey  wherefore should i beat her save for doing errands that yonder lad should have known better than to thrust on her  nay sir tis not for that but my mother said she should be beaten if ever she spake of the fortune yonder tibbott told her and we are sure that shetibbott i meanis a witch and knows more than she ought  what meanst thou  tell me children and cis nothing loath since she was secured from the beating related the augury which had left so deep an impression on her humfrey bearing witness that it was before they knew themselves of cicelys history  but that is not all added cicely seeing mr talbot less impressed than she expected by these supernatural powers of divination  she can change from a woman to a man  in sooth exclaimed richard startled enough by this information  yea father said cicely faithful ekins the carriers boy saw her in doublet and hose and a tawny cloak going along the road to chesterfield  he knew her by the halt in her left leg  ha said richard and how long hast thou known this  only yestermorn said cis it was that which made me so much afraid to have any dealings with her  she shall trouble thee no more my little wench said richard in a tone that made humfrey cry out joyously  o father sweet father wilt thou duck her for a witch  sink or swim that will be rare  hush hush foolish lad said richard and thou cicely take good heed that not a word of all this gets abroad  go to thy mother childnay i am not wroth with thee little one  thou hast not done amiss but bear in mind that nought is ever taken out of the park without knowledge of me or of thy mother     chapter vii  the blast of the whistle   richard talbot was of course convinced that witchcraft was not likely to be the most serious part of the misdeeds of tibbott the huckstress committing antony babington to the custody of his wife he sped on his way back to the manorhouse where lord shrewsbury was at present residing the countess being gone to view her buildings at chatsworth taking her daughter bessie with her  he sent in a message desiring to speak to my lord in his privy chamber  francis talbot came to him  is it matter of great moment dick he said for my father is so fretted and chafed i would fain not vex him further tonightwhat know you not  here are tidings that my lady hath married bessyes bess cavendish in secret to my young lord lennox the brother of this queens unlucky husband  how he is to clear himself before her grace of being concerned in it i know not for though heaven wots that he is as innocent as the child unborn she will suspect him  i knew she flew high for mistress bess returned richard  high nothing would serve her save royal blood  my poor father says as sure as the lions and fleurdelis have come into a family the headsmans axe has come after them  however it is not our family  so i tell him but it gives him small comfort said frank looking as he doth on the cavendish brood as his own and knowing that there will be a mighty coil at once with my lady and these two queens  he is sore vexed tonight and saith that never was earl not to say man so baited by woman as he and he bade me see whether yours be a matter of such moment that it may not wait till morning or be despatched by me  that is for you to say master francis  what think you of this for a toy as he produced the parcel with the whistle and its contents i went home betimes today as you know and found my boy humfrey had just made young master babington taste of his fists for trying to make our little wench pass this packet to yonder hucksterwoman who was succoured some months back by the queen of scots  francis talbot silently took the whistle and unrolled the long narrow strip of paper  this is the cipher said he the cipher used in corresponding with her french kin phillipps the decipherer showed me the trick of it when he was at tutbury in the time of the duke of norfolks business  soh your son hath done good service richard that lad hath been tampered with then i thought he was over thick with the lady in the lodge  where is he the young traitor  at bridgefield under my wifes ward having his bruises attended to i would not bring him up here till i knew what my lord would have done with him  he is but a child and no doubt was wrought with by sweet looks and i trust my lord will not be hard with him  if my father had hearkened to me he should never have been here said francis  his father was an honest man but his mother was i find a secret recusant and when she died young antony was quite old enough to have sucked in the poison  you did well to keep him richard he ought not to return hither again either in ward or at liberty  if he were mine i would send him to school said richard where the masters and the lads would soon drive out of him all dreams about captive princesses and seminary priests to boot  for cousin francis i would have you to know that my children say there is a rumour that this woman tibbott the huckstress hath been seen in a doublet and hose near chesterfield  the villain  when is she looked for here again  anon i should suppose judging by the boy leaving this charge with cis in case she should come while he is gone to chatsworth  we will take order as to that said francis compressing his lips i know you will take heed cousin that she or he gets no breath of warning  i should not wonder if it were parsons himself and he unfolded the scroll with the air of a man seeking to confirm his triumph  can you make anything of it asked richard struck by its resemblance to another scroll laid up among his wifes treasures  i cannot tell they are not matters to be read in an hour said francis talbot moreover there is one in use for the english traitors her friends and another for the french  this looks like the french sort  let me see they are read by taking the third letter in each second word  francis talbot somewhat proud of his proficiency and perfectly certain of the trustworthiness of his cousin richard went on puzzling out the ciphered letters making richard set each letter down as he picked it out and trying whether they would make sense in french or english  both understood french having learned it in their page days and kept it up by intercourse with the french suite  francis however had to try two or three methods which being a young man perhaps he was pleased to display and at last he hit upon the right which interpreted the apparent gibberish of the scrollexcepting that the names of persons were concealed under soubriquets which francis talbot could not always understandbut the following sentence by and by became clearquand le matelot vient des marais un feu peut eclater dans la meute et dans la meleewhen the sailor lands from the fens a fire might easily break out in the dogkennel and in the confusion name could not be read could carry off the tercel gentle  la meute said francis that is their term for the home of us talbots and the sailor in the fens is this don john of austria who means after conquering the dutchmen to come and set free this tercel gentle as she calls herself and play the inquisitor upon us on my honour dick your boy has played the man in making this discovery keep the young traitor fast and take down a couple of yeomen to lay hands on this same tibbott as she calls herself  if i remember right said richard she was said to be the sister or aunt to one of the grooms or prickers  so it was guy norman methinks  belike he was the very fellow to set fire to our kennel  yea we must secure him  ill see to that and you shall lay this scroll before my father meantime dick  why to fall on such a trail will restore his spirits and win back her grace to believe in his honesty if my ladys tricks should have made her doubtful  off went francis with great alacrity and ere long the earl was present with richard  the long light beard was now tinged with gray and there were deep lines round the mouth and temples betraying how the long anxiety was telling on him and rendering him suspicious and querulous soh  richard talbot was his salutation whats the coil now  can a man never be left in peace in his own house between queens and ladies plots and follies but his own kinsfolk and retainers must come to him on every petty broil among the lads  i should have thought your boy and young babington might fight out their quarrels alone without vexing a man that is near driven distracted as it is  i grieve to vex your lordship said richard standing bareheaded but master francis thought this scroll worthy of your attention this is the manner in which he deciphered it  scrolls i am sick of scrolls said the earl testily  what is it some order for saying massor to get some new popish image or a skein of silk  i wear my eyes out reading such as that and racking my brains for some hidden meaning  and falling on franciss first attempt at copying he was scornful of the whole and had nearly thrown the matter aside but when he lit at last on the sentence about burning the meute and carrying off the tercel gentle his brow grew dark indeed and his inquiries came thickly one upon the other both as to antony babington and the huckstering woman  in the midst frank talbot returned with the tidings that the pricker guy norman was nowhere to be found  he had last been seen by his comrades about the time that captain richard had returned to the manorhouse  probably he had taken alarm on seeing him come back at that unusual hour and had gone to carry the warning to his supposed aunt  this last intelligence made the earl decide on going down at once to bridgefield to examine young babington before there was time to miss his presence at the lodge or to hold any communication with him frank caused horses to be brought round and the earl rode down with richard by a shaded alley in an ordinary cloak and hat  my lords appearance at bridgefield was a rarer and more awful event than was my ladys and if mistress susan had been warned beforehand there is no saying how at the head of her men and maids she would have scrubbed and polished the floors and brushed the hangings and cushions  what then were her feelings when the rider who dismounted from his little hackney as unpretendingly as did her husband in the twilight court proved to have my lords long beard and narrow face  curtseying her lowest and with a feeling of consternation and pity as she thought of the orphan boy she accepted his greeting with duteous welcome as he said kinswoman i am come to cumber you whilst i inquire into this matter  i give your son thanks for the honesty and faithfulness he hath shown in the matter as befitted his fathers son i should wish myself to examine the springald  humfrey was accordingly called and privately admonished by his father that he must not allow any scruples about bringing his playmate into trouble to lead him to withhold his evidence or shrink from telling the whole truth as he knew it humfrey accordingly stood before the earl and made his replies a little sullenly but quite straightforwardly  he had prevented the whistle from being given to his sister for the huckstress because the woman was a witch who frightened her and moreover he knew it was against rules  did he suspect that the whistle came from the queen of scots  he looked startled and asked if it were so indeed and when again commanded to say why he had thought it possible he replied that he knew antony thought the queen of scots a fair and gracious lady  did he believe that antony ever had communication with her or her people unheard by others  assuredly  wherefore not when he carried my lady countesss messages  lord shrewsbury bent his brow but did not further pursue this branch of the subject but demanded of humfrey a description of tibbott huckster or witch man or woman  she wears a big black hood and muffler said humfrey and hath a long hooked stick  i asked thee not of her muffler boy but of her person  she hath pouncet boxes and hawks bells and dogwhistles in her basket proceeded humfrey but as the earl waxed impatient and demanded whether no one could give him a clearer account richard bade humfrey call his mother  she however could say nothing as to the womans appearance  she had gone to normans cottage to offer her services after the supposed accident but had been told that the potticary of the queen of scots had undertaken her cure and had only seen her huddled up in a heap of rags asleep  since her recovery the woman had been several times at bridgefield but it had struck the mistress of the house that there was a certain avoidance of direct communication with her and a preference for the servants and children  this susan had ascribed to fear that she should be warned off for her fortunetelling propensities or the childrens little bargains interfered with  all she could answer for was that she had once seen a huge pair of grizzled eyebrows with light eyes under them and that the woman if woman she were was tall and bent a good deal upon a hooked stick which supported her limping steps  cicely could say little more except that the witch had a deep awesome voice like a man and a long nose terrible to look at indeed there seemed to have been a sort of awful fascination about her to all the children who feared her yet ran after her  antony was then sent for  it was not easy to judge of the expression of his disfigured countenance but when thus brought to bay he threw off all tokens of compunction and stood boldly before the earl  so master babington i find you have been betraying the trust i placed in you  what trust my lord said antony his bright blue eyes looking back into those of the nobleman  the cockerel crows loud said the earl  what trust quotha  is there no trust implied in the coming and going of one of my household when such a charge is committed to me and mine  no one ever gave me any charge said antony  dost thou bandy words thou froward imp said the earl  thou hast not the conscience to deny that there was no honesty in smuggling forth a letter thus hidden  deny it not  the treasonable cipher hath been read  i knew nought of what was in it said the boy  i believe thee there but thou didst know that it was foully disloyal to me and to her majesty to bear forth secret letters to disguised traitors  i am willing to believe that the smooth tongue which hath deluded many a better man than thou hath led thee astray and i am willing to deal as lightly with thee as may be so thou wilt tell me openly all thou knowest of this infamous plot  i know of no plot sir  they would scarce commit the knowledge to the like of him said richard talbot  may be not said lord shrewsbury looking at him with a glance that antony thought contemptuous and which prompted him to exclaim and if i did know of one you may be assured i would never betray it were i torn with wild horses  betray sayest thou returned the earl  thou hast betrayed my confidence antony and hast gone as far as in thee lies to betray thy queen  my queen is mary the lawful queen of us all replied antony boldly  ho  sayest thou so  it is then as thou didst trow cousin the foolish lad hath been tampered with by the honeyed tongue  i need not ask thee from whom thou hadst this letter boy  we have read it and know the foul treason therein  thou wilt never return to the castle again but for thy fathers sake thou shalt be dealt with less sternly if thou wilt tell who this woman is and how many of these toys thou hast given to her if thou knowest who she is  but antony closed his lips resolutely  in fact richard suspected him of being somewhat flattered by being the cause of such a commotion and actually accused of so grand and manly a crime as high treason  the earl could extract no word and finally sentenced him to remain at bridgefield shut up in his own chamber till he could be dealt with the lad walked away in a dignified manner and the earl holding up his hands half amused half vexed said so the spell is on that poor lad likewise  what shall i do with him  an orphan boy too and mine old friends son  with your favour my lord said richard i should say send him to a grammar school where among lads of his own age the dreams about captive princesses might be driven from him by hard blows and merry games  that may scarce serve said the earl rather severely for public schools were then held beneath the dignity of both the nobility and higher gentry  i may however send him to study at cambridge under some trusty pedagogue  back at the castle i cannot have him so must i cumber you with him my good kinswoman until his face have recovered your sons lusty chastisement  also it may be well to keep him here till we can lay hands on this same hucksterwoman since there may be need to confront him with her  it were best if you did scour the country toward chesterfield for her while frank went to york  having thus issued his orders the earl took a gracious leave of the lady mounted his horse and rode back to sheffield dispensing with the attendance of his kinsman who had indeed to prepare for an early start the next morning when he meant to take humfrey with him as not unlikely to recognise the woman though he could not describe her  the boy merits well to go forth with me said he  he hath done yeomans service and proved himself staunch and faithful  was there matter in that scroll asked susan  only such slight matter as burning down the talbots kennel while don john of austria is landing on the coast  god forgive them and defend us sighed susan turning pale  was that in the cipher  ay in sooth but fear not good wife  much is purposed that neer comes to pass  i doubt me if the ship be built that is to carry the don hither  i trust that antony knew not of the wickedness  not he  his is only a dream out of the romances the lads love so well of beauteous princesses to be freed and the like  but the woman  yea that lies deeper  what didst thou say of her  wherefore do the children call her a witch  is it only that she is grim and ugly  i trow there is more cause than that said susan  it may be that i should have taken more heed to their babble at first but i have questioned cis while you were at the lodge and i find that even before mate goatley spake here this tibbott had told the child of her being of lofty race in the north alien to the talbots kennel holding out to her presages of some princely destiny  that bodeth ill said richard thoughtfully  wife my soul misgives me that the hand of cuthbert langston is in this  susan started  the idea chimed in with tibbotts avoidance of her scrutiny and also with a certain vague sense she had had of having seen those eyes before  so lightcomplexioned a man would be easily disguised and the halt was accounted for by a report that he had had a bad fall when riding to join in the rising in the north  nor could there now be any doubt that he was an ardent partisan of the imprisoned mary while richard had always known his inclination to intrigue  she could only agree with her husbands opinion and ask what he would do  my duty must be done kin or no kin said richard that is if i find him but i look not to do that since norman is no doubt off to warn him  i marvel whether he hath really learnt who our cis can be  belike not  the hint would only have been thrown out to gain power over her  said you that you read the cipher  master frank did so  would it serve you to read our scroll  ah woman woman  why can thy kind never let well alone  i have sufficient on my hands without reading of scrolls  humfreys delight was extreme when he found that he was to ride forth with his father and halfadozen of the earls yeomen in search of the supposed witch  they traced her as far as chesterfield but having met the carriers waggon on the way they carefully examined faithful ekins on his report but all the youth was clear about was the halt and the orange tawny cloak and after entering chesterfield no one knew anything of these tokens  there was a large village belonging to a family of recusants not far off where the pursuers generally did lose sight of suspicious persons and perhaps richard was relieved though his son was greatly chagrined  the good captain had a sufficient regard for his kinsman to be unwilling to have to unmask him as a traitor and to be glad that he should have effected an escape so that at least it should be others who should detect himif langston indeed it were  his next charge was to escort young babington to cambridge and deliver him up to a tutor of his lordships selection who might draw the popish fancies out of him  meantime antony had been kept close to the house and garden and not allowed any intercourse with any of the young people save humfrey except when the master or mistress of the house was present but he did not want for occupation for master sniggius came down and gave him a long chapter of the book of proverbschiefly upon loyalty in the septuagint to learn by heart and translate into latin and english as his saturdays and sundays occupation under pain of a flogging which was no light thing from the hands of that redoubted dominie  young babington was halfflattered and halffrightened at the commotion he had excited  am i going to the tower he asked in a low voice awestricken yet not without a certain ring of selfimportance when he saw his mails brought down and was bidden to put on his boots and his travelling dress  and captain talbot had a cruel satisfaction in replying no master babington the tower is not for refractory boys  you are going to your schoolmaster  but where the school was to be richard kept an absolute secret by special desire in order that no communication should be kept up through any of the household  he was to avoid chatsworth and to return as soon as possible to endeavour to trace the supposed hucksterwoman at chesterfield  when once away from home he ceased to treat young babington as a criminal but rode in a friendly manner with him through lanes and over moors till the young fellow began to thaw towards him and even went so far as to volunteer one day that he would not have brought mistress cicely into the matter if there had been any other sure way of getting the letter delivered in his absence  ah boy returned richard when once we swerve from the open and direct paths there is no saying into what tangles we may bring ourselves and others  antony winced a little and said whoever says i lied lies in his throat  no one hath said thou wert false in word but how as to thy deed  sir said antony surely when a high emprise and great right is to be done there is no need to halt over such petty quibbles  master babington no great right was ever done through a little wrong depend on it if you cannot aid without a breach of trust it is the sure sign that it is not the will of god that you should be the one to do it  captain talbot mused whether he should convince or only weary the lad by an argument he had once heard in a sermon that the force of satans temptation to our blessed lord when showing him all the kingdoms of the world must have been the absolute and immediate vanishing of all kinds of evil by a voluntary abdication on the part of the prince of this world instead not only of the coming anguish of the strife but of the long long often losing battle which has been waging ever since  yet for this great achievement he would not commit the moments sin  he was just about to begin when antony broke in then sir you do deem it a great wrong  that i leave to wiser heads than mine returned the sailor  my duty is to obey my lord his duty is to obey her grace  that is all a plain man needs to see  but an if the true queen be thus mewed up sir asked antony richard was too wise a man to threaten the suggestion down as rank treason well knowing that thus he should never root it out  look you here antony he said who ought to reign is a question of birth such as neither of us can understand nor judge  but we know thus much that her grace queen elizabeth hath been crowned and anointed and received oaths of fealty as her due and that is quite enough for any honest man  even when she keeps in durance the queen who came as her guest in dire distress  nay master antony you are not old enough to remember that the durance began not until the queen of scots tried to form a party for herself among the english liegemen  and didst thou know thou simple lad what the letter bore which thou didst carry and what it would bring on this peaceful land  antony looked a little startled when he heard of the burning of the kennel but he averred that don john was a gallant prince  i have seen more than one gallant spaniard under whose power i should grieve to see any friend of mine  all the rest of the way richard talbot entertained the young gentleman with stories of his own voyages and adventures into which he managed to bring traits of spanish cruelty and barbarity as shown in the low countries such as without actually drawing the moral every time might show what was to be expected if mary of scotland and don john of austria were to reign over england armed with the inquisition  antony asked a good many questions and when he found that the captain had actually been an eyewitness of the state of a country harried by the spaniards he seemed a good deal struck  i think if i had the training of him i could make a loyal englishman of him yet said richard talbot to his wife on his return  but i fear me there is that in his heart and his conscience which will only grow while yonder sourfaced doctor with whom i had to leave him at cambridge preaches to him of the perdition of pope and papists  if his mother were indeed a concealed papist said susan such sermons will only revolt the poor child  yea truly  if my lord wanted to make a plotter and a papist of the boy he could scarce find a better means  i myself never could away with yonder ladys blandishments  but when he thinks of her in contrast to yonder divine it would take a stronger head than his not to be led away  the best chance for him is that the stir of the world about him may put captive princesses out of his head     chapter viii  the key of the cipher   where is the man who does not persuade himself that when he gratifies his own curiosity he does so for the sake of his womankind  so richard talbot having made his protest waited two days but when next he had any leisure moments before him on a sunday evening he said to his wife sue what hast thou done with that scroll of cissys  i trow thou wilt not rest till thou art convinced it is but some lying horoscope or popish charm  susan had in truth been resting in perfect quietness being extremely busy over her spinning so as to be ready for the weaver who came round periodically to direct the more artistic portions of domestic work however she joyfully produced the scroll from the depths of the casket where she kept her chief treasures and her spindle often paused in its dance as she watched her husband over it with his elbows on the table and his hands in his hair from whence he only removed them now and then to set down a letter or two by way of experiment  she had to be patient for she heard nothing that night but that he believed it was french that the father of deceits himself might be puzzled with the thing and that she might as well ask him for his head at once as propose his consulting master francis  the next night he unfolded it with many a groan and would say nothing at all but he sat up late and waked in early dawn to pore over it again and on the third day of study he uttered a loud exclamation of dismay but he ordered susan off to bed in the midst and did not utter anything but a perplexed groan or two when he followed her much later  it was not till the next night that she heard anything and then in the darkness he began susan thou art a good wife and a discreet woman  perhaps her heart leapt as she thought to herself at last it is coming i knew it would but she only made some innocent note of attention  thou hast asked no questions nor tried to pry into this unhappy mystery he went on  i knew you would tell me what was fit for me to hear she replied  fit  it is fit for no one to hear  yet i needs must take counsel with thee and thou hast shown thou canst keep a close mouth so far  concerns it our cissy husband  ay does it our cissy indeed  what wouldst say sue to hear she was daughter to the lady yonder  to the queen of scots  hush hush fairly grasping her to hinder the words from being uttered above her breath  and her father  that villain bothwell of course  poor lassie she is ill fathered  you may say so  is it in the scroll  ay so far as i can unravel it but besides the cipher no doubt much was left for the poor woman to tell that was lost in the wreck  and he went on to explain that the scroll was a letter to the abbess of soissons who was aunt to queen mary as was well known since an open correspondence was kept up through the french ambassador  this letter said that our trusty alison hepburn would tell how in secrecy and distress queen mary had given birth to this poor child in lochleven and how she had been conveyed across the lake while only a few hours old after being hastily baptized by the name of bride one of the patron saints of scotland  she had been nursed in a cottage for a few weeks till the queen had made her first vain attempt to escape after which mary had decided on sending her with her nurse to dumbarton castle whence lord flemyng would despatch her to france the abbess was implored to shelter her in complete ignorance of her birth until such time as her mother should resume her liberty and her throne  or if the poor queen said i perish in the hands of my enemies you will deal with her as my uncles of guise and lorraine think fit since should her unhappy little brother die in the rude hands of yonder traitors she may bring the true faith back to both realms  ah cried susan with a sudden gasp of dismay as she bethought her that the child was indeed heiress to both realms after the young king of scots  but has there been no quest after her  do they deem her lost  no doubt they do  either all hands were lost in the bride of dunbar or if any of the crew escaped they would report the loss of nurse and child  the few who know that the little one was born believe her to have perished  none will ever ask for her  they deem that she has been at the bottom of the sea these twelve years or more  and you would still keep the knowledge to ourselves asked his wife in a tone of relief  i would i knew it not myself sighed richard  would that i could blot it out of my mind  it were far happier for the poor maid herself to remain no ones child but ours said susan  in sooth it is  a drop of royal blood is in these days a mere drop of poison to them that have the ill luck to inherit it  as my lord said the other day it brings the headsmans axe after it  and our boy humfrey calls himself contracted to her  so long as we let the secret die with us that can do her no ill happily the wench favours not her mother save sometimes in a certain lordly carriage of the head and shoulders  she is like enough to some of the scots retinue to make me think she must take her face from her father the villain who someone told me was beetlebrowed and swarthy  lives he still  so tis thought but somewhere in prison in the north  there have been no tidings of his death but my lady queen youll remember treats the marriage as nought and has made offer of herself for the misfortune of the duke of norfolk ay and of this don john and i know not whom besides  she would not have done that had she known that our cis was alive  mayhap she would mayhap not  i believe myself she would do anything short of disowning her popery to get out of prison but as matters stand i doubt me whether cis  the lady bride hepburn suggested susan  pshaw poor child i misdoubt me whether they would own her claim even to that name  and they might put her in prison if they did said susan  they would be sure to do so sooner or later  here has my lord been recounting in his trouble about my ladys fine match for her bess all that hath come of mating with royal blood the very least disaster being poor lady mary greys  kept in ward for life  it is a cruel matter  i would that i had known the cipher at first  then she might either have been disposed of at the queens will or have been sent safe to this nunnery at soissons  to be bred a papist  oh fie husband  and to breed dissension in the kingdoms added her husband  it is best so far for the poor maiden herself to have thy tender hand over her than that of any queen or abbess of them all  shall we then keep all things as they are and lock this knowledge in our own hearts asked susan hopefully  to that am i mightily inclined said richard  were it blazed abroad at once thou and i might be made out guilty of i know not what for concealing it and as to the maiden she would either be put in close ward with her mother or what would be more likely had up to court to be watched and flouted and spied upon as were the two poor ladiessisters to the lady janeere they made their lot hopeless by marrying  nay i have seen those who told me that poor lady katherine was scarce worse bested in the tower than she was while at court  my poor cis  no no  the only cause for which i could bear to yield her up would be the thought that she would bring comfort to the heart of the poor captive mother who hath the best right to her  forsooth  i suspect her poor captive mother would scarce be pleased to find this witness to her illadvised marriage in existence  nor would she be permitted to be with her  assuredly not  moreover what could she do with the poor child  rear her in popery exclaimed susan to whom the word was terrible  yea and make her hand secure as the bait to some foreign prince or some english traitor who would fain overthrow queen and church  susan shuddered  oh yes let us keep the poor child to ourselves i could not give her up to such a lot as that  and it might imperil you too my husband  i should like to get up instantly and burn the scroll  i doubt me whether that were expedient said richard  suppose it were in the course of providence that the young king of scots should not live then would this maid be the means of uniting the two kingdoms in the true and reformed faith  heaven forefend that he should be cut off but meseemeth that we have no right to destroy the evidence that may one day be a precious thing to the kingdom at large  no chance eye could read it even were it discovered said susan  no indeed  thou knowest how i strove in vain to read it at first and even now when frank talbot unwittingly gave me the key it was days before i could fully read it  it will tell no tales sweet wife that can prejudice any one so we will let it be even with the baby clouts  so now to sleep with no more thoughts on the matter  that was easy to say but susan lay awake long pondering over the wonder and only slept to dream strange dreams of queens and princesses ay and worse for she finally awoke with a scream thinking her husband was on the scaffold and that humfrey and cis were walking up the ladder hand in hand with their necks bared to follow him  there was no need to bid her hold her tongue  she regarded the secret with dread and horror and a sense of something amiss which she could not quite define though she told herself she was only acting in obedience to her husband and indeed her judgment went along with his  often she looked at the unconscious cis studying whether the childs parentage could be detected in her features  but she gave promise of being of larger frame than her mother who had the fine limbs and contour of her lorraine ancestry whereas cis did as richard said seem to have the sturdy outlines of the borderer race from whom her father came  she was roundfaced too and sunburnt with deep gray eyes under black straight brows capable of frowning heavily  she did not look likely ever to be the fascinating beauty which all declared her mother to bethough those who saw the captive at sheffield believed the charm to be more in indefinable grace than in actual featuresin a certain wonderful smile and sparkle a mixed pathos and archness which seldom failed of its momentary effect even upon those who most rebelled against it  poor little cis a sturdy girl of twelve or thirteen playing at ball with little ned on the terrace and coming with tardy steps to her daily task of spinning had little of the princess about her and yet when she sat down and the management of distaff and thread threw her shoulders back there was something in the poise of her small head and the gesture of her hand that forcibly recalled the queen  moreover all the boys around were at her beck and call not only humfrey and poor antony babington but cavendishes pierrepoints all the young pages and grandsons who dwelt at castle or lodge and attended master sniggiuss school  nay the dominie himself though owning that mistress cicely promoted idleness and inattention among his pupils had actually volunteered to come down to bridgefield twice a week himself to prevent her from forgetting her lillys grammar and her caesars commentaries an attention with which this young lady would willingly have dispensed  stewart lorraine hepburn the blood of all combined was a perilous inheritance and good susan talbots instinct was that the young girl whom she loved truly like her own daughter would need all the more careful and tender watchfulness and training to overcome any tendencies that might descend to her  pity increased her affection and even while in ordinary household life it was easy to forget who and what the girl really was yet cis was conscious that she was admitted to the intimacy and privileges of an elder daughter and made a companion and friend while her contemporaries at the manorhouse were treated as children and rated roundly their fingers tapped with fans their shoulders even whipped whenever they transgressed  cis did indeed live under equal restraint but it was the wise and gentle restraint of firm influence and constant watchfulness which took from her the wish to resist     chapter ix  unquiet   bridgefield was a peaceable household and the castle and manor beyond might envy its calm  from the time of the marriage of elizabeth cavendish with the young earl of lennox all the shreds of comfort which had remained to the unfortunate earl had vanished  first he had to clear himself before queen elizabeth from having been a consenting party and then he found his wife furious with him at his displeasure at her daughters aggrandisement  moreover whereas she had formerly been on terms of friendly gossiphood with the scottish queen she now went over to the lennox side because her favourite daughter had married among them and it was evident that from that moment all amity between her and the prisoner was at an end  she was enraged that her husband would not at once change his whole treatment of the queen and treat her as such guilt deserved and with the illogical dulness of a passionate woman she utterly scouted and failed to comprehend the argument that the unhappy mary was to say the least of it no more guilty now than when she came into their keeping and that to alter their demeanour towards her would be unjust and unreasonable  my lady is altogether beyond reason said captain talbot returning one evening to his wife neither my lord nor her daughter can do ought with her so puffed up is she with this marriage  moreover she is hotly angered that young babington should have been sent away from her retinue without notice to her and demands our humfrey in his stead as a page  he is surely too old for a page said his mother thinking of her tall wellgrown son of fifteen  so said i returned richard  i had sooner it were diccon and so i told his lordship  before richard could speak for them the two boys came in eager and breathless  father cried humfrey who think you is at hull why none other than your old friend and shipmate captain frobisher  ha  martin frobisher  who told thee humfrey  faithful ekins sir who had it from the doncaster carrier who saw captain frobisher himself and was asked by him if you sir were not somewhere in yorkshire and if so to let you know that he will be in hull till mayday getting men together for a voyage to the northwards where there is gold to be had for the pickingand if you had a likely son or two now was the time to make their fortunes and show them the world  he said any way you might ride to see an old comrade  a long message for two carriers said richard talbot smiling but martin never was a scribe  but sir you will let me go cried humfrey eagerly  i mean i pray you to let me go  dear mother say nought against it entreated the youth  cis think of my bringing thee home a gold bracelet like mothers  what said his father when my lady has just craved thee for a page  a page said humfrey with infinite contemptto hear all their tales and bickerings hold skeins of silk amble mincingly along galleries be begged to bear messages that may have more in them than one knows and be noted for a bear if one refuses  the father and cis laughed the mother looked unhappy  so martin is at hull is he said richard musingly  if my lord can give me leave for a week or fortnight methinks i must ride to see the stout old knave  and oh sweet father prithee take me with you entreated humfrey if it be only to come back again  i have not seen the sea since we came here and yet the sound is in my ears as i fall asleep  i entreat of you to let me come good my father  and good father let me come exclaimed diccon i have never even seen the sea  and dear sweet father take me entreated little ned  nay cried cis what should i do  here is antony babington borne off to cambridge and you all wanting to leave me  ill come home better worth than he muttered humfrey who thought he saw consent on his fathers brow and drew her aside into the deep window  youll come back a rude sailor smelling of pitch and tar and antony will be a wellbred pointdevice scholar who will know how to give a lady his hand said the teasing girl  and so the playful war was carried on while the father having silenced and dismissed the two younger lads expressed his intention of obtaining leave of absence if possible from the earl  yea he added to his wife i shall even let humfrey go with me it is time he looked beyond the walls of this place which is little better than a prison  and will you let him go on this strange voyage she asked wistfully he our firstborn and our heir  for that dame remember his namesake my poor brother was the one who stayed at home i the one to go forth and here am i now  the lads words may have set before thee weightier perils in yonder park than he is like to meet among seals and bears under honest old martin  yet here he has your guidance said susan  who knows how they might play on his honour as to talebearing  nay good wife when thou hast thought it over thou wilt see that far fouler shoals and straits lie up yonder than in the free open sea that god almighty made  martin is a devout and godly man who hath matins and evensong on board each day when the weather is not too foul and looks well that there be no illdoings in his ship and if he have a berth for thy lad it will be a better school for him than where twothirds of the household are raging against one another and the third ever striving to corrupt and outwit the rest  i am weary of it all  would that i could once get into blue water again and leave it all behind  you will not  oh you will not implored susan  remember my dear good lord how you said all your duties lay at home  i remember my good housewife  thou needst not fear for me  but there is little time to spare  if i am to see mine old friend i must get speech of my lord tonight so as to be on horseback tomorrow saddle me brown dumpling boys  and as the boys went off persuading cis who went coyly protesting that the paddock was damp yet still following after them he added yea sue considering all it is better those two were apart for a year or so till we see better what is this strange nestling that we have reared  ay thou art like the mother sparrow that hath bred up a cuckoo and doteth on it yet it mateth not with her brood  it casteth them out said susan as thou art doing now by your leave husband  only for a flight gentle mother he answered only for a flight to prove meanwhile whether there be the making of a simple household bird or of a hawk that might tear her mate to pieces in yonder nestling  susan was too dutiful a wife to say more though her motherly heart was wrung almost as much at the implied distrust of her adopted daughter as by the sudden parting with her firstborn to the dangers of the northern seas  she could better enter into her husbands fears of the temptations of page life at sheffield and being altogether a wife bonner and boughsome as her marriage vow held it she applied herself and cis to the choosing of the shirts and the crimping of the ruffs that were to appear in hull if for there was this hope at the bottom of her heart my lord might refuse leave of absence to his gentleman porter  the hope was fallacious richard reported that my lord was so much relieved to find that he had detected no fresh conspiracy as to be willing to grant him a fortnights leave and even had said with a sigh that he was in the right ont about his son for sheffield was more of a school for plotting than for chivalry  it was a point of honour with every good housewife to have a store of linen equal to any emergency and indeed as there were no washing days in the winter the stock of personal bodylinen was at all times nearly a sufficient outfit so the main of humfreys shirts were to be despatched by a carrier in the trust that they would reach him before the expedition should sail  there was then little to delay the father and son after the mother with fastgathering tears resolutely forced back had packed and strapped their mails with ciss help humfrey standing by booted and spurred and talking fast of the wonders he should see and the gold and ivory he should bring home to hide the qualms of homesickness and mothersickness he was already beginning to feel and maybe to get cis to pronounce that then she should think more of him than of antony babington with his airs and graces  wistfully did the lad watch for some such tender assurance but cis seemed all provoking brilliancy and teasing  she knew he would be back over soon  oh no he would never go to sea  she feared not  mr frobisher would have none of such awkward lubbers  mores the pity there would be some peace to get to do her broidery and leave to play on the virginals when he was gone  but when the horsemen had disappeared down the avenue cis hid herself in a corner and cried as if her heart would break  she cried again behind the back of the tall settle when the father came back alone full of praises of captain frobisher his ship and his company and his assurances that he would watch over humfrey like his own son  meantime the domestic storms at the park were such that master richard and his wife were not sorry that the boy was not growing up in the midst of them though the countess rated susan severely for her ingratitude  queen elizabeth was of course much angered at the lennox match and the earl had to write letter after letter to clear himself from any participation in bringing it about  queen mary also wrote to clear herself of it and to show that she absolutely regretted it as she had small esteem for bess cavendish  moreover though lady shrewsburys friendship might not be a very pleasant thing it was at least better than her hostility  however she was not much at sheffield  not only was she very angry with her husband but queen elizabeth had strictly forbidden the young lord lennox from coming under the same roof with his royal sisterinlaw  he was a weakly youth and his wifes health failed immediately after her marriage so that lady shrewsbury remained almost constantly at chatsworth with her darling  gilbert talbot who was the chief peacemaker of the family went to and fro wrote letters and did his best which would have been more effective but for mary his wife who no doubt detailed all the gossip of sheffield at chatsworth as she certainly amused sheffield with stories of her sister bess as a royal countess full of airs and humours and her mother treating her if not as a queen at least on the high road to become one and how the haughty dame of shrewsbury ran willingly to pick up her daughters kerchief and stood over the fire stirring the posset rather than let it fail to tempt the appetite which became more dainty by being cossetted  the difference made between lady lennox and her elder sisters was not a little nettling to dame mary talbot who held that some consideration was her due as the proud mother of the only grandson of the house of shrewsbury little george who was just able to be put on horseback in the court and say he was riding to see lady danmode and to drink the health of lady danmode at his meals  alas the little hope of the talbots suddenly faded  one evening after supper a message came down in haste to beg for the aid of mistress susan who though much left to the seclusion of bridgefield in prosperous days was always a resource in trouble or difficulty little george then two and a half years old had been taken suddenly ill after a supper on marchpane and plum broth washed down by christmas ale  convulsions had come on and the skill of queen marys apothecary had only gone so far as to bleed him  susan arrived only just in time to see the child breathe his last sigh and to have his mother wild with tumultuous clamorous grief put into her hands for such soothing and comforting as might be possible and the good and tender woman did her best to turn the mothers thoughts to something higher and better than the bewailing at one moment her pretty boy with a sort of animal sense of bereavement and the next with lamentations over the honours to which he would have succeeded it was of little use to speak to her of the eternal glories of which he was now secure for mary talbots sorrow was chiefly selfish and was connected with the loss of her preeminence as parent to the heirmale  however the grief of those times was apt to expend itself quickly and when little georges coffin smothered under heraldic devices and funeral escutcheons had been bestowed in the family vault dame mary soon revived enough to take a warm interest in the lords who were next afterwards sent down to hold conferences with the captive and her criticism of the fashion of their ruffs and doublets was as animated as ever  another grief however soon fell upon the family lady lennoxs ailments proved to be no such trifles as her sisters and sistersinlaw had been pleased to suppose and before the year was out she had passed away from all her ambitious hopes leaving a little daughter the earl took a brief leave of absence to visit his lady in her affliction at chatsworth and to stand godfather to the motherless infant  she will soon be fatherless too said richard talbot on his return to bridgefield after attending his lord on this expedition  my young lord lennox poor youth is far gone in the wasting sickness as well as distraught with grief and he could scarcely stand to receive my lord  our poor lady said susan it pities me to think what hopes she had fixed upon that young couple whom she had mated together  i doubt me whether her hopes be ended now quoth richard  what think you she hath fixed on as the name of the poor puling babe yonder they have called her arbel or arabella  arabella say you  i never heard such a name  it is scarce christian  is it out of a romaunt  better that it were  it is out of a pedigree  they have got the whole genealogy of the house of lennox blazoned fair with crowns and coronets and coats of arms hung up in the hall at chatsworth going up on the one hand through sir aeneas of troy and on the other hand through woden to adam and eve  pass for all before the stewart line became kings of scots  well it seems that these lennox stewarts sprang from one walter who was son to king robert ii and that the mother of this same walter was called anhild or as the scots here call it annaple but the scholars have made it into arabella and so my young lady is to be called  they say it was a special fancy of the young countesss  so i should guess  my lady would fill her head with such thoughts and of this poor youth being next of kin to the young scottish king and to our own queen  he is not next heir to scotland even barring a little one we wot of dame sue  the hamiltons stand between being descended from a daughter of king james i  so methought i had heard  are they not papists  yea  ah ha sweetheart there is another of the house of hardwicke as fain to dreams of greatness for her child as ever was the countess though she may be more discreet in the telling of them  ah me dear sir i dreamt not of greatness for splendours saketwere scarce for the dear childs happiness  i only thought of what you once said that she may be the instrument of preserving the true religion  and if so it can only be at a mighty cost said her husband  verily said susan glad am i that you sent our humfrey from her would that nought had ever passed between the children  they were but children said richard and there was no contract between them  i fear me there was what humfrey will hold to or know good reason why said his mother  and were the young king of scots married and father to a goodly heir there is no reason he should not hold to it rejoined richard  however richard was still anxious to keep his son engaged at a distance from sheffield  there was great rejoicing and thankfulness when one of the many messengers constantly passing between london and sheffield brought a packet from humfrey whose ship had put into the thames instead of the humber  the packet contained one of the black stones which the science of the time expected to transmute into gold also some esquimaux trinkets made of bone and a few shells  these were for the mother and cis and there were also the tusks of a seaelephant which humfrey would lay up at my lords london lodgings till his father sent tidings what should be done with them and whether he should come home at once by sea to hull or if as he much desired to do he might join an expedition which was fitting out for the spanish main where he was assured that much more both of gold and honour was to be acquired than in the cold northern seas where nothing was to be seen for the fog at most times and when it cleared only pigmies with their dogs white bears and seals also mountains of ice bigger than any church blue as my ladys best sapphires green as her emeralds sparkling as her diamonds but ready to be the destruction of the ships  one there was wrote humfrey that i could have thought was no other than the city that the blessed st john saw descending from heaven so fair was it to look on but they cried out that it was rather a city of destruction and when we had got out of the current where it was bearing down on us our noble captain piped all hands up to prayers and gave thanks for our happy deliverance therefrom  susan breathed a thanksgiving as her husband read and he forbore to tell her of the sharks the tornadoes and the fevers which might make the tropical seas more perilous than the arctic  no elizabethan mariner had any scruples respecting piracy and so long as the captain was a godly man who kept up strict discipline on board master richard held the quarterdeck to be a much more wholesome place than the manorhouse and much preferred the humours of the ship to those of any other feminine creature for as to his susan he always declared that she was the only woman who had none  so she accepted his decision and saw the wisdom of it though her tender heart deeply felt the disappointment  tenderly she packed up the shirts which she and cis had finished and bestrewed them with lavender which as she said while a tear dropped with the gray blossoms would bring the scent of home to the boy  cis affected to be indifferent and offended  master humfrey might do as he chose  she did not care if he did prefer pitch and tar and whale blubber and grease to hawks and hounds and lords and ladies she was sure she wanted no more great lubberly ladswith a sly cut at dicconto tangle her silk and torment her to bait their hooks she was well quit of any one of them  when diccon proposed that she should write a letter to humfrey she declared that she should do no such thing since he had never attempted to write to her  in truth diccon may have made the proposal in order to obtain a companion in misfortune since master sniggius emulous of the success of other tutors insisted on his writing to his brother in latin and the unfortunate epistle of ricardus to onofredus was revised and corrected to the last extremity and as it was allowed to contain no word unknown to virgilius maro it could not have afforded much delectation to the recipient  but when mrs susan had bestowed all the shirts as neatly as possible on returning to settle them for the last time before wrapping them up for the messenger she felt something hard among them  it was a tiny parcel wrapped in a piece of a fine kerchief tied round with a tress of dark hair and within susan knew by the feeling a certain chess rook which had been won by cis when shooting at the butts a week or two before     chapter x  the lady arbell   after several weary months of languishing charles stewart was saved from the miseries which seemed the natural inheritance of his name by sinking into his grave  his funeral was conducted with the utmost magnificence though the earl of shrewsbury declined to be present at it and shortly after the countess intimated her purpose of returning to sheffield bringing with her the little orphan lady arabella stewart  orders came that the best presence chamber in the manorhouse should be prepared the same indeed where queen mary had been quartered before the lodge had been built for her use  the earl was greatly perturbed  whom can she intend to bring he went about asking  if it were the lady margaret it were be much as my head were worth to admit her within the same grounds as this queen  there is no love lost between the motherinlaw and daughterinlaw observed his son gilbert in a consolatory tone  little good would that do to me if once it came to the ears of her grace and the lord treasurer that both had been my guests  and if i had to close the gatesthough in no other way could i save my life and honouryour mother would never forget it  it would be cast up to me for ever  what think you daughter talbot  mayhap said dame mary my lady mother has had a hint to make ready for her majesty herself who hath so often spoken of seeing the queen of scots and might think well to take her unawares  this was a formidable suggestion  say you so cried the poor earl with an alarm his eye would never have betrayed had parma himself been within a march of sheffield then were we fairly spent  i am an impoverished man eaten out of house and lands as it is and were the queen herself to come i might take at once to the beggars bowl  but think of the honour good my lord cried mary  think of all hallamshire coming to do her homage  oh how i should laugh to hear the mayor stumbling over his address  laugh ay growled the earl and how will you laugh when there is not a deer left in the park nor an ox in the stalls  nay my lord interposed gilbert there is no fear of her majestys coming  that post from m de la mauvissiere reported her at greenwich only five days back and it would take her majesty a far longer time to make her progress than yonder fellow who will tell you himself that she had no thoughts of moving  that might only be a feint to be the more sudden with us said his wife actuated in part by the diversion of alarming her fatherinlaw and in part really fired by the hope of such an effectual enlivenment of the dulness of sheffield  they were all in full family conclave drawn up in the hall for the reception and mistress susan who could not bear to see the earl so perplexed and anxious ventured to say that she was quite sure that my lady countess would have sent warning forward if indeed she were bringing home such a guest and at that moment the blare of trumpets announced that the cavalcade was approaching  the start which the earl gave showed how much his nerves had become affected by his years of custody  up the long avenue they came with all the state with which the earl had conducted queen mary to the lodge before she was absolutely termed a prisoner  halberdiers led the procession horse and foot seemed to form it  the home party stood on the top of the steps watching with much anxiety  there was a closed litter visible beside which lady shrewsbury in a mourning dress and hood could be seen riding her favourite bay palfrey  no doubt it contained the lady margaret countess of lennox and the unfortunate earl forgetting all his stately dignity stood uneasily moving from leg to leg and pulling his long beard torn between the instincts of hospitality and of loyal obedience between fear of his wife and fear of the queen  the litter halted at the foot of the steps the earl descended  all he saw was the round face of an infant in its nurses arms and he turned to help his wife from the saddle but she waved him aside my son gilbert will aid me my lord said she your devoir is to the princess  poor lord shrewsbury his apologies on his tongue looked into the litter where he saw the wellknown and withered countenance of the family nurse  he also beheld a buxom young female whose dress marked her as a peasant but before he had time to seek further for the princess the tightly rolled chrysalis of a child was thrust into his astonished arms while the round face puckered up instantly with terror at sight of his bearded countenance and he was greeted with a loud yell  he looked helplessly round and his lady was ready at once to relieve him  my precious  my sweetheart  my jewel  did he look sour at her and frighten her with his ugsome beard and the like endearments common to grandmothers in all ages  but where is the princess  where  where should she be but here  her grandames own precious royal queenly little darling and as a fresh cry broke out yes yes she shall to her presence chamber  usher her gilbert  besss brat muttered dame mary in ineffable disappointment  curiosity and the habit of obedience to the countess carried the entire troop on to the grand apartments on the south side where queen mary had been lodged while the fiction of her guestship had been kept up lady shrewsbury was all the time trying to hush the child who was quite old enough to be terrified by new faces and new scenes and who was besides tired and restless in her swaddling bands for which she was so nearly too old that she had only been kept in them for greater security upon the rough and dangerous roads great was my ladys indignation on reaching the state rooms on finding that no nursery preparations had been made and her daughter mary with a giggle hardly repressed by awe of her mother stood forth and said why verily my lady we expected some great dame my lady margaret or my lady hunsdon at the very least when you spoke of a princess  and who should it be but one who has both the royal blood of england and scotland in her veins  you have not saluted the child to whom you have the honour to be akin mary  on your knee minion i tell you she hath as good or a better chance of wearing a crown as any woman in england  she hath a far better chance of a prison muttered the earl if all this foolery goes on  what  what is that  what are you calling these honours to my orphan princess cried the lady but the princess herself here broke in with the lustiest of squalls and susan who was sorry for the child contrived to insert an entreaty that my lady would permit her to be taken at once to the nursery chamber that had been made ready for her and let her there be fed warmed and undressed at once  there was something in the quality of susans voice to which people listened and the present necessity overcame the countesss desire to assert the dignity of her granddaughter so she marched out of the room attended by the women while the earl and his sons were only too glad to slink awaythere is no other word for it their relief as to the expected visitor having been exchanged for consternation of another description  there was a blazing fire ready and all the baby comforts of the time provided and poor little lady arbell was relieved from her swathing bands and allowed to stretch her little limbs on her nurses lap the one rest really precious to babes of all periods and conditionsbut the troubles were not yet over for the grandmother glancing round demanded where is the cradle inlaid with pearl  why was it not provided  bring it here  now this cradle carved in cedar wood and inlaid with motherofpearl had been a sponsors gift to poor little george the first male heir of the talbots and it was regarded as a special treasure by his mother who was both wounded and resentful at the demand and stood pouting and saying it was my sons  it is mine  it belongs to the family  you to two of the servants fetch it here instantly  the ladies of hardwicke race were not guarded in temper or language and mary burst into passionate tears and exclamations that besss brat should not have her lost georges cradle and flounced away to get before the servants and lock it up  lady shrewsbury would have sprung after her and have made no scruple of using her fists and nails even on her married daughter but that she was impeded by a heavy table and this gave time for susan to throw herself before her and entreat her to pause  you you susan talbot  you should know better than to take the part of an undutiful foultongued vixen like that  out of my way i say and as susan still on her knees held the ridingdress she received a stinging box on the ear  but in her maiden days she had known the weight of my ladys hand and without relaxing her hold she only entreated hear me hear me for a little space my lady did you but know how sore her heart is and how she loved little master george  that is no reason she should flout and miscall her dead sister of whom she was always jealous  o madam she wept with all her heart for poor lady lennox  it is not any evil but she sets such store by that cradle in which her child diedshe keeps it by her bed even now and her woman told me how for all she seems gay and blithe by day she weeps over it at night as if her heart would break  lady shrewsbury was a little softened  the child died in it she asked  yea madam  he had been on his fathers knee and had seemed a little easier and as if he might sleep so sir gilbert laid him down and he did but stretch himself out shiver all over draw a long breath and the pretty lamb was gone to paradise  you saw him susan  yea madam  dame mary sent for me but none could be of any aid where it was the will of heaven to take him  if i had been there said the countess i who have brought up eight children and lost none i should have saved him  so he died in yonder cedar cradle  well een let mary keep it  it may be that there is infection in the smell of the cedar wood and that the child will sleep better out of it  it is too late to do aught this evening but tomorrow the child shall be lodged as befits her birth in the presence chamber  ah madam said susan would it be well for the sweet babe if her majestys messengers who be so often at the castle were to report her so lodged  i have a right to lodge my grandchild where and how i please in my own house  yea madam that is most true but you wot how the queen treats all who may have any claim to the throne in future times and were it reported by any of the spies that are ever about us how royal honours were paid to the little lady arbell might she not be taken from your ladyships wardship and bestowed with those who would not show her such loving care  the countess would not show whether this had any effect on her or else some sound made by the child attracted her  it was a puny little thing and she had a true grandmothers affection for it apart from her absurd pride and ambition so that she was glad to hold counsel over it with susan who had done such justice to her training as to be in her eyes a mother who had sense enough not to let her children waste and die a rare merit in those days and one that susan could not disclaim though she knew that it did not properly belong to her  cis had stood by all the time like a little statue for no one not even young lady talbot durst sit down uninvited in the presence of earl or countess but her black brows were bent her gray eyes intent  mother she said as they went home on their quiet mules are great ladies always so rudely spoken to one another  i have not seen many great ladies cis and my lady countess has always been good to me  antony said that the scots queen and her ladies never storm at one another like my lady and her daughters  open words do not always go deep cis said the mother  i had rather know and hear the worst at once  and then her heart smote her as she recollected that she might be implying censure of the girls true mother as well as defending wrath and passion and she added be that as it may it is a happy thing to learn to refrain the tongue     chapter xi  queen marys presence chamber   the storm that followed on the instalment of the lady arbell at sheffield was the precursor of many more  her grandmother did sufficiently awake to the danger of alarming the jealousy of queen elizabeth to submit to leave her in the ordinary chambers of the children of the house and to exact no extraordinary marks of respect towards the unconscious infant but there was no abatement in the countesss firm belief that an englishborn englishbred child would have more right to the crown than any foreign princes as she contemptuously termed the scottish queen and her son  moreover in her two years intercourse with the elder countess of lennox who was a gentletempered but commonplace woman she had adopted to the full that unfortunate princesss entire belief in the guilt of queen mary and entertained no doubt that she had been the murderer of darnley  old lady lennox had seen no real evidence and merely believed what she was told by her lord whose impeachment of bothwell had been baffled by the queen in a most suspicious manner conversations with this lady had entirely changed lady shrewsbury from the friendly hostess of her illustrious captive to be her enemy and persecutor partly as being convinced of her guilt partly as regarding her as an obstacle in the path of little arbell to the throne  so she not only refused to pay her respects as usual to that murtheress but she insisted that her husband should tighten the bonds of restraint and cut off all indulgences  the countess was one of the women to whom argument and reason are impossible and who was entirely swayed by her predilections as well as of so imperious a nature as to brook no opposition and to be almost always able to sweep every one along with her  her own sons always were of her mind and her daughters might fret and chafe but were sure to take part with her against every one else outside the cavendish family  the idea of being kinsfolk to the future queen excited them all and even mary forgot her offence about the cradle and her jealousy of bess and ranked herself against her stepfather influencing her husband gilbert on whom the unfortunate earl had hitherto leant  on his refusal to persecute his unfortunate captive beyond the orders from the court bess of hardwicke emboldened by the support she had gathered from her children passionately declared that it could only be because he was himself in love with the murtheress  lord shrewsbury could not help laughing a little at the absurdity of the idea whereupon my lady rose up in virtuous indignation calling her sons and daughters to follow her  all that night lights might have been seen flitting about at the manorhouse and early in the morning bugles sounded to horse  a huge procession consisting of the countess herself and all her sons and daughters then at sheffield little lady arbell and the whole of their attendants swept out of the gates of the park on the way to hardwicke when richard talbot went up to fulfil his duties as gentleman porter at the lodge the courts seemed wellnigh deserted and a messenger summoned him at once to the earl whom he found in his bedchamber in his morning gown terribly perturbed  for heavens sake send for your wife richard talbot he said it is her majestys charge that some of mine household or i myself see this unhappy queen of scots each day for not less than two hours as you well know  my lady has broken away and all her daughters on this accursed fancyyea and gilbert too gilbert whom i always looked to to stand by me i have no one to send  if i go and attend upon her alone as i have done a thousand times to my sorrow it will but give colour to the monstrous tale but if your good wife an honourable lady of the hardwicke kin against whom none ever breathed a word will go and give the daily attendance then can not the queen herself find fault and my wifes heated fancy can coin nothing suspicious  you must all come up and lodge here in the manorhouse till this tempest be overpast  oh richard richard will it last out my life  my very children are turned against me  go you down and fetch your good susan and take order for bringing up your children and gear  benthall shall take your turn at the lodge  what are you tarrying for  do you doubt whether your wife have rank enough to wait on the queen  she should have been a knights lady long ago but that i deemed you would be glad to be quit of heralds fees your service and estate have merited it and i will crave license by todays courier from her majesty to lay knighthood on your shoulder  that was not what i thought of my lord though i humbly thank you and would be whatever was best for your lordships service though if it would serve you as well i would rather be squire than knight but i was bethinking me how we should bestow our small family  we have a young damsel at an age not to be left to herself  the blackbrowed maidi recollect her  let her een follow her mother  queen mary likes a young face and is kindly disposed to little maids  she taught bess pierrepoint to speak french and work with her needle and i cannot see that she did the lass any harm nay she is the only one of them all that can rule her tongue to give a soft answer if things go not after her will and a maid might learn worse things  besides your wife will be there to look after the maiden so you need have no fears  and for your sons they will be at school and can eat with us  richards doubts being thus silenced he could not but bring his wife to his lords rescue though he well knew that susan would be greatly disturbed on all accounts and indeed he found her deep in the ironing that followed the great spring wash and her housewifely mind was as much exercised as to the effects of her desertion as was her maternal prudence at the plunge which her unconscious adopted child was about to make  however there was no denying the request backed as it was by her husband looking at her proudly and declaring she was by general consent the only discreet woman in sheffield  she was very sorry for the earls perplexity and had a loyal pity for the countesss vexation and folly and she was consoled by the assurance that she would have a free time between dinner and supper to go home and attend to her wash and finish her preparations  cis who had been left in a state of great curiosity to continue compounding pickle while the mother was called away was summoned to don her holiday kirtle for she was to join in attendance on the queen of scots while lady shrewsbury and her daughters were absent  it was unmixed delight to the girl and she was not long in freshbinding up her hairblack with a little rustcoloured tingeunder her stiff little cap smoothing down the front which was alone visible putting on the wellstiffened ruff with the dainty little lace edge and closefitting tucker and then the gray homespun kirtle with the puffs at the top of the tight sleeves and the slashes into which she had persuaded mother to insert some old pink satin for was not she sixteen now and almost a woman  there was a pink breastknot to match and humfreys owch just above it gray stockings homespun and worked with elaborate pink clocks but knitted by cis herself and a pair of shoes with pink roses to match were put into a bag to be assumed when she arrived at the lodge out of this simple finery beamed a face bright in spite of the straight almost bushy black brows  there was a light of youth joy and intelligence about her gray eyes which made them sparkle all the more under their dark setting and though her complexion had no brilliancy only the clearness of health and her features would not endure criticism there was a wonderful lively sweetness about her fresh innocent young mouth and she had a tall lithe figure surpassing that of her stepmother she would have been a sonsie border lass in appearance but for the remarkable carriage of her small head and shoulders which was assuredly derived from her royal ancestry and indeed her air and manner of walking were such that diccon had more than once accused her of sailing about ambling like the queen of scots an accusation which she hotly denied  her hands bad likewise a slender form and fine texture such as none of the ladies of the houses of talbot or hardwicke could rival but she was on the whole viewed as far from being a beauty  the taste of the day was altogether for light sandyhaired smallfeatured women like queen elizabeth or her namesake of hardwicke so that cis was looked on as a sort of crow and her supposed parents were pitied for having so illfavoured a daughter so unlike all their families except one blackavised talbot grandmother whose portrait had been discovered on a pedigree  much did susan marvel what impression the daughter would make on the true mother as they jogged up on their sober ponies through the long avenues whose branches were beginning to wear the purple shades of coming spring  lord shrewsbury himself met them in front of the lodge where in spite of all his dignity he had evidently been impatiently awaiting them he thanked susan for coming as if he had not had a right to order gave her his ungloved hand when she had dismounted then at the single doorway of the lodge caused his gentleman to go through the form of requesting admission for himself and mistress talbot his dear kinswoman to the presence of the queen  it was a ceremony daily observed as an acknowledgment of marys royalty and the earl was far too courteous ever to omit it  queen marys willingness to admit him was notified by sir andrew melville a tall worn man with the typical scottish countenance and a keen steadfast gray eye  he marshalled the trio up a circular staircase made as easy as possible but necessarily narrow since it wound up through a brick turret at the corner to the third and uppermost story of the lodge  there however was a very handsome anteroom with tapestry hangings a richly moulded ceiling and wide carved stone chimneypiece where a bright fire was burning around which sat several scottish and french gentlemen who rose at the earls entrance  another wide doorway with a tapestry curtain over the folding leaves led to the presence chamber and sir andrew announced in as full style as if he had been marshalling an english ambassador to the court of holyrood the most high and mighty earl of shrewsbury  the room was full of march sunshine and a great wood fire blazed on the hearth  part of the floor was carpeted and overhung with a canopy proceeding from the tapestried wall and here was a crosslegged velvet chair on which sat queen mary  this was all that cis saw at first while the earl advanced knelt on one step of the dais with bared head exchanging greetings with the queen  he then added that his wife the countess and her daughter having been called away from sheffield he would entreat her grace to accept for a few days in their stead the attendance of his good kinswoman mrs talbot and her daughter mistress cicely  mary graciously intimated her consent and extended her hand for each to kiss as they knelt in turn on the step susan either fancied or really saw a wonderful likeness in that taper hand to the little one whose stitches she had so often guided  cis on her part felt the thrill of girlhood in the actual touch of the subject of her dreams she stood scarcely hearing what passed but taking in from under her black brows all the surroundings and recognising the persons from her former glimpses and from antony babingtons descriptions the presence chamber was ample for the suite of the queen which had been reduced on every fresh suspicion  there was in it besides the queens four ladies an elderly one with a close black silk hoodjean kennedy or mrs kennett as the english called her another a thin slight figure with a worn face as if a great sorrow had passed over her making her look older than her mistress was the queens last remaining mary otherwise mrs seaton  the gossip of sheffield had not failed to tell how the chamberlain beatoun had been her suitor and she had half consented to accept him when he was sent on a mission to france and there died  the darkcomplexioned brighteyed little lady on a smaller scale than the rest was marie de courcelles who like the two others had been the queens companion in all her adventures and the fourth younger and prettier than the rest was already known to cis and her mother since she was the barbara mowbray who was affianced to gilbert curll the queens scottish secretary recently taken into her service  both these were protestants and like the bridgefield family attended service in the castle chapel  they were all at work as was likewise their royal lady to whom the girl with the youthful coyness that halts in the fulfilment of its dreams did not at first raise her eyes having first taken in all the ladies the several portions of one great coverlet which they were all embroidering in separate pieces and the gentleman who was reading aloud to them from a large book placed on a desk at which he was standing  when she did look up as the queen was graciously requesting her mother to be seated and the earl excusing himself from remaining longer her first impression was one of disappointment  either the queen of scots was less lovely seen leisurely close at hand than antony babington and ciss own fancy had painted her or the last two or three years had lessened her charms as well they might for she had struggled and suffered much in the interval had undergone many bitter disappointments and had besides endured much from rheumatism every winter indeed even now she could not ride and could only go out in a carriage in the park on the finest days looking forward to her annual visit to buxton to set her up for the summer  her face was longer and more pointed than in former days her complexion had faded or perhaps in these private moments it had not been worth while to enhance it though there was no carelessness in the general attire the black velvet gown and delicate lace of the cap and open ruff always characteristic of her  the small curls of hair at her temples had their auburn tint softened by far more white than suited one who was only just over forty but the delicate pencilling of the eyebrows was as marked as ever and the eyes on whose colour no one ever agreed melted and sparkled as of old  cis had heard debates as to their hue and furtively tried to form her own opinion but could not decide on anything but that they had a dark effect and a wonderful power of expression seeming to look at every one at once and to rebuke encourage plead or smile from moment to moment the slight cast in one of them really added to their force of expression rather than detracted from their beauty and the delicate lips were ready to second the glances with wondrous smiles  cis had not felt the magic of her mere presence five minutes without being convinced that antony babington was right the lord treasurer and all the rest utterly wrong and that she beheld the most innocent and persecuted of princesses  meantime all due formalities having been gone through lord shrewsbury bowed himself out backwards with a dexterity that cis breathlessly admired in one so stately and so stiff forgetting that he had daily practice in the art  then queen mary courteously entreated her visitors to be seated near herself asking with a smile if this were not the little maiden who had queened it so prettily in the brake some few years since  cis blushed and drew back her head with a pretty gesture of dignified shyness as susan made answer for her that she was the same  i should have known it said the queen smiling by the port of her head alone  tis strange she said musing that maiden hath the bearing of head and neck that i have never seen save in my own mother the saints rest her soul and in her sisters and which we always held to be their inheritance from the blood of charlemagne  your grace does her too much honour susan contrived to say thankful that no less remote resemblance had been detected  it was a sad farce when they tried to repeat your pretty comedy with the chief performer omitted proceeded the queen directing her words to the girl but the mother replied for her  your grace will pardon me i could not permit her to play in public before all the menie of the castle  madame is a discreet and prudent mother said the queen  the mistake was in repeating the representation at all not in abstaining from appearing in it  i should be very sorry that this young lady should have been concerned in a spectacle a la comtesse  there was something in the intonation of this young lady that won ciss heart on the spot something in the concluding words that hurt susans faithful loyalty towards her kinswoman in spite of the compliment to herself  however mary did not pursue the subject perceiving with ready tact that it was distasteful and proceeded to ask dame susans opinion of her work which was intended as a gift to her good aunt the abbess of soissons  how strangely the name fell upon susans ear  it was a pale blue satin coverlet worked in large separate squares innumerable shields and heraldic devices of lorraine bourbon france scotland etc round the border and beautiful meandering patterns of branches with natural flowers and leaves growing from them covering the whole with a fascinating regular irregularity  cis could not repress an exclamation of delight which brought the most charming glance of the winning eyes upon her  there was stitchery here that she did not understand but when she looked at some of the flowers she could not help uttering the sentiment that the eyes of the daisies were not as mother could make them  so as a great favour queen mary entreated to be shown mrs talbots mode of dealing with the eyes of the daisies  no her good seaton would not learn so well as she should madame must come and sit by her and show her  meantime here was her poor little bijou whimpering to be taken on her lap  would not he find a comforter in sweet mistressah what was her name  we named her cicely so please your grace said susan unable to help blushing  cecile a fair name  ah so the poor antoine called her  i see my bijou has found a friend in you mistress cecileas the girls idle hands were only too happy to caress the pretty little shivering italian greyhound rather than to be busy with a needle  do you ever hear of that young babington your playfellow she added  no madam said cis looking up he hath never been here  i thought not said queen mary sighing  take heed to manifest no pity for me maiden if you should ever chance to be inspired with it for a poor wornout old prisoner  it is the sure sentence of misfortune and banishment  in his sex madam here put in marie de courcelles  if it were so in ours woe to some of us  that is true my dear friends said mary her eyes glistening with dew  it is the women who are the most fearless the most faithful and whom the saints therefore shield  alas there are some who are faithful but who are not shielded  it was merely a soft low murmur but the tenderhearted queen had caught it and rising impulsively crossed the room and gathered mary seatons hands into hers no longer the queen but the loving friend of equal years soothing her in a low fond voice and presently sending her to the inner chamber to compose herself  then as the queen returned slowly to her seat it would be seen how lame she was from rheumatism  mrs kennedy hurried to assist her with a nurselike word of remonstrance to which she replied with a bewitching look of sweetness that she could not but forget her aches and pains when she saw her dear mary seaton in trouble  most politely she then asked whether her visitors would object to listening to the conclusion of her days portion of reading  there was no refusing of course though as susan glanced at the reader and knew him to be strongly suspected of being in holy orders conferred abroad she had her fears for her childs protestant principles  the book however proved to be a translation of st austin on the psalms and of course she could detect nothing that she disapproved even if cis had not been far too much absorbed by the little dog and its mistress to have any comprehending ears for theology  queen mary confidentially observed as much to her after the reading having no doubt detected her uneasy glance  you need not fear for your child madam she said st augustine is respected by your own queen and her bishops  at the readings with which my good mr belton favours me i take care to have nothing you protestants dispute when i know it  she added smiling heaven knows that i have endeavoured to understand your faith and many a minister has argued with me  i have done my best to comprehend them but they agreed in nothing but in their abuse of the pope  at least so it seemed to my poor weak mind  but you are satisfied madam i see it in your calm eyes and gentle voice  if i see much of you i shall learn to think well of your religion  susan made an obeisance without answering  she had heard sir gilbert talbot say if she tries to persuade you that you can convert her be sure that she means mischief but she could not bear to believe it anything but a libel while the sweet sad face was gazing into hers  queen mary changed the subject by asking a few questions about the countesss sudden departure  there was a sort of guarded irony suppressed in her toneshe was evidently feeling her way with the stranger and when she found that susan would only own to causes lord shrewsbury had adduced on the spur of the moment she was much too wary to continue the examination though susan could not help thinking that she knew full well the disturbance which had taken place  a short walk on the roof above followed  the sun was shining brilliantly and lame as she was the queens strong craving for free air led her to climb her stairs and creep to and fro on sir andrew melvilles arm gazing out over the noble prospect of the park close below divided by the winding vales of the three rivers which could be traced up into the woods and the moors beyond purple with spring freshness and glory  mary made her visitors point out bridgefield and asked questions about all that could be seen of the house and pleasance which in truth was little enough but she contrived to set cis off into a girls chatter about her home occupations and would not let her be hushed  you little know the good it does a captive to take part only in fancy in a free harmless life returned mary with the wistful look that made her eyes so pathetic  there is no refreshment to me like a childs prattle  susans heart smote her as she thought of the true relations in which these two stood to one another and she forbore from further interference but she greatly rejoiced when the great bell of the castle gave notice of noon and of her own release  when queen marys dinner was served the talbot ladies in attendance left her and repaired to the general family meal in the hall     chapter xii  a furious letter   a period now began of daily penance to mrs talbot of daily excitement and delight to cis  two hours or more had to be spent in attendance on queen mary  even on sundays there was no exemption the visit only took place later in the day so as not to interfere with going to church  nothing could be more courteous or more friendly than the manner in which the elder lady was always received  she was always made welcome by the queen herself who generally entered into conversation with her almost as with an equal  or when mary herself was engaged in her privy chamber in dictating to her secretaries the ladies of the suite showed themselves equally friendly and told her of their mistresss satisfaction in having a companion free from all the rude and unaccountable humours and caprices of my lady countess and her daughters  and if susan was favoured cis was petted  queen mary always liked to have young girls about her  their fresh spontaneous enthusiastic homage was pleasant to one who loved above all to attract and it was a pleasure to a prisoner to have a fresh face about her  was it only this or was it the maternal instinct that made her face light up when the young girl entered the room and return the shy reverential kiss of the hand with a tender kiss on the forehead that made her encourage the chatter give little touches to the deportment and present little keepsakes which increased in value till sir richard began to look grave and to say there must be no more jewels of price brought from the lodge  and as his wife uttered a word that sounded like remonstrance he added not while she passes for my daughter  cis who had begun by putting on a pouting face burst into tears her adopted parents had always been more tolerant and indulgent to her than if she had been a child over whom they felt entire rights and instead of rewarding her petulance with such a blow as would have fallen to the lot of a veritable talbot richard shrugged his shoulders and left the roomthe chamber which had been allotted to dame susan at the manorhouse while susan endeavoured to cheer the girl by telling her not to grieve for her father was not angry with her  whywhy may not the dear good queen give me her dainty gifts sobbed cis  see dear child said susan while she only gave thee an orange stuck with cloves or an embroidery needle or even a puppy dog it is all very well but when it comes to spanish gloves and coral clasps the next time there is an outcry about a plot some evildisposed person would be sure to say that master richard talbot had been taking bribes through his daughter  it would be vilely false cried cis with flashing eyes  it would not be the less believed said susan  my lord would say we had betrayed our trust and there never has been one stain on my husbands honour  you are wroth with me too mother said cis  not if you are a good child and guard the honour of the name you bear  i will i will said cis  never will i take another gift from the queen if only you and he will call me your child and begood to me the rest was lost in tears and in the tender caresses that susan lavished on her all the more as she caught the broken words humfrey too he would never forgive me  susan told her husband what had passed adding she will keep her word  she must or she shall go no more to the lodge he said  you would not have doubted had you seen her eye flash at the thought of bringing your honour into question  there spoke her kingly blood  well we shall see sighed richard if it be blood that makes the nature  i fear me hers is but that of a scottish thief  scorn not warning mother but watch thy stranger nestling well  nay mine husband  while we own her as our child she will do anything to be one with us  it is when we seem to put her from us that we wound her so that i know not what she might do fondled as she isbyby her whohas the best right to the dear child  richard uttered a certain exclamation of disgust which silenced his discreet wife  neither of them had quite anticipated the result namely that the next morning cis after kissing the queens hand as usual remained kneeling her bosom heaving and a little stammering on her tongue while tears rose to her eyes  what is it mignonne said mary kindly is the whelp dead or is the clasp broken  no madam butbut i pray you give me no more gifts  my father says it touches his honour and i have promised himoh madam be not displeased with me but let me give you back your last beauteous gift  mary was standing by the fire  she took the ivory and coral trinket from the hand of the kneeling girl and dashed it into the hottest glow  there was passion in the action and in the kindling eye but it was but for a moment  before cis could speak or susan begin her excuses the delicate hand was laid on the girls head and a calm voice said fear not child  queens take not back their gifts  i ought to have borne in mind that i am balked of the pleasure of givingthe beat of all the joys they have robbed me of  but tremble not sweetheart i am not chafed with thee  i will vex thy father no more  better thou shouldst go without a trinket or two than deprive me of the light of that silly little face of thine so long as they will leave me that sunbeam  she stooped and kissed the drooping brow and susan could not but feel as if the voice of nature were indeed speaking  a few words of apology in her character of mother for the maidens abrupt proceeding were met by the queen most graciously  spare thy words good madam  we understand and reverence mr talbots point of honour  would that all who approached us had held his scruples  perhaps mary was after this more distant and dignified towards the matron but especially tender and caressing towards the maiden as if to make up by kindness for the absence of little gifts  storms however were brewing without  lady shrewsbury made open complaints of her husband having become one of marys many victims representing herself as an injured wife driven out of her house  she actually in her rage carried the complaint to queen elizabeth who sent down two commissioners to inquire into the matter  they sat in the castle hall and examined all the attendants including richard and his wife  the investigation was extremely painful and distressing but it was proved that nothing could have been more correct and guarded than the whole intercourse between the earl and his prisoner  if he had erred it had been on the side of caution and severity though he had always preserved the courteous demeanour of a gentleman and had been rejoiced to permit whatever indulgences could be granted  if there had been any transgressions of the strict rules they had been made by the countess herself and her daughters in the days of their intimacy with the queen and the aspersions on the unfortunate earl were it was soon evident merely due to the violent and unscrupulous tongues of the countess and her daughter mary  no wonder that lord shrewsbury wrote letters in which he termed the lady his wicked and malicious wife and expressed his conviction that his son gilberts mind had been perverted by her daughter  the indignation of the captive queen was fully equal to his as one after another of her little court returned and was made to detail the points on which he or she had been interrogated  susan found her pacing up and down the floor like a caged tigress her cap and veil thrown back so that her hairfar whiter than what was usually displayedwas hanging dishevelled her ruff torn open as if it choked back the swelling passion in her throat  never never content with persecuting me they must insult me  is it not enough that i am stripped of my crown deprived of my friends that i cannot take a step beyond this chamber queen as i am without my warder  must they attaint me as a woman  oh why why did the doom spare me that took my little brothers   why did i live to be the most wretched not of sovereigns alone but of women  madam entreated marie de courcelles dearest madam take courage all these horrible charges refute themselves  ah marie you have said so ten thousand times and what charge has ever been dropped  this one is dropped exclaimed susan coming forward  yes your grace indeed it is  the commissioner himself told my husband that no one believed it for a moment  then why should these men have been sent but to sting and gall me and make me feel that i am in their power cried the queen  they came said the secretary curll because thus alone could the countess be silenced  the countess exclaimed mary  so my cousin hath listened to her tongue  backed by her daughters added jean kennedy  it were well that she knew what those two dames can say of her majesty herself when it serves them added marie de courcelles  that shall she exclaimed mary  she shall have it from mine own hand  ha ha  elizabeth shall know the choice tales wherewith mary talbot hath regaled us and then shall she judge how far anything that comes from my young lady is worth heeding for a moment remember you all the tales of the nips and the pinches  ay and of all the endearments to leicester and to hatton  she shall have it all and try how she likes the dish of scandal of mary talbots cookery sauced by bess of hardwicke  here nurse come and set this headgear of mine in order and do you my good curll have pen ink and paper in readiness for me  the queen did little but write that morning  the next day on coming out from morning prayers which the protestants of her suite attended with the rest of the shrewsbury household barbara mowbray contrived to draw mrs talbot apart as they went towards the lodge  madam she said they all talk of your power to persuade  now is the time you could do what would be no small service to this poor queen ay and it may be to your own children  i may not meddle in any matters of the queens returned susan rather stiffly  nay but hear me madam  it is only to hinder the sending of a letter  that letter which her grace was about to write yesterday  even so  tis no secret for she read fragments of it aloud and all her women applauded it with all their might and laughed over the stings that it would give but mr curll who bad to copy it saith that there is a bitterness in it that can do nothing but make her majesty of england the more inflamed not only against my lady shrewsbury but against her who writ the letter and all concerned why she hath even brought in the comedy that your children acted in the woodland and that was afterwards repeated in the hall  you say not so mistress barbara  indeed i do  mr curll and sir andrew melville are both of them sore vexed and would fain have her withdraw it but master nau and all the french part of the household know not how to rejoice enough at such an exposure of my lady which gives a hard fling at queen elizabeth at the same time  nay i cannot but tell you that there are things in it that dame mary talbot might indeed say but i know not how queen mary could bring herself to set down  barbara mowbray ventured no more and susan felt hopeless of her task since how was she by any means to betray knowledge of the contents of the letter  yet much that she had heard made her feel very uneasy on all accounts  she had too much strong family regard for the countess and for gilbert talbot and his wife to hear willingly of what might imperil them and though royal indignation would probably fly over the heads of the children no one was too obscure in those tudor times to stand in danger from a sovereign who might think herself insulted  yet as a hardwicke and the wife of a talbot it was most unlikely that she would have any opening for remonstrance given to her  however it was possible that curll wished to give her an opening for no sooner were the ladies settled at work than he bowed himself forward and offered his mistress his copy of the letter  is it fair engrossed good curll asked mary  thanks  then will we keep your copy and you shall fold and prepare our own for our sealing  will not your majesty hear it read over ere it pass out of your hands asked curll  even so returned mary who really was delighted with the pungency of her own composition  mayhap we may have a point or two to add  after what mistress barbara had said susan was on thorns that cis should hear the letter but that good young lady hating the expressions therein herself and hating it still more for the girl bethought her of asking permission to take mistress cicely to her own chamber there to assist her in the folding of some of her laces and mary consented  it was well for there was much that made the englishbred susans cheeks glow and her ears tingle  but at least it gave her a great opportunity  when the letter was finished she advanced and knelt on the step of the canopied chair saying madam pardon me if in the name of my unfortunate children i entreat you not to accuse them to the queen  your children lady  how have i included them in what i have told her majesty of our sweet countess  your grace will remember that the foremost parts in yonder farce were allotted to my son humfrey and to young master babington  nay that the whole arose from the woodland sport of little cis which your grace was pleased to admire  sooth enough my good gossip but none could suspect the poor children of the malice my lady countess contrived to put into the matter  ah madam these are times when it is convenient to shift the blame on one who can be securely punished  certes said mary thoughtfully the countess is capable of making her escape by denouncing some one else especially those within her own reach  your grace who can speak such truth of my poor lady said susan will also remember that though my lord did yield to the persuasions of the young ladies he so heedfully caused master sniggins to omit all perilous matter that no one not informed would have guessed at the import of the piece as it was played in the hall  most assuredly not said mary laughing a little at the recollection it might have been played in westminster hall without putting my gracious cousin ay or leicester and hatton themselves to the blush  thus if the queen should take the matter up and trace it home it could not but be brought to my poor innocent children  humfrey is for the nonce out of reach but the maideni wis verily that your highness would be loath to do her any hurt  thou art a good pleader madam said the queen  verily i should not like to bring the bonnie lassie into trouble  it will give master curll a little more toil ay and myself likewise for the matter must stand in mine own hand but we will leave out yonder unlucky farce  your highness is very good said susan earnestly  yet you look not yet content my good lady  what more would you have of me  what your majesty will scarce grant said susan  ha thou art of the same house thyself  i had forgotten it thou art so unlike to them  i wager that it is not to send this same letter at all  your highness hath guessed my mind  nay madam though assuredly i do desire it because the countess bath been ever my good lady and bred me up ever since i was an orphan it is not solely for her sake that i would fain pray you but fully as much for your majestys own  madame talbot sees the matter as i do said sir andrew melville the english queen is as like to be irate with the reporter of the scandal as with the author of it even as the wolf bites the barb that pierces him when he cannot reach the archer  she is welcome to read the letter said mary smiling thy semblance falleth short my good friend  nay madam that was not the whole of my purport said susan standing with folded hands looking from one to another  pardon me my thought was that to take part in all this repeating of thoughtless idle words spoken foolishly indeed but scarce so much in malice as to amuse your grace with court news and treasured up so long your majesty descends from being the patient and suffering princess meek generous and uncomplaining to beto be  no better than one of them wouldst thou add asked mary somewhat sharply as susan paused  your highness has said it answered susan then as there was a moments pause she looked up and with clasped hands added oh madam would it not be more worthy more noble more queenly more christian to refrain from stinging with this repetition of these vain and foolish slanders  most christian treatment have i met with returned mary but after a pause she turned to her almoner  master belton saying what say you sir  i say that mrs talbot speaks more christian words than are often heard in these parts returned he  the thankworthiness of suffering is lost by those who return the revilings upon those who utter them  then be it so returned the queen  elizabeth shall be spared the knowledge that some ladies tongues can be as busy with her as with her poor cousin  with her own hands mary tore up her own letter but curlls copy unfortunately escaped destruction to be discovered in after times lord and lady shrewsbury never knew the service susan had rendered them by causing it to be suppressed     chapter xiii  beads and bracelets   the countess was by no means pacified by the investigation and both she and her family remained at court maligning her husband and his captive  as the season advanced bringing the time for the queens annual resort to the waters of buxton lord shrewsbury was obliged to entreat mrs talbot again to be her companion declaring that he had never known so much peace as with that lady in the queens chambers  the journey to buxton was always the great holiday of the imprisoned court  the place was part of the shrewsbury property and the earl had a great house there but there were no conveniences for exercising so strict a watch as at sheffield and there was altogether a relaxation of discipline  exercise was considered an essential part of the treatment and recreations were there provided  cis had heard so much of the charms of the expedition that she was enraptured to hear that she was to share it together with mrs talbot the only drawback was that humfrey had promised to come home after this present voyage to see whether his little cis were ready for him and his father was much disposed to remain at home receive him first and communicate to him the obstacles in the way of wedding the young lady however my lord refused to dispense with the attendance of his most trustworthy kinsman and leaving ned at school under charge of the learned sniggius the elder and the younger richard talbot rode forth with the retinue of the queen and her warder  neither cicely nor diccon had ever left home before and they were in raptures which would have made any journey delightful to them far more a ride through some of the wildest and loveliest glades that england can display  nay it may be that they would better have enjoyed something less like sheffield park than the rocks glens and woods through which they rode  their real delight was in the towns and villages at which there was a halt and every traveller they saw was such a wonder to them that at the end of the first day they were almost as full of exultation in their experiences as if with humfrey they had been far on the way to america  the delight of sleeping at tideswell was in their eyes extreme though the hostel was so crowded that cis had to share a mattress with mrs talbot and diccon had to sleep in his cloak on the floor which he persuaded himself was high preferment  he woke however much sooner than was his wont and finding it useless to try to fall asleep again he made his way out among the sleeping figures on the floor and hall and finding the fountain in the midst of the court produced his soap and comb from his pocket and made his morning toilet in the open air with considerable satisfaction at his own alertness  presently there was a tap at the window above and he saw cicely making signals to him to wait for her and in a few minutes she skipped out from the door into the sunlight of the early summer morning  no one is awake yet she said  even the guard before the queens door is fast asleep  i only heard a wench or two stirring  we can have a run in the fields and gather may dew before any one is afoot  tis not may tis june said matteroffact diccon  but yonder is a guard at the yard gate will he let us past  see heres a little wicket into a garden of potherbs said cis no doubt we can get out that way and it will bring us the sooner into the fields  i have a cake in my wallet that mother gave me for the journey so we shall not fast   how sweet the herbs smell in the dewand see how silvery it lies on the strawberry leaves  ah thou naughty lad think not whether the fruit be ripe  mayhap we shall find some wild ones beyond  the gate of the garden was likewise guarded but by a yeoman who well knew the young talbots and made no difficulty about letting them out into the broken ground beyond the garden sloping up into a little hill  up bounded the boy and girl like young mountaineers through gorse and fern and presently had gained a sufficient height to look over the country marking the valleys whence still were rising fragrant clouds of dewy steam under the influence of the sunbeams gazing up at the purple heights of the peak where a few lines of snow still lingered in the crevices trying to track their past journey from their own sheffield and with still more interest to guess which wooded valley before them contained buxton  have you lost your way my pretty mistress said a voice close to them and turning round hastily they saw a peasant woman with a large basket on her arm  no said cicely courteously we have only come out to take the air before breakfast  i crave pardon said the woman curtseying the pretty lady belongs to the great folk down yonder  would she look at my poor wares  here are beads and trinkets of the goodly stones pins and collars bracelets and eardrops white yellow and purple she said uncovering her basket where were arranged various ornaments made of derbyshire spar  we have no money good woman said cicely rising to return vaguely uncomfortable at the womans eye which awoke some remembrance of tibbott the huckster and the troubles connected with her  yea but if my young mistress would only bring me in to the great lady there i know she would buy of me my beads and bracelets of give me an alms for my poor children  i have five of them good young lady and they lie naked and hungry till i can sell my few poor wares and the yeomen are so rough and hard  they would break and trample every poor bead i have in pieces rather than even let my lord hear of them  but if even my basket could be carried in and shown and if the good earl heard my sad tale i am sure he would give license  he never does said diccon roughly hold off woman do not hang on us or ill get thee branded for a vagabond  the woman put her knuckles into her eyes and wailed out that it was all for her poor children and cicely reproved him for his roughness and as the woman kept close behind them wailing moaning and persuading the boy and girl were wrought upon at last to give her leave to wait outside the gate of the inn garden while they saw whether it was possible to admit her or her basket  but before they reached the gate they saw a figure beyond it scanning the hill eagerly  they knew him for their father even before he shouted to them and as they approached his voice was displeased how now children what manners are these  we have only been on the hillside sweet father said cis diccon and i together  we thought no harm  this is not sheffield chase cis and thou art no more a child but a maiden who needs to be discreet above all in these times  whom did i see following you  a poor woman whomha where is she exclaimed cis suddenly perceiving that the woman seemed to have vanished  a troublesome begging woman who beset us with her wares said diccon and would give us no peace praying that we would get them carried in to the queen and her ladies whining about her children till she made cis softhearted  where can she have hidden herself  the man who was stationed as sentry at the gate said he had seen the woman come over the brow of the hill with master diccon and mistress cicely but that as they ran forward to meet captain talbot she had disappeared amid the rocks and brushwood  poor woman she was afraid of our father said cicely i would we could see her again  so would not i said richard  it looks not well and heed me well children there must be no more of these pranks nor of wandering out of bounds or babbling with strangers  go thou in to thy mother cis she hath been in much trouble for thee  mistress susan was unusually severe with the girl on the indiscretion of gadding in strange places with no better escort than diccon and of entering into conversation with unknown persons  moreover cicelys hair her shoes and camlet riding skirt were all so dank with dew that she was with difficulty made presentable by the time the horses were brought round  the queen who had not seen the girl that morning made her come and ride near her asking questions on the escapade and giving one of her bewitching pathetic smiles as she said how she envied the power of thus dancing out on the greensward and breathing the free and fresh morning air  my scottish blood loves the mountains and bounds the more freely in the fresh breeze she said gazing towards the peak  i love the scent of the dew  didst get into trouble child  methought i heard sounds of chiding  it was no fault of mine said cis inclined to complain when she found sympathy the woman would speak to us  what woman asked the queen  a poor woman with a basket of wares who prayed hard to be allowed to show them to your grace or some of the ladies  she said she had five sorely hungered children and that she heard your grace was a compassionate lady  woe is me compassion is full all that i am permitted to give said the queen sadly she brought trinkets to sell  what were her wares saidst thou  i had no time to see many said cis something pure and white like a newlaid egg i saw and a necklet clouded with beauteous purple  ay beads and bracelets no doubt said the queen  yes beads and bracelets returned cicely the soft chime of the queens scottish accent bringing back to her that the woman had twice pressed on her beads and bracelets  she dwelt on them said the queen lightly  ay i know the chant of the poor folk who ever hover about our outskirts in hopes to sell their country gewgaws beads and bracelets collars and pins little guessing that she whom they seek is poorer than themselves  mayhap our arguseyed lord may yet let the poor dame within his fence and we may be able to gratify thy longing for those same purple and white beads and bracelets  meantime the party were riding on intending to dine at buxton which meant to reach it by noonday  the tall roof of the great hall erected by the earl over the baths was already coming in sight and by and by they would look into the valley  the wye after coming down one of those lovely deep ravines to be found in all mountainous countries here flowed through a more open space part of which had been artificially levelled but which was covered with buildings rising out amongst the rocks and trees  most conspicuous among them was a large freshlybuilt erection in tudor architecture with a wide portal arch and five separate gables starting from one central building which bore a large clocktower and was decorated at every corner with the talbots stout and sturdy form this was the great hall built by the present earl george and containing five baths intended to serve separately for each sex gentle and simple with one special bath reserved for the sole use of the more distinguished visitors  besides this at no great distance was the earls own mansion a very goodly house four square four stories high with stables offices and all the requisites of a noblemans establishment and this was to be the lodging of the scottish queen  farther off was another house which had been built by permission of the earl under the auspices of dr jones probably one of the first of the long series of physicians who have made it their business to enhance the fame of the wateringplaces where they have set up their staff  this was the great hostel or lodginghouse for the patients of condition who resorted to the healing springs and nestled here and there among the rocks were cottages which accommodated after a fashion the poorer sort who might drag themselves to the spot in the hope of washing away their rheumatic pains and other infirmities in a distant and magnificent way like some of the lesser german potentates the mighty lord of shrewsbury took toll from the visitors to his baths and this contributed to repair the ravages to his fortune caused by the maintenance of his royal captive  arriving just at noontide the queen and her escort beheld a motley crowd dispersed about the sward on the banks of the river some playing at ball others resting on benches or walking up and down in groups exercise being recommended as part of the cure  all thronged together to watch the earl and his captive ride in with their suite the household turning out to meet them while foremost stood a dapper little figure with a short black cloak a stiff round ruff and a square barrett cap with a goldheaded cane in one hand and a paper in the other  prepare thy patience cis whispered barbara mowbray now shall we not be allowed to alight from our palfreys till we have heard his full welcome to my lord and all his plans for this place howit is to be made a sanctuary for the sick during their abode there for all causes saving sacrilege treason murder burglary and highway robbery with a license to eat flesh on a friday as long as they are drinking the waters  it was as mistress mowbray said  dr joness harangue on the progress of buxton and its prospects had always to be endured before any one was allowed to dismount but royalty and nobility were inured to listening with a good grace and mary though wearied and aching sat patiently in the hot sunshine and was ready to declare that buxton put her in good humour  in fact the grandees and their immediate attendants endured with all the grace of good breeding but the farther from the scene of action the less was the patience and the more restless and confused the movements of the retinue  diccon talbot hungry and eager had let his equally restless pony convey him he scarce knew where from his fathers side when he saw making her way among the horses the very woman with the basket whom he had encountered at tideswell in the early morning  how could she have gone such a distance in the time thought the boy and he presently caught the words addressed to one of the grooms of the scottish queens suite  let me show my poor beads and bracelets the scotsman instantly made way for her and she advanced to a wizened thin old frenchman maitre gorion the queens surgeon who jumped down from his horse and was soon bending over her basket exchanging whispers in the lowest possible tones but a surge among those in the rear drove diccon up so near that he was absolutely certain that they were speaking french as indeed he well knew that m gorion never could succeed in making himself understood in english  the boy bred up in the perpetual caution and suspicion of sheffield was eager to denounce one who he was sure was a conspirator but he was hemmed in among horses and men so that he could not make his way out or see what was passing till suddenly there was a scattering to the right and left and a simultaneous shriek from the ladies in front  when diccon could see anything his father was pressing forward to a group round some one prostrate on the ground before the house and there were exclamations the poor young lady the chirurgeon  to the front the queen is asking for you sir and cicelys horse with loose bridle passed before his eyes  let me through let me through cried the boy it is my sister  he threw his bridle to a groom and squeezing between horses and under elbows succeeded in seeing cis lying on the ground with her eyes shut and her head in his mothers lap and the french surgeon bending over her  she gave a cry when he touched her arm and he said something in his mixture of french and english which diccon could not hear  the queen stood close by a good deal agitated anxiously asking questions and throwing out her hands in her french fashion  diccon much frightened struggled on but only reached the party just as his father had gathered cicely up in his arms to carry her upstairs  diccon followed as closely as he could but blindly in the crowd in the strange house until he found himself in a long gallery shut out among various others of both sexes  come my masters and mistresses all said the voice of the seneschal you had best to your chambers there is naught for you to do here  however he allowed diccon to remain leaning against the balustrade of the stairs which led up outside the house and in another minute his father came out  ha diccon that is well said he  no thou canst not enter  they are about to undress poor little cis  nay it seemed not to me that she was more hurt than thy mother could well have dealt with but the french surgeon would thrust in and the queen would have it so  we will walk here in the court till we hear what he saith of her  how befell it dost thou ask  truly i can hardly tell but i believe one of the frenchmens horses got restless either with a fly or with standing so long to hear yonder leechs discourse  he must needs cut the beast with his rod and so managed to hit white posy who starts aside and cis sitting unheedfully on that newfangled french saddle was thrown in an instant  i shall laugh at her well for letting herself be thrown by a frenchman with his switch said diccon  i hope the damage hath not been great said his father anxiously looking up the stair  where wast thou dick  i had lost sight of thee  i was seeking you sir for i had seen a strange sight said dick that woman who spoke with us at tideswell was here again yea and she talked with the little old frenchman that they call gorion the same that is with cis now  she did  folly boy  the fellow can hardly comprehend five words of plain english together long as he hath been here  one of the queens women is gone in even now to interpret for him  that do i wot sir  therefore did i marvel and sought to tell you  what like was the woman demanded richard  diccons description was lame and his father bade him hasten out of the court and fetch the woman if he could find her displaying her trinkets to the waterdrinkers instructing him not to alarm her by peremptory commands but to give her hopes of a purchaser for her spars  proud of the commission entrusted to him the boy sallied forth but though he wandered through all the groups on the sward and encountered two tumblers and one puppet show besides a bear and monkey he utterly failed in finding the vendor of the beads and bracelets     chapter xiv  the monograms   when cicely had been carried into a chamber by master talbot and laid halfconscious and moaning on the grand carved bed mrs talbot by word and gesture expelled all superfluous spectators  she would have preferred examining alone into the injury sustained by the maiden which she did not think beyond her own management but there was no refusing the services of maitre gorion or of mrs kennedy who indeed treated her authoritatively assuming the direction of the sickroom she found herself acting under their orders as she undid the boddice while mrs kennedy ripped up the tight sleeve of the riding dress and laid bare the arm and shoulder which had been severely bruised and twisted but neither broken nor dislocated as mrs kennedy informed her after a few rapid words from the frenchman unintelligible to the english lady who felt somewhat impatient of this invasion of her privileges and was ready to say she had never supposed any such thing  the chirurgeon skipped to the door and for a moment she hoped that she was rid of him but he had only gone to bring in a neat case with which his groom was in waiting outside whence he extracted a lotion and sponge speaking rapidly as he did so  now madam said jean kennedy lift the lassie there turn back her boddice and we will bathe her shouther  so  by my halidome  ah  mort de ma vie  the two exclamations darted simultaneously from the lips of the scottish nurse and the french doctor  susan beheld what she had at the moment forgotten the curious mark branded on her nurslings shoulder which indeed she had not seen since cicely had been of an age to have the care of her own person and which was out of the girls own sight no more was said at the moment for cis was reviving fast and was so much bewildered and frightened that she required all the attention and soothing that the two women could give but when they removed the rest of her clothing so that she might be laid down comfortably to rest mrs kennedy by another dexterous movement uncovered enough of the other shoulder to obtain a glimpse of the monogram upon it  nothing was spoken  those two had not been so many years attendants on a suspected and imprisoned queen without being prudent and cautious but when they quitted the apartment after administering a febrifuge susan felt a pang of wonder whether they were about to communicate their discovery to their mistress  for the next quarter of an hour the patient needed all her attention and there was no possibility of obeying the summons of a great clanging bell which announced dinner when however cis had fallen asleep it became possible to think over the situation  she foresaw an inquiry and would have given much for a few words with her husband but reflection showed her that the one point essential to his safety was not to betray that he and she had any previous knowledge of the rank of their nursling  the existence of the scroll might have to be acknowledged but to show that richard had deciphered it would put him in danger on all hands  she had just made up her mind on this point when there was a knock at the door and mrs kennedy bore in a salver with a cup of wine and took from an attendant who remained outside a tray with some more solid food which she placed on the broad edge of the deepset window and coming to the bedside invited mrs talbot to eat while she watched the girl  susan complied though with little appetite and mrs kennedy after standing for a few minutes in contemplation came to the window  she was a tall woman her yellow hair softened by an admixture of gray her eyes keen and shrewd yet capable of great tenderness at times her features certainly not youthful but not a whit more aged than they had been when susan had first seen her fourteen years ago  it was a quiet mouth and one that gave a sense of trust both in its firmness secrecy and kindness  madam said she in her soft scotch voice lowered considerably but not whispering and with her keen eyes fixed on susanmadam what garred ye gie your bit lassie yonder marks  ye need not fear that draught of maister gorions will keep her sleeping fast for a good hour or two longer and it behoves me to ken how she cam by yonder brands  she had them when she came to us said susan  yell no persuade me that they are birth marks returned mistress jean  such a thing would be a miracle in a loyal scottish catholics wean let alone an english heretics  no said susan who had in fact only made the answer to give herself time to think whether it were possible to summon her husband they never seemed to me birth marks  woman said jean kennedy laying a strong though soft hand on her wrist this is not gear for trifling  is the lass your ain bairn ha i always thought she had mair of the kindly scot than of the southron about her  hech so they made the puir wean captive  wha gave her till you to keep  your lord i trow  the lord of heaven and earth replied susan  my husband took her the only living thing left on a wreck off the spurn head  hech sirs exclaimed mrs kennedy evidently much struck but still exercising great selfcommand  and when fell this out  two days after low sunday in the year of grace 1568 returned susan  my halidome again ejaculated jean in a low voice crossing herself and what became of honest ailiei mean catching herself up what befell those that went with her  not one lived said susan gravely  the mate of my husbands ship took the little one from the arms of her nurse who seemed to have been left alone with her by the crew lashed to the wreck and to have had her life freshly beaten out by the winds and waves for she was still warm  i was then lying at hull and they brought the babe to me while there was still time to save her life with gods blessing  and the vessel asked jean  my husband held it to be the bride of dunbar plying between that port and harfleur  ay ay  blessed st bride muttered jean kennedy with an awestricken look then collecting herself she added were there no tokens save these about the little one by which she could be known  there was a gold chain with a cross and what you call a reliquary about her little neck and a scroll written in cipher among her swaddling bands but they are laid up at home at bridgefield  it was a perplexing situation for this simplehearted and truthful woman and on the other hand jean kennedy was no less devoted and loyal in her own line a good and conscientious woman but shrewder and by nature and breeding far less scrupulous as to absolute truth  the one idea that susan in her confusion could keep hold of was that any admission of knowledge as to who her cis really was would be a betrayal of her husbands secret and on the other hand she saw that mrs kennedy though most keen to discover everything and no doubt convinced that the maiden was her queens child was bent on not disclosing that fact to the fostermother  she asked anxiously whether mistress cicely knew of her being only an adopted child and susan replied that they had intended that she never should learn that she was of alien birth but that it had been revealed by the old sailor who had brought her on board the mastiff though no one had heard him save young humfrey and the girl herself and they had been so far as she knew perfectly reserved on the subject  jean kennedy then inquired how the name of cicely had been given and whether the child had been so baptized by protestant rites  wot you who the maid may be madam susan took courage to ask but the scotswoman would not be disconcerted and replied  how suld i ken without a sight of the tokens  gin i had them maybe i might give a guess but there was mony a leal scot sairly bestead wife and wean and all in her majestys cause that wearie spring  here cis stirred in her sleep and both women were at her side in a moment but she did not wake  jean kennedy stood gazing at the girl with eagerness that she did not attempt to conceal studying each feature in detail but cis showed in her sleep very little of her royal lineage which betrayed itself far more in her gait and bearing than in her features  susan could not help demanding of the nurse whether she saw any resemblance that could show the maidens parentage  the old lady gave a kind of scotch guttural sound expressive of disappointment and said ill no say but ive seen the like beetlebroo  but well waken the bairn with our clavers  ill away the noo  maister gorion will see her again ere night but it were ill to break her sleep the puir lassie  nevertheless she could not resist bending over and kissing the sleeper so gently that there was no movement  then she left the room and susan stood with clasped hands  my child my child  oh is it coming on thee  wilt thou be taken from me  oh and to what a fate  and to what hands  they will never never love thee as we have done  o god protect her and be her father  and susan knelt by the bed in such a paroxysm of grief that her husband coming in unshod that he might not disturb the girl apprehended that she had become seriously worse  however his entrance awoke her and she found herself much better and was inclined to talk so he sat down on a chest by the bed and related what diccon had told him of the reappearance of the woman with the basket of spar trinkets  beads and bracelets said cicely  ay said he  what knowest thou of them  only that she spake the words so often and the queen just ere that doctor began his speech asked of me whether she did not sell beads and bracelets  tis a password no doubt and we must be on our guard said richard while his wife demanded with whom diccon had seen her speaking  with gorion returned he  that was what made the lad suspect something knowing that the chirurgeon can barely speak three sentences in any tongue but his own and those are in their barbarous scotch  i took the boy with me and inquired here there and everywhere this afternoon but could find no one who had ever seen or heard of any one like her  tell me cis exclaimed susan with a sudden conviction was she like in any fashion to tibbott the hucksterwoman who brought young babington into trouble three years agone  womens heads all run on one notion said richard  can there be no secret agents save poor cuthbert whom i believe to be beyond seas  nay but hear what saith the child asked susan  this woman was not nearly so old as tibbott said cis nor did she walk with a staff nor had she those grizzled black brows that were wont to frighten me  but was she tall asked susan  oh yes mother  she was very tallshe came after diccon and me with long stridesyet it could never have been tibbott  susan had reasons for thinking otherwise but she could not pursue the subject at that time as she had to go down to supper with her husband and privacy was impossible  even at night nobody enjoyed extensive quarters and but for cicelys accident she would have slept with dyot the tirewoman who had arrived with the baggage which included a pallet bed for them  however the young lady had been carried to a chamber intended for one of queen marys suite and there it was decreed that she should remain for the night the mother sleeping with her while the father and son betook themselves to the room previously allotted to the family  only on the excuse of going to take out her husbands gear from the mails was susan able to secure a few words with him and then by ordering out diccon dyot and the servingman  then she could succeed in saying mine husband all will soon outmistress kennedy and master gorion have seen the brands on the childs shoulders  it is my belief that she of the beads and bracelets bade the chirurgeon look for them else why should he have thrust himself in for a hurt that womenfolk had far better have tended  now that kinsman of yours knew that poor cis was none of ours and gave her a hint of it long agothat is if tibbott were he and not something worse  richard shook his head  give a woman a hint of a seminary priest in disguise and she would take a newborn baby for one  i tell thee i heard that cuthbert was safe in paris  but be that as it may i trust thou hast been discreet  so i strove to be said susan  mrs kennedy questioned me and i told her  what sharply demanded her husband  nought but truth she answered save that i showed no knowledge who the maid really is nor let her guess that you had read the scroll  that is well  frank talbot was scarce within his duty when he gave me the key and it were as much as my head were worth to be known to have been aware of the matter  to this susan could only assent as they were interrupted by the servingman coming to ask directions about the bestowal of the goods  she was relieved by this short colloquy but it was a sad and wakeful night for her as cicely slept by her side  her love was too truly motherly not to be deeply troubled at the claim of one of differing religion and nation and who had so uncertain and perilous a lot in which to place her child  there was also the sense that all her dearest including her eldest son were involved in the web of intrigue with persons far mightier and more unscrupulous than themselves and that however they might strive to preserve their integrity it would be very hard to avoid suspicion and danger  in this temporary abode the household of the queen and of the earl ate together in the great hall and thus while breaking their fast in the morning jean kennedy found opportunity to examine richard talbot on all the circumstances of the wreck of the bride of dunbar and the finding of the babe  she was much more on her guard than the day before and said that she had a shrewd suspicion as to who the babes parents might be but that she could not be certain without seeing the reliquary and the scroll  richard replied that they were at home but made no offer of sending for them  nor will i do so said he to his wife unless i am dealt plainly with and the lady herself asks for them  then should i have no right to detain them  m gorion would not allow his patient to leave her room that day and she had to remain there while susan was in attendance on the queen who did not appear to her yet to have heard of the discovery and who was entering with zest into the routine of the place where dr jones might be regarded as the supreme legislator  each division of the great bath hall was fitted with drying and dressing room arranged commodiously according to the degree of those who were to use them  royalty of course enjoyed a monopoly and after the hot bath which the queen took immediately after rising she breakfasted in her own apartments and then came forth according to the regimen of the place by playing at trowle madame  a board with arches cut in just big enough to permit the entrance of the balls used in playing at bowls was placed on the turf at a convenient distance from the player  each arch was numbered from one to thirteen but the numbers were irregularly arranged and the game consisted in rolling bowls into the holes in succession each player taking a single turn and the winner reaching the highest number firstbeing in fact a sort of lawn bagatelle  dr jones recommended it as good to stretch the rheumatic joints of his patients and queen mary an adept at all outofdoor games delighted in it though she had refused an offer to have the lawn arranged for it at sheffield saying that it would only spoil a buxton delight  she was still too stiff to play herself but found infinite amusement in teaching the newcomers the game and poor susan with her thoughts far away was scarcely so apt a pupil as befitted a royal mistress especially as she missed mrs kennedy  when she came back she found that the dame had been sitting with the patient and had made herself very agreeable to the girl by drawing out from her all she knew of her own story from beginning to end having first shown that she knew of the wreck of the bride of dunbar  and mother said cis she says she is nearly certain that she knows who my true parents were and that she could be certain if she saw the swaddling clothes and tokens you had with me  have you mother  i never knew of them  yes child i have  we did not wish to trouble and perturb your mind little one while you were content to be our daughter  ah mother i would fain be yours and fathers still  they must not take me from you  but suppose i was some great and noble lords daughter and had a great inheritance and lordship to give humfrey  alas child  scottish inheritances are wont to bring more strife than wealth  nevertheless cis went on supposing and building castles that were pain and grief to her foreboding auditor  that evening however richard called his wife  it was late but the northern sunset was only just over and susan could wander out with him on the greensward in front of the earls house  so this is the tale we are to be put off with he said from the queen herself ay herself and told with such an air of truth that it would almost make me discredit the scroll  she told me with one of her sweetest smiles how a favourite kinswoman of hers wedded in secret with a faithful follower of hers of the clan hepburn  oh i assure you it might have been a ballad sung by a harper for its sadness  well this fellow ventured too far in her service and had to flee to france to become an archer of the guard while the wife remained and died at lochleven castle having given birth to our cis whom the queen in due time despatched to her father he being minded to have her bred up in a french nunnery sending her to dunbar to be there embarked in the bride of dunbar  and the father  oh forsooth the father  it cost her as little to dispose of him as of the mother  he was killed in some brawl with the huguenots so that the poor child is altogether an orphan beholden to our care for which she thanked me with tears in her eyes that were more true than mayhap the poor woman could help  poor lady said susan  yet can it not be sooth indeed  nay dame that may not be  the cipher is not one that would be used in simply sending a letter to the father  might not the occasion have been used for corresponding in secret with french friends  i tell thee wife if i read one word of that letter i read that the child was her own and confided to the abbess of soissons  i will read it to thee once more ere i yield it up that is if i ever do wherefore cannot the woman speak truth to me  i would be true and faithful were i trusted but to be thus put off with lies makes a man ready at once to ride off with the whole to the queen in council  think but think dear sir pleaded susan how the poor lady is pressed and how much she has to fear on all sides  ay because lies have been meat and drink to her till she cannot speak a soothfast word nor know an honest man when she sees him  what would she have  that cis should remain with us as before and still pass for our daughter till such time as these negotiations are over and she recover her kingdom  that isso far as i seelike not to be till latter lammasbut meantime what sayest thou susan  ah  i knew anything to keep the child with thee  well be it sothough if i had known the web we were to be wound into id have sailed for the indies with humfrey long ago     chapter xv  mother and child   cicely was well enough the next day to leave her room and come out on the summers evening to enjoy the novel spectacle of trowle madame in which she burned to participate so soon as her shoulder should be well  it was with a foreboding heart that her adopted mother fell with her into the rear of the suite who were attending queen mary as she went downstairs to walk on the lawn and sit under a canopy whence she could watch either that game or the shooting at the butts which was being carried on a little farther off  so our bonnie maiden said mary brightening as she caught sight of the young girl thou art come forth once more to rejoice mine eyes a sight for sair een as they say in scotland and she kissed the fresh cheeks with a tenderness that gave susan a strange pang then she asked kindly after the hurt and bade cis sit at her feet while she watched a match in archery between some of the younger attendants now and then laying a caressing hand upon the slender figure  little one she said i would fain have thee to share my pillow i have had no young bedfellow since bess pierrepoint left us  wilt thou stoop to come and cheer the poor old caged bird  oh madam how gladly will i do so if i may cried cicely delighted  we will take good care of her mistress talbot said mary and deliver her up to you whole and sain in the morning and there was a quivering playfulness in her voice  your grace is the mistress answered susan with a sadness not quite controlled  ah you mock me madam  would that i were returned the queen it is my lords consent that we must ask  how say you my lord may i have this maiden for my warder at night  lord shrewsbury was far from seeing any objection and the promise was given that cis should repair to the queens chamber for at least that night  she was full of excitement at the prospect  why look you so sadly at me sweet mother she cried as susan made ready her hair and assisted her in all the arrangements for which her shoulder was still too stiff you do not fear that they will hurt my arm  no truly my child  they have tender and skilful hands  may be they will tell me the story of my parents said cis but you need never doubt me mother  though i were to prove to be ever so great a lady no one could ever be mine own mother like you  scarcely in love my child said susan as she wrapped the little figure in a loose gown and gave her such a kiss as parents seldom permitted themselves in the fear of cockering their children which was considered to be a most reprehensible practice  nor could she refrain from closely pressing cicelys hand as they passed through the corridor to the queens apartments gave the word to the two yeomen who were on guard for the night at the head of the stairs and tapped at the outmost door of the royal suite of rooms  it was opened by a french valet but mrs kennedy instantly advanced took the maiden by the hand and with a significant smile said gramercy madam we will take unco gude tent of the lassie  a fair gude nicht to ye  and mrs talbot felt as she put the little hand into that of the nurse and saw the door shut on them as if she had virtually given up her daughter and oh was it for her good  cis was led into the bedchamber bright with wax tapers though the sky was not yet dark  she heard a sound as of closing and locking double doors while some one drew back a crimson goldedged velvet curtain which she had seen several times and which it was whispered concealed the shrine where queen mary performed her devotions  she had just risen from before it at the sound of ciss entrance and two of her ladies mary seaton and marie de courcelles seemed to have been kneeling with her  she was made ready for bed with a darkblue velvet gown corded round her and her hair now very gray braided beneath a little round cap but a square of soft cambric drapery had been thrown over her head so as to form a perfectly graceful veil and shelter the features that were aging  indeed when queen mary wore the exquisite smile that now lit up her face as she held out her arms no one ever paused to think what those lineaments really were  she held out her arms as cis advanced bashfully and said welcome my sweet bedfellow my little scotone more loyal subject come to me in my bondage  ciss impulse was to put a knee to the ground and kiss the hands that received her  thou art our patient continued mary  i will see thee in bed ere i settle myself there  the bed was a tall large carved erection with sweeping green and silver curtains and a huge bank of lacebordered pillows  a flight of low steps facilitated the ascent and cis passive in this new scene was made to throw off her dressinggown and climb up  and now said the queen let me see the poor little shoulder that hath suffered so much  my arm is still bound madam said cis  but she was not listened to and mrs kennedy much to her discomfiture turned back her undergarment  the marks were in fact so placed as to be entirely out of her own view and mrs susan had kept them from the knowledge or remark of any one  they were also high enough up to be quite clear from the bandages and thus she was amazed to hear the exclamation there sooth enough  monsieur gorion could swear to them instantly  what is it  oh what is it madam cried cis affrighted is there anything on my back  no plague spot i hope and her eyes grew round with terror  the queen laughed  no plague spot sweet one save perhaps in the eyes of you protestants but to me they are a gladsome sighta token i never hoped to see  and the bewildered girl felt a pair of soft lips kiss each mark in turn and then the covering was quickly and caressingly restored and mary added lie down my child and now to bed to bed my maids patent the lights  then making the sign of the cross as cis had seen poor antony babington do the queen just as all the lights save one were extinguished was divested of her wrapper and veil and took her place beside cis on the pillows  the two maries left the chamber and jean kennedy disposed herself on a pallet at the foot of the bed  and so said the queen in a low voice tender but with a sort of banter she thought she had the plague spot on her little white shoulders  didst thou really not know what marks thou bearest little one  no madam said cis  is it what i have felt with my fingers  listen child said mary  art thou at thine ease thy poor shoulder resting well  there then give me thine hand and i will tell thee a tale  there was a lonely castle in a lake grim cold and northerly and thither there was brought by angry men a captive woman  they had dealt with her strangely and subtilly they had laid on her the guilt of the crimes themselves had wrought and when she clung to the one man whom at least she thought honest they had forced and driven her into wedding him only that all the world might cry out upon her forsake her and deliver her up into those cruel hands  there was something irresistibly pathetic in marys voice and the maiden lay gazing at her with swimming eyes  thou dost pity that poor lady sweet one  there was little pity for her then  she had looked her last on her ladbairn ay and they had said she had striven to poison him and they were breeding him up to loathe the very name of his mother yea and to hate and persecute the church of his father and his mother both  and so it was that the lady vowed that if another babe was granted to her sprung of that last strange miserable wedlock these foes of hers should have no part in it nor knowledge of its very existence but that it should be bred up beyond their kensafe out of their reach  ah child good nurse kennedy can best tell thee how the jealous eyes and ears were disconcerted and in secrecy and sorrow that birth took place  ciss heart was beating too fast for speech but there was a tight close pressure of the hand that mary had placed within hers  the poor mother went on the queen in a low trembling voice durst have scarce one hours joy of her first and only daughter ere the trusty gorion took the little one from her to be nursed in a hut on the other side of the lake  there continued mary forgetting the third person i hoped to have joined her so soon as i was afoot again  the faithful lavender lent me her garments and i was already in the boat but the menatarms were rude and would have pulled down my muffler i raised my hand to protect myself and it was all too white  they had not let me stain it because the dye would not befit a washerwoman  so there was i dragged back to ward again and all our plans overthrown  and it seemed safer and meeter to put my little one out of reach of all my foes even if it were far away from her mothers aching heart  not one more embrace could i be granted but my good chaplain rosswhom the saints restbaptized her in secret and gorion had set two marks on the soft flesh which he said could never be blotted out in after years and then her fathers clanswoman alison hepburn undertook to carry her to france with a letter of mine bound up in her swathing clothes committing her to the charge of my good aunt the abbess of soissons in utter secrecy until better days should come  alas i thought them not so far off i deemed that were i once beyond the clutches of morton ruthven and the rest the loyal would rally once more round my standard and my crown would be mine own mine enemies and those of my church beneath my feet  little did i guess that my escape would only be to see them slain and routed and that when i threw myself on the hospitality of my cousin her tender mercies would prove such as i have found them libera me dominie libera me  cis began dimly to understand but she was still too much awed to make any demonstration save a convulsive pressure of the queens hand and the murmuring of the latin prayer distressed her  presently mary resumed  long long did i hope my little one was safely sheltered from all my troubles in the dear old cloisters of soissons and that it was caution in my good aunt the abbess that prevented my hearing of her but through my faithful servants my lord flemyng who had been charged to speed her from scotland at length let me know that the ship in which she sailed the bride of dunbar had been never heard of more and was thought to have been cast away in a tempest that raged two days after she quitted dunbar and ii shed some tears but i could well believe that the innocent babe had been safely welcomed among the saints and i could not grieve that she was as i thought spared from the doom that rests upon the race of stewart till one week back i gave thanks for that child of sorrow as cradled in paradise  then followed a pause and then cis said in a low trembling voice and it was from the wreck of the bride of dunbar that i was taken  thou hast said it child  my bairn my bonnie bairn and the girl was absorbed in a passionate embrace and strained convulsively to a bosom which heaved with the sobs of tempestuous emotion and the caresses were redoubled upon her again and again with increasing fervour that almost frightened her  speak to me  speak to me  let me hear my childs voice  oh madam  call me mother  never have i heard that sound from my childs lips i have borne two children two living children only to be stripped of both  speak childlet me hear thee  cis contrived to say mother my mother but scarcely with effusion it was all so strange and she could not help feeling as if susan were the mother she knew and was at ease with  all this was much too like a dream from which she longed to awake  and there was mrs kennedy too rising up and crying quite indignantlymother indeed is that all thou hast to say as though it were a task under the rod when thou art owned for her own bairn by the fairest and most illused queen in christendom  out on thee  have the southron loons chilled thine heart and made thee no leal to thine ain mother that hath hungered for thee  the angry tones and her sense of her own shortcomings could only make cis burst into tears  hush hush nurse thou shalt not chide my newfound bairn  she will learn to ken us better in time if they will leave her with us said mary  there there greet not so sair mine ain  i ask thee not to share my sorrows and my woes  that heaven forefend  i ask thee but to come from time to time and cheer my nights and lie on my weary bosom to still its ache and yearning and let me feel that i have indeed a child  oh mother mother cis cried again in a stifled voice as one who could not utter her feelings but not in the cold dry tone that had called forth mrs kennedys wrath  pardon me i know noti cannot say what i would  but oh i would do anything forfor your grace  all that i would ask of thee is to hold thy peace and keep our counsel  be cicely talbot by day as ever  only at night be minemy child my bride for so wast thou named after our scottish patroness it was a relic of her sandals that was hung about thy neck and her ship in which thou didst sail and lo she heard and guarded thee and not merely saved thee from death but provided thee a happy joyous home and wellnurtured childhood  we must render her our thanks my child beata brigitta ora pro nobis  it was the good god almighty who saved me madam said cis bluntly  alack  i forgot that yonder good lady could not fail to rear thee in the outer darkness of her heresy but thou wilt come back to us my ain wee thing  heaven forbid that i should deny whose hand it was that saved thee but it was at the blessed brides intercession  no doubt she reserved for me who had turned to her in my distress this precious consolation  but i will not vex thy little heart with debate this first night  to be mother and child is enough for us what art thou pondering  only madam who was it that told your grace that i was a stranger  the marks bairnie the marks said mary  they told their own tale to good nurse jeanie ay and to gorion whom we blamed for his cruelty in branding my poor little lammie  ah but said cicely did not yonder woman with the beads and bracelets bid him look  if it had been lighter cicely would have seen that the queen was not pleased at the inquiry but she only heard the answer from jeans bed hout no i wad she knew nought of thae brands  how should she  nay said cicely sheno it was tibbott the hucksterwoman told me long ago that i was not what i seemed and that i came from the northi cannot understand  were they the same  the bairn kens too much said jean  dinna ye deave her grace with your speirings my lammie  yell have to learn to keep a quiet sough and to see mickle ye canna understand here  silence her not good nurse said the queen it imports us to know this matter  what saidst thou of tibbott  she was the woman who got antony babington into trouble explained cicely  i deemed her a witch for she would hint strange things concerning me but my father always believed she was a kinsman of his who was concerned in the rising of the north and who he said had seen me brought in to hull from the wreck  ay said the queen as a sign to her to continue  and meseemed added cicely timidly that the strange woman at tideswell who talked of beads and bracelets minded me of tibbott though she was younger and had not her grizzled brows but father says that cannot be for master cuthbert langston is beyond seas at paris  soh that is well returned mary in a tone of relief  see child that langston of whom you speak was a true friend of mine he has done much for me under many disguises and at the time of thy birth he lived as a merchant at hull trading with scotland  thus it may have become known to him that the babe he had seen rescued from the wreck was one who had been embarked at dunbar  but no more doth he know  the secret of thy birth my poor bairn was entrusted to none save a few of those about me and all of those who are still living thou hast already seen lord flemyng who put thee on board believed thee the child of james hepburn of lillieburn the archer and of my poor mary stewart a kinswoman of mine ain and it was in that belief doubtless that he or tibbott as thou callst him would have spoken with thee  but the woman at tideswell said cis who was getting bewildereddiccon said that she spake to master gorion  that did she and pointed thee out to him  it is true  she is another faithful friend of mine and no doubt she had the secret from him  but no more questions child  enough that we sleep in each others arms  it was a strange night  cis was more conscious of wonder excitement and a certain exultation than of actual affection  she had not been bred up so as to hunger and crave for love  indeed she had been treated with more tenderness and indulgence than was usual with peoples own daughters and her adopted parents had absorbed her undoubting love and respect  queen marys fervent caresses were at least as embarrassing as they were gratifying because she did not know what response to make and the novelty and wonder of the situation were absolutely distressing  they would have been more so but for the queens tact  she soon saw that she was overwhelming the girl and that time must be given for her to become accustomed to the idea  so saying tenderly something about rest she lay quietly leaving cis as she supposed to sleep this however was impossible to the girl except in snatches which made her have to prove to herself again and again that it was not all a dream the last of these wakenings was by daylight as full as the heavy curtains would admit and she looked up into a face that was watching her with such tender wistfulness that it drew from her perforce the word mother  ah that is the tone with the true ring in it  i thank thee and i bless thee my bairn said mary making over her the sign of the cross at which the maiden winced as at an incantation  then she added my little maid we must be up and stirring  mind no word of all this  thou art cicely talbot by day as ever and only my child my bride mine ain wee thing my princess by night  canst keep counsel  surely madam said cis i have known for five years that i was a foundling on the wreck and i never uttered a word  mary smiled  this is either a very simple child or a very canny one she said to jean kennedy  either she sees no boast in being of royal blood or she deems that to have the mother she has found is worse than the being the nameless foundling  oh madam mother not so  i meant but that i had held my tongue when i had something to tell  let thy secrecy stand thee in good stead child said the queen remember that did the bruit once get abroad thou wouldest assuredly be torn from me to be mewed up where the english queen could hinder thee from ever wedding living man  ay and it might bring the head of thy fosterfather to the block if he were thought to have concealed the matter  i fear me thou art too young for such a weighty secret  i am seventeen years old madam returned cis with dignity i have kept the other secret since i was twelve  then thou wilt i trust have the wisdom not to take the princess on thee nor to give any suspicion that we are more to one another than the caged bird and the bright linnet that comes to sing on the bars of her cage  only child thou must get from master talbot these tokens that i hear of  hast seen them  never madam indeed i knew not of them  i need them not to know thee for mine own but it is not well that they should be in stranger hands  thou canst saybut hush we must be mum for the present  for it became necessary to admit the queens morning draught of spiced milk borne in by one of her suite who had to remain uninitiated and from that moment no more confidences could be exchanged until the time that cis had to leave the queens chamber to join the rest of the household in the daily prayers offered in the chapel  her dress and hair had according to promise been carefully attended to but she was only finished and completed just in time to join her adopted parents on the way down the stairs  she knelt in the hall for their blessingan action as regular and as mechanical as the morning kiss and greeting now are between parent and child but there was something in her face that made susan say to herself she knows all  they could not speak to one another till not only matins but breakfast were ended and thenafter the somewhat solid mealthe ladies had to put on their outofdoor gear to attend queen mary in her daily exercise  the dress was not much high summer as it was only a loose veil over the stiff cap and a fan in the gloved hand to act as parasol  however the retirement gave cicely an interval in which to say o mother she has told me and as susan sat holding out her arms the adopted child threw herself on her knees hiding her face on that bosom where she had found comfort all her life and where her emotion at last finding full outlet she sobbed without knowing why for some moments till she started nervously at the entrance of richard saying the queen is asking for you both  but how now  is all told  ay whispered his wife  so  and why these tears  tell me my maid was not she good to thee doth she seek to take thee into her own keeping  oh no sir no said cis still kneeling against the motherly knee and struggling with her sobs  no one is to guess  i am to be cicely talbot all the same till better days come to her  the safer and the happier for thee child  here are two honest hearts that will not cast thee off even if as i suspect yonder lady would fain be quit of thee  oh no burst from cicely then shocked at having committed the offence of interrupting him she added dear sir i crave your pardon but indeed she is all fondness and love  then what means this passion he asked looking from one to the other  it means only that the childs senses and spirits are overcome said susan and that she scarce knows how to take this discovery is it not so sweetheart  oh sweet mother yes in sooth  you will ever be mother to me indeed  well said little maid said richard  thou mightest search the world over and never hap upon such another  but she oweth duty to the true mother said susan with her hand on the girls neck  we wot well of that answered her husband and i trow the first is to be secret  yea sir said cis recovering herself none save the very few who tended her the queen at lochleven know who i verily am  such as were aware of the babe being put on board ship at dunbar thought me the daughter of a scottish archer a hepburn and she the queen my mother would have me pass as such to those who needs must know i am not myself  trust her for making a double web when a single one would do muttered richard but so that the girl could not hear  there is no need for any to know at present said susan hastily moved perhaps by the same dislike to deception but ah theres that fortunetelling woman  cis proud of her secret information here explained that tibbott was indeed cuthbert langston but not the person whose password was beads and bracelets and that both alike could know no more than the story of the scottish archer and his young wife but they were here interrupted by the appearance of diccon who had been sent by my lord himself to hasten them at the instance of the queen  master richard sent the boy on with his mother saying he would wait and bring cis as she had still to compose her hair and coif which had become somewhat disordered  my maiden he said gravely i have somewhat to say unto thee thou art in a stranger case than any woman of thy years between the four seas nay it may be in christendom  it is woeful hard for thee not to be a traitor through mere lapse of tongue to thine own mother or else to thy queen  so i tell thee this once for all  see as little hear as little and above all say as little as thou canst  not to mother asked cis  no not to her above all not to me and my girl pray god daily to keep thee true and loyal and guard thee and the rest of us from snares  now have with thee  we may tarry no longer  all went as usual for the rest of the day so that the last night was like a dream until it became plain that cicely was again to share the royal apartment  ah i have thirsted for this hour said mary holding out her arms and drawing her daughter to her bosom  thou art a canny lassie mine ain wee thing  none could have guessed from thy bearing that there was aught betwixt us  in sooth madam said the girl it seems that i am two maidens in onecis talbot by day and bride of scotland by night  that is well  be all cis talbot by day  when there is need to dissemble believe in thine own feigning  tis for want of that art that these clumsy southrons make themselves but a laughingstock whenever they have a secret  cis did not understand the maxim and submitted in silence to some caresses before she said my father will give your grace the tokens when we return  thy father child  i crave your pardon madam it comes too trippingly to my tongue thus to term master talbot  so much the better  thy tongue must not lose the trick  i did but feel a moments fear lest thou hadst not been guarded enough with yonder sailor man and had let him infer over much  o surely madam you never meant me to withhold the truth from father and mother cried cis in astonishment and dismay  tush silly maid said the queen really angered  father and mother forsooth  now shall we have a fresh coil  i should have known better than to have trusted thy word  never would i have given my word to deceive them cried cis hotly  lassie exclaimed jean kennedy ye forget to whom ye speak  nay said mary recovering herself or rather seeing how best to punish tis the poor bairn who will be the sufferer  our state cannot be worse than it is already save that i shall lose her presence but it pities me to think of her  the secret is safe with them repeated cis o madam none are to be trusted like them  tell me not said the queen  the sailors blundering loyalty will not suffer him to hold his tongue  i would lay my two lost crowns that he is down on his honest knees before my lord craving pardon for having unwittingly fostered one of the viper brood  then via off goes a postboots and spurs are no doubt already onand by and by comes knollys or garey or walsingham to bear off the perilous maiden to walk in queen besss train and have her ears boxed when her majesty is out of humour or when she gets weary of dressing st katherines hair and weds the man of her choice she begins to taste of prison walls and is a captive for the rest of her days  cis was reduced to tears and assurances that if the queen would only broach the subject to master richard she would perceive that he regarded as sacred secrets that were not his own and to show that he meant no betrayal she repeated his advice as to seeing hearing and saying as little as possible  wholesome counsel said mary  cheer thee lassie mine i will credit whatever thou wilt of this fosterfather of thine until i see it disproved and for the good lady his wife she hath more inward if less outward grace than any dame of the mastiff brood which guards our prison court  i should have warned thee that they were not excepted from those who may deem thee my poor marys child  cicely did not bethink herself that in point of fact she had not communicated her royal birth to her adopted parents but that it had been assumed between them as indeed they had not mentioned their previous knowledge   mary presently proceededafter all we may not have to lay too heavy a burden on their discretion  better days are coming  one day shall our faithful lieges open the way to freedom and royalty and thou shalt have whatever boon thou wouldst ask even were it pardon for my lady shrewsbury  there is one question i would fain ask madam mother doth my real father yet live  the earl of  jean kennedy made a sound of indignant warning and consternation cutting her short in dismay but the queen gripped her hand tightly for some moments and then said tis not a thing to speir of me child of me the most woefully deceived and forlorn of ladies never have i seen nor heard from him since the parting at carbery hill when he left me to bear the brunt  folk say that he took ship for the north believe him dead child  so were it best for us both but never name him to me more  jean kennedy knew though the girl did not what these words conveyed if bothwell no longer lived there would be no need to declare the marriage null and void and thus sacrifice his daughters position but supposing him to be in existence mary had already shown herself resolved to cancel the very irregular bonds which had united thema most easy matter for a member of her church since they had been married by a reformed minister and bothwell had a living wife at the time  of all this cicely was absolutely ignorant and was soon eagerly listening as the queen spoke of her hopes of speedy deliverance  my son my jamie is working for me she said nay dost not ken what is in view for me  no madam my good father master richard i mean never tells aught that he hears in my lords closet  that is to assure me of his discretion i trow but this is no secret no treason against our wellbeloved cousin bess  oh no but thy brother mine ain ladbairn hath come to years of manhood and hath shaken himself free of the fetters of knox and morton and buchanan and all their clamjamfrie  the stewart lion hath been too strong for them the puir laddie hath true men about him at lastthe master of gray as they call him and esme stewart of aubigny a scot polished as the french know how to brighten scottish steel  nor will the lad bide that his mother should pine longer in durance  he yearns for her and hath writ to her and to elizabeth offering her a share in his throne  poor laddie what would be outrecuidance in another is but duteousness in him  what will he say when we bring him a sister as well as a mother they tell me that he is an unco scholar but uncouth in his speech and manners and how should it be otherwise with no woman near him save my old lady mar  we shall have to take him in hand to teach him fair courtesy  sure he will be an old pupil said cis if he be more than two years my elder  never fear if we can find a winsome young bride for him trust mother wife and sister for moulding him to kingly bearing  we will make our home in stirling or linlithgow we two and leave holyrood to him  i have seen too much there ever to thole the sight of those chambers far less of the high street of edinburgh but stirling bonnie stirling ay i would fain ride a hawking there once more methinks a highland breeze would put life and youth into me again theres a little chamber opening into mine where i will bestow thee my lady bride of scotland for so long as i may keep thee  ah it will not be for long  they will be seeking thee my brave courtly faithful kindred of lorraine and scottish nobles and english lords will vie for this little hand of thine where courses the royal blood of both realms  so please you madam my mother  eh  what is it  who is it  i deemed that yonder honourable dame had kept thee from all the frolics and foibles of the poor old profession fear not to tell me little one  remember thine own mother hath a heart for such matters  i guess already  cetait un beau garcon ce pauvre antoine  oh no madam exclaimed cicely  when the sailor goatley disclosed that i was no child of my fathers of master richard i mean and was a nameless creature belonging to no one humfrey talbot stood forth and pledged himself to wed me so soon as we were old enough  and what said the squire and dame  that i should then be indeed their daughter  and hath the contract gone no farther  no madam  he hath been to the north with captain frobisher and since that to the western main and we look for his return even now  how long is it since this pledge as thou callest it was given  five years next lammas tide madam  was it by ring or token  no madam  our mother said we were too young but humfrey meant it with all his heart  humfrey  that was the urchin who must needs traverse the correspondence through the seeming tibbott and so got antony removed from about us  a stout lubberly yorkshire lad fed on beef and pudding a true talbot a mere english bulldog who will have lost all the little breeding he had while committing spulzie and piracy at sea on his catholic majestys ships  bah mon enfant i am glad of it had he been a graceful young courtly page like the poor antony it might have been a little difficult but a great english carle like that whom thou hast not seen for five years she made a gesture with her graceful hands as if casting away a piece of thistledown  humfrey is my very goodmy very good brother madam cried cicely casting about for words to defend him and not seizing the most appropriate  brother quotha  yea and as good brother he shall be to thee and welcome so long as thou art cis talbot by daybut no more child princesses mate not with yorkshire esquires  when the lady bride takes her place in the halls of her forefathers she will be the property of scotland and her hand will be sought by princes  ah lassie let it not grieve thee  one thing thy mother can tell thee from her own experience  there is more bliss in mating with our equals by the choice of others than in following our own wild will thou gazest at me in wonder but verily my happy days were with my gentle young kingand so will thine be i pray the saints happier and more enduring than ever were mine  nothing has ever lasted with me but captivity o libera me  and in the murmured repetition the mother fell asleep and the daughter who had slumbered little the night before could not but likewise drop into the world of soothing oblivion though with a dull feeling of aching and yearning towards the friendly kindly humfrey yet with a certain exultation in the fate that seemed to be carrying her on inevitably beyond his reach     chapter xvi  the peak cavern   it was quite true that at this period queen mary had good hope of liberation in the most satisfactory manner possibleshort of being hailed as english queen  negotiations were actually on foot with james vi and elizabeth for her release  james had written to her with his own hand and she had for the first time consented to give him the title of king of scotland  the project of her reigning jointly with him had been mooted and each party was showing how enormous a condescension it would be in his or her eyes  thus there was no great unlikelihood that there would be a recognition of the lady bride and that she would take her position as the daughter of a queen therefore when mary contrived to speak to master richard talbot and his wife in private she was able to thank them with gracious condescension for the care they had bestowed in rearing her daughter much as if she had voluntarily entrusted the maiden to them saying she trusted to be in condition to reward them  mistress susans heart swelled high with pain as though she had been thanked for her care of humfrey or diccon and her husband answered we seek no reward madam  the damsel herself while she was ours was reward enough  and i must still entreat that of your goodness you will let her remain yours for a little longer said mary with a touch of imperious grace until this treaty is over and i am free it is better that she continues to pass for your daughter  the child herself has sworn to me by her great gods said mary smiling with complimentary grace that you will preserve her secretnay she becomes a little fury when i express my fears lest you should have scruples  no madam this is no state secret such as i might not with honour conceal returned richard  there is true english sense exclaimed mary  i may then count on your giving my daughter the protection of your name and your home until i can reclaim her and place her in her true position  yea and if your concealment should give offence and bring you under any displeasure of my good sister those who have so saved and tended my daughter will have the first claim to whatever i can give when restored to my kingdom  we are much beholden for your graces favour said richard somewhat stiffly but i trust never to serve any land save mine own  ah there is your fierete cried mary  happy is my sister to have subjects with such a point of honour  happy is my child to have been bred up by such parents  richard bowed  it was all a man could do at such a speech and mary further added she has told me to what bounds went your goodness to her  it is well that you acted so prudently that the childrens hearts were not engaged for as we all know but too well royal blood should have no heart  i am quite aware of it madam returned richard and there for the time the conversation ended  the queen had been most charming full of gratitude and perfectly reasonable in her requests and yet there was some flaw in the gratification of both even while neither thought the disappointment would go very hard with their son richard could never divest himself of the instinctive prejudice with which soft words inspire men of his nature and susans maternal heart was all in revolt against the inevitable not merely grieving over the wrench to her affections but full of forebodings and misgivings as to the future welfare of her adopted child  even if the brightest hopes should be fulfilled the destiny of a scottish princess did not seem to southern eyes very brilliant at the best and whether poor bride hepburn might be owned as a princess at all was a doubtful matter since if her father lived and he had certainly been living in 1577 in norway both the queen and the scottish people would be agreed in repudiating the marriage  any way susan saw every reason to fear for the happiness and the religion alike of the child to whom she had given a mothers love under her grave selfcontained placid demeanour perhaps dame susan was the most dejected of those at buxton  the captive queen had her hopes of freedom and her newly found daughter who was as yet only a pleasure and not an encumbrance to her the earl had been assured that his wifes slanders had been forgotten  he was secure of his sovereigns favour and permitted to see the term of his weary jailorship and thus there was an unusual liveliness and cheerfulness about the whole sojourn at buxton where indeed there was always more or less of a holiday time  to cis herself her nights were like a perpetual fairy tale and so indeed were all times when she was alone with the initiated who were indeed all those original members of her mothers suite who had known of her birth at lochleven people who had kept too many perilous secrets not to be safely entrusted with this one and whose finished habits of caution in a moment on the approach of a stranger would change their manner from the deferential courtesy due to their princess to the goodnatured civility of court ladies to little cicely talbot  dame susan had been gratified at first by the young girls sincere assurances of unchanging affection and allegiance and in truth cis had clung the most to her with the confidence of a whole lifes danghterhood but as the days went on and every caress and token of affection imaginable was lavished upon the maiden every splendid augury held out to her of the future and every story of the past detailed the charms of marys court life in france seen through the vista of nearly twenty sadly contrasted years it was in the very nature of things that cis should regard the time spent perforce with mistress talbot much as a petted child views its return to the strict nurse or governess from the delights of the drawingroom  she liked to dazzle the homely housewife with the wonderful tales of french gaieties or the splendid castles in the air she had heard in the queens rooms but she resented the doubt and disapproval they sometimes excited she was petulant and fractious at any exercise of authority from her fostermother and once or twice went near to betray herself by lapsing into a tone towards her which would have brought down severe personal chastisement on any real daughter even of seventeen  it was well that the countess and her sharpeyed daughter mary were out of sight as the sight of such cockering of a malapert maiden would have led to interference that might have brought matters to extremity  yet with all the forbearance thus exercised susan could not but feel that the girls love was being weaned from her and after all how could she complain since it was by the true mother  if only she could have hoped it was for the dear childs good it would not have been so hard  but the trial was a bitter one and not even her husband guessed how bitter it was  the queen meantime improved daily in health and vigour in the splendid summer weather  the rheumatism had quitted her and she daily rode and played at trowle madame for hours after supper in the long bright july evenings  cis whose shoulder was quite well played with great delight on the greensward where one evening she made acquaintance with a young esquire and his sisters from the neighbourhood who had come with their father to pay their respects to my lord earl as the head of all hallamshire  the earl though it was not quite according to the recent stricter rules ventured to invite them to stay to sup with the household and afterwards they came out with the rest upon the lawn  cis was walking between the young lad and his sister laughing and talking with much animation for she had not for some time enjoyed the pleasure of free intercourse with any of her fellowdenizens in the happy land of youth  dame susan watched her with some uneasiness and presently saw her taking them where she herself was privileged to go but strangers were never permitted to approach on the trowle madame sward reserved for the queen on which she was even now entering  cicely she called but the young lady either did not or would not hear and she was obliged to walk hastily forward meet the party and with courteous excuses turn them back from the forbidden ground they submitted at once apologising but cis with a red spot on her cheek cried the queen would take no offence  that is not the matter in point cicely said dame susan gravely master and mistress eyre understand that we are bound to obedience to the earl  master eyre a wellbred young gentleman made reply that he well knew that no discourtesy was intended but cis pouted and muttered evidently to the extreme amazement of mistress alice eyre and dame susan to divert her attention began to ask about the length of their ride and the way to their home  ciss ill humour never lasted long and she suddenly broke in o mother master eyre saith there is a marvellous cavern near his fathers house all full of pendants from the roof like a minster and great sheeted tables and statues standing up all grand and ghostly on the floor far better than in this pools hole  he says his father will have it lighted up if we will ride over and see it  we are much beholden to master eyre said susan but cis read refusal in her tone and began to urge her to consent  it must be as my husband wills was the grave answer and at the same time courteously but very decidedly she bade the strangers farewell and made her daughter do the same though cis was inclined to resistance and in a somewhat defiant tone added i shall not forget your promise sir  i long to see the cave  child child entreated susan as soon as they were out of hearing be on thy guard  thou wilt betray thyself by such conduct towards me  but mother they did so long to see the queen and there would have been no harm in it  they are well affected and the young gentleman is a friend of poor master babington  nay cis that is further cause that i should not let them pass onward  i marvel not at thee my maid but thou and thy mother queen must bear in mind that while thou passest for our daughter and hast trust placed in thee thou must do nothing to forfeit it or bring thy fa master richard i mean into trouble  i meant no harm said cis rather crossly  thou didst not but harm may be done by such as mean it the least  only mother sweet mother cried the girl childlike set upon her pleasure i will be as good as can be  i will transgress in nought if only thou wilt get my father to take me to see master eyres cavern  she was altogether the home daughter again in her eagerness entreating and promising by turns with the eager curiosity of a young girl bent on an expedition but richard was not to be prevailed on he had little or no acquaintance with the eyre family and to let them go to the cost and trouble of lighting up the cavern for the young ladys amusement would be like the encouragement of a possible suit which would have been a most inconvenient matter  richard did not believe the young gentleman had warrant from his father in giving this invitation and if he had that was the more reason for declining it  the eyres then holding the royal castle of the peak were suspected of being secretly roman catholics and though the earl could not avoid hospitably bidding them to supper the less any talbot had to do with them the better and for the present cis must be contented to be reckoned as one  so she had to put up with her disappointment and she did not do so with as good a grace as she would have shown a year ago  nay she carried it to queen mary who at night heard her gorgeous description of the wonders of the cavern which grew in her estimation in proportion to the difficulty of seeing them and sympathised with her disappointment at the denial  nay thou shalt not be balked said mary with the old queenly habit of having her own way  prisoner as i am i will accomplish this  my daughter shall have her wish  so on the ensuing morning when the earl came to pay his respects mary assailed him with there is a marvellous cavern in these parts my lord of which i hear great wonders  does your grace mean pools hole  nay nay my lord  have i not been conducted through it by dr jones and there writ my name for his delectation  this is i hear as a palace compared therewith  the peak cavern madam said lord shrewsbury with the distaste of middle age for underground expeditions is four leagues hence and a dark damp doleful den most noxious for your graces rheumatism  have you ever seen it my lord  no verily returned his lordship with a shudder  then you will be edified yourself my lord if you will do me the grace to escort me thither said mary with the imperious suavity she well knew how to adopt  madam madam cried the unfortunate earl do but consult your physicians  they will tell you that all the benefits of the buxton waters will be annulled by an hour in yonder subterranean hole  i have heard of it from several of my suite replied mary and they tell me that the work of nature on the limedroppings is so marvellous that i shall not rest without a sight of it  many have been instant with me to go and behold the wondrous place  this was not untrue but she had never thought of gratifying them in her many previous visits to buxton  the earl found himself obliged either to utter a harsh and unreasonable refusal or to organise an expedition which he personally disliked extremely and moreover distrusted for he did not in the least believe that queen mary would be so set upon gratifying her curiosity about stalactites without some ulterior motive  he tried to set on dr jones to persuade messieurs gorion and bourgoin her medical attendants that the cave would be fatal to her rheumatism but it so happened that the peak cavern was dr joness favourite lion the very pride of his heart pools hole was dear to him but the peak cave was far more precious and the very idea of the queen of scots honouring it with her presence and leaving behind her the flavour of her name was so exhilarating to the little man that if the place had been ten times more damp he would have vouched for its salubrity  moreover he undertook that fumigations of fragrant woods should remove all peril of noxious exhalations so that the earl was obliged to give his orders that mr eyre should be requested to light up the cave and heartily did he grumble and pour forth his suspicions and annoyance to his cousin richard  and i said the good sailor felt it hard not to be able to tell him that all was for the freak of a silly damsel  mistress cicely laughed a little triumphantly  it was something like being a queens daughter to have been the cause of making my lord himself bestir himself against his will  she had her own way and might well be goodhumoured  come dear sir father she said coming up to him in a coaxing patronising way which once would have been quite alien to them both be not angered  you know nobody means treason  and after all tis not i but you that are the cause of all the turmoil  if you would but have ridden soberly out with your poor little cis there would have been no coil but my lord might have paced stately and slow up and down the terracewalk undisturbed  ah child child said susan vexed though her husband could not help smiling at the arch drollery of the girls tone and manner do not thou learn light mockery of all that should be honoured  i am not bound to honour the earl said cis proudly  hush hush said richard  i have allowed thee unchecked too long maiden  wert thou ten times what thou art it would not give thee the right to mock at the grayhaired highlytrusted noble the head of the name thou dost bear  and the torment of her whom i am most bound to love broke from cicely petulantly  richards response to this sally was to rise up make the young lady the lowest possible reverence with extreme and displeased gravity and then to quit the room  it brought the girl to her bearings at once oh mother mother how have i displeased him  i trow thou canst not help it child said susan sadly but it is hard that thou shouldst bring home to us how thine heart and thine obedience are parted from us  the maiden was in a passion of tears at once vowing that she meant no such thing that she loved and obeyed them as much as ever and that if only her father would forgive her she would never wish to go near the cavern  she would beg the queen to give up the plan at once if only sir richard would be her good father as before  susan looked at her sadly and tenderly but smiled and said that what had been lightly begun could not now be dropped and that she trusted cis would be happy in the days enjoyment and remember to behave herself as a discreet maiden  for truly said she so far from discretion being to be despised by queens daughters the higher the estate the greater the need thereof  this little breeze did not prevent cicely from setting off in high spirits as she rode near the queen who declared that she wanted to enjoy through the merry maiden and who was herself in a gay and joyous mood believing that the term of her captivity was in sight delighted with her daughter exhilarated by the fresh breezes and rapid motion and so mirthful that she could not help teasing and bantering the earl a little though all in the way of goodhumoured grace  the ride was long about eight miles but though the peak castle was a royal one the earl preferred not to enter it but according to previous arrangement caused the company to dismount in the valley or rather ravine which terminates in the cavern where a repast was spread on the grass  it was a wonderful place cool and refreshing for the huge rocks on either side cast a deep shadow seldom pierced by the rays of the sun  lofty solemn and rich in dark reds and purples rose the walls of rock here and there softened by tapestry of ivy or projecting bushes of sycamore mountain ash or with fruit already assuming its brilliant tints and jackdaws flying in and out of their holes above  deep beds of rich ferns clothed the lower slopes and sheets of that delicate flower the enchanters nightshade reared its white blossoms down to the bank of a little clear stream that came flowing from out of the mighty yawning arch of the cavern while above the precipice rose sheer the keep of peak castle  the banquet was gracefully arranged to suit the scene and comprised besides more solid viands large bowls of milk with strawberries or cranberries floating in them  mr eyre the keeper of the castle and his daughter did the honours while his son superintended the lighting and fumigation of the cavern assisted if not directed by dr jones whose short black cloak and goldheaded cane were to be seen almost everywhere at once  presently clouds of smoke began to issue from the vast archway that closed the ravine  beware my maidens said the queen merrily we have roused the dragon in his den and we shall see him come forth anon curling his tail and belching flame  with a marvellous stomach for a dainty maiden or two added gilbert curll falling into her humour  hark  good lack cried the queen with an affectation of terror as a most extraordinary noise proceeded from the bowels of the cavern making cis start and marie de courcelles give a genuine shriek  your majesty is pleased to be merry said the earl ponderously the sound is only the coughing of the torchbearers from the damp whereof i warned your majesty  by my faith said mary i believe my lord earl himself fears the monster of the cavern to whom he gives the name of damp  dread nothing my lord the valorous knight sir jones is even now in conflict with the foul worm as those cries assure me being in fact caused by his fumigations  the jest was duly received and in the midst of the laughter young eyre came forward bowing low and holding his jewelled hat in his hand while his eyes betrayed that he had recently been sneezing violently  so please your majesty he said the odour hath rolled away and all is ready if you will vouchsafe to accept my poor guidance  how say you my lord said mary  will you dare the lair of the conquered foe or fear you to be pinched with aches and pains by his lurking hobgoblins  if so we dispense with your attendance  your majesty knows that where she goes thither i am bound to attend her said the rueful earl  even into the abyss said mary  valiantly spoken for have not ariosto and his fellows sung of captive princesses for whom every cave held an enchanter who could spirit them away into vapour thin as air and leave their guardians questing in vain for them  your majesty jests with edged tools sighed the earl  old mr eyre was too feeble to act as exhibitor of the cave and his son was deputed to lead the queen forward  this was of course lord shrewsburys privilege but he was in truth beholden to her fingers for aid as she walked eagerly forward now and then accepting a little help from john eyre but in general surefooted and exploring eagerly by the light of the numerous torches held by yeomen in the eyre livery one of whom was stationed wherever there was a dangerous pass or a freak of nature worth studying  the magnificent vaulted roof grew lower and presently it became necessary to descend a staircase which led to a deep hollow chamber shaped like a bell and echoing like one  a pool of intensely black water filled it reflecting the lights on its surface that only enhanced its darkness while there moved on a mysterious flatbottomed boat breaking them into shimmering sparks and john eyre intimated that the visitors must lie down flat in it to be ferried one by one over a space of about fourteen yards  your majesty will surely not attempt it said the earl with a shudder  wherefore not  it is but a foretaste of charons boat said mary who was one of those people whose spirit of enterprise rises with the occasion and she murmured to mary seaton the line of dante            quando noi fermerem li nostri passi            su la triate riviera a acheronte   will your majesty enter asked john eyre  dr jones and some gentlemen wait on the other side to receive you  some gentlemen repeated mary  you are sure they are not minos and rhadamanthus sir  my obolus is ready shall i put it in my mouth  nay madam pardon me said the earl spurred by a miserable sense of his duties since you will thus venture far be it from me to let you pass over until i have reached the other aide to see that it is fit for your majesty  even as you will most devoted cavalier said mary drawing back we will be content to play the part of the pale ghosts of the unburied dead a little longer  see mary the boat sinks down with him and his mortal flesh  we shall have charon complaining of him anon  your highness gars my flesh grue was the answer of her faithful mary  ah ma mie we have not left all hope behind  we can afford to smile at the doleful knight ferried oer on his back in duteous and loyal submission to his task mistress  child cicely where art thou  art afraid to dare the black river  no madam not with you on the other side and my father to follow me  well said  let the maiden follow next after me  or mayhap master eyre should come next then the young lady  for you my ladies and you good sirs you are free to follow or not as the fancy strikes you  sohere is charon once moremust i lie down  ay madam said eyre if you would not strike your head against yonder projecting rock  mary lay down her cloak drawn about her and saying now then for acheron  ah would that it were lethe  her grace saith well muttered faithful jean kennedy unversed in classic lore would that we were once more at bonnie leith  soft there now tis you that follow her next my fair mistress  cicely not without trepidation obeyed laid herself flat and was soon midway feeling the passage so grim and awful that she could think of nothing but the dark passages of the grave and was shuddering all over when she was helped out on the other side by the queens own hand  some of those in the rear did not seem to be similarly affected or else braved their feelings of awe by shouts and songs which echoed fearfully through the subterranean vaults  indeed diccon following the example of one or two young pages and grooms of the earls began to get so daring and wild in the strange scene that his father became anxious and tarried for him on the other side in the dread of his wandering away and getting lost or falling into some of the fearful dark rivers that could be heardnot seenrushing along  by this means master richard was entirely separated from cicely to whom before crossing the water he had been watchfully attending but he knew her to be with the queen and her ladies and considered her natural timidity the best safeguard against the chief peril of the cave namely wandering away  cicely did however miss his care for the queen could not but be engrossed by her various cicerones and attendants and it was no ones especial business to look after the young girl over the rough descent to the dripping well called roger rains house and the grand cathedrallike gallery with splendid pillars of stalagmite and pendants above  by the time the steps beyond were reached a toilsome descent the queen had had enough of the expedition and declined to go any farther but she goodnaturedly yielded to the wish of master john eyre and dr jones that she would inscribe her name on the farthest column that she had reached  there was a little confusion while this was being done as some of the more enterprising wished to penetrate as far as possible into the recesses of the cave and these were allowed to pass forwarddiccon and his father among them  in the passing and repassing cicely entirely lost sight of all who had any special care of her and went stumbling on alone weary frightened and repenting of the wilfulness with which she had urged on the expedition  each of the other ladies had some cavalier to help her but none had fallen to cicelys lot and though to an active girl there was no real danger where the torchbearers lined the way still there was so much difficulty that she was a laggard in reaching the likeness of acheron and could see no father near as she laid herself down in charons dismal boat dimly rejoicing that this time it was to return to the realms of day and yet feeling as if she should never reach them  a hand was given to assist her from the boat by one of the torchbearers a voice strangely familiar was in her ears saying mistress cicely and she knew the eager eyes and exclaimed under her breath antony you here  in hiding  what have you done  nothing he answered smiling and holding her hand as he helped her forward  i only put on this garb that i might gaze once more on the most divine and persecuted of queens and with some hope likewise that i might win a word with her who deigned once to be my playmate lady i know the truth respecting you  do you in very deed demanded cicely considerably startled  i know your true name and that you are none of the mastiff race said antony  diddid tibbott tell you sir asked cicely  you are one of us said antony bound by natural allegiance in the land of your birth to this lady  even so said cis here becoming secure of what she had before doubted that babington only knew half the truth he referred to  and you see and speak with her privily he added  as bess pierrepoint did said she  these words passed during the ascent and were much interrupted by the difficulties of the way in which antony rendered such aid that she was each moment more impelled to trust to him and relieved to find herself in such familiar hands  on reaching the summit the light of day could be seen glimmering in the extreme distance and the maidens heart bounded at the sight of it but she found herself led somewhat aside where in a sort of side aisle of the great bell chamber were standing together four more of the torchbearers  one of them a slight man made a step forward and said the queen hath dropped her kerchief  mayhap the young gentlewoman will restore it  she will do more than that said antony drawing her into the midst of them  dost not know her langston  she is her sacred majestys own born true and faithful subject the lady  hush my friend thou art ever over outspoken with thy names returned the other evidently annoyed at babingtons imprudence  i tell thee she is one of us replied antony impatiently  how is the queen to know of her friends if we name them not to her  are these her friends asked cicely looking round on the five figures in the leathern coats and yeomens heavy buskins and shoes and especially at the narrow face and keen pale eyes of langston  ay verily said one whom cicely could see even under his disguise to be a slender graceful youth  by john eyres favour have we come together here to gaze on the true and lawful mistress of our hearts the champion of our faith in her martyrdom  then taking the kerchief from langstons hand babington kissed it reverently and tore it into five pieces which he divided among himself and his fellows saying this fair mistress shall bear witness to her sacred majesty that weantony babington chidiock tichborne cuthbert langston john charnock john savageregard her as the sole and lawful queen of england and scotland and that as we have gone for her sake into the likeness of the valley of the shadow of death so will we meet death itself and stain this linen with our best hearts blood rather than not bring her again to freedom and the throne  then with the most solemn oath each enthusiastically kissed the white token and put it in his breast but langston looked with some alarm at the girl and said to babington doth this young lady understand that you have put our lives into her hands  she knows she knows  i answer for her with my life said antony  let her then swear to utter no word of what she has seen save to the queen said langston and cicely detected a glitter in that pale eye and with a horrified leap of thought recollected how easy it would be to drag her away into one of those black pools beyond all ken  oh save me antony she cried clinging to his arm  no one shall touch you  i will guard you with my life exclaimed the impulsive young man feeling for the sword that was not there  who spoke of hurting the foolish wench growled savage but tichborne said no one would hurt you madam but it is due to us all that you should give us your word of honour not to disclose what has passed save to our only true mistress  oh yes yes cried cicely hastily scarcely knowing what passed her lips and only anxious to escape from that gleaming eye of langston which had twice before filled her with a nameless sense of the necessity of terrified obedience  oh let me go  i hear my fathers voice  she sprang forward with a cry between joy and terror and darted up to richard talbot while savage the man who looked most entirely unlike a disguised gentleman stepped forward and in a rough north country dialect averred that the young gentlewoman had lost her way  poor maid said kind richard gathering the two trembling little hands into one of his own broad ones  how was it  thanks good fellow and he dropped a broad piece into savages palm thou hast done good service  what cis child art quaking  hast seen any hobgoblins cis said diccon at her other side im sure i heard them laugh  whist dick said his father putting a strong arm round the girls waist  see my wench yonder is the goodly light of day  we shall soon be there  with all his fatherly kindness he helped the agitated girl up the remaining ascent as the lovely piece of blue sky between the retreating rocks grew wider and the archway higher above them  cis felt that infinite repose and reliance that none else could give yet the repose was disturbed by the pang of recollection that the secret laid on her was their first severance  it was unjust to his kindness strange doubtful nay grisly to her foreboding mind and she shivered alike from that and the chill of the damp cavern and then he drew her cloak more closely about her and halted to ask for the flask of wine which one of the adventurous spirits had brought that queen elizabeths health might be drunk by her true subjects in the bowels of the earth  the wine was of course exhausted but dr jones bustled forward with some cordial waters which he had provided in case of anyone being struck with the chill of the cave and cicely was made to swallow some  by this time she had been missed and the little party were met by some servants sent by the earl at the instance of the muchalarmed queen to inquire for her  a little farther on came mistress talbot in much anxiety and distress though as diccon ran forward to meet her and she saw cicely on her husbands arm she resumed her calm and staid demeanour and when assured that the maiden had suffered no damage she made no special demonstrations of joy or affection indeed such would have been deemed unbecoming in the presence of strangers and disrespectful to the queen and the earl who were not far off  mary on the other hand started up held out her arms received the truant with such vehement kisses as might almost have betrayed their real relationship and then reproached her with all sorts of endearing terms for having so terrified them all nor would she let the girl go from her side and kept her hand in her own diccon meanwhile had succeeded in securing his fathers attention which had been wholly given to cicely till she was placed in the womens hands father he said i wish that one of the knaves with the torches who found our cis was the woman with the beads and bracelets ay and tibbott too  belike belike my son said richard  there are folk who can take as many forms as a barnacle goose  keep thou a sharp eye as the fellows pass out and pull me by the cloak if thou seest him  of course he was not seen and richard who was growing more and more cautious about bringing vague or halfproved suspicions before his lord decided to be silent and to watch though he sighed to his wife that the poor child would soon be in the web  cis had not failed to recognise that same identity and to feel a halfrealised conviction that the queen had not chosen to confide to her that the two female disguises both belonged to langston  yet the contrast between marys endearments and the restrained manner of susan so impelled her towards the veritable mother that the compunction as to the concealment she had at first experienced passed away and her heart felt that its obligations were towards her veritable and most loving parent  she told the queen the whole story at night to marys great delight  she said she was sure her little one had something on her mind she had so little to say of her adventure and the next day a little privy council was contrived in which cicely was summoned again to tell her tale  the ladies declared they had always hoped much from their darling page in whom they had kept up the true faith but sir andrew melville shook his head and said id misdoot ony plot where the little finger of him was  what garred the silly loon call in the young leddy ere he kenned whether she wad keep counsel     chapter xvii  the ebbing well   cicelys thirst for adventures had received a check but the queen being particularly well and in good spirits and trusting that this would be her last visit to buxton was inclined to enterprise and there were long rides and hawking expeditions on the moors  the last of these ere leaving buxton brought the party to the hamlet of barton clough where a loose horseshoe of the earls caused a halt at a little wayside smithy  mary always friendly and freespoken asked for a draught of water and entered into conversation with the smiths rosycheeked wife who brought it to her and said it was sure to be good and pure for the stream came from the ebbing and flowing well and she pointed up a steep path  then on a further question she proceeded has her ladyship never heard of the ebbing well that shows whether true love is soothfast  how so asked the queen  how precious such a test might be  it would save many a maiden a broken heart only that the poor fools would neer trust it  i have heard of it said the earl and dr jones would demonstrate to your grace that it is but a superstition of the vulgar regarding a natural phenomenon  yea my lord said the smith looking up from the horses foot tis the trade of yonder philosophers to gainsay whatever honest folk believed before them  theyll deny next that hens lay eggs or blight rots wheat  my good wife speaks but plain truth and we have seen it oer and oer again  what have you seen good man asked mary eagerly and ready answer was made by the couple who had acquired some cultivation of speech and manners by their wayside occupation and likewise as cicerones to the spring  seen quoth the lady said the smith  why he that is a true man and hath a true maid can quaff a draught as deep as his gullet can holdor she that is true and hath a true lovebut let one who hath a flaw in the metal on the one side or tother stoop to drink and the water shrinks away so as theres not the moistening of a lip  ay the ladies may laugh added his wife but tis soothfast for all that  hast proved it good dame asked the queen archly for the pair were still young and welllooking enough to be jested with  ay have we not madam said the dame  was not my man yonder rob the tinkers son whom my father and brethren the smiths down yonder at buxton thought but scorn of but wed taken a sup together at the ebbing well and it played neither of us false so we held out against em all and when they saw there was no help for it they gave bob the second best anvil and bellows for my portion and here we be  living witnesses to the well said the queen merrily  how say you my lord  i would fain see this marvel  master curll will you try the venture  i fear it not madam said the secretary looking at the blushing barbara  objections did not fail to arise from the earl as to the difficulties of the path and the lateness of the hour but bob smith perhaps wilfully discovered another of my lords horseshoes to be in a perilous state and his good wife dame emmott offered to conduct the ladies by so good a path that they might think themselves on the queens walk at buxton itself  lord shrewsbury finding himself a prisoner was obliged to yield compliance and leaving sir andrew melville with the grooms and falconers in charge of the horses the queen the earl cicely mary seaton barbara mowbray the two secretaries and richard talbot and young diccon started on the walk together with dr bourgoin her physician who was eager to investigate the curiosity and make it a subject of debate with dr jones  the path was a beautiful one through rocks and brushwood mountain ash bushes showing their coral berries amid their feathery leaves golden and white stars of stonecrop studding every coign of vantage and in more level spots the waxy bellheather beginning to come into blossom still it was rather over praise to call it as smooth as the carefullylevelled and muchtrodden queens path at buxton considering that it ascended steeply all the way and made the solemn muchenduring earl pant for breath but the queen her rheumatics for the time entirely in abeyance bounded on with the mountain step learned in early childhood and closely followed the brisk emmott  the last ascent was a steep pull taking away the disposition to speak and at its summit mary stood still holding out one hand with a finger of the other on her lips as a sign of silence to the rest of the suite and to emmott who stood flushed and angered for what she esteemed her lawful province seemed to have been invaded from the other side of the country  they were on the side of the descent from the moorlands connected with the peak on a small esplanade in the midst of which lay a deep clear pool with nine small springs or fountains discharging themselves under fern and wild rose or honeysuckle into its basin steps bad been cut in the rock leading to the verge of the pool and on the lowest of these with his back to the newcomers was kneeling a young man his brown head bare his short cloak laid aside so that his wellknit form could be seen the sword and spurs that clanked against the rock as well as the whole fashion and texture of his ridingdress showing him to be a gentleman  we shall see the venture made whispered mary to her daughter who in virtue of youth and lightness of foot had kept close behind her grasping the girls arm and smiling she heard the young mans voice cry aloud to the echoes of the rock cis then stoop forward and plunge face and head into the clear translucent water  good luck to a true lover smiled the queen  what starting silly maid  cisses are plenty in these parts as rowan berries  nay but gasped cicely for at that moment the young man rising from his knees his face still shining with the water looked up at his unsuspected spectators  an expression of astonishment and ecstasy lighted up his honest sunburnt countenance as master richard who had just succeeded in dragging the portly earl up the steep path met his gaze  he threw up his arms made apparently but one bound and was kneeling at the captains feet embracing his knees  my son  humfrey  thyself cried richard  see see what presence we are in  your blessing father first cried humfrey ere i can see aught else  and as richard quickly and thankfully laid his hand on the brow so much fairer than the face and then held his son for one moment in a close embrace with an exchange of the kiss that was not then only a foreign fashion  queen and earl said to one another with a sigh that happy was the household where the son had no eyes for any save his father  mary however must have found it hard to continue her smiles when after due but hurried obeisance to her and to his feudal chief humfrey turned to the little figure beside her all smiling with startled shyness and in one moment seemed to swallow it up in a huge overpowering embrace fraternal in the eyes of almost all the spectators but not by any means so to those of mary especially after the name she had heard  diccons greeting was the next and was not quite so visibly rapturous on the part of the elder brother who explained that he had arrived at sheffield yesterday and finding no one to welcome him but little edward had set forth for buxton almost with daylight and having found himself obliged to rest his horse he had turned aside to  and here he recollected just in time that cis was in every ones eyes save his fathers his own sister and lamely concluded to take a draught of water blushing under his brown skin as he spoke  poor fellow the queen even while she wished him in the farthest west indian isle could not help understanding that strange doubt and dread that come over the mind at the last moment before a longedfor meeting and which had made even the bold young sailor glad to rally his hopes by this divination fortunately she thought only herself and one or two of the foremost had heard the name he gave as was proved by the earls goodhumoured laugh as he said  a draught quotha  we understand that young sir  and who may this your true love be  that i hope soon to make known to your lordship returned humfrey with a readiness which he certainly did not possess before his voyage  the ceremony was still to be fulfilled and the smiths wife called them to order by saying good luck to the young gentleman  he is a stranger here or he would have known he should have come up by our path  will you try the well your grace  nay nay good woman my time for such toys is over said the queen smiling but moved by such an example here are others to make the venture master curll is burning for it i see  i fear no such trial ant please your grace said curll bowing with a bright defiance of the water and exchanging a confident smile with the blushing mistress barbarathen kneeling by the well and uttering her name aloud ere stooping to drink  he too succeeded in obtaining a full draught and came up triumphantly  the water is a flatterer said the earl  it favours all  the french secretary monsieur nau here came forward and took his place on the steps  no one heard but every one knew the word he spoke was bessie for elizabeth pierrepoint had long been the object of his affections  no doubt he hoped that he should obtain some encouragement from the water even while he gave a little laugh of affected incredulity as though only complying with a form to amuse the queen down he went on his knees bending over the pool when behold he could not reach it  the streams that fed it were no longer issuing from the rock the water was subsiding rapidly  the farther he stooped the more it retreated till he had almost fallen over and the guide screamed out a note of warning have a care sir  if the water flees you flee it will and yell not mend matters by drowning yourself  how he was to be drowned by water that fled from him was not clear but with a muttered malediction he arose and glanced round as if he thought the mortification a trick on the part of the higher powers since the earl did not think him a match for the countesss grandchild and the queen had made it known to him that she considered bess pierrepoint to have too much of her grandmothers conditions to be likely to be a good wife  there was a laugh too scarce controlled by some of the less wellmannered of the suite especially as the earl wishing to punish his presumption loudly set the example  there was a pause as the discomfited secretary came back and the guide exclaimed come my masters be not daunted  will none of you come on  hath none of you faith in your love  oh fie  we are married men good women said richard hoping to put an end to the scene and thus can laugh at your well  but will not these pretty ladies try it  it speaks as sooth to lass as to lad  i am ready said barbara mowbray as curll gave her his hand to bound lightly down the steps  and to the general amazement no sooner had gilbert echoed from her lips than the fountains again burst forth the water rose and she had no difficulty in reaching it while no one could help bursting forth in applause  her gilbert fervently kissed the hand she gave him to aid her steps up the slope and dame emmott in triumphant congratulation scanned them over and exclaimed ay trust the well for knowing true sweetheart and true maid  come you next fair mistress  poor mary seaton shook her head with a look that the kindly woman understood and she turned towards cicely who had a girls unthinking impulse of curiosity and had already put her hand into humfreys when his father exclaimed nay nay the maid is yet too young and the queen added come back thou silly little one these tests be not for babes like thee  she was forced to be obedient but she pouted a little as she was absolutely held fast by richard talbots strong hand  humfrey was disappointed too but all was bright with him just then and as the party turned to make the descent he said to her it matters not little cis  im sure of thee with the water or without and after all thou couldst but have whispered my name till my father lets us speak all out  they were too much hemmed in by other people for a private word and a little mischievous banter was going on with sir andrew melville who was supposed to have a grave elderly courtship with mistress kennedy humfrey was left in the absolute bliss of ignorance while the old habit and instinct of joy and gladness in his presence reasserted itself in cis so that as he handed her down the rocks she answered in the old tone all his inquiries about his mother and all else that concerned them at home diccon meantime risking his limbs by scrambling outside the path to keep abreast of his brother and to put in his word whenever he could  on reaching the smithy humfrey had to go round another way to fetch his horse and could hardly hope to come up with the rest before they reached buxton  his brother was spared to go with him but his father was too important a part of the escort to be spared  so cicely rode near the queen and heard no more except the earls version of dr joness explanation of the intermitting spring  they reached home only just in time to prepare for supper and the two youths appeared almost simultaneously so that mistress talbot sitting at her needle on the broad terrace in front of the earls lodge beheld to her amazement and delight the figure that grown and altered as it was she recognised in an instant  in another second humfrey had sprung from his horse rushed up the steps he knew not how and the queen with tears trembling in her eyes was saying ah melville see how sons meet their mothers  the great clock was striking seven a preposterously late hour for supper and etiquette was stronger than sentiment or perplexity every one hastened to assume an evening toilette for a ridingdress would have been an insult to the earl and the bell soon clanged to call them down to their places in the hall  even humfrey had brought in his cloakbag wherewithal to make himself presentable and soon appeared a wellknit and active figure in a plain dark blue jerkin with white slashes and long hose knitted by his mothers dainty fingers and wellpreserved shoes with blue rosettes and a flat blue velvet cap with an exquisite black and sapphire feather in it fastened by a curious brooch  his hair was so short that its naturally strong curl could hardly be seen his ruddy sunburnt face could hardly be called handsome but it was full of frankness and intelligence and beaming with honest joy and close to him moved little diccon hardly able to repress his ecstasy within company bounds and letting it find vent in odd little gestures wriggling with his body playing tunes on his knee or making dancingsteps with his feet  lord shrewsbury welcomed his young kinsman as one who had grown from a mere boy into a sturdy and effective supporter  he made the newcomer sit near him and asked many questions so that humfrey was the chief speaker all supper time with here and there a note from his father the only person who had made the same voyage  all heard with eager interest of the voyage the weeds in the gulf stream the strange birds and fishes of walter raleighs virginian colony and its ill success of the halfstarved men whom sir richard grenville had found only too ready to leave roanoake of darkskinned indians of chases of spanish ships of the peak of teneriffe rising white from the waves of phosphorescent seas of storms and of sharkcatching  supper over the audience again gathered round the young traveller a perfect fountain of various and wonderful information to those who had for the most part never seen a book of travels  he narrated simply and well without his boyish shy embarrassment and awkwardness and likewise as his father alone could judge without boasting though if to no one else to diccon and cis listening with wide open eyes he seemed a hero of heroes  in the midst of his narration a message came that the queen of scots requested the presence of mistress cicely humfrey stared in discomfiture and asked when she would return  not tonight faltered the girl and the mother added for the benefit of the bystanders for lack of other ladies of the household much service hath of late fallen to cicely and myself and she shares the queens chamber  humfrey had to submit to exchange goodnights with cicely and she made her way less willingly than usual to the apartments of the queen who was being made ready for her bed  here comes our truant she exclaimed as the maiden entered  i sent to rescue thee from the western seafarer who had clawed thee in his tarry clutch thou didst act the sisters part passing well  i hear my lord and all his meine have been sitting openmouthed hearkening to his tales of savages and cannibals  o madam he told us of such lovely isles said cis  the sea he said is blue bluer than we can conceive with white waves of dazzling surf breaking on islands fringed with white shells and coral and with palms their tops like the biggest ferns in the brake and laden with red golden fruit as big as goose eggs  and the birds  o madam my mother the birds  they are small small as our butterflies and beetles and they hang hovering and quivering over a flower so that humfrey thought they were moths for he saw nothing but a whizzing and a whirring till he smote the pretty thing dead and then he said that i should have wept for pity for it was a little bird with a long bill and a breast that shines red in one light purple in another and flamecoloured in a third  he has brought home the little skin and feathers of it for me  thou hast supped full of travellers tales my simple child  yea madam but my lord listened and made humfrey sit beside him and made much of himmy lord himself  i would fain bring him to you madam  it is so wondrous to hear him tell of the red men with crowns of feathers and belts of beads  such gentle savages they be and their chiefs as courteous and stately as any of our princes and yet those cruel spaniards make them slaves and force them to dig in mines so that they die and perish under their hands  and better so than that they should not come to the knowledge of the faith said mary  i forgot that your grace loves the spaniards said cis much in the tone in which she might have spoken of a taste in her grace for spiders adders or any other noxious animal  one day my child will grow out of her little heretic prejudices and learn to love her mothers staunch friends the champions of holy church and the representatives of true knighthood in these degenerate days  ah child couldst thou but see a true spanish caballero or again could i but show thee my noble cousin of guise then wouldst thou know how to rate these gross clownish english mastiffs who now turn thy silly little brain  ah that thou couldst once meet a true prince  the well murmured cicely  tush child said the queen amused  what of that  thy name is not cis is it  tis only the slough that serves thee for the nonce the good youth will find himself linked to some homely housewifely cis in due time when the princess bride is queening it in france or austria and will own that the well was wiser than he  poor cis  if her inmost heart declared humfrey talbot to be prince enough for her she durst not entertain the sentiment not knowing whether it were unworthy and while marie de courcelles read aloud a french legend of a saint to soothe the queen to sleep she lay longing after the more sympathetic mother and wondering what was passing in the hall  richard talbot had communed with his wifes eyes and made up his mind that humfrey should know the full truth before the queen should enjoin his being put off with the story of the parentage she had invented for bride hepburn and while some of the gentlemen followed their habit of sitting late over the wine cup he craved their leave to have his son to himself a little while and took him out in the summer twilight on the greensward going through the guards for whom he as the gentleman warder had the password of the night  in compliment to the expedition of the day it had been made true love and the flowing well  it sounded agreeable in humfreys ears he repeated it again and then added little cis she hath come to womans estate and she hath caught some of the captive ladys pretty tricks of the head and hands  how long hath she been so thick with her  since this journey  i have to speak with thee my son  i wait your pleasure sir said humfrey and as his father paused a moment ere communicating his strange tidings he rendered the matter less easy by saying i guess your purpose  if i may at once wed my little cis i will send word to sir john norreys that i am not for this expedition to the low countries though there is good and manly work to be done there and i have the offer of a command but i gave not my word till i knew your will and whether we might wed at once  thou hast much to hear my son  nay surely no one has come between exclaimed humfrey  methought she was less frank and more coy than of old  if that sneaking traitor babington hath been making up to her i will slit his false gullet for him  hush hush humfrey thy seafaring boasts skill not here  no man hath come between thee and yonder poor maid  poor  you mean not that she is sickly  were she so i would so tend her that she should be well for mere tenderness  but no she was the very image of health   no man said you father  then it is a woman ah my lady countess is it bent on making her match her own way  sir you are too good and upright to let a tyrannous dame like that sever between us though she be near of kin to us  my mother might scruple to cross her but you have seen the world sir  my lad you are right in that it is a woman who stands between you and cis but it is not the countess  none would have the right to do so save the maidens own mother  her mother  you have discovered her lineage  can she have ought against mei your son sir of the talbot blood and not ill endowed  alack son the talbot may be a good dog but the lioness will scarce esteem him her mate  riddles apart it is proved beyond question that our little maid is of birth as high as it is unhappy  thou canst be secret i know humfrey and thou must be silent as the grave for it touches my honour and the poor childs liberty  who is she then demanded humfrey sharply  his father pointed to the queens window  humfrey stared at him and muttered an ejaculation then exclaimed how and when was this known  richard went over the facts giving as few names as possible while his son stood looking down and drawing lines with the point of his sword  i hoped ended the father that these five years absence might have made thee forget thy childish inclination and as humfrey without raising his face emphatically shook his head he went on to add so my dear son meseemeth that there is no remedy but that for her peace and thine own thou shouldest accept this offer of brave norreys and by the time the campaign is ended they may be both safe in scotland out of reach of vexing thy heart my poor boy  is it so sure that her royal lineage will be owned muttered humfrey out on me for saying so  but sure this lady hath made light enough of her wedlock with yonder villain  even so but that was when she deemed its offspring safe beneath the waves  i fear me that however our poor damsel be regarded she will be treated as a mere bait and tool  if not bestowed on some foreign prince and there hath been talk of dukes and archdukes she may serve to tickle the pride of some scottish thief such as was her father  sir sir how can you speak patiently of such profanation and cruelty papist butchers and scottish thieves for the child of your hearth were it not better that i stole her safely away and wedded her in secret so that at least she might have an honest husband  nay his honesty would scarce be thus manifest said richard even if the maid would consent which i think she would not  her head is too full of her new greatness to have room for thee my poor lad best that thou shouldest face the truth  and verily what is it but her duty to obey her mother her true and veritable mother humfrey it is but making her ease harder and adding to her griefs to strive to awaken any inclination she may have had for thee and therefore it is that i counsel thee nay i might command thee to absent thyself while it is still needful that she remain with us passing for our daughter  humfrey still traced lines with his sword in the dust  he had always been a strongwilled though an obedient and honourable boy and his father felt that these five years had made a man of him whom in spite of mediaeval obedience it was not easy to dispose of arbitrarily  theres no haste he muttered  norreys will not go till my lord of leicesters commission be made out  it is five years since i was at home  my son thou knowest that i would not send thee from me willingly i had not done so ere now but that it was well for thee to know the world and men and sheffield is a mere nest of intrigue and falsehood where even if one keeps ones integrity it is hard to be believed but for my lord thy mother and my poor folk i would gladly go with thee to strike honest downright blows at a foe i could see and feel rather than be nothing better than a warder and be driven distracted with womens tongues  why they have even set division between my lord and his son gilbert who was ever the dearest to him  young as he is methinks diccon would be better away with thee than where the very air smells of plots and lies  i trow the queen of scots will not be here much longer said humfrey men say in london that sir ralf sadler is even now setting forth to take charge of her and send my lord to london  we have had such hopes too often my son said richard  nay she hath left us more than once but always to fall back upon sheffield like a weight to the ground  but she is full of hope in her son now that he is come of age and hath put to death her great foe the earl of morton  the poor lady might as well put her faith inin a jellyfish said humfrey falling on a comparison perfectly appreciated by the old sailor  heh  she will get naught but stings  how knowest thou  why do none know here that king james is in the hands of him they call the master of gray  queen mary puts in him her chief hope  then she hath indeed grasped a jellyfish  know you not father those proud and gay ones with rosecoloured bladders and long blue beardsblue as the azure of a heralds coat  ay marry i do  i remember when i was a lad in my first voyage laying hold on one  i warrant you i danced about till i was nearly overboard and my arm was as big as two for three days later  is the fellow of that sort  the false scot  look you father i met in london that same johnstone who was one of this ladys gentlemen at one time  you remember him  he breakfasted at bridgefield once or twice ere the watch became more strict  yea i remember him  he was an honest fellow for a scot  when he made out that i was the little lad he remembered he was very courteous and desired his commendations to you and to my mother  he had been in scotland and had come south in the train of this rogue gray  i took him to see the old pelican and we had a breakfast aboard there  he asked much after his poor queen whom he loves as much as ever and when he saw i was a man he could trust your true son he said that he saw less hope for her than ever in scotlandher friends have been slain or exiled and the young generation that has grown up have learned to dread her like an incarnation of the scarlet one of babylon  their preachers would hail her as satan loosed on them and the nobles dread nothing so much as being made to disgorge the lands of the crown and the church on which they are battening  as to her son he was fain enough to break forth from one set of tutors and the messages of france and spain tickled his fancybut he is nought  he is crammed with scholarship and not without a shrewd apprehension but with respect be it spoken more the stuff that court fools are made of than kings it may be as a learned man told johnstone that the shock the queen suffered when the brutes put davy to death before her eyes three months ere his birth hath damaged his constitution for he is at the mercy of whosoever chooses to lead him and hath no will of his own this master of gray was at first inclined to the queens party thinking more might be got by a reversal of all things but now he finds the kings men so strong in the saddle and the queens french kindred like to be too busy at home to aid her what doth he do but list to our queens offers and this ambassage of his which hath a colour of being for queen marys release is verily to make terms with my lord treasurer and sir francis walsingham for the pension he is to have for keeping his king in the same mind  turning a son against a mother  i marvel that honourable counsellors can bring themselves to the like  policy sir policy said humfrey  and this gray maketh a fine show of chivalry and honour insomuch that sir philip sidney himself hath desired his friendship but you see the poor lady is as far from freedom as she was when first she came to sheffield  she is very far from believing it poor dame  i am sorry for her humfrey more sorry than i ever thought i could be now i have seen more of her  my lord himself says he never knew her break a promise how gracious she is there is no telling  that we always knew said humfrey looking somewhat amazed that his honoured father should have fallen under the spell of the siren between the cold earth and moon  yes gracious and of a wondrous constancy of mind and evenness of temper said richard  now that thy mother and i have watched her more closely we can testify that weary worn and sick of body and of heart as she is she never letteth a bitter or a chiding word pass her lips towards her servants  she hath nothing to lose by it their fidelity is proven  they would stand by her to the last use them as she would but assuredly their love must be doubly bound up in her when they see how she regardeth them before herself  let what will be said of her son humfrey i shall always maintain that i never saw woman save thine own good mother of such evenness of condition and sweetness of consideration for all about her ay and patience in adversity such as heaven forbid thy mother should ever know  amen and verily amen said humfrey  deem you then that she hath not worked her own woe  nay lad what saith the scripture judge not and ye shall not be judged  how should i know what hath passed seventeen years back in scotland  ay but for present plots and intrigues judge you her a true woman  humfrey thou hadst once a fox in a cage  when it found it vain to dash against the bars rememberest thou how it scratched away the earth in the rear and then sat over the hole it had made lest we should see it  the fox say you sir  then you cannot call her ought but false  they tell me said sir richard that ever since an italian named machiavel wrote his book of the prince statecraft hath been craft indeed and princes suck in deceit with the very air they breathe ay boy it is what chiefly vexes me in the whole  i cannot doubt that she is never so happy as when there is a plot or scheme toward not merely for her own freedom but the utter overthrow of our own gracious sovereign who if she hath kept this lady in durance hath shielded her from her own bloodthirsty subjects  and for dissembling i never saw her equal  yet she as thy mother tells me is a pious and devout woman who bears her troubles thus cheerfully and patiently because she deems them a martyrdom for her religion ay all women are riddles they say but this one the most of all  thinkest thou that she hath tampered withwith that poor maidens faith asked humfrey huskily  i trow not yet my son replied richard  cis is as open as ever to thy mother for i cannot believe she hath yet learnt to dissemble and i greatly suspect that the queen hoping to return to scotland may be willing to keep her a protestant the better to win favour with her brother and the lords of his council but if he be such a cur as thou sayest all hope of honourable release is at an end  so thou seest humfrey how it lies and how in my judgment to remain here is but to wring thine own heart and bring the wench and thyself to sore straits i lay not my commands on thee a man grown but such is my opinion on the matter  i will not disobey you father said humfrey but suffer me to consider the matter     chapter xviii  cis or sister     buxtona quae calidae celebraris nomine lymphae   forte mihi post hac non adeunda vale    buxton of whose warm waters men tell   perchance i neer shall see thee more farewell   thus wrote queen mary with a diamond upon her window pane smiling as she said there we will leave a memento over which the admirable dr jones will gloat his philosophical soul  never may i see thee more buxton yet never thought i to be so happy as i have here been  she spoke with the tenderness of farewell to the spot which had always been the pleasantest abode of the various places of durance which had been hers in england  each year she had hoped would be her last of such visits but on this occasion everything seemed to point to a close to the present state of things since not only were the negotiations with scotland apparently prosperous but lord shrewsbury had obtained an absolute promise from elizabeth that she would at all events relieve him from his onerous and expensive charge  thus there was general cheerfulness as the baggage was bestowed in carts and on beasts of burthen and mary as she stood finishing her inscription on the window smiled sweetly and graciously on mistress talbot and gave her joy of the arrival of her towardly and hopeful son adding we surprised him at the well  may his cis who is yet to be found i trow reward his lealty  that was all the notice mary deigned to take of the former relations between her daughter and young talbot  she did not choose again to beg for secrecy when she was sure to hear that she had been forestalled and she was too consummate a judge of character not to have learnt that though she might despise the dogged simple straightforwardness of richard and susan talbot their honour was perfectly trustworthy she was able for the present to keep her daughter almost entirely to herself since on the return to sheffield the former state of things was resumed  the bridgefield family was still quartered in the manorhouse and mistress talbot continued to be as it were lady warder to the captive in the place of the countess who obstinately refused to return while mary was still in her husbands keeping cicely as marys acknowledged favourite was almost always in her apartments except at the meals of the whole company of shrewsbury kinsfolk and retainers when her place was always far removed from that of humfrey  in truth if ever an effort might have obtained a few seconds of private conversation a strong sense of embarrassment and perplexity made the two young people fly apart rather than come together  they knew not what they wished  humfrey might in his secret soul long for a token that cis remembered his faithful affection and yet he knew that to elicit one might do her lifelong injury  so however he might crave for word or look when out of sight of her an honourable reluctance always withheld him from seeking any such sign in the short intervals when he could have tried to go beneath the surface on the other hand this apparent indifference piqued her pride and made her stiff cold and almost disdainful whenever there was any approach between them  her vanity might be flattered by the knowledge that she was beyond his reach but it would have been still more gratified could she have discovered any symptoms of pining and languishing after her she might peep at him from under her eyelashes in chapel and in hall but in the former place his gaze always seemed to be on the minister in the latter he showed no signs of flagging as a trencher companion both mothers thought her marvellously discreet but neither beheld the strange tumult in her heart where were surging pride vanity ambition and wounded affection  in a few days sir ralf sadler and his soninlaw mr somer arrived at sheffield in order to take the charge of the prisoner whilst shrewsbury went to london  the conferences and consultations were endless and harassing and it was finally decided that the earl should escort her to wingfield and leaving her there under charge of sadler should proceed to london  she made formal application for mistress cicely talbot to accompany her as one of her suite and her supposed parents could not but give their consent but six gentlewomen had been already enumerated and the authorities would not consent to her taking any more ladies with her and decreed that mistress cicely must remain at home  this unkindness has made the parting from this place less joyous than i looked for said mary but courage ma mignonne  soon shall i send for thee to scotland and there shalt thou burst thine husk and show thyself in thy true colours and turning to susan madam i must commit my treasure to her who has so long watched over her  your grace knows that she is no less my treasure said susan  i should have known it well returned the queen from the innocence and guilelessness of the damsel  none save such a mother as mistress talbot could have made her what she is  credit me madam i have looked well into her heart and found nought to undo there  you have bred her up better than her poor mother could have done and i gladly entrust her once more to your care assured that your welltried honour will keep her in mind of what she is and to what she may be called  she shall remember it madam said susan  when i am a queen once more said mary all i can give will seem too poor a meed for what you have been to my child  even as queen of scotland or england itself my power would be small in comparison with my will  my gratitude however no bounds can limit out to me  and with tears of tenderness and thankfulness she kissed the cheeks and lips of good mistress talbot who could not but likewise weep for the mother thus compelled to part with her child  the night was partly spent in caresses and promises of the brilliant reception preparing in scotland with auguries of the splendid marriage in store with a prince of lorraine or even with an archduke  cis was still young enough to dream of such a lot as an opening to a fairy land of princely glories  if her mother knew better she still looked tenderly back on her beau pays de france with that halo of brightness which is formed only in childhood and youth  moreover it might be desirable to enhance such aspiration as might best secure the young princess from anything derogatory to her real rank while she was strongly warned against betraying it and especially against any assumption of dignity should she ever hear of her mothers release reception and recognition in scotland  for whatever might be the maternal longings it would be needful to feel the way and prepare the ground for the acknowledgment of bothwells daughter in scotland while the knowledge of her existence in england would almost surely lead to her being detained as a hostage  she likewise warned the maiden never to regard any letter or billet from her as fully read till it had been heldwithout witnessesto the fire  of humfrey talbot queen mary scorned to say anything or to utter a syllable that she thought a daughter of scotland needed a warning against a petty english sailor  indeed she had confidence that the youths parents would view the attachment as quite as undesirable for him as for the young princess and would guard against it for his sake as much as for hers  the true parting took place ere the household was astir  afterwards mary fully equipped for travelling in a dark cloth ridingdress and hood came across to the great hall of the manorhouse and there sat while each one of the attendants filed in procession as it were before her  to each lady she presented some small token wrought by her own hands  to each gentleman she also gave some trinket such as the elaborate dress of the time permitted and to each serving man or maid a piece of money  of each one she gravely but gently besought pardon for all the displeasures or offences she might have caused them and as they replied kissing her hand many of them with tears she returned a kiss on the brow to each woman and an entreaty to be remembered in their prayers and a like request with a pressure of the hand to each man or boy  it must have been a tedious ceremony and yet to every one it seemed as if mary put her whole heart into it and to any to whom she owed special thanks they were freely paid  the whole was only over by an hour before noon  then she partook of a manchet and a cup of wine drinking with liquid eyes to the health and prosperity of her good host and to the restoration of his family peace which she had so sorely though unwittingly disturbed  then she let him hand her out once more kissing susan talbot and cis who was weeping bitterly and whispering to the latter not over much grief ma petite not more than may befit ma mignonne  lord shrewsbury lifted her on her horse and with him on one side and sir ralf sadler on the other she rode down the long avenue on her way to wingfield  the bridgefield family had already made their arrangements and their horses were waiting for them amid the jubilations of diccon and ned the queen had given each of them a fair jewel with special thanks to them for being good brothers to her dear cis  as if one wanted thanks for being good to ones own sister said ned thrusting the delicate little ruby brooch on his mother to be taken care of till his days of foppery should set in and he would need it for cap and plume  come cis we are going home at last said diccon  what thou art not breaking thine heart over yonder scottish ladywhen we are going home home i say and have got rid of watch and ward for ever hurrah and he threw up his cap and was joined in the shout by more than one of the youngsters around for richard and most of the elders were escorting the queen out of the park and mistress susan had been summoned on some question of household stuff  cis however stood leaning against the balustrade over which she had leant for the last glance exchanged with her mother her face hidden in her hands and kerchief weeping bitterly feeling as if all the glory and excitement of the last few weeks had vanished as a dream and left her to the dreary dulness of common life as little insignificant cis talbot again  it was humfrey who first came near almost timidly touched her hand and said cheer up  it is but for a little while mayhap  she will send for thee  come here is thine old palfreypoor old dapple let me put thee on him and for this brief time let us feign that all is as it was and thou art my little sister once more  i know not which is truth and which is dreaming said cis waking up through her tears but resigning her hand to him and letting him lift her to her seat on the old pony which had been the playfellow of both if it had been an effort to humfrey to prolong the word cis into sister he was rewarded for it  it gave the keynote to their intercourse and set her at ease with him and the idea that her present rustication was but a comedy instead of a reality was consoling in her present frame of mind  mistress susan surrounded with importunate inquirers as to household matters and unable to escape from them could only see that humfrey had taken charge of the maiden and trusted to his honour and his tact  this was however only the beginning of a weary and perplexing time  nothing could restore cis to her old place in the bridgefield household or make her look upon its tasks cares and joys as she had done only a few short months ago her share in them could only be acting and she was too artless and simple to play a part  most frequently she was listless dull and pining so much inclined to despise and neglect the ordinary household occupations which befitted the daughter of the family that her adopted mother was forced for the sake of her incognito to rouse and often to scold her when any witnesses were present who would have thought mrs talbots toleration of such conduct in a daughter suspicious and unnatural  such reproofs were dangerous in another way for humfrey could not bear to hear them and was driven nearly to the verge of disrespect and perilous approaches to implying that cis was no ordinary person to be sharply reproved when she sat musing and sighing instead of sewing diccons shirts  even the father himself could not well brook to hear the girl blamed and both he and humfrey could not help treating her with a kind of deference that made the younger brothers gape and wonder what had come to humfrey on his travels to make him treat our cis as a born princess  you irreverent varlets said humfrey you have yet to learn that every woman ought to be treated as a born princess  by cock and pie said spoilt ned that beats all  ones own sister  whereupon humfrey had the opportunity of venting a little of his vexation by thrashing his brother for his oath while sharp diccon innocently asked if men never swore by anything when at sea and thereby nearly got another castigation for irreverent mocking of his elder brothers discipline  at other times the girls natural activity and high spirits gained the upper hand and she would abandon herself without reserve to the old homely delights of bridgefield  at the apple gathering she was running about screaming with joy and pelting the boys with apples more as she had done at thirteen than at seventeen and when called to order she inconsistently pleaded ah mother it is for the last time do but let me have my swing putting on a wistful and caressing look which susan did not withstand when the only companions were the three brothers since humfrey had much of her own unselfishness and selfcommand resulting in a discretion that was seldom at fault  and that discretion made him decide at a fortnights end that his father had been right and that it would be better for him to absent himself from where he could do no good but only added to the general perplexity and involved himself in the temptation of betraying the affection he knew to be hopeless  before however it was possible to fit out either diccon or the four men who were anxious to go under the leadership of master humfrey of bridgefield the earl and countess of shrewsbury were returning fully reconciled  queen elizabeth had made the cavendishes ask pardon on their knees of the earl for their slanders and he in his joy had freely forgiven all  gilbert talbot and his wife had shared in the general reconciliation  his elder brothers death had made him the heir apparent and all were coming home again including the little lady arbell once more to fill the castle and the manorhouse and to renew the free hospitable life of a great feudal chief or of the queens old courtier with doors wide open and no ward or suspicion  richard rejoiced that his sons before going abroad should witness the return to the old times which had been at an end before they could remember sheffield distinctly  the whole family were drawn up as usual to receive them when the earl and countess arrived first of all at the manorhouse  the countess looked smaller thinner older perhaps a trifle more shrewish but she had evidently suffered much and was very glad to have recovered her husband and her home  so susan talbot was her salutation you have thriven it seems you have been playing the part of hostess i hear  only so far as might serve his lordship madam  and the wench there what call you her  ay cicely  i hear the scottish queen hath been cockering her up and making her her bedfellow till she hath spoilt her for a reasonable maiden  is it so  she looks it  i trust not madam said susan  she grows a strapping wench and we must find her a good husband to curb her pride  i have a young man already in my eye for her  so please your ladyship we do not think of marrying her as yet returned susan in consternation  tilly vally susan talbot tell me not such folly as that  why the maid is over seventeen at the very least  save for all the coil this scottish woman and her crew have made i should have seen her well mated a year ago  here was a satisfactory prospect for mistress susan bred as she had been to unquestioning submission to the countess  there was no more to be said on that occasion as the great lady passed on to bestow her notice on others of her little court  humfrey meantime had been warmly greeted by the younger men of the suite and one of them handed him a letter which filled him with eagerness  it was from an old shipmate who wrote not without sanction to inform him that sir francis drake was fitting out an expedition with the full consent of the queen to make a descent upon the spaniards and that there was no doubt that if he presented himself at plymouth he would obtain either the command or at any rate the lieutenancy of one of the numerous ships which were to be commissioned  humfrey was before all else a sailor  he had made no engagement to sir john norreys and many of the persons engaged on this expedition were already known to him  it was believed that the attack was to be upon spain itself and the notion filled him with ardour and excitement that almost drove cicely out of his mind as he laid the proposal before his father  richard was scarcely less excited  you young lads are in luck he said  i sailed for years and never had more than a chance brush with the don never the chance of bearding him on his own shores  come with us then father entreated humfrey  sir francis would be overjoyed to see you  you would get the choicest ship to your share  nay nay my boy tempt me not i cannot leave your mother to meet all the coils that may fall in her way  no im too old  ive lost my sea legs  i leave thee to win the fame son humfrey  the decision was thus made and humfrey and diccon were to start together for london first and then for plymouth the second day after a great festival for the wedding of the little alethea daughter of gilbert lord talbotstill of very tender ageto the young heir of arundel  the talbot family had been precluded from holding festival for full fourteen years or indeed from entertaining any guests save the commissioners sent down to confer from time to time with the captive queen so that it was no wonder that they were in the highest possible spirits at their release and determined to take the first opportunity of exercising the gorgeous hospitality of the tudor times  posts went out riding round all the neighbourhood with invitations the halls were swept and adorned with the best suit of hangings  all the gentlemen young and old all the keepers and verdurers were put in requisition to slaughter all the game quadruped and biped that fell in their way the village women and children were turned loose on the blackberries cranberries and bilberries and all the ladies and servingwomen were called on to concoct pasties of many stories high subtilties of wonderful curiosity sweetmeats and comfits cakes and marchpanes worthy of camachos wedding or to deck the halls with green boughs and weave garlands of heather and red berries  cis absolutely insisted so that the heads of the household gave way on riding out with richard and humfrey when they had a buck to mark down in rivelin chase  and she set her heart on going out to gather cranberries in the park flinging herself about with petulant irritation when dame susan showed herself unwilling to permit a proceeding which was thought scarcely becoming in any wellborn damsel of the period  ah child child thou wilt have to bear worse restraints than these she said if ever thou comest to thy greatness  cis made no answer but threw herself into a chair and pouted  the next morning she did not present herself at the usual hour but just as the good mother was about to go in quest of her to her chamber a clear voice came singing up the valley             berries to sell berries to sell            berries fresh from moorland fell   and there stood a girl in peasant dress with short petticoats stout shoes soaked in dew a round face under black brows and cheeks glowing in morning freshness and a boy swung the other handle of the basket overflowing with purple berries  it was but a shallow disguise betrayed by the two roguish faces and the good mother was so pleased to see cis smile merrily again that she did not scold over the escapade  yet the inconsistent girl hotly refused to go up to the castle and help to make pastry for her mothers bitter and malicious foe and sir richard shook his head and said she was in the right ont and should not be compelled  so susan found herself making lame excuses which did not avert a sharp lecture from the countess on the cockering of her daughter     chapter xix  the clash of swords   festivals in the middle ages were conducted by day rather than by night and it was a bright noonday sun that shone upon the great hall at sheffield bedecked with rich tapestry around the dais where the floor was further spread with eastern carpets  below the garniture of the walls was of green boughs interspersed between stags antlers and the floor was strewn in ancient fashion with the fragrant rush  all the tables however were spread with pure white napery the difference being only in texture but the higher table rejoiced in the wonderful extravagance of silver plates while the lower had only trenchers as to knives each guest brought his or her own and forks were not yet but bread in long fingers of crust was provided to a large amount to supply the want  splendid saltcellars towering as landmarks to the various degrees of guests tankards gilt and parcel gilt or shining with silver perfectly swarmed along the board and the meanest of the guests present drank from silverrimmed cups of horn while for the very greatest were reserved the tall slender opal venice glasses recently purchased by the countess in london  the pies the glory of yorkshire surpassed themselves  the young bride and bridegroom had the felicity of contemplating one whose crust was elevated into the altar of hymen with their own selves united thereat attended by numerous cupids made chiefly in paste and sugar and with little wings from the feathers of the many slaughtered fowl within  as to the jellies the devices and the subtilties the pen refuses to describe them  it will be enough to say that the wedding itself was the least part of the entertainment it was gone through with very few spectators in the early morning and the guests only assembled afterwards to this mighty dinner at a somewhat earlier hour than they would now to a wedding breakfast the sewer marshalled all the guests in pairs according to their rank having gone through the roll with his mistress just as the lady of the house or her aidedecamp pairs the guests and puts cards in their plates in modern times  every one was there who had any connection with the earl and cis though flashes of recollection of her true claims would come across her now and then was unable to keep from being eager about her first gaiety  perhaps the strange life she had led at buxton as it receded in the distance became more and more unreal and shadowy and she was growing back into the simple cicely she had always believed herself  it was with perfectly girlish natural pleasure that she donned the delicate skyblue farthingale embroidered with white lilies by the skilful hands of the captive queen and the daintilyfashioned little cap of flanders lace and practised the pretty dancing steps which the queen had amused herself with teaching her long ere they knew they were mother and daughter  as talbots the bridgefield family were spectators of the wedding after which one by one the seneschal paired them off  richard was called away first then a huge old yorkshire knight came and bore away mrs susan and after an interval during which the young people entertained hopes of keeping together in enviable obscurity the following summons to the board was heard in a loud voice  master antony babington esquire of dethick mistress cicely talbot of bridgefield  humfreys brow grew dark with disappointment but cleared into a friendly greeting as there advanced a tall slender gentleman of the wellknown fair pink and white colouring and yellow hair apparelled point device in dark green velvet with a full delicately crimped ruff bowing low as he extended his hand to take that of the young lady exchanging at the same time a friendly greeting with his old comrade before leading cis to her place  on the whole she was pleased  teteatetes with humfrey were dreadfully embarrassing and she felt life so flat without her nocturnal romance that she was very glad to have some one who would care to talk to her of the queen  in point of fact such conversation was prohibited  in the former days when there had been much more intercourse between the earls household and the neighbourhood regular cautions had been given to every member of it not to discuss the prisoner or make any communication about her habits  the younger generation who had grown up in the time of the closer captivity had never been instructed in these laws for the simple reason that they hardly saw any one  antony and cicely were likewise most comfortably isolated for she was flanked by a young esquire who had no eyes nor ears save for the fair widow of sixteen whom he had just led in and antony by a fat and deaf lady whose only interest was in tasting as many varieties of good cheer as she could and trying to discover how and of what they were compounded knowing mistress cicely to be a member of the family she once or twice referred the question to her across antony but getting very little satisfaction she gave up the young lady as a bad specimen of housewifery and was forced to be content with her own inductions  there was plenty of time for antony to begin with are there as many conies as ever in the chase and to begin on a discussion of all the memories connected with the free days of childhood the blackberry and bilberry gatherings the hideandseek in the rocks and heather the consternation when little dick was lost the audacious comedy with the unsuspected spectators and all the hundred and one recollections less memorable perhaps but no less delightful to both  it was only thus gradually that they approached their recent encounter in the castleton cavern and antony explained how he had burnt to see his dear queen and mistress once again and that his friends tichborne and the rest were ready to kiss every footstep she had taken and almost worshipped him and john eyre for contriving this mode of letting them behold the hitherto unknown object of their veneration  all that passionate chivalrous devotion which in sidney spenser and many more attached itself to thengreat gloriana had in these young men all either secretly or openly reconciled to rome found its object in that rival in whom edmund spenser only beheld his false duessa or snowy florimel  and indeed romance had in her a congenial heroine who needed little selfblinding so to appear  her beauty needed no illusion to be credited  even at her age now over forty the glimpse they had had in the fitful torchlight of the cavern had been ravishing and had confirmed all they had ever heard of her witching loveliness nor did they recollect how that very obscurity might have assisted it  to their convictions she was the only legitimate sovereign in the island a confessor for their beloved church a captive princess and beauty driven from her throne and kept in durance by a usurper thus every generous feeling was enlisted in her cause with nothing to counterbalance them save the english hatred of the spaniard with whom her cause was inextricably linked a dread of what might be inflicted on the country in the triumph of her party and in some a strange inconsistent personal loyalty to elizabeth but all these they were instructed to believe mere temptations and delusions that ought to be brushed aside as cobwebs  antonys puritan tutor at cambridge had as richard talbot had foreboded done little but add to his detestation of the reformation and he had since fallen in with several of the seminary priests who were circulating in england  some were devoted and pious men who at the utmost risk went from house to house to confirm the faith and constancy of the old families of their own communion  the saintly martyr spirit of one of these whom antony met in the house of a kinsman of his mother had so wrought on him as to bring him heart and soul back to his mothers profession in which he had been secretly nurtured in early childhood and which had received additional confirmation at sheffield where queen mary and her ladies had always shown that they regarded him as one of themselves sure to return to them when he was his own master  it was not however of this that he spoke to cis but whatever she ventured to tell him of the queen was listened to with delight as an extreme favour which set her tongue off with all the eager pleasure of a girl telling what she alone can tell  all through the banquet they talked for babington had much to ask of all the members of the household whom he had known  and after the feast was over and the hall was cleared for dancing antony was still by etiquette her partner for the evening  the young bride and bridegroom had first to perform a stately pavise before the whole assembly in the centre of the floor in which poor young things they acquitted themselves much as if they were in the dancingmasters hands  then her father led out his mother and vice verse the bridegroom had no grandparents but the stately earl handed forth his little active wiry countess bowing over her with a grand stiff devotion as genuine and earnest as at their wedding twenty years previously for the reconciliation had been complete and had restored all her ascendency over him  theirs as mistress susan exultingly agreed with a hardwicke kinsman not seen for many years was the grandest and most featly of all the performances  all the time each pair were performing the others were awaiting their turn the ladies in rows on benches or settles the gentlemen sometimes standing before them sometimes sitting on cushions or steps at their feet sometimes handing them comfits of sugar or dried fruits  the number of gentlemen was greatly in excess so that humfrey had no such agreeable occupation but had to stand in a herd among other young men watching with no gratified eye antony babington in a graceful attitude at cicelys feet while she conversed with him with untiring animation  humfrey was not the only one to remark them  lady shrewsbury nodded once or twice to herself as one who had discovered what she sought and the next morning a mandate arrived at bridgefield that master richard and his wife should come to speak with my lady countess  richard and his son were out of reach having joined a party of the guests who had gone out hunting  susan had to go alone for she wished to keep cicely as much as possible out of her ladyships sight so she left the girl in charge of her keys so that if father brought home any of the hunters to the midday meal tankards and glasses might not be lacking  the countesss summons was to her own bower a sort of dressingroom within her great state bedroom and with a small glazed window looking down into the great hall where her ladies sat at work whence she could on occasion call down orders or directions or reproofs susan had known what it was to stand in dread of such a window at chatsworth or hardwicke whence shrill shrieks of objurgation followed sometimes by such missiles as pincushions shoes or combs however the window was now closed and my lady sat in her armchair as on a throne a stool being set to which she motioned her kinswoman  so  susan talbot she said i have sent for you to do you a good turn for you are mine own kinswoman of the hardwicke blood and have ever been reasonably humble and dutiful towards me and my lord  mrs talbot did not by any means view this speech as the insult it would in these days appear to a lady of her birth and position but accepted it as the compliment it was intended to be  thus continued lady shrewsbury i have always cast about how to marry that daughter of yours fitly  it would have been done ere now had not that scottish womans tongue made mischief between me and my lord but i am come home to rule my own house now and mine own blood have the first claim on me  the alarm always excited by a summons to speak with my lady countess began to acquire definite form and susan made answer your ladyship is very good but i doubt me whether my husband desires to bestow cicely in marriage as yet  he hath surely received no marriage proposals for her without my knowledge or my lords said bess of hardwicke who was prepared to strain all feudal claims to the uttermost  no madam but  tell me not that you or he have the presumption to think that my son william cavendish or even edward talbot will ever cast an eye on a mere portionless country maid not comely nor even like the hardwickes or the talbots  if i thought so for a moment never shouldst thou darken these doors again thou ungrateful treacherous woman  neither of us ever had the thought far less the wish said susan most sincerely  well thou wast ever a simple woman susan talbot said the great lady thereby meaning truthful so i will een take thy word for it the more readily that i made contracts for both the lads when i was at court  as to dick talbot not being fain to bestow her i trow that is because ye have spent too much on your longlegged sons to be able to lay down a portion for her though she be your only daughter anan  for though this was quite true susan feeling that it was not the whole truth made but faint response  however the countess went on expecting to overpower her with gratitude  the gentleman i mean is willing to take her in her smock and moreover his wardship and marriage were granted to my lord by her majesty  thou knowest whom i mean  she wanted to hear a guess and susan actually foreboded the truth but was too full of dismay and perplexity to do anything but shake her head as one puzzled  what thinkst thou of mr babington triumphantly exclaimed the countess  mr babington returned susan  but he is no longer a ward  no  we had granted his marriage to a little niece of my lord treasurers but she died ere coming to age  then tom ratcliffes wife would have him for her daughter a mere babe  but for that thou and thine husband have done good service while evil tongues kept me absent and because the wench comes of our own blood we are willing to bestow her upon him he showing himself willing and content as bents a lad bred in our own household  madam we are much beholden to you and my lord but sure mr babington is more inclined to the old faith  tush woman what of that  thou mayst say the same of half our northern youth  they think it grand to dabble with seminary priests in hiding and talk big about their conscience and the like but when theyve seen a neighbour or two pay down a heavy fine for recusancy they think better of it and a good wife settles their brains to jog to church to hear the parson with the rest of them  i fear me cis is over young to settle any ones mind said susan  she is seventeen if she is a day said my lady and i was a wedded wife ere i saw my teens  moreover i will say for thee susan that thou hast bred the girl as becomes one trained in my household and unless she have been spoiled by resort to the scottish woman she is like to make the lad a moderately good wife having seen nought of the unthrifty modes of the fine court dames who queen it with standing ruffs a foot high and coloured with turmeric so please you but who know no more how to bake a marchpane or roll puff paste than yonder messan dog  she is a good girl said susan but  what has the foolish wife to object now said the countess  i tell you i marked them both last eve and though i seldom turn my mind to such follies i saw the plain tokens of love in every look and gesture of the young springald  nay twas his countenance that put it into my mind for i am even too goodnaturedover goodnatured susan talbot how now at some sound below springing to the little window and flinging it back you lazy idle wencheswhat are you doing there  is my work to stand still while you are toying with yon vile whelp  he is tangling the yarn dont you see thou purblind jane dacre with no eyes but for ogling  there there round the leg of the chair dont you see and down flew a shoe which made the poor dog howl and his mistress catch him up  put him down put him down this instant thomas  davy  here hang him up i say cried this over goodnatured lady interspersing her commands with a volley of sixteenth century billingsgate and ending by declaring that nothing fared well without her and hurrying off to pounce down on the luckless damsels who had let their dog play with the embroidery yarn destined to emblazon the tapestry of chatsworth with the achievements of juno  the good nature was so far veritable that when she found little harm done and had vented her wrath in strong language and boxes on the ear she would forget her sentence upon the poor little greyhound which mrs jane dacre had hastily conveyed out of sight during her transit downstairs susan was thus to her great relief released for the present for guests came in before my lady had fully completed her objurgations on her ladies the hour of noon was nigh at hand sounds in the court betokened the return of the huntsmen and susan effected her escape to her own sober old palfreyglad that she would at least be able to take counsel with her husband on this most inconvenient proposition  he came out to meet her at the court door having just dismounted and she knew by his face that she had not to give him the first intelligence of the difficulty in which they stood  my lord had himself spoken to him like my lady expecting him to be enchanted at the prospect of so good a match for his slenderlyportioned daughter for dethick was a fair estate and the babington family though not ennobled fully equal to a younger branch of the talbots  however richard had had a less uncomfortable task than his wife since the earl was many degrees more reasonable than the countess  he had shown himself somewhat offended at not meeting more alacrity in the acceptance of his proposal when richard had objected on account of the young gentlemans popish proclivities but boldly declared that he was quite certain that the stripling had been entirely cured  this point of the narrative had just been reached when it was interrupted by a scream and cicely came flying into the hall crying o father father stop them  humfrey and mr babington they are killing one another  where exclaimed richard catching up his sword  in the pleasance father  oh stop them  they will slay one another they had their swords and as the father was already gone she threw herself into the mothers arms hid her face and sobbed with fright as scarce became a princess for whom swords were for the first time crossed  fear not  father will stop them said the mother with confidence she could only keep up outwardly by the inward cry god protect my boy  father will come ere they can hurt one another  but how came it about she added as with an arm round the trembling girl she moved anxiously forward to know the issue  oh  i know not  twas humfrey fell on him  hark  tis fathers voice said susan  thank god  i know by the sound no harm is done  but how was it child  cis told with more coherence now but the tears in her eyes and colour deepening i was taking in humfreys kerchiefs from the bleaching on the grass when master babingtonhe had brought me a plume of pheasants feathers from the hunting and he began  o mother is it sooth  he said my lord had sent him  that is true my child but you know we have no choice but to refuse thee  ay mother and antony knows  not thy true birth child  not that but the other story  so he began to say that if i were favourablemother do men always do like that  hiding her face against the trusty breast and when i drew back and said i could not and would not hearken to such folly  that was well dear child  he would have it that i should have to hear him and he went down on his knee and snatched at my hand  and therewith came a great howl of rage like an angry lion and humfrey bounded right over the sweetbrier fence and cried out off fellow  no papist traitor knave shall meddle with her  and then antony gave him back the lie for calling him traitor and they drew their swords and i ran away to call father but oh mother i heard them clash and she shuddered again  see said susan as they had reached the corner of a thick screen of yewtrees all is safe  there they stand and father between them speaking to them  no we will not go nearer since we know that it is well with them  men deal with each other better out of womens earshot  ah see there they are giving one another their hands all is over now  humfrey stands tall grave and stiff  he is only doing it because father bids him said cicely  antony is much more willing  poor humfrey he knows better than antony how vain any hope must be of my silly little princess said susan with a sigh for her boy come in child and set these locks in order  the hour of noon hath long been over and father hath not yet dined  so they flitted out of sight as richard and his son turned from the place of encounter the former saying son humfrey i had deemed thee a wiser man  sir how could a man brook seeing that fellow on his knee to her is it not enough to be debarred from my sweet princess myself but i must see her beset by a papist and traitor fostered and encouraged too  and thou couldst not rest secure in the utter impossibility of her being given to him  he is as much out of reach of her as thou art  he has secured my lord and my lady on his side growled humfrey  my lord is not an amurath nor my lady either said richard shortly as long as i pass for her father i have power to dispose of her and i am not going to give another womans daughter away without her consent  yet the fellow may have her ear said humfrey  i know him to be popishly inclined and there is a web of those romish priests all over the island whereof this queen holds the strands in her fingers captive though she be  i should not wonder if she had devised this fellows suit  this is the very madness of jealousy humfrey said his father the whole matter was as thy mother and thy lord have both told me simply a device of my lady countesss own brain  babington took to it wondrous naturally muttered humfrey  that may be but as for the lady at wingfield her talk to our poor maid hath been all of archdukes and dukes  she is far too haughty to think for a moment of giving her daughter to a mere derbyshire esquire not even of noble blood  you may trust her for that  this pacified humfrey for a little while especially as the bell was clanging for the meal which had been unusually deferred and he had to hurry away to remove certain marks which were happily the result of the sweetbrier weapons instead of that of babington  that a little blood had been shed was shown by the state of his sword point but antony had disclaimed being hurt when the master of the house came up and in the heat of the rebuke the father and son had hardly noticed that he had thrown a kerchief round his left hand ere he moved away  before dinner was over word was brought in from the door that master will cavendish wanted to speak to master humfrey  the ladies hearts were in their mouths as it were lest it should be to deliver a cartel and they looked to the father to interfere but he sat still contenting himself with saying as his son craved license to quit the board use discretion as well as honour  they were glad that the next minute humfrey came back to call his father to the door where will cavendish sat on horseback  he had come by desire of babington who had fully intended that the encounter should be kept secret but some servant must have been aware of it either from the garden or the park and the countess had got wind of it  she had summoned babington to her presence before the castle barber had finished dealing with the cut in his hand and the messenger reported that my lady was in one of her raging fits and talked of throwing young humfrey into a dungeon if not having him hung for his insolence  babington who had talked to his friends of a slip with his huntingknife while disembowelling a deer was forced to tell the fact in haste to cavendish the nearest at hand begging him to hurry down and advise humfrey to set forth at once if he did not wish his journey to be unpleasantly delayed  my lord is unwilling to cross my mother at the present said young cavendish with half a smile and though it be not likely that much harm should come of the matter yet if she laid hands on humfrey at the present moment there might be hindrance and vexation so it may be well for him to set forth in case tony be unable to persuade my lady that it is nought  will cavendish had been a friendly comrade of both humfrey and antony in their boyish days and his warning was fully to be trusted  i know not why i should creep off as though i had done aught that was evil said humfrey drawing himself up  well said will my lord is always wroth at brawling with swords amongst us and he mightmy mother egging him onlay you by the heels in the strong room for a week or so  nay for my part methinks twas a strange requital of poor babingtons suit to your sister  had she been your love instead of your sister there might have been plainer excuse but sure you wot not of aught against tony to warrant such heat  he was importuning her when she would have none of him said humfrey feeling the perplexity he had drawn on himself  will says well added the father feeling that it by all means behoved them all to avert inquiry into the cause of humfreys passion since neither cicelys birth nor antonys perilous inclinations could be pleaded  to be detained a week or two might hinder thy voyage  so we will speed thee on thy way instantly  tell me not where he halts for the night said cavendish significantly  fare thee well humfrey  i would return ere i am missed  i trust thou wilt have made the spaniards ships smoke and weighted thy pouch with his dollars before we see thee again  fare thee well will and thank thee kindly returned humfrey as they wrung each others hands  and tell antony that i thank him heartily for his thought and owe him a good turn  that is well my son said richard as cavendish rode out of the court  babington is both hot and weakheaded and i fear me is in the toils of the scottish lady but he would never do aught that he held as disloyal by a comrade  i wish i could say the same of him anent the queen  and you will guard her from him sir earnestly said humfrey  as i would fromi would have said frenchman or spaniard but poor maid that may only be her hap if her mother should come to her throne again and as humfrey shrugged his shoulders at the improbability but we must see thee off my boy  poor mother this hurries the parting for her  so best mayhap  it was hastily arranged that humfrey should ride off at once and try to overtake a squire who had been at the festival and had invited him to turn a little out of his road and spend a day or two at his house when leaving home  humfrey had then declined but hospitality in those days was elastic and he had no doubt of a welcome  his father would bring diccon and his baggage to join him there the next day  thus there were only a very few minutes for adieux and as richard had felt this was best for all even the anxious mother  cicely ran about with the rest in the stress of preparation until humfrey hurrying upstairs met her coming down with a packet of his lace cuffs in her hands  he caught the hand on the balusters and cried my princess my princess and art thou doing this for me  thou hast learnt fine compliments humfrey said cis trying to do her part with quivering lips  ah cis thou knowest but too well what hath taught me no fine words but plain truth  fear me not i know what is due to thee  cis we never used to believe the tales and ballads that told of knights worshipping princesses beyond their reach without a hope of more than a looknot even daring to wish for more cis it is very truth be thou where thou wilt with whom thou wilt there will be one ready to serve thee to the uttermost and never ask aughtaught but such remembrance as may befit the brother of thy childhood  mistress cis screamed one of the maids madam is waiting for those cuffs  cis ran down but the squeeze and kiss on the hand remained as it were imprinted on it far more than the last kiss of all which he gave as both knew and felt to support his character as a brother before the assembled household     chapter xx  wingfield manor   the drawing of swords was not regarded as a heinous offence in elizabethan days  it was not likely under ordinary circumstances to result in murder and was looked on much as boxing is or was recently in public schools as an evidence of high spirit and a means of working off illblood  lady shrewsbury was however much incensed at such a presumptuous reception of the suitor whom she had backed with her wouldbe despotic influence and in spite of babingtons making extremely light of it and declaring that he had himself been too forward in his suit and the young ladys apparent fright had made her brother interfere over hastily for her protection four yeomen were despatched by her ladyship with orders instantly to bring back master humfrey talbot to answer for himself  they were met by mr talbot with the sober reply that master humfrey was already set forth on his journey  the men having no orders never thought of pursuing him and after a short interval richard thought it expedient to proceed to the manorhouse to explain matters  the countess swooped upon him in one of her ungovernable furiesone of those of which even gilbert talbot avoided writing the particulars to his fatherabusing his whole household in general and his son in particular in the most outrageous manner for thus receiving the favour she had done to their beggarly illfavoured illnurtured daughter  richard stood still and grave his hat in his hand as unmoved and tranquil as if he had been breasting a stiff breeze on the deck of his ship with good searoom and confidence in all his tackle never even attempting to open his lips but looking at the countess with a steady gaze which somehow disconcerted her for she demanded wherefore he stared at her like one of his clumsy hinds  because her ladyship does not know what she is saying he replied  darest thou  thou traitor thou viper thou unhanged rascal thou mire under my feet thou blot on the house  darest thou beard meme screamed my lady  darest thoui say  if the sailor had looked one whit less calm and resolute my lady would have had her clenched fist on his ear or her talons in his beard but he was like a rock against which the billows expended themselves and after more of the tempest than need stain these pages she deigned to demand what he meant or had to say for his son  solely this madam that my son had never even heard of babingtons suit far less that he had your ladyships goodwill  he found him kneeling to cicely in the garden and the girl distressed and dismayed at his importunity  there were hot words and drawn blades that was the whole  i parted them and saw them join hands  so saith master babington  he is willing to overlook the insult so will i and my lord if you will atone for it by instantly consenting to this espousal  that madam i cannot do  she let him say no more and the storm had begun to rage again when babington took advantage of an interval to take breath and said i thank you madam and pray you peace  if a little space be vouchsafed me i trust to show this worthy gentleman cause wherefore he should no longer withhold his fair damsel from me  indeed said the countess  art thou so confident  i marvel what better backer thou wouldst have than me  so conceited of themselves are young men nowadays they think forsooth their own merits and graces should go farther in mating them than the word and will of their betters  there you may go  i wash my hands of the matter one is as ingrate as the other  both gentlemen accepted this amiable dismissal each hoping that the countess might indeed have washed her hands of their affairs  on his departure richard was summoned into the closet of the earl who had carefully kept out of the way during the uproar only trusting not to be appealed to  my good cousin he asked what means this broil between the lads  hath babington spoken sooth  he hath spoken well and more generously than mayhap i thought he would have done said richard  ay you have judged the poor youth somewhat hardly as if the folly of pagedom never were outgrown said the earl  i put him under governorship such as to drive out of his silly pate all the wiles that he was fed upon here  you will see him prove himself an honest protestant and good subject yet and be glad enough to give him your daughter  so he was too hot a lover for master humfreys notions eh said my lord laughing a little  the varlet  he was over prompt to protect his sister yet twas a fault on the right side and i am sorry there was such a noise about it that he should have gone without leavetakings  he will be glad to hear of your lordships goodness  i shall go after him tomorrow and take his mails and little diccon to him  that is well said the earl  and give him this with his kinsmans good wishes that he may win ten times more from the don pushing towards richard a packet of twenty broad gold pieces stamped with queen bess in all her glory and then after receiving due thanks for the gift which was meant half as friendly feudal patronage from the head of the family half as a contribution to the royal service the earl added i would crave of thee richard to extend thy journey to wingfield  here are some accounts of which i could not sooner get the items to be discharged between me and the lady thereand i would fain send thee as the man whom i can most entirely trust  i will give thee a pass and a letter to sadler bidding him admit thee to her presence since there are matters here which can sooner be discharged by one word of mouth than by many weary lines of writing  good master richards conscience had little occasion to wince yet he could not but feel somewhat guilty when this opportune commission was given to him since the earl gave it unaware of his secret understanding with the captive  he accepted it however without hesitation since he was certainly not going to make a mischievous use of it and bent all his mind to understand the complicated accounts that he was to lay before the queen or her comptroller of the household  he had still another interview to undergo with antony babington who overtook him on his way home through the crackling leaves that strewed the avenue as the october twilight fell  his recent conduct towards humfrey gave him a certain right to friendly attention though as the frankhearted mariner said to himself it was hard that a plain man who never told a lie nor willingly had a concealment of his own should be involved in a manysided secret like this a sort of web where there was no knowing whether straining the wrong strand might not amount to a betrayal all because he had rescued an infant and not at once proclaimed her an alien  sir said antony if my impatience to accost the maiden we wot of when i saw her alone had not misled me i should have sought you first to tell you that no man knows better than i that my lady countesss good will is not what is wanting to forward my suit  knowing then that it is not in my power or right to dispose of her thine ardent wooing was out of place said richard  i own it sir though had i but had time i should have let the maiden know that i sought her subject to other approval which i trust to obtain so as to satisfy you  young man said richard listen to friendly counsel and meddle not in perilous matters  i ask thee not whether dethick hath any commerce with wingfield but i warn thee earnestly to eschew beginning again that which caused the trouble of thy childhood  thou mayst do it innocently seeking the consent of the lady to this courtship of thine but i tell thee as one who knows more of the matter than thou canst that thou wilt only meet with disappointment  hath the queen other schemes for her asked babington anxiously and richard thinking of the vista of possible archdukes replied that she had but that he was not free to speak though he replied to babingtons halfuttered question that his son humfrey was by no means intended  ah cried antony you give me hope sir  i will do her such service that she shall refuse me nothing  sir do you mock me he added with a fierce change of note  my poor lad i could not but laugh to think what a simple plotter you are and what fine service you will render if thou utterest thy vows to the very last person who should hear them  credit me thou wast never made for privy schemes and conspiracies and a queen who can only be served by such is no mistress for thee  thou wilt but run thine own neck into the noose and belike that of others  that will i never do quoth antony  i may peril myself but no others  then the more you keep out of secrets the better  thou art too openhearted and unguarded for them  so speaks thy wellwisher antony whose friendship thou hast won by thine honourable conduct towards my rash boy though i tell thee plainly the maiden is not for thee whether as scottish or english cis or bride  so they parted at the gate of the park the younger man full of hope and confidence the elder full of pitying misgiving  he was too kindhearted not to let cicely know that he should see her mother or to refuse to take a billet for hera little formal note necessarily silent on the matter at issue since it had to be laid before the earl who smiled at the scrupulous precaution and let it pass  thus the good father parted with humfrey and diccon rejoicing in his heart that they would fight with open foes instead of struggling with the meshes of perplexity which beset all concerned with queen mary and then he turned his horses head towards wingfield manor a grand old castellated mansion of the talbots considered by some to excel even sheffield  it stood high on ground falling very steeply from the walls on three sides and on the south well fortified court within court and each with a deeparched and portcullised gateway with loopholed turrets on either side a porters lodge and yeomen guards  mr talbot had to give his name and quality and show his pass at each of these gates though they were still guarded by shrewsbury retainers with the talbot on their sleeves  he was however received with the respect and courtesy due to a trusted kinsman of their lord and sir ralf sadler a thin elderly careworn statesman came to greet him at the door of the hall and would only have been glad could he have remained a week instead of for the single night he wished to spend at wingfield  sadler was one of marys most gentle and courteous warders and he spoke of her with much kindness regretting that her health had again begun to suffer from the approach of winter and far more from disappointment  the negotiation with scotland on her behalf was now known to have been abortive  james had fallen into the hands of the faction most hostile to her and though his mother still clung with desperate hope to the trust that he at least was labouring on her behalf no one else believed that he cared for anything but his own security and even she had been forced to perceive that her liberation was again adjourned  and what think you was her thought when she found that road closed up said sir ralf  why for her people  her gentlewoman mrs mowbray hath it seems been long betrothed  ay to gilbert curll the longbacked scotch secretary  they were to be wed at stirling so soon as she arrived there again  yea but when she read the letter that overthrew her hopes what did she say but that her servants must not grow grayheaded with waiting till she was set free  so she would have me make the case known to sir parson and we had them married in the parish church two days since they being both good protestants  there is no doubt that her kindness of heart is true said richard the poor folk at sheffield and ecclesfield will miss her plentiful almsgiving  some say it ought to be hindered for that it is but a purchasing of friends to her cause said sadler but i have not the heart to check it and what could these of the meaner sort do to our queens prejudice  i take care that nothing goes among them that could hide a billet and that none of her people have private speech with them so no harm can ensue from her bounty  a message here came that the queen was ready to admit mr talbot and richard found himself in her presence chamber a larger and finer room than that in the lodge at sheffield and with splendid tapestry hangings and plenishings but the windows all looked into the inner quadrangle instead of on the expanse of park and thus as mary said she felt more entirely the prisoner  this however was not perceptible at the time for the autumn evening had closed in there were two large fires burning one at each end of the room and tall tapestrycovered screens and highbacked settles were arranged so as to exclude the draughts around the hearth where mary reclined on a couchlike chair  she looked ill and though she brightened with her sweet smile to welcome her guest there were dark circles round her eyes and an air of dejection in her whole appearance  she held out her hand graciously as richard approached closely followed by his host he put his knee to the ground and kissed it as she said you must pardon me mr talbot for discourtesy if i am less agile than when we were at buxton  you see my old foe lies in wait to plague me with aches and pains so soon as the year declines  i am sorry to see your grace thus returned richard standing on the step  the while i am glad to see you thus well sir  and how does the good lady your wife and my sweet playfellow your daughter  well madam i thank your grace and cicely has presumed to send a billet by mine hand  ah the dear bairnie and all the queens consummate art could not repress the smile of gladness and the movement of eager joy with which she held out her hand for it so that richard regretted its extreme brevity and unsatisfying nature and mary recollecting herself in a second added smiling at sadler mr talbot knows how a poor prisoner must love the pretty playfellows that are lent to her for a time  sir ralfs presence hindered any more intimate conversation and richard had certainly committed a solecism in giving cicelys letter the precedence over the earls  the queen however had recalled her caution and inquired for the health of the lord and lady and with a certain sarcasm on her lips trusted that the peace of the family was complete and that they were once more setting hallamshire the example of living together as household doves  her hazel eyes meantime archly scanned the face of richard who could not quite forget the very undovelike treatment he had received though he could and did sturdily aver that my lord and my lady were perfectly reconciled and seemed most happy in their reunion  welladay let us trust that there will be no further disturbances to their harmony said mary a prayer i may utter most sincerely is the little arbell come back with them  yea madam  and is she installed in my former rooms with the canopy over her cradle to befit her strain of royalty  i think not madam  meseems that my lady countess hath seen reason to be heedful on that score  my young lady hath come back with a grave gouvernante who makes her read her primer and sew her seam and save that she sat next my lady at the wedding feast there is little difference made between her and the other grandchildren  the queen then inquired into the circumstances of the wedding festivities with the interest of one to whom most of the parties were more or less known and who seldom had the treat of a little feminine gossip  she asked who had been her little ciss partner and when she heard of babington she said ah ha then the poor youth has made his peace with my lord  certes madam he is regarded with high favour by both my lord and my lady said richard heartily wishing himself rid of his host  i rejoice to hear it said mary i was afraid that his childish knighterrantry towards the captive dame had damaged the poor striplings prospects for ever  he is our neighbour here and i believe sir ralf regards him as somewhat perilous  nay madam if my lord of shrewsbury be satisfied with him so surely ought i to be said sir ralf  nothing more of importance passed that night  the packet of accounts was handed over to sir andrew melville and the two gentlemen dismissed with gracious goodnights  richard talbot was entirely trusted and when the next morning after prayers breakfast and a turn among the stables it was intimated that the queen was ready to see him anent my lords business sir ralf sadler who had his weeks report to write to the council requested that his presence might be dispensed with and thus mr talbot was ushered into the queens closet without any witnesses to their interview save sir andrew melville and marie de courcelles the queen was seated in a large chair leaning against cushions and evidently in a good deal of pain but as richard made his obeisance her eyes shone as she quoted two lines from an old scotch ballad            madame how does my gay goss hawk             madame how does my doo  now can i hear what i hunger for  my gay gosshawk madam is flown to join sir francis drake at plymouth and taken his little brother with him  i come now from speeding them as far as derby  ah you must not ask me to pray for success to them my good sironly that there may be a time when nations may be no more divided and i fear me we shall not live to see it  and my doomy little cis did she weep as became a sister for the bold laddies  she wept many tears madam but we are sore perplexed by a matter that i must lay before your grace  my lady countess is hotly bent on a match between the maiden and young babington  babington exclaimed the queen with the lioness sparkle in her eye you refused the fellow of course  flatly madam but your grace knows that it is ill making the countess accept a denial of her will  mary laughed  ah ha methought sir you looked somewhat as if you had had a recent taste of my lord of shrewsburys dove  but you are a man to hold your own sturdy will master richard let lord or lady say what they choose  i trust so madam i am master of mine own house and as i should certainly not give mine own daughter to babington so shall i guard your graces  you would not give the child to him if she were your own  no madam  and wherefore not  because he is too much inclined to the poor prisoner and her faith  is it so sir  your grace speaks the truth in part said richard and then with effort added and likewise madam with your pardon i would say that though i verily believe it is nobleness of heart and spirit that inclines poor antony to espouse your graces cause there is to my mind a shallowness and indiscretion about his nature even when most in earnest such as would make me loath to commit any woman or any secret to his charge  you are an honest man mr talbot said mary i am glad my poor maid is in your charge  tell me is this suit on his part made to your daughter or to the scottish orphan  to the scottish orphan madam  thus much he knows though by what means i cannot tell unless it be through that kinsman of mine who as i told your grace saw the babe the night i brought her in  doubtless responded mary  take care he neither knows more nor hints what he doth know to the countess  so far as i can i will madam said richard but his tongue is not easy to silence i marvel that he hath not let the secret ooze out already  proving him to have more discretion than you gave him credit for my good sir said the queen smiling  refuse him however staunchly grounding your refusal if it so please you on the very causes for which i should accept him were the lassie verily what he deems her my ward and kinswoman  nor do you accede to him whatever word or token he may declare that he brings from me unless it bear this mark and she hastily traced a peculiartwisted form of m  you know it she asked  i have seen it madam said richard gravely for he knew it as the letter which had been traced on the childs shoulders  ah good master richard she said with a sweet and wistful expression looking up to his face in pleading and changing to the familiar pronoun thou likest not my charge and i know that it is hard on an upright man like thee to have all this dissembling thrust on thee but what can a poor captive mother do but strive to save her child from an unworthy lot or from captivity like her own  i ask thee to say nought that is all and to shelter the maid who hath been as thine own daughter yet a little longer  thou wilt not deny me for her sake  madam i deny nothing that a christian man and my queens faithful servant may in honour do  your grace has the right to choose your own daughters lot and with her i will deal as you direct me  but madam were it not well to bethink yourself whether it be not a perilous and a cruel policy to hold out a bait to nourish hope in order to bind to your service a foolish though a generous youth whose devotion may after all work you and himself more ill than good  mary looked a good deal struck and waved back her two attendants who were both startled and offended at what marie de courcelles described as the englishmans brutal boldness  silence dear friends said she  would that i had always had counsellors who would deal with me with such honour and disinterestedness  then should i not be here  however she then turned her attention to the accounts where sir andrew melville was ready to question and debate every item set down by shrewsburys steward while his mistress showed herself liberal and openhanded  indeed she had considerable command of money from her french dowry the proceeds of which were in spite of the troubles of the league regularly paid to her and no doubt served her well in maintaining the correspondence which throughout her captivity eluded the vigilance of her keepers  on taking leave of her which richard talbot did before joining his host at the midday meal she reiterated her thanks for his care of her daughter and her charges to let no persuasion induce him to consent to babingtons overtures adding that she hoped soon to obtain permission to have the maiden amongst her authorised attendants  she gave him a billet loosely tied with black floss silk and unsealed so that if needful sadler and shrewsbury might both inspect the tender playful messages she wrote to her mignonne and which she took care should not outrun those which she had often addressed to bessie pierrepoint  cicely was a little disappointed when she first opened the letter but ere long she bethought herself of the directions she had received to hold such notes to the fire and accordingly she watched waiting even till the next day before she could have free and solitary access to either of the two fires in the house those in the hall and in the kitchen  at last while the master was out farming ned at school and the mistress and all her maids engaged in the unsavoury occupation of making candles by repeated dipping of rushes into a caldron of melted fat after the winters salting she escaped under pretext of attending to the hall fire and kneeling beside the glowing embers she held the paper over it and soon saw pale yellow characters appear and deepen into a sort of brown or green in which she read my little jewel must share the ring with none less precious  yet be not amazed if commendations as from me be brought thee  jewels are sometimes useful to dazzle the eyes of those who shall never possess them  therefore seem not cold nor over coy so as to take away all hope  it may be much for my service  thou art discreet and thy good guardians will hinder all from going too far  it might be well that he should deem thee and me inclined to what they oppose  be secret  keep thine own counsel and let them not even guess what thou hast here read  so fare thee well with my longing yearning blessing  cicely hastily hid the letter in the large housewifely pocket attached to her girdle feeling excited and important at having a real secret unguessed by any one and yet experiencing some of the reluctance natural to the pupil of susan talbot at the notion of acting a part towards babington  she really liked him and her heart warmed to him as a true friend of her muchinjured mother so that it seemed the more cruel to delude him with false hopes  yet here was she asked to do a real service to her mother  poor cis she knelt gazing perplexed into the embers now and then touching a stick to make them glow till nat the chief of the old blue bottles of servingmen came in to lay the cloth for dinner exclaiming so mistress cis  madam doth cocker thee truly letting thee dream over the coals till thy face be as red as my ladys new farthingale while she is toiling away like a very scullion     chapter xxi  a tangle   it was a rainy november afternoon  dinner was over the great wood fire had been made up and mistress talbot was presiding over the womenfolk of her household and their tasks with needle and distaff she had laid hands on her unwilling son edward to show his father how well he could read the piece de resistance of the family fabyans chronicle and the boy with an elbow firmly planted on either side of the great folio was floundering through the miseries of king stephens time while mr talbot after smoothing the head of his largest hound for some minutes had leant back in his chair and dropped asleep cicelys hand tardily drew out her thread her spindle scarcely balanced itself on the floor and her maiden meditation was in an inactive sort of way occupied with the sense of dulness after the summer excitements and wonder whether her greatness were all a dream and anything would happen to recall her once more to be a princess the kitten at her feet took the spindle for a lazily moving creature and thought herself fascinating it so she stared hard with only an occasional whisk of the end of her striped tail and mistress susan was only kept awake by her anxiety to adapt diccons last years jerkin to neds use  suddenly the dogs outside bayed the dogs inside pricked their ears ned joyfully halted his father uttered the unconscious falsehood im not asleep lad go on then woke up as horses feet were heard ned dashed out into the porch and was in time to hold the horse of one of the two gentlemen who with cloaks over their heads had ridden up to the door  he helped them off with their cloaks in the porch exchanging greetings with william cavendish and antony babington  will mrs talbot pardon our ridingboots said the former  we have only come down from the manorhouse and we rode mostly on the grass  their excuses were accepted though susan had rather master william had brought any other companion  however on such an afternoon almost any variety was welcome especially to the younger folk and room was made for them in the circle and according to the hospitality of the time a cup of canary fetched for each to warm him after the ride while another was brought to the master of the house to pledge them ina relic of the barbarous ages when such a security was needed that the beverage was not poisoned  will cavendish then explained that a post had come that morning to his stepfather from wingfield having been joined on the way by babington people always preferred travelling in companies for securitys sake and that as there was a packet from sir ralf sadler for master richard he had brought it down accompanied by his friend who was anxious to pay his devoirs to the ladies and though will spoke to the mother he smiled and nodded comprehension at the daughter who blushed furiously and set her spindle to twirl and leap so violently as to make the kitten believe the creature had taken fright and was going to escape  on she dashed with a sudden spring involving herself and it in the flax  the old watchdog roused himself with a growl to keep order  cicely flung herself on the cat antony hurried to the rescue to help her disentangle it and received a fierce scratch for his pains which made him start back while mrs talbot put in her word ah master babington it is ill meddling with a cat in the toils specially for men folk  here cis hold her fast and i will soon have her free  still tib  cicelys cheeks were of a still deeper colour as she held fast the mischievous favourite while the good mother untwisted the flax from its little claws and supple limbs while it winked twisted its head about sentimentally purred and altogether wore an air of injured innocence and forgiveness  i am afraid air you receive nothing but damage at our house said mrs talbot politely  hast drawn blood  oh fie thou illmannered tib  will you have a tuft from a beaver to stop the blood  thanks madam no it is a small scratch  i would i would that i could face truer perils for this ladys sake  that i hope you will not sir said richard in a serious tone which conveyed a meaning to the ears of the initiated though will cavendish only laughed and said  our kinsman takes it gravely  it was in the days of our grandfathers that ladies could throw a glove among the lions and bid a knight fetch it out for her love  it has not needed a lion to defeat mr babington observed ned looking up from his book with a sober twinkle in his eye which set them all laughing though his father declared that he ought to have his ears boxed for a malapert varlet  will cavendish declared that the least the fair damsel could do for her knighterrant was to bind up his wounds but cis was too shy to show any disposition so to do and it was mrs talbot who salved the scratch for him  she had a feeling for the motherless youth upon whom she foreboded that a fatal game might be played  when quiet was restored mr talbot craved license from his guests and opened the packet  there was a letter for mistress cicely talbot in queen marys wellknown beautiful hand which antony followed with eager eyes and a low gasp of ah favoured maiden making the good mother who overheard it say to herself methinks his love is chiefly for the maid as something appertaining to the queen though he wots not how nearly  his heart is most for the queen herself poor lad  the maiden did not show any great haste to open the letter being aware that the true gist of it could only be discovered in private and her father was studying his own likewise in silence  it was from sir ralf sadler to request that mistress cicely might be permitted to become a regular member of the household  there was now a vacancy since though mrs curll was nearly as much about the queen as ever it was as the secretarys wife not as one of the maiden attendants and sir ralf wrote that he wished the more to profit by the opportunity as he might soon be displaced by some one not of a temper greatly to consider the prisoners wishes  moreover he said the poor lady was ill at ease and much dejected at the tenor of her late letters from scotland and that she had said repeatedly that nothing would do her good but the presence of her pretty playfellow sir ralf added assurances that he would watch over the maiden like his own daughter and would take the utmost care of the faith and good order of all within his household curll also wrote by order of his mistress a formal application for the young lady to which mary had added in her own hand i thank the good master richard and mrs susan beforehand for i know they will not deny me  refusal was of course impossible to a mother who had every right to claim her own child and there was nothing to be done but to fix the time for setting off and cicely who had by this time read her own letter or at least all that was on the surface looked up tremulous with a strange frightened gladness and said mother she needs me  i shall shortly be returning home said antony and shall much rejoice if i may be one of the party who will escort this fair maiden  i shall take my daughter myself on a pillion sir said richard shortly  then sir i may tell my lord that you purpose to grant this request said will cavendish who had expected at least some time to be asked for deliberation and knew his mother would expect her permission to be requested  i may not choose but do so replied richard and then thinking he might have said too much he added it were sheer cruelty to deny any solace to the poor lady  sick and in prison and balked by her only son added susan ones heart cannot but ache for her  let not mr secretary walsingham hear you say so good madam said cavendish smiling  in london they think of her solely as a kind of malicious fury shut up in a cage and there were those who looked askance at me when i declared that she was a gentlewoman of great sweetness and kindness of demeanour  i believe myself they will not rest till they have her blood  cis and susan cried out with horror and babington with stammering wrath demanded whether she was to be assassinated in the spanish fashion or on what pretext a charge could be brought against her well cavendish answered as the saying is give her rope enough and she will hang herself  indeed theres no doubt but that she tampered enough with throckmortons plot to have been convicted of misprision of treason and so she would have been but that her most sacred majesty queen elizabeth would have no charge made against her  treason from one sovereign to another that is new law said babington  so to speak said richard but if she claim to be heiress to the crown she must also be a subject  heaven forefend that she should come to the throne  to which all except cis and babington uttered a hearty amen while a picture arose before the girl of herself standing beside her royal mother robed in velvet and ermine on the throne and of the faces of lady shrewsbury and her daughter as they recognised her and were pardoned  cavendish presently took his leave and carried the unwilling babington off with him rightly divining that the family would wish to make their arrangements alone  to richards relief babington had brought him no private message and to cicelys disappointment there was no addition in sympathetic ink to her letter though she scorched the paper brown in trying to bring one out  the scottish queen was much too wary to waste and risk her secret expedients without necessity  to richard and susan this was the real resignation of their fosterchild into the hands of her own parent  it was true that she would still bear their name and pass for their daughter but that would be only so long as it might suit her mothers convenience and instead of seeing her every day and enjoying her full confidence so far as they knew she would be out of reach and given up to influences both moral and religious which they deeply distrusted also to a fate looming in the future with all the dark uncertainty that brooded over all connected with tudor or stewart royalty  how much good susan wept and prayed that night only her pillow knew not even her husband and there was no particular comfort when my lady countess descended on her in the first interval of fine weather full of wrath at not having been consulted and discharging it in all sorts of predictions as to ciss future  no honest and loyal husband would have her after being turned loose in such company she would be corrupted in morals and manners and a disgrace to the talbots she would be perverted in faith become a papist and die in a nunnery beyond sea or she would be led into plots and have her head cut off or pressed to death by the peine forte et dure  susan had nothing to say to all this but that her husband thought it right and then had a little vigorous advice on her own score against tamely submitting to any man a weakness which certainly could not be laid to the charge of the termagant of hardwicke  cicely herself was glad to go  she loved her mother with a romantic enthusiastic affection missed her engaging caresses and felt her bridgefield home eminently dull flat and even severe especially since she had lost the excitement of humfreys presence and likewise her companion diccon  so she made her preparations with a joyful alacrity which secretly pained her good fosterparents and made susan almost ready to reproach her with ingratitude  they lectured her after the fashion of the time on the need of never forgetting her duty to her god in her affection to her mother susan trusting that she would never let herself be led away to the romish faith and richard warning her strongly against untruth and falsehood though she must be exposed to cruel perplexities as to the right but if thou be true to man thou wilt be true to god he said  if thou be false to man thou wilt soon be false to thy god likewise  we will pray for thee child said susan  do thou pray earnestly for thyself that thou mayest ever see the right  my queen mother is a right pious woman  she is ever praying and reading holy books said cis  mother susan i marvel you who know her can speak thus  nay child i would not lessen thy love and duty to her poor soul but it is not even piety in a mother that can keep a maiden from temptation  i blame not her in warning thee  richard himself escorted the damsel to her new home  there was no preventing their being joined by babington who being well acquainted with the road and being also known as a gentleman of good estate was able to do much to make their journey easy to them and secure good accommodation for them at the inns though mr talbot entirely baffled his attempts to make them his guests and insisted on bearing a full share of the reckoning  neither did cicely fulfil her mothers commission to show herself inclined to accept his attentions  if she had been under contrary orders there would have been some excitement in going as far as she durst but the only effect on her was embarrassment and she treated antony with the same shy stiffness she had shown to humfrey during the earlier part of his residence at home besides she clung more and more to her adopted father who now that they were away from home and he was about to part with her treated her with a tender chivalrous deference most winning in itself and making her feel herself no longer a child  arriving at last at wingfield sir ralf sadler had hardly greeted them before a messenger was sent to summon the young lady to the presence of the queen of scots  her welcome amounted to ecstasy the queen rose from her cushioned invalid chair as the bright young face appeared at the door held out her arms gathered her into them and covering her with kisses called her by all sorts of tender names in french and scottish  o ma mie my lassie ma fille mine ain wee thing how sweet to have one bairn who is mine mine ain whom they have not robbed me of for thy brother ah thy brother he hath forsaken me  he is made of the false darnley stuff and compacted by knox and buchanan and the rest and he will not stand a blast of queen elizabeths wrath for the poor mother that bore him  ay he hath betrayed me and deluded me my child he hath sold me once more to the english loons  i am set faster in prison than ever the iron entereth into my soul  thou art but daughter to a captive queen who looks to thee to be her one bairn one comfort and solace  cicely responded by caresses and indeed felt herself more than ever before the actual daughter as she heard with indignation of jamess desertion of his mothers cause but mary whatever she said herself would not brook to hear her speak severely of him  the poor laddie she said he was no better than a prisoner among those dour scots lords and she described in graphic terms some of her own experiences of royalty in scotland  the other ladies all welcomed the newcomer as the best medicine both to the spirit and body of their queen  she was regularly enrolled among the queens maidens and shared their meals  mary dined and supped alone sixteen dishes being served to her both on fish and flesh days and the reversion of these as well as a provision of their own came to the higher table of her attendants where cicely ranked with the two maries jean kennedy and sir andrew melville there was a second table at which ate the two secretaries mrs curll and elizabeth curll gilberts sister a most faithful attendant on the queen  as before she shared the queens chamber and there it was that mary asked her well mignonne and how fares it with thine ardent suitor  didst say that he rode with thee  as far as the manor gates madam  and what said he  was he very pressing  nay madam i was ever with my fathermr talbot  and he keeps the poor youth at arms length  thine other swain the sailor his son is gone off once more to rob the spaniards is he notso there is the more open field  ay but not till he had taught antony a lesson  the queen made cis tell the story of the encounter at which she was much amused  so my princess even unknown can make hearts beat and swords ring for her  well done thou art worthy to be one of the maids in perceforest or amadis de gaul who are bred in obscurity and set all the knights a sparring together  tourneys are gone out since my poor gudefather perished by mischance at one or we would set thee aloft to be contended for  o madame mere it made me greatly afraid and poor humfrey had to go off without leavetaking my lady countess was so wrathful  so my lady countess is playing our game is she  backing babington and banishing talbot  ha ha and mary again laughed with a merriment that rejoiced the faithful ears of jean kennedy under her bedclothes but somewhat vexed cicely  indeed madam mother she said if i must wed under my degree i had rather it were humfrey than antony babington  i tell thee simple child thou shall wed neither  a woman does not wed every man to whom she gives a smile and a nod  so long as thou bearst the name of this talbot he is a good watchdog to hinder babington from winning thee but if my lady countess choose to send the swain here favoured by her to pay his court to thee why then she gives us the best chance we have had for many a long day of holding intercourse with our friends without and a hope of thee will bind him the more closely  he is all yours heart and soul already madam  i know it child but men are men and no chains are so strong as can be forged by a ladys lip and eye if she do it cunningly  so said my belle mere in france and well do i believe it  why if one of the sourvisaged reformers who haunt this place chanced to have a daughter with sweetness enough to temper the acidity the youth might be throwing up his cap the next hour for queen bess and the reformation unless we can tie him down with a silken cable while he is in the mind  yea madam you who are beautiful and winsome you can do such things i am homely and awkward  mort de ma vie child the beauty of the best of us is in the mans eyes who looks at us  tis true thou hast more of the border lassie than the princess  the likeness of some ewemilking cheesemaking sonsie hepburn hath descended to thee and hath been fostered by country breeding  but thou hast by nature the turn of the neck and the tread that belong to our lorraine blood the blood of charlemagne and now that i have thee altogether see if i train thee not so as to bring out the princess that is in thee and so goodnight my bairnie my sweet child i shall sleep tonight now that i have thy warm fresh young cheek beside mine  thou art life to me my little one     chapter xxii  tutbury   james vi again cruelly tore his mothers heart and dashed her hopes by an unfeeling letter in which he declared her incapable of being treated with since she was a prisoner and deposed  the not unreasonable expectation that his manhood might reverse the proceedings wrought in his name in his infancy was frustrated  mary could no longer believe that he was constrained by a faction but perceived clearly that he merely considered her as a rival whose liberation would endanger his throne and that whatever scruples he might once have entertained had given way to english gold and scottish intimidation  the more simple was i to look for any other in the son of darnley and the pupil of buchanan said she but a mothers heart is slow to give up her trust  and is there now no hope asked cicely  hope child  dum spiro spero  the hope of coming forth honourably to him and to elizabeth is at an end  there is another mode of coming forth she added with a glittering eye a mode which shall make them rue that they have driven patience to extremity  by force of arms  oh madam cried cicely  and wherefore not  my noble kinsman guise is the paramount ruler in france and will soon have crushed the heretics there parma is triumphant in the low countries and has only to tread out the last remnants of faction with his iron boot  they wait only the call which my motherly weakness has delayed to bring their hosts to avenge my wrongs and restore this island to the true faith  then thou child wilt be my heiress  we will give thee to one who will worthily bear the sceptre and make thee blessed at home  the austrians make good husbands i am told  matthias or albert would be a noble mate for thee only thou must be trained to more princely bearing my little homebred lassie  in spitenay perhaps in consequenceof these anticipations an entire change began for cicely  it was as if all the romance of her princely station had died out and the reality had set in  her freedom was at an end  as one of the suite of the queen of scots she was as much a prisoner as the rest whereas before both at buxton and sheffield she had been like a dog or kitten admitted to be petted and played with but living another life elsewhere while now there was nothing to relieve the weariness and monotony of the restraint  nor was the petting what it was at first  mary was far from being in the almost frolicsome mood which had possessed her at buxton her hopes and spirits had sunk to the lowest pitch and though she had an admirably sweet and considerate temper and was scarcely ever fretful or unreasonable with her attendants still depression illness and anxiety could not but tell on her mode of dealing with her surroundings  sometimes she gave way entirely and declared she should waste away and perish in her captivity and that she only brought misery and destruction on all who tried to befriend her or again that she knew that burghley and walsingham were determined to have her blood  it was in these moments that cicely loved her most warmly for caresses and endearments soothed her and the grateful affection which received them would be very sweet  or in a higher tone she would trust that if she were to perish she might be a martyr and confessor for her church though as she owned the sacrifice would be stained by many a sin and she betook herself to the devotions which then touched her daughter more than in any other respect  more often however her indomitable spirit resorted to fresh schemes and chafed fiercely and hotly at thought of her wrongs and this made her the more critical of all that displeased her in cicely  much that had been treated as charming and amusing when cicely was her plaything and her visitor was now treated as unbecoming english rusticity  the princess bride must speak french and italian perhaps latin and the girl whose literary education had stopped short when she ceased to attend master sniggiuss school was made to study her cicero once more with the almoner who was now a french priest named de preaux while queen mary herself heard her read french and though always goodnatured was excruciated by her pronunciation  moreover mary was too admirable a needlewoman not to wish to make her daughter the same whereas cicelys turn had always been for the department of housewifery and she could make a castle in pastry far better than in tapestry but where queen mary had a whole service of cooks and pantlers of her own this accomplishment was uncalled for and was in fact considered undignified  she had to sit still and learn all the embroidery stitches and lacemaking arts brought by mary from the court of france till her eyes grew weary her heart faint and her young limbs ached for the freedom of bridgefield pleasaunce and sheffield park  her mother sometimes saw her weariness and would try to enliven her by setting her to dance but here poor cicelys untaught movements were sure to incur reproof and even if they had been far more satisfactory to the beholders what refreshment were they in comparison with gathering cranberries in the park or holding a basket for ned in the appletree  mrs kennedy made no scruple of scolding her roundly for fretting in a month over what the queen had borne for full eighteen years  ah said poor cicely but she had always been a queen and was used to being mewed up close  and if this was the case at wingfield how much more was it so at tutbury whither mary was removed in january  the space was far smaller and the rooms were cold and damp there was much less outlet the atmosphere was unwholesome and the furniture insufficient  mary was in bed with rheumatism almost from the time of her arrival but she seemed thus to become the more vigilant over her daughter and distressed by her shortcomings  if the queen did not take exercise the suite were not supposed to require any and indeed it was never desired by her elder ladies but to the country maiden it was absolute punishment to be thus shut up day after day neither sir ralf sadler nor his colleague mr somer had brought a wife to share the charge so that there was none of the neutral ground afforded by intercourse with the ladies of the talbot family and at first the only variety cicely ever had was the attendance at chapel on the other side of the court  it was remarkable that mary discouraged all proselytising towards the protestants of her train and even forbore to make any open attempt on her daughters faith cela viendra she said to marie de courcelles the sermons of m le pasteur will do more to convert her to our side than a hundred controversial arguments of our excellent abbe and when the good time comes one high mass will be enough to win her over  alas when shall we ever again assist at the holy sacrifice in all its glory sighed the lady  ah my good courcelles of what have you not deprived yourself for me sacrifice ah truly you share it  but for the child it would give needless offence and difficulty were she to embrace our holy faith at present  she is simple and impetuous and has not yet sufficiently outgrown the rude straightforward breeding of the good housewife madam susan not to rush into open confession of her faith and then oh the fracas  the wicked wolves would have stolen a precious lamb from m le pasteurs fold  master richard would be sent for  our restraint would be the closer  moreover even when the moment of freedom strikes who knows that to find her of their own religion may not win us favour with the english  so from whatever motive cis remained unmolested in her religion save by the weariness of the controversial sermons during which the young lady contrived to abstract her mind pretty completely  if in good spirits she would construct airy castles for her archduke if dispirited she yearned with a homesick feeling for bridgefield and mrs talbot  there was something in the firm sober wisdom and steady kindness of that good lady which inspired a sense of confidence for which no caresses nor brilliant auguries could compensate  weary and cramped she was to the point of having a feverish attack and on one slightly delirious night she fretted piteously after mother and shook off the queens hand entreating that mother real mother would come  mary was much pained and declared that if the child were not better the next day she should have a messenger sent to summon mrs talbot  however she was better in the morning and the queen who had been making strong representations of the unhealthiness and other inconveniences of tutbury received a promise that she should change her abode as soon as chartley a house belonging to the young earl of essex could be prepared for her  the giving away large alms had always been one of her great solacesnot that she was often permitted any personal contact with the poor only to sit at a window watching them as they flocked into the court to be relieved by her servants under supervision from some officer of her warders so as to hinder any surreptitious communication from passing between them  sometimes however the poor would accost her or her suite as she rode out and she had a great compassion for them deprived as she said of the alms of the religious houses and flogged or branded if hunger forced them into beggary  on a fine spring day sir ralf sadler invited the ladies out to a hawking party on the banks of the dove with the little sparrow hawks whose prey was specially larks  pity for the beautiful soaring songster or for the young ones that might be starved in their nests if the parent birds were killed had not then been thought of  a gallop on the moors though they were strangely dull gray and stony was always the best remedy for the queens ailments and the party got into the saddle gaily and joyously followed the chase thinking only of the dexterity and beauty of the flight of pursuer and pursued instead of the deadly terror and cruel death to which they condemned the created creature the very proverb for joyousness  it was during the halt which followed the slaughter of one of the larks and the reclaiming of the hawk that cicely strayed a little away from the rest of the party to gather some golden willow catkins and sprays of white sloe thorn wherewith to adorn a beaupot that might cheer the dull rooms at tutbury  she had jumped down from her pony for the purpose and was culling the branch when from the copsewood that clothed the gorge of the river a ragged woman with a hood tied over her head came forward with outstretched hand asking for alms  yon may have something from the queen anon goody when i can get back to her said cis not much liking the looks or the voice of the woman  and have you nothing to cross the poor womans hand with fair mistress returned the beggar  she brought you fair fortune once how know you but she can bring you more  and cicely recognised the person who had haunted her at sheffield tideswell and buxton and whom she had heard pronounced to be no woman at all  i need no fortune of your bringing she said proudly and trying to get nearer the rest of the party heartily wishing she was on not off her little rough pony  my young lady is proud said her tormentor fixing on her the little pale eyes she so much disliked  she is not one of the maidens who would thank one who can make or mar her life and cast spells that can help her to a princely husband or leave her to a prison  let go said cicely as she saw a retaining hand laid on her ponys bridle i will not be beset thus  and this is your gratitude to her who helped you to lie in a queens bosom ay and who could aid you to rise higher or fall lower  i owe nothing to you said cicely too angry to think of prudence let me go  there was a laugh and not a womans laugh  you owe nothing quoth my mistress  not to one who saw you a drenched babe brought in from the wreck and who gave the sign which has raised you to your present honours  beware  by this time however the conversation had attracted notice and several riders were coming towards them  there was an immediate change of voice from the threatening tone to the beggars whine but the words werei must have my reward ere i speak out  what is this  a masterful beggar wife besetting mistress talbot said mr somer who came first  i had naught to give her said cicely  she should have the lash for thus frightening you said somer yonder lady is too good to such vagabonds and they come about us in swarms  stand back woman or it may be the worse for you  let me help you to your horse mistress cicely  instead of obeying the seeming woman to gain time perhaps began a story of woe and mr somer being anxious to remount the young lady did not immediately stop it so that before cis was in her saddle the queen had ridden up with sir ralf sadler a little behind her  there were thus a few seconds free in which the stranger sprang to the queens bridle and said a few hasty words almost inaudibly and as cis thought in french but they were answered aloud in englishmy good woman i know all that you can tell me and more of this young ladys fortune  here are such alms as are mine to give but hold your peace and quit us now  sir ralf sadler and his soninlaw both looked suspicious at this interview and bade one of the grooms ride after the woman and see what became of her but the fellow soon lost right of her in the broken ground by the riverside  when the party reached home there was an anxious consultation of the inner circle of confidantes over cicelys story  neither she nor the queen had the least doubt that the stranger was cuthbert langston who had been employed as an agent of hers for many years past his insignificant stature and colourless features eminently fitting him for it  no concealment was made now that he was the messenger with the beads and bracelets which were explained to refer to some ivory beads which had been once placed among some spare purchased by the queen and which jean had recognised as part of a rosary belonging to poor alison hepburn the nurse who had carried the babe from lochleven  this had opened the way to the recovery of her daughter mary and sir andrew melville had always held him to be devotedly faithful but there had certainly been something of greed and something of menace in his language which excited anxiety  cicely was sure that his expressions conveyed that he really knew her royal birth and meant to threaten her with the consequences but the few who had known it were absolutely persuaded that this was impossible and believed that he could only surmise that she was of more importance than an archers daughter  he had told the queen in french that he was in great need and expected a reward for his discretion respecting what he had brought her  and when he perceived the danger of being overheard he had changed it into a pleading i did but tell the fair young lady that i could cast a spell that would bring her some good fortune  would her grace hear it  so said mary i could but answer him as i did sadler and somer being both nigh  i gave him my purse with all there was therein how much was it andrew  five golden pieces besides groats and testers madam replied sir andrew  if he come again he must have more if it can be contrived without suspicion said the queen  i fear me he may become troublesome if he guess somewhat and have to be paid to hold his tongue  i dread worse than that said melville apart to jean kennedy there was a scunner in his een that i mislikit as though her grace had offended him  and if the lust of the pennyfee hath possessed him tis but who can bid the highest to have him fast body and soul those lads those lads  ive seen a mony of them  theyll begin for pure love of the queen and of holy church but ye see tis lying and falsehood and disguise that is needed and one way or other they get so in love with it that they come at last to lie to us as well as to the other side and then none kens where to have them cuthbert has been over to that weary paris and once a man goes there he leaves his truth and honour behind him and ye kenna whether he be serving you or queen elizabeth or the deil himsel i wish i could stop that loons thrapple or else wot how much he kens anent our lady bride     chapter xxiii  the love token   yonder woman came to tell this young ladys fortune said sir ralf a few days later  did she guess what i an old man have to bode for her and he smiled at the queen  here is a token i was entreated by a young gentleman to deliver to this young lady with his humble suit that he may pay his devoirs to her tomorrow your grace permitting  i knew not said mary that my women had license to receive visitors  assuredly not as a rule but this young gentleman mr babington of dethick has my lord and lady of shrewsburys special commendation  i knew the young man said mary with perfectly acted heedlessness he was my lady shrewsburys page in his boyhood  i should have no objection to receive him  that madam may not be returned sadler  i am sorry to say it is contrary to the orders of the council but if mr and mrs curll and the fair mistress cicely will do me the honour to dine with me tomorrow in the hall we may bring about the auspicious meeting my lady desires  cicelys first impulse had been to pout and say she wanted none of mr babingtons tokens nor his company but her mothers eye held her back and besides any sort of change of scene or any new face could not but be delightful so there was a certain leap of the young heart when the invitation was accepted for her and she let sir ralf put the token into her hand and a choice one it was  everybody pressed to look at it while she stood blushing coy and unwilling to display the small eggshaped watch of the kind recently invented at nuremberg  sir ralf observed that the young lady showed a comely shamefast maidenliness and therewith bowed himself out of the room  cicely laughed with impatient scorn  well spoken reverend seignior she said as she found herself alone with the queen  i wish my lady countess would leave me alone  i am none of hers  nay mademoiselle be not thus disdainful said the queen in a gay tone of banter give me here this poor token that thou dost so despise when many a maiden would be distraught with delight and gratitude  let me see it i say  and as cicely restraining with difficulty an impatient uncourtly gesture placed the watch in her hand her delicate deft fingers opened the case disregarding both the face and the place for inserting the key but dealing with a spring which revealed that the case was double and that between the two thin plates of silver which formed it was inserted a tiny piece of the thinnest paper written from corner to corner with the smallest characters in cipher  mary laughed joyously and triumphantly as she held it up  there mignonne  what sayest thou to thy token now  this is the first secret news i have had from the outer world since we came to this weary tutbury  and oh the exquisite jest that my lady and sir ralf sadler should be the bearers i always knew some good would come of that suitor of thine  thou must not flout him my fair lady nor scowl at him so with thy beetle brows  it seems but hard to lure him on with false hopes said cicely gravely  hoots lassie as dame jean would say tis but joy and delight to men to be thus tickled  tis the greatest kindness we can do them thus to amuse them said mary drawing up her head with the conscious fascination of the serpent of old nile and toying the while with the ciphered letter in eagerness and yet dread of what it might contain  such things were not easy to make out even to those who had the key and mary unwilling to trust it out of her own hands leant over it spelling it out for many minutes but at last broke forth into a clear ringing burst of girlish laughter and clasped her hands together mignonne mignonne it is too rare a jest to hold back deem not that your highness stands first here  oh no  tis a letter from bernardo de mendoza with a proposition for whose hand thinkest thou  for this poor old captive hand  for mine maiden  ay and from whom  from his excellency the prince of parma lieutenant of the netherlands  anon will he be here with 30000 picked men and the spanish fleet and then i shall ride once again at the head of my brave men hear trumpets bray and see banners fly  we will begin to work our banner at once child and let sir ralf think it is a bedquilt for her sacred majesty elizabeth  thou lookst dismayed little maiden  spanish ships and men madam ah and how would it be with my fathermr and mrs talbot i mean  not a hair of their heads shall be touched child  we will send down a chosen troop to protect them with babington at its head if thou wilt  but added the queen recollecting herself and perceiving that she had startled and even shocked her daughter it is not to be tomorrow nor for many a weary month  all that is here demanded is whether all being well he might look for my hand as his guerdon shall i propose thine instead  o madam he is an old man and full of gout  well we will not pull caps for him just yet  and see thou must be secret as the grave child or thou wilt ruin thy mother  i ought not to have told thee but the surprise was too much for me and thou canst keep a secret  leave me now child and send me monsieur nau  the next time any converse was held between mother and daughter queen mary said  will it grieve thee much my lassie to return this bauble on the plea of thy duty to the good couple at bridgefield  after all cicely had become so fond of the curious and ingenious egg that she was rather sorry to part with it and there was a little dismal resignation in her answer i will do your bidding madam  thou shalt have a better  i will write to chateauneuf for the choicest that paris can furnish said mary but seest thou none other mode is so safe for conveying an answer to this suitor of mine nay little one do not fear  he is not at hand and if he be so goutridden and stern as i have heard we will find some way to content him and make him do the service without giving thee a stepfather even though he be grandson to an emperor  there was something perplexing and distressing to cis in this sudden mood of exultation at such a suitor  however parmas proposal might mean liberty and a recovered throne and who could wonder at the joy that even the faintest gleam of light afforded to one whose captivity had lasted longer than cicelys young lifeand then once more there was an alternation of feeling at the last moment when cicely dressed in her best came to receive instructions  i ken not i ken not said mary speaking the scottish tongue to which she recurred in her moments of deepest feeling i ought not to let it go  i ought to tell the noble prince to have naught to do with a being like me  tis not only the jettatura wherewith the queen mother used to reproach me  men need but bear me good will and misery overtakes them  death is the best that befalls them  the gentle husband of my girlhoodthen the frantic chastelar my poor poor good davie darnley bothwell geordie douglas young willie and again norfolk and the noble and knightly don john  one spark of love and devotion to the wretched mary and all is over with them give me back that paper child and warn babington against ever dreaming of aid to a wretch like me  i will perish alone  it is enough  i will drag down no more generous spirits in the whirlpool around me  madam madam exclaimed de preaux the almoner who was standing this is not like your noble self  have you endured so much to be fainthearted when the end is near and you are made a smooth and polished instrument welded in the fire for the triumph of the church over her enemies  ah father said the queen how should not my heart fail me when i think of the many high spirits who have fallen for my sake  ay and when i look out on yonder peaceful vales and happy homesteads and think of them ravaged by those furious spaniards and italians whom my brother of anjou himself called very fiends  fiends are the tools of divine wrath returned preaux  look at the profaned sanctuaries and outraged convents on which these proud english have waxen fat and say whether a heavy retribution be not due to them  ah father  i may be weak but i never loved persecution  king francis and i were dragged to behold the executions at amboise  that was enough for us  his gentle spirit never recovered it and ii see their contorted visages and forms still in my restless nights and if the spanish dogs should deal with england as with haarlem or antwerp and all through meoh i should be happier dying within these walls  nay madam as queen you would have the reins in your own hand you could exercise what wholesome severity or welltempered leniency you chose urged the almoner it were ill requiting the favour of the saints who have opened this door to you at last to turn aside now in terror at the phantasy that long weariness of spirit hath conjured up before you  so mary rallied herself and in five minutes more was as eager in giving her directions to cicely and to the curlls as though her heart had not recently failed her  cis was to go forth with her chaperons not by any means enjoying the message to babington and yet unable to help being very glad to escape for ever so short a time from the dull prison apartments there might be no great faith in her powers of diplomacy but as it was probable that babington would have more opportunity of conversing with her than with the curlls she was charged to attend heedfully to whatever he might say  sir ralfs soninlaw mr somer was sent to escort the trio to the hall at the hour of noon and there pacing the ample chamber while the board at the upper end was being laid were sir ralf sadler and his guest mr babington  antony was dressed in green velvet slashed with primrose satin setting off his good mien to the greatest advantage and he came up with suppressed but rapturous eagerness bowing low to mrs curll and the secretary but falling on his knee to kiss the hand of the darkbrowed girl  her recent courtly training made her much less rustically awkward than she would have been a few months before but she was extremely stiff and held her head as though her ruff were buckram as she began her lesson  sir i am greatly beholden to you for this token but if it be not sent with the knowledge and consent of my honoured father and mother i may not accept of it  alas that you will say so fair mistress said antony but he was probably prepared for this rejection for he did not seem utterly overwhelmed by it  the young lady exercises a wise discretion said sir ralf sadler to mrs curll if i had known that mine old friend mr talbot of bridgefield was unfavourable to the suit i would not have harboured the young spark but when he brought my lady countesss commendation i thought all was well  barbara curll had her cue namely to occupy sir ralf so as to leave the young people to themselves so she drew him off to tell him in confidence a long and not particularly veracious story of the objections of the talbots to antony babington whilst her husband engaged the attention of mr somer and there was a space in which as antony took back the watch he was able to inquire was the eggshell opened  ay said cis blushing furiously and against her will the egg was sucked and replenished  take consolation said antony and as some one came near them duty and discretion shall i trust both be satisfied when i next sun myself in the light of those lovely eyes  then as the coast became more clear you are about shortly to move  chartley is preparing for you  so we are told  there are others preparing said antony bending over her holding her hand and apparently making love to her with all his might tell me lady who hath charge of the queens buttery  is it faithful old halbert as at sheffield  it is replied cis  then let him look well at the bottom of each barrel of beer supplied for the use of her household  there is an honest man a brewer at burton whom paulett will employ who will provide that letters be sent to and fro  gifford and langston who are both of these parts know him well  cis started at the name  do you trust langston then she asked  wholly  why he is the keenest and ablest of all  have you not seen him and had speech with him in many strange shapes  he can change his voice and whine like any beggar wife  yea said cis but the queen and sir andrew doubted a little if he meant not threats last time we met  all put onexcellent dissembling to beguile the keepers  he told me all said antony and how he had to scare thee and change tone suddenly  why he it is who laid this same egg and will receive it there is a sworn band as you know already who will let her know our plans and be at her commands through that means  then when we have done service approaching to be worthy of her then it may be that i shall have earned at least a look or sign  alas sir said cicely how can i give you false hopes  for her honest heart burnt to tell the poor fellow that she would in case of his success be farther removed from him than ever  what would be false now shall be true then  i will wring love from thee by my deeds for her whom we both alike love and then wilt thou be mine own my true bride  by this time other guests had arrived and the dinner was ready babington was in deference to the countess allowed to sit next to his ladylove  she found he had been at sheffield and had visited bridgefield vainly endeavouring to obtain sanction to his addresses from her adopted parents  he saw how her eyes brightened and heard how her voice quivered with eagerness to hear of what still seemed home to her and he was pleased to feel himself gratifying her by telling her how mrs talbot looked and how brown dumpling had been turned out in the park and mr talbot had taken a new horse which ned had insisted on calling fulvius from its colour for ned was such a scholar that he was to be sent to study at cambridge  then he would have wandered off to little lady arbells being put under master sniggiuss tuition but cicely would bring him back to bridgefield and to neds brothers  no the boasted expedition to spain had not begun yet  sir francis drake was lingering about plymouth digging a ditch it was said to bring water from dartmoor  he would never get license to attack king philip on his own shores  the queen knew better than to give it humfrey and diccon would get no better sport than robbing a ship or two on the way to the netherlands  antony for his part could not see that piracy on the high seas was fit work for a gentleman  a gentleman loves to serve his queen and country in all places said cicely  ah said antony with a long breath as though making a discovery sits the wind in that quarter  antony exclaimed she in her eagerness calling him by the familiar name of childhood you are in error  i declare most solemnly that it is quite another matter that stands in your way  and you will not tell me wherefore you are thus cruel  i cannot sir  you will understand in time that what you call cruelty is true kindness  this was the gist of the interview  all the rest only repeated it in one form or another and when cis returned it was with a saddened heart for she could not but perceive that antony was wellnigh crazed not so much with love of her as with the contemplation of the wrongs of the church and the queen whom he regarded with equally passionate devotion and with burning zeal and indignation to avenge their sufferings and restore them to their pristine glory  he did indeed love her as he professed to have done from infancy but as if she were to be his own personal portion of the reward  indeed there was magnanimity enough in the youth almost to lose the individual hope in the dazzle of the great victory for which he was willing to devote his own life and happiness in the true spirit of a crusader  cicely did not fully or consciously realise all this but she had such a glimpse of it as to give her a guilty feeling in concealing from him the whole truth which would have shown how fallacious were the hopes that her mother did not scruple for her own purposes to encourage  poor cicely she had not had royal training enough to look on all subjects as simply pawns on the monarchs chessboard and she was so evidently unhappy over babingtons courtship and so little disposed to enjoy her first feminine triumph that the queen declared that nature had designed her for the convent she had so narrowly missed and valuable as was the intelligence she had brought she was never trusted with the contents of the correspondence  on the removal of mary to chartley the barrel with the false bottom came into use but the secretaries nau and curll alone knew in full what was there conveyed  little more was said to cicely of babington  however it was a relief when before the end of this summer cicely heard of his marriage to a young lady selected by the earl  she hoped it would make him forget his dangerous inclination to herself but yet there was a little lurking vanity which believed that it had been rather a marriage for propertys than for loves sake     chapter xxiv  a lioness at bay   it was in the middle of the summer of 1586 that humfrey and his young brother richard in broad grass hats and long feathers found themselves again in london diccon looking considerably taller and leaner than when he went away  for when after many months delay the naval expedition had taken place he had been laid low with fever during the attack on florida by sir francis drakes little fleet and the return to england had been only just in time to save his life though humfrey had set forth merely as a lieutenant he had returned in command of a vessel and stood in high repute for good discipline readiness of resource and personal exploits  his ship had however suffered so severely as to be scarcely seaworthy when the fleet arrived in plymouth harbour and sir francis finding it necessary to put her into dock and dismiss her crew had chosen the young captain talbot to ride to london with his despatches to her majesty  the commission might well delight the brothers who were burning to hear of home and to know how it fared with cicely having been absolutely without intelligence ever since they had sailed from plymouth in january since which they had plundered the spaniard both at home and in the west indies but had had no letters  they rode post into london taking their last change of horses at kensington on a fine june evening when the sun was mounting high upon the steeple of st pauls and speeding through the fields in hopes of being able to reach the strand in time for supper at lord shrewsburys mansion which even in the absence of my lord was always a harbour for all of the name of talbot  nor indeed was it safe to be out after dark for the neighbourhood of the city was full of roisterers of all sorts if not of highwaymen and cutpurses who might come in numbers too large even for the two young gentlemen and the two servants who remained out of the four volunteers from bridgefield  they were just passing westminster where the abbey hall and st stephens chapel and their precincts stood up in their venerable but unstained beauty among the fields and fine trees and some of the westminster boys flatcapped gowned and yellowstockinged ran out with the cry that always flattered diccon not to say humfrey though he tried to be superior to it mariners mariners from the western main  hurrah for gallant drake  down with the don  for the tokens of the sea in the form of clothes and weapons were well known and highly esteemed  two or three gentlemen who were walking along the road turned and looked up and the young sailors recognised in a moment a home face there was an exclamation on either side of antony babington and humfrey talbot and a ready clasp of the hand in right of old companionship  welcome home exclaimed antony  is all well with you  royally well returned humfrey  knowst thou aught of our father and mother  all was well with them when last i heard said antony  and cismy sister i mean said diccon putting in his unconsciousness the very question humfrey was burning to ask  she is still with the queen of scots at chartley replied babington  chartley where is that  it is a new place for her captivity  tis a house of my lord of essex not far from lichfield returned antony  they sent her thither this spring after they had wellnigh slain her with the damp and wretched lodgings they provided at tutbury  who  not our cis asked diccon  nay said antony it hurt not her vigorous youthbut i meant the longsuffering princess  hath sir ralf sadler still the charge of her inquired humfrey  no indeed  he was too gentle a jailer for the council  they have given her sir amias paulett a mere puritan and leicestrian who is as hard as the nether millstone and wellnigh as dull said babington with a little significant chuckle which perhaps alarmed one of his companions a small slight man with a slight halt clad in black like a lawyer  mr babington he said pardon me for interrupting you but we shall make mr gage tarry supper for us  nay mr langston said babington who was in high spirits these are kinsmen of your own sons of mr richard talbot of bridgefield to whom you have often told me you were akin  mr langston was thus compelled to come forward shake hands with the young travellers welcome them home and desire to be commended to their worthy parents and babington in the exuberance of his welcome named his other two companionsmr tichborne a fine handsome graceful and somewhat melancholy young man captain fortescue a bearded moustached bravo in the height of the fashion a long plume in his spanish hat and his short gray cloak glittering with silver lace humfrey returned their salute but was as glad as they evidently were when they got babington away with them and left the brothers to pursue their way after inviting them to come and see him at his lodgings as early as possible  it is before supper said diccon sagely or i should say master antony had been acquainted with some good canary  more likely he is uplifted with some fancy of his own  it may be only with the meeting of me after our encounter said humfrey  he is a brave fellow and kindly but never did craft so want ballast as does that pate of his  humfrey said his brother riding nearer to him did he not call that fellow in black langston  ay cuthbert langston  i have heard of him  no good comrade for his weak brain  humfrey it is so though father would not credit me  i knew his halt and his eyejust like the venomous little snake that was the death of poor foster  he is the same with the witch woman tibbott ay and with her with the beads and bracelets who beset cis and me at buxton  young diccon had proved himself on the voyage to have an unerring eye for recognition and his brother gave a low whistle  i fear me then master antony may be running himself into trouble  see they turn in mounting the steps to the upper fence of yonder house with the deep carved balcony  another has joined them  i like not his looks  he is like one of those hardened cavaliers from the netherlands  ay who seem to have left pity and conscience behind them there said humfrey looking anxiously up at the fine old gabled house with its projecting timbered front and doubting inwardly whether it would be wise to act on his old playfellows invitation yet with an almost sick longing to know on what terms the youth stood with cicely  in another quarter of an hour they were at the gateway of shrewsbury house where the porter proved to be one of the sheffield retainers and admitted them joyfully  my lord earl was in yorkshire he said but my lord and lady talbot were at home and would be fain to see them and there too was master william cavendish  they were handed on into the courtyard where servants ran to take their horses and as the news ran that master richards sons had arrived from the indies will cavendish came running down the hall steps to embrace them in his glee while lord talbot came to the door of the hall to welcome them  these great london houses which had not quite lost their names of hostels or inns did really serve as free lodgings to all members of the family who might visit town and above all such travellers as these bringing news of grand national achievements  very soon after gilberts accession to the heirship quarrels had begun between his wife and her mother the countess  lord talbot had much of his fathers stately grace and his wife was a finished lady  they heartily welcomed the two lads who had grown from boys to men  my lady smilingly excused the ridinggear and as soon as the dust of travel had been removed they were seated at the board and called on to tell of the gallant deeds in which they had taken part whilst they heard in exchange of lord leicesters doings in the netherlands and the splendid exploits of the stanleys at zutphen  lord talbot promised to take humfrey to richmond the next day to be presented to her majesty so soon as he should be equipped so as not to lose his character of mariner but still not to affront her sensibilities by aught of uncourtly or unstudied in his apparel  they confirmed what babington had said of the queen of scots changes of residence and of keepers  as to cicely they had been lately so little at sheffield that they had almost forgotten her but they thought that if she were still at chartley there could be no objection to her brothers having an interview with her on their way home if they chose to go out of their road for it  humfrey mentioned his meeting with babington in westminster and lord talbot made some inquiries as to his companions adding that there were strange stories and suspicions afloat and that he feared that the young man was disaffected and was consorting with popish recusants diccons tongue was on the alert with his observation but at a sign from his brother who did not wish to get babington into trouble he was silent  cavendish however laughed and said he was for ever in mr secretarys house and even had a room there  very early the next morning the body servant of his lordship was in attendance with a barber and the fashionable tailor of the court and in good time humfrey and diccon were arrayed in such garments as were judged to suit the queens taste and to become the character of young mariners from the west  humfrey had a dainty jewel of shellwork from the spoils of carthagena entrusted to him by drake to present to the queen as a foretaste of what was to come  lady talbot greatly admired its novelty and beauty and thought the queen would be enchanted with it giving him a pretty little perfumed box to present it in  lord talbot well pleased to introduce his spirited young cousins took them in his boat to richmond which they reached just as the evening coolness came on  they were told that her majesty was walking in the park and thither so soon as the ruffs had been adjusted and the fresh spanish gloves drawn on they resorted  the queen walked freely there without guardswithout even swords being worn by the gentlemen in attendanceloving as she did to display her confidence in her people  no precautions were taken but they were allowed to gather together on the greensward to watch her as among the beautiful shady trees she paced along  the eyes of the two youths were eagerly directed towards her as they followed lord talbot  was she not indeed the cynosure of all the realm  did she not hold the heart of every loyal englishman by an invisible rein  was not her favour their dream and their reward she was a little in advance of her suite  her hair of that light sandy tint which is slow to whiten was built up in curls under a rich stiff coif covered with silver lace and lifted high at the temples  from this a light gauze veil hung round her shoulders and over her splendid standing ruff which stood up like the erected neck ornaments of some birds opening in front and showing the lesser ruff or frill encircling her throat and terminating a lace tucker within her lowcut boddice  rich necklaces the jewel of the garter and a whole constellation of brilliants decorated her bosom and the boddice of her blue satin dress and its sleeves were laced with seed pearls  the waist a very slender one was encircled with a gold cord and heavy tassels the farthingale spread out its magnificent proportions and a richly embroidered white satin petticoat showed itself in front but did not conceal the active wellshaped feet there was something extraordinarily majestic in her whole bearing especially the poise of her head which made the spectator never perceive how small her stature actually was  her face and complexion too were of the cast on which time is slow to make an impression being always pale and fair with keen and delicatelycut features so that her admirers had quite as much reason to be dazzled as when she was half her present age nay perhaps more for the habit of command had added to the regality which really was her principal beauty  sir christopher hatton with a handsome but very small face at the top of a very tall and portly frame dressed in the extreme of foppery came behind her and then a bevy of ladies and gentlemen  as the talbots approached she was moving slowly on unusually erect even for her and her face composed to severe majesty like that of a judge the tawny eyes with a strange gleam in them fixed on some one in the throng on the grass near at hand  lord talbot advanced with a bow so low that he swept the ground with his plume and while the two youths followed his example diccons quick eye noted that she glanced for one rapid second at their weapons then continued her steady gaze never withdrawing it even to receive lord talbots salutation as he knelt before her though she said we greet you well my good lord are not we well guarded not having one man with a sword near me  here are three good swords madam returned he mine own and those of my two young kinsmen whom i venture to present to your majesty as they bear greetings from your trusty servant sir francis drake  while he spoke there had been a byplay unperceived by him or by the somewhat slow and tardy hatton  a touch from diccon had made humfrey follow the direction of the queens eye and they saw it was fixed on a figure in a loose cloak strangely resembling that which they had seen on the stair of the house babington had entered  they also saw a certain quailing and cowering of the form and a scowl on the shaggy red eyebrows and irish features and humfrey at once edged himself so as to come between the fellow and the queen though he was ready to expect a pistol shot in his back but better thus was his thought than that it should strike herand both laid their hands on their swords  how now said hatton young men you are over prompt  her majesty needs no swords  you are out of rank  fall in and do your obeisance  something in the queens relaxed gaze told humfrey that the peril was over and that he might kneel as talbot named him explaining his lineage as elizabeth always wished to have done  a sort of tremor passed over her but she instantly recalled her attention  from drake she said in her clear somewhat shrill voice  so young gentleman you have been with the pirate who outruns our orders and fills our brother of spain with malice such that he would have our life by fair or foul means  that shall he never do while your grace has english watchdogs to guard you returned talbot  the talbot is a trusty hound by water or by land said elizabeth surveying the goodly proportion of the elder brother  whelps of a good litter though yonder lad be somewhat long and lean  well and how fares sir francis  let him make his will for the spaniards one day will have his blood  i have letters and a token from him for your grace said humfrey  come then in said the queen  we will see it in the bower and hear what thou wouldst say  a bower or small summerhouse stood at the end of the path and here she took her way seating herself on a kind of rustic throne evidently intended for her and there receiving from humfrey the letter and the gift and asking some questions about the voyage but she seemed preoccupied and anxious and did not show the enthusiastic approbation of her sailors exploits which the young men expected after glancing over it she bade them carry the letter to mr secretary walsingham the next day nor did she bid the party remain to supper but as soon as half a dozen of her gentlemen pensioners who had been summoned by her orders came up she rose to return to the palace     chapter xxv  pauls walk   will cavendish who was in training for a statesman and acted as a secretary to sir francis walsingham advised that the letters should be carried to him at once that same evening as he would be in attendance on the queen the next morning and she would inquire for them  the great mans house was not far off and he walked thither with humfrey who told him what he had seen and asked whether it ought not at once to be reported to walsingham  will whistled  they are driving it very close he said  humfrey old comrade thy brains were always more of the order fit to face a tough breeze than to meddle with court plots  credit me there is cause for what amazed thee  the queen and her council know what they are about  risk a little and put an end to all the plottings for ever  thats the word  risk even the queens life  will cavendish looked sapient and replied we of the council board know many a thing that looks passing strange  mr secretary walsinghams town house was like lord talbots built round a court across which cavendish led the way with the assured air of one used to the service and at home there  the hall was thronged with people waiting but cavendish passed it opened a little wicket and admitted his friends into a small anteroom where he bade them remain while he announced them to sir francis  he disappeared shutting a door behind him and after a moments interval another person with a brown cloak round him came hastily and stealthily across to the door  he had let down the cloak which muffled his chin not expecting the presence of any one and there was a moments start as he was conscious of the young men standing there  he passed through the door instantly but not before humfrey had had time to recognise in him no other than cuthbert langston almost the last person he would have looked for at sir francis walsinghams  directly afterwards cavendish returned  sir francis could not see captain talbot and prayed him to excuse him and send in the letter  it cant be helped said cavendish with his youthful airs of patronage  he would gladly have spoken with you when i told him of you but that maude is just come on business that may not tarry  so you must een entrust your packet to me  maude repeated humfrey was that mans name maude  i should have dared be sworn that he was my fathers kinsman cuthbert langston  very like said will i would dare be sworn to nothing concerning him but that he is one of the greatest and most useful villains unhung  so saying will cavendish disappeared with the letters  he probably had had a caution administered to him for when he returned he was evidently swelling with the consciousness of a state secret which he would not on any account betray yet of the existence of which he desired to make his old comrade aware  humfrey asked whether he had told mr secretary of the man in richmond park  never fear he knows it returned the budding statesman  why look you a man like sir francis has ten thousand means of intelligence that a simple mariner like you would never guess at  i thought it strange myself when i came first into business of state but he hath eyes and ears everywhere like the queens gown in her picture  men of the privy council you see must despise none for the lewdest and meanest rogues oft prove those who can do the best service just as the bandylegged cur will turn the spit or unearth the fox when your gallant hound can do nought but bay outside  is this maude or langston such a cur  cavendish gave his head a shake that expressed unutterable things saying your kinsman said you  i trust not on the talbot side of the house  no  on his mothers side  i wondered the more to see him here as he got that halt in the rising of the north and on the wrong side and hath ever been reckoned a concealed papist  ay ay  dost not see mine honest humfrey thats the very point that fits him for our purpose  you mean that he is a double traitor and informer  we do not use such hard words in the privy council board as you do on deck my good friend said cavendish  we have our secret intelligencers you see all in the queens service  foul and dirty work but you cant dig out a fox without soiling of fingers and if there be those that take kindly to the work why een let them do it  then there is a plot  content you humfrey  youll hear enough of it anon  a most foul bloody and horrible plot quite enough to hang every soul that has meddled in it and yet safe to do no harmlike poor hals blunderbuss which would never go off except when it burst and blew him to pieces  will felt that he had said quite enough to impress humfrey with a sense of his statecraft and importance and was not sorry for an interruption before he should have said anything dangerous  it was from frank pierrepoint who had been diccons schoolmate and was enchanted to see him  humfrey was to stay one day longer in town in case walsingham should wish to see him and to show diccon something of london which they had missed on their way to plymouth  st pauls cathedral was even then the sight that all englishmen were expected to have seen and the brothers took their way thither accompanied by frank pierrepoint who took their guidance on his hands had the lads seen the place at the opening of the century they would have thought it a piteous spectacle for desecration and sacrilege had rioted there unchecked the magnificent peal of bells had been gambled away at a single throw of the dice the library had been utterly destroyed the magnificent plate melted up and what covetous fanaticism had spared had been further ravaged by a terrible fire  at this time bishop bancroft had done his utmost towards reparation and the old spire had been replaced by a wooden one but there was much of ruin and decay visible all around where stood the famous octagon building called pauls cross where outdoor sermons were preached to listeners of all ranks  this was of wood and was kept in moderately good repair  beyond the nave of the cathedral stretched its length the greatest in england  two sets of doors immediately opposite to one another on the north and south sides had rendered it a thoroughfare in very early times in spite of the endeavours of the clergy and at this time duke humfreys walk from the tomb of duke humfrey stafford as the twelve grand norman bays of this unrivalled nave were called was the prime place for the humours of london and it may be feared that this rather than the architecture was the chief idea in the minds of the youths as a babel of strange sounds fell on their ears a still roar like a humming of bees as it was described by a contemporary or as humfrey said like the sea in a great hollow cave  a cluster of choirboys were watching at the door to fall on any one entering with spurs on to levy their spur money and one gentleman whom they had thus attacked was endeavouring to save his purse by calling on the youngest boy to sing his gamut  near at hand was a pillar round which stood a set of men some rough some knavishlooking with the blue coats badges short swords and bucklers carried by servingmen  they were waiting to be hired as if in a statute fair and two or three loudvoiced bargains were going on in the middle aisle gentlemen in all the glory of plumed hats jewelled ears ruffed necks spanish cloaks silken jerkins velvet hose and berosed shoes were marching up and down some attitudinising to show their graces some discussing the news of the day for pauls walk was the bond street the row the tattersalls the club of london  twelve scriveners had their tables to act as letterwriters and sometimes as legal advisers and great amusement might be had by those who chose to stand listening to the blundering directions of their clients  in the side aisles horsedealing merchants exchanges everything imaginable in the way of traffic was going on  disreputablelooking men who there were in sanctuary from their creditors there lurked around humfrey staffords tomb and young pierrepoints warning to guard their purses was evidently not wasted for a country fellow who had just lost his was loudly demanding justice and getting jeered at for his simplicity in expecting to recover it  seest thou this said a voice close to humfrey and he found a hand on his arm and babington in the handsome equipment of one of the loungers close to him  a sorry sight that would grieve my good mother returned humfrey  my mother the church is grieved responded antony  this is what you have brought us to for your socalled religion he added ignorant or oblivious that these desecrations had been quite as shocking before the reformation  all will soon be changed however he added  sir thomas greshams new exchange has cleared off some of the traffic they say returned humfrey  pshaw said antony i meant no such folly  that were cleansing one stone while the whole house is foul with shame  no  there shall be a swift vengeance on these desecrators  the purifier shall come again and the glory and the beauty of the true faith shall be here as of old when our fathers bowed before the holy rood instead of tearing it down  his eye glanced with an enthusiasm which humfrey thought somewhat wild and he said whist these are not things to be thus spoken of  all is safe said babington drawing him within shelter of the chantry of sir john beauchamps tomb  never heed dicconpierrepoint can guide him and humfrey saw their figures apparently absorbed in listening to the bidding for a horse  i have things of moment to say to thee humfrey talbot  we have been old comrades and had that childish emulation which turns to love in manhood in the face of perils  humfrey recollecting how they had parted held out his hand in recognition of the friendliness  i would fain save thee said babington  heretic and rival as thou art i cannot but love thee and i would have thee die if die thou must in honourable fight by sea or land rather than be overtaken by the doom that will fall on all who are persecuting our true and lawful confessor and sovereign  gramercy for thy good will tony said humfrey looking anxiously to see whether his old companion was in his right mind yet remembering what had been said of plots  thou deemst me raving said antony smiling at the perplexed countenance before him but thou wilt see too late that i speak sooth when the armies of the church avenge the name that has been profaned among you  the spaniards i suppose you mean said humfrey coolly  you must be far gone indeed to hope to see those fiends turned loose on this peaceful land but by gods blessing we have kept them aloof before i trust we may again  you talk of gods blessing  look at his house said babington  he is more like to bless honest men who fight for their queen their homes and hearths than traitors who would bring in slaughterers and butchers to work their will  his glory is worked through judgment and thus must it begin returned the young man  but i would save thee humfrey he added go thou back to plymouth and be warned to hold aloof from that prison where the keepers will meet their fit doom and the captive will be set free  thou dost not believe he added  see here and drawing into the most sheltered part of the chantry he produced from his bosom a picture in the miniature style of the period containing six heads among which his own was plainly to be recognised and likewise a face which humfrey felt as if he should never forget that which he had seen in richmond park quailing beneath the queens eye round the picture was the motto            hi mihi sunt comites quos ipsa pericula jungunt   i tell thee humfrey thou wilt hearif thou dost live to hearof these six as having wrought the greatest deed of our times  may it only be a deed an honest man need not be ashamed of said humfrey not at all convinced of his friends sanity  ashamed of exclaimed babington  it is blest i tell thee blest by holy men blest by the noble and suffering woman who will thus be delivered from her martyrdom  babington if thou talkest thus it will be my duty to have thee put in ward said humfrey  antony laughed and there was a triumphant ring very like insanity in his laughter  humfrey with a moments idea that to hint that the conspiracy was known would blast it at once if it were real said i see not cuthbert langston among your six  know you i saw him only yestereven going into secretary walsinghams privy chamber  was he so answered babington  ha ha he holds them all in play till the great stroke be struck  why am not i myself in walsinghams confidence  he thinketh that he is about to send me to france to watch the league  ha ha  here humfreys other companions turned back in search of him babington vanished in the crowd he hardly knew how and he was left in perplexity and extreme difficulty as to what was his duty as friend or as subject  if babington were sane there must be a conspiracy for killing the queen bringing in the spaniards and liberating mary and he had expressly spoken of having had the latter ladys sanction while the sight of the fellow in richmond park gave a colour of probability to the guess  yet the imprudence and absurdity of having portraits taken of six assassins before the blow was struck seemed to contradict all the rest  on the other hand cavendish had spoken of having all the meshes of the web in the hands of the council and langston or maude seemed to be trusted by both parties  humfrey decided to feel his way with will cavendish and that evening spoke of having met babington and having serious doubts whether he were in his right mind  cavendish laughed poor wretch  i could pity him he said though his plans be wicked enough to merit no compassion  nay never fear humfrey  all were overthrown did i speak openly  nay to utter one word would ruin me for ever  tis quite sufficient to say that he and his fellows are only at large till mr secretary sees fit that so his grip may be the more sure  humfrey saw he was to be treated with no confidence and this made him the more free to act  there were many recusant gentlemen in the neighbourhood of chartley and an assault and fight there were not improbable if as cavendish hinted there was a purpose of letting the traitors implicate themselves in the largest numbers and as fatally as possible  on the other hand babingtons hot head might only fancy he had authority from the queen for his projects  if through cicely he could convey the information to mary it might save her from even appearing to be cognisant of these wild schemes whatever they might be and to hint that they were known was the surest way to prevent their taking effect  any way humfreys heart was at chartley and every warning he had received made him doubly anxious to be there in person to be cicelys guardian in case of whatever danger might threaten her  he blessed the fiction which still represented him as her brother and which must open a way for him to see her but he resolved not to take diccon thither and parted with him when the roads diverged towards lichfield sending to his father a letter which diccon was to deliver only into his own hand with full details of all he had seen and heard and his motives for repairing to chartley  shall i see my little cis thought he  and even if she play the princess to me how will she meet me  she scorned me even when she was at home  how will it be now when she has been for wellnigh a year in this queens training  ah she will be taught to despise me heigh ho at least she may be in need of a true heart and strong arm to guard her and they shall not fail her  will cavendish in the plenitude of the official importance with which he liked to dazzle his old playfellow had offered him a pass to facilitate his entrance and he found reason to be glad that he had accepted it for there was a guard at the gate of chartley park and he was detained there while his letter was sent up for inspection to sir amias paulett who had for the last few months acted as warder to the queen  however a friendly message came back inviting him to ride up  the housethough called a castlehad been rebuilt in hospitable domestic style and looked much less like a prison than sheffield lodge but at every enclosure stood yeomen who challenged the passersby as though this were a time of alarm  however at the halldoor itself stood sir amias paulett a thin narrowbrowed anxiouslooking man with the stiffest of ruffs over which hung a scanty yellow beard  welcome sir he said with a nervous anxious distressed manner welcome most welcome  you will pardon any discourtesy sir but these are evil times  the son i think of good master richard talbot of bridgefield  ay i would not for worlds have shown any lack of hospitality to one of his family  it is no want of respect sir  no nor of my lords house but these are ill days and with my charge sirif heaven itself keep not the housewho knows what may chance or what may be laid on me  i understand said humfrey smiling  i was bred close to sheffield and hardly knew what twas to live beyond watch and ward  yea said paulett shaking his head  you come of a loyal house sir but even the good earl was less exercised than i am in the charge of this same lady  but i am glad glad to see you sir  and you would see your sister sir  a modest young lady and not indevout though i have sometimes seen her sleep at sermon  it is well that the poor maiden should see some one well affected for she sitteth in the very gate of babylon and with respect sir i marvel that a woman so godly as mistress talbot of bridgefield is reported to be should suffer it however i do my poor best under heaven to hinder the faithful of the household from being tainted  i have removed preaux who is well known to be a popish priest in disguise and thus he can spread no more of his errors  moreover my chaplain master blunden with other godly men preaches three times a week against romish errors and all are enforced to attend  may their ears be opened to the truth  i am about to attend this lady on a ride in the park sir  it mightif she be willingbe arranged that your sister mistress talbot should spend the time in your company and methinks the lady will thereto agree for she is ever ready to show a certain carnal and worldly complaisance to the wishes of her attendants and i have observed that she greatly affects the damsel more i fear than may be for the eternal welfare of the maidens soul     chapter xxvi  in the web   it was a beautiful bright summer day and queen mary and some of her train were preparing for their ride  the queen was in high spirits and that wonderful and changeful countenance of hers was beaming with anticipation and hope while her demeanour was altogether delightful to every one who approached her  she was adding some last instructions to nau who was writing a letter for her to the french ambassador and cicely stood by her holding her little dog in a leash and looking somewhat anxious and wistful  there was more going on round the girl than she was allowed to understand and it made her anxious and uneasy she knew that the correspondence through the brewer was actively carried on but she was not informed of what passed  only she was aware that some crisis must be expected for her mother was ceaselessly restless and full of expectation  she had put all her jewels and valuables into as small a compass as possible and talked more than ever of her plans for giving her daughter either to the archduke matthias or to some great noble as if the english crown were already within her grasp anxious curious and feeling injured by the want of confidence yet not daring to complain cicely felt almost fretful at her mothers buoyancy but she had been taught a good many lessons in the past year and one of them was that she might indeed be caressed but that she must show neither humour nor will of her own and the least presumption in inquiry or criticism was promptly quashed  there was a knock at the door and the usher announced that sir amias paulett prayed to speak with her grace  her eye glanced round with the rapid emotion of one doubtful whether it were for weal or woe yet with undaunted spirit to meet either and as she granted her permission cis heard her whisper to nau a rider came up even now tis the tidings are the catholics of derby in the saddle  are the ships on the coast  in came the tall old man with a stiff reverence madam your graces horses attend you and i have tidingsmary started forwardtidings for this young lady mistress cicely talbot  her brother is arrived from the spanish main and requests permission to see and speak with her  radiance flashed out on cicelys countenance as excitement faded on that of her mother humfrey  o madam let me go to him she entreated with a spring of joy and clasped hands  mary was far too kindhearted to refuse besides to have done so would have excited suspicion at a perilous moment and the arrangement sir amias proposed was quickly made  mary seaton was to attend the queen in cicelys stead and she was allowed to hurry downstairs and only one warning was possible  go then poor child take thine holiday only bear in mind what and who thou art  yet the words had scarce died on her ears before she was oblivious of all save that it was a familial home figure who stood at the bottom of the stairs one of the faces she trusted most in all the world which beamed out upon her the hands which she knew would guard her through everything were stretched out to her the lips with veritable love in them kissed the cheeks she did not withhold  sir amias stood by and gave the kindest smile she had seen from him quite changing his pinched features and he proposed to the two young people to go and walk in the garden together letting them out into the square walled garden very formal but very bright and gay and with a pleached alley to shelter them from the sun  good old gentleman exclaimed humfrey holding the maidens hand in his  it is a shame to win such pleasure by feigning  as for that sighed cis i never know what is sooth here and what am i save a living lie myself  o humfrey i am so weary of it all  ah i would that i could bear thee home with me he said little prepared for this reception  would that thou couldst  o that i were indeed thy sister or that the writing in my swaddling bands had been washed outnay catching back her words i meant not that  i would not but belong to the dear lady here  she says i comfort her more than any of them and oh she isshe is there is no telling how sweet and how noble it was only that the sight of thee awoke the yearning to be at home with mother and with father  forget my folly humfrey  i cannot soon forget that bridgefield seems to thee thy true home he said putting strong restraint on himself to say and do no more while his heart throbbed with a violence unawakened by storm or spaniard  tell me of them all she said  i have heard naught of them since we left tutbury where at least we were in my lords house and the dear old silver dog was on every sleeve  ah there he is the trusty rogue  and snatching up humfreys hat which was fastened with a brooch of his crest in the fashion of the day she kissed the familiar token then however she blushed and drew herself up remembering the caution not to forget who she was and with an assumption of more formal dignity she said and how fares it with the good mrs talbot  well when i last heard said humfrey but i have not been at home i only know what will cavendish and my lord talbot told me  i sent diccon on to bridgefield and came out of the way to see you lady he concluded with the same regard to actual circumstances that she had shown  oh that was good she whispered and they both seemed to feel a certain safety in avoiding personal subjects  humfrey had the history of his voyage to narrateto tell of little diccons gallant doings and to exalt sir francis drakes skill and bravery and at last to let it ooze out under ciss eager questioning that when his captain had died of fever on the hispaniola coast and they had been overtaken by a tornado sir francis had declared that it was humfreys skill and steadfastness which had saved the ship and crew  and it was that tornado he said which stemmed the fever and saved little diccons life  oh when he lay moaning below then was the time to long for my mother  time sped on till the great hall clock made cicely look up and say she feared that the riders would soon return and then humfrey knew that he must make sure to speak the words of warning he came to utter  he told in haste of his message to queen elizabeth and of his being sent on to secretary walsingham adding but i saw not the great man for he was closetedwith whom think you   no other than cuthbert langston whom cavendish called by another name  it amazed me the more because i had two days before met him in westminster with antony babington who presented him to me by his own name  saw you antony babington asked cis raising her eyes to his face but looking uneasy  twice at westminster and again in pauls walk  had you seen him since you have been here  not here but at tutbury  he came once and i was invited to dine in the hall because he brought recommendations from the countess there was a pause and then as if she had begun to take in the import of humfreys words she added what said you  that mr langston was going between him and mr secretary  not exactly that and humfrey repeated with more detail what he had seen of langston forbearing to ask any questions which cicely might not be able to answer with honour but they had been too much together in childhood not to catch one anothers meaning with half a hint and she said i see why you came here humfrey  it was good and true and kind befitting you  i will tell the queen  if langston be in it there is sure to be treachery  but indeed i know nothing or wellnigh nothing  i am glad of it fervently exclaimed humfrey  no i only know that she has high hopes and thinks that the term of her captivity is wellnigh over  but it is madame de courcelles whom she trusts not me said cicely a little hurt  so is it much better for thee to know as little as possible said humfrey growing intimate in tone again in spite of himself  she hath not changed thee much cis only thou art more grave and womanly ay and thou art taller yea and thinner and paler as i fear me thou mayest well be  ah humfrey tis a poor joy to be a princess in prison  and yet i shame me that i long to be away  oh no i would not  mistress seaton and mrs curll and the rest might be free yet they have borne this durance patiently all these yearsand i thinki think she loves me a little and oh she is hardly used  humfrey what thinkst thou that mr langston meant  i wot now for certain that it was he who twice came to beset us as tibbott the huckster and with the beads and bracelets  they all deem him a true friend to my queen  so doth babington said humfrey curtly  ah she said with a little terrified sound of conviction then added what thought you of master babington  that he is halfcrazed said humfrey  we may say no more said cis seeing a servant advancing from the house to tell her that the riders were returning  shall i see you again humfrey  if sir amias should invite me to lie here tonight and remain tomorrow since it will be sunday  at least i shall see you in the morning ere you depart she said as with unwilling yet prompt steps she returned to the house humfrey feeling that she was indeed his little cis yet that some change had come over her not so much altering her as developing the capabilities he had always seen  for herself poor child her feelings were in a strange turmoil more than usually conscious of that dual existence which had tormented her ever since she had been made aware of her true birth  moreover she had a sense of impending danger and evil and by force of contrast the frank openhearted manner of humfrey made her the more sensible of being kept in the dark as to serious matters while outwardly made a pet and plaything by her mother just like bijou as she said to herself  so little one said queen mary as she returned thou hast been revelling once more in tidings of sheffield  how long will it take me to polish away the dulness of thy clownish contact  humphrey does not come from home madam but from london  madam let me tell you in your ear  marys eye instantly took the terrified alert expression which had come from many a shock and alarm  what is it child she asked however in a voice of affected merriment  i wager it is that he has found his true cis  nay whisper it to me if it touch thy silly little heart so deeply  cicely knelt down the queen bending over her while she murmured in her ear he saw cuthbert langston by a feigned name admitted to mr secretary walsinghams privy chamber  she felt the violent start this information caused but the command of voice and countenance was perfect  what of that mignonne she said  what knoweth he of this langston as thou callest him  he is mynohis fathers kinsman madam and is known to be but a plotter  oh surely he is not in your secrets madam my mother after that day at tutbury  alack my lassie gifford or babington answered for him said the queen and he kens more than i could desire  but this humfrey of thine  how came he to blunder out such tidings to thee  it was no blunder madam  he came here of purpose  sure exclaimed mary it were too good to hope that he hath become well affected  hea sailor of drakes a son of master richard hath babington won him over or is it for thy sake child  for i bestowed no pains to cast smiles to him at sheffield even had he come in my way  i think madam said cicely that he is too loyalhearted to bear the sight of treachery without a word of warning  is he so  then he is the first of his nation who hath been of such a mind  nay mignonne deny not thy conquest  this is thy work  i deny not thatthat i am beloved by humfrey said cicely for i have known it all my life but that goes for naught in what he deems it right to do  there spoke so truly mistress susans scholar that thou makest me laugh in spite of myself and all the rest  hold him fast my maiden think what thou wilt of his service and leave me now and send melville and curll to me  cicely went away full of that undefined discomfort experienced by generous young spirits when their elders more worldlywise or foolish fail even to comprehend the purity or loftiness of motive which they themselves thoroughly believe  yet though she had infinitely more faith in humfreys affection than she had in that of babington she had not by any means the same dread of being used to bait the hook for him partly because she knew his integrity too well to expect to shake it and partly because he was perfectly aware of her real birth and could not be gulled with such delusive hopes as poor antony might once have been  humfrey meantime was made very welcome by sir amias paulett who insisted on his spending the next day sunday at chartley and made him understand that he was absolutely welcome as having a strong arm stout heart and clear brain used to command  trusty aid do i need said poor sir amias if ever man lacked an arm of flesh  the council is putting more on me than ever man had to bear in an open place like this hard to be defended and they will not increase the guard lest they should give the alarm forsooth  what is it that you apprehend inquired humfrey  theres enough to apprehend when all the hotheaded papists of stafford and derbyshire are waiting the signal to fire the outhouses and carry off this lady under cover of the confusion  mr secretary swears they will not stir till the signal be given and that it never will but such sort of fellows are like enough to mistake the sign and the stress may come through their dillydallying to make all sure as they say and then if there be any mischance i shall be the one to bear the blame  ay if it be their own work he added speaking to himself murder under trust  that would serve as an answer to foreign princes and my head would have to pay for it however welcome it might be  so good mr talbot supposing any alarm should arise keep you close to the person of this lady for there be those who would make the fray a colour for taking her life under pretext of hindering her from being carried off  it was no wonder that a warder in such circumstances looked harassed and perplexed and showed himself glad of being joined by any ally whom he could trust  in truth harsh and narrow as he was paulett was too good and religious a man for the task that had been thrust on him where loyal obedience sense of expediency and even religious fanaticism were all in opposition to the primary principles of truth mercy and honour  he was besides in constant anxiety living as he did between plot and counterplot and with the certainty that emissaries of the council surrounded him who would have no scruple in taking marys life and leaving him to bear the blame when elizabeth would have to explain the deed to the other sovereigns of europe  he disclosed almost all this to humfrey whose frank trustworthy expression seemed to move him to unusual confidence  at suppertime another person appeared whom humfrey thought he had once seen at sheffielda thin yellowhaired and bearded man much marked with smallpox in the black dress of a lawyer who sat above the household servants though below the salt  paulett once drank to him with a certain air of patronage calling him master phillipps a name that came as a revelation to humfrey  phillipps was the decipherer who had he knew been employed to interpret queen marys letters after the norfolk plot  were there then fresh letters of that unfortunate lady in his hands or were any to be searched for and captured     chapter xxvii  the castle well     what vantage or what thing   gettst thou thus for to sting     thou false and flattring liar   thy tongue doth hurt its seen   no less than arrows keen     or hot consuming fire   so sang the congregation in the chapel at chartley in the strains of sternhold and hopkins while humfrey talbot could not forbear from a misgiving whether these falsehoods were entirely on the side to which they were thus liberally attributed  opposite to him stood cicely in her dainty sunday farthingale of white embroidered with violet buds and a green and violet boddice to match holding herself with that unconscious royal bearing which had always distinguished her but with an expression of care and anxiety drawing her dark brows nearer together as she bent over her book  she knew that her mother had left her bed with the earliest peep of summer dawn and had met the two secretaries in her cabinet  there they were busy for hours and she had only returned to her bed just as the household began to bestir itself  my child she said to cicely i am about to put my life into thy keeping and that of this talbot lad  if what he saith of this langston be sooth i am again betrayed fool that i was to expect aught else my life is spent in being betrayed  the fellow hath been a gobetween in all that hath passed between babington and me if he hath uttered it to walsingham all is over with our hopes and the window in whose sunlight i have been basking is closed for ever but something may yet be saved  something  what do i saythe letters i hold here would give colour for taking my life ay and babingtons and curlls and many more  i trusted to have burnt them but in this summer time there is no coming by fire or candle without suspicion and if i tore them they might be pieced together nay and with addition  they must be carried forth and made away with beyond the ken of paulett and his spies  now this lad hath some bowels of compassion and generous indignation  thou wilt see him again alone and unsuspected ere he departs  thou must deal with him to bear this packet away and when he is far out of reach to drop it into the most glowing fire or the deepest pool he can find tell him it may concern thy life and liberty and he will do it but be not simple enough to say ought of babington  he would be as like to do it for babington as for any other said cis  the queen smiled and said nineteen years old and know thus little of men  i know humfrey at least said cis  then deal with him after thy best knowledge to make him convey away this perilous matter ere a search come upon us  do it we must maiden not for thy poor mothers sake alone but for that of many a faithful spirit outside and above all of poor curll  think of our barbara would that i could have sent her out of reach of our alarms and shocks but paulett is bent on penning us together like silly birds in the net still proofs will be wanting if thou canst get this youth to destroy this packet unseen  tell him that i know his parents son too well to offer him any meed save the prayers and blessings of a poor captive or to fear that he would yield it for the largest reward elizabeths coffers could yield  it shall be done madam said cicely  but there was a strong purpose in her mind that humfrey should not be implicated in the matter  when after dinner sir amias paulett made his daily visit of inspection to the queen she begged that the young talbots might be permitted another walk in the garden and when he replied that he did not approve of worldly pastime on the sabbath she pleaded the celebrated example of john knox finding calvin playing at bowls on a sunday afternoon at geneva and thus absolutely prevailed on him to let them take a short walk together in brotherly love while the rest of the household was collected in the hall to be catechised by the chaplain  so out they went together but to humfreys surprise cicely walked on hardly speaking to him so that he fancied at first that she must have had a lecture on her demeanour to him  she took him along the broad terrace beside the bowlinggreen through some yewtree walks to a stone wall and a gate which proved to be locked  she looked much disappointed but scanning the wall with her eye said we have scaled walls together before now and higher than this  humfrey i cannot tell you why but i must go over here  the wall was overgrown with stout branches of ivy and though the sunday farthingale was not very appropriate for climbing cicelys active feet and humfreys strong arm carried her safely to where she could jump down on the other side into a sort of wilderness where thorn and apple trees grew among green mounds heaps of stones and broken walls the ruins of some old outbuilding of the former castle there was only a certain trembling eagerness about her none of the mirthful exultation that the recurrence of such an escapade with her old companion would naturally have excited and all she said was stand here humfrey an you love me follow me not  i will return anon  with stealthy stop she disappeared behind a mound covered by a thicket of brambles but humfrey was much too anxious for her safety not to move quietly onwards  he saw her kneeling by one of those black yawning holes often to be found in ruins intent upon fastening a small packet to a stone he understood all in a moment and drew back far enough to secure that no one molested her  there was something in this reticence of hers that touched him greatly it showed so entirely that she had learnt the lesson of loyalty which his fathers influence had impressed and likewise one of selfdependence  what was right for her to do for her mother and queen might not be right for him as an englishman to aid and abet and small as the deed seemed in itself her thus silently taking it on herself rather than perplex him with it added a certain esteem and respect to the affection he had always had for her  she came back to him with bounding steps as if with a lightened heart and as he asked her what this strange place was she explained that here were said to be the ruins of the former castle and that beyond lay the ground where sometimes the party shot at the butts  a little dog of mary seatons had been lost the last time of their archery and it was feared that he had fallen down the old well to which cis now conducted humfrey  there was a soundlong hollow reverberating when humfrey threw a stone down and when cecily asked him in an awestruck voice whether he thought anything thrown there would ever be heard of more he could well say that he believed not  she breathed freely but they were out of bounds and had to scramble back which they did undetected and with much more mirth than the first time  cicely was young enough to be glad to throw off her anxieties and forget them  she did not want to talk over the plots she only guessed at which were not to her exciting mysteries but gloomy terrors into which she feared to look  nor was she free to say much to humfrey of what she knew  indeed the rebound and the satisfaction of having fulfilled her commission had raised cicelys spirits so that she was altogether the bright childish companion humfrey had known her before he went to sea or royalty had revealed itself to her and sir amias paulett would hardly have thought them solemn and serious enough for an edifying sunday talk could he have heard them laughing over humfreys adventures on board ship or her troubles in learning to dance in a high and disposed manner  she came in so glowing and happy that the queen smiled and sighed and called her her little milkmaid commending her highly however for having disposed of the dangerous parcel unknown as she believed to her companion  the fewer who have to keep counsel the sickerer it is she said  humfrey meantime joined the rest of the household and comported himself at the evening sermon with such exemplary discretion as entirely to win the heart of sir amias paulett who thought him listening to mr blundens oftdivided headings while he was in fact revolving on what pretext he could remain to protect cicely  the knight gave him that pretext when he spoke of departing early on monday morning offering him or rather praying him to accept the command of the guards whose former captain had been dismissed as untrustworthy  sir amias undertook that a special messenger should be sent to take a letter to bridgefield explaining humfreys delay and asking permission from his parents to undertake the charge since it was at this very crisis that he was especially in need of godfearing men of full integrity  then moved to confidence the old gentleman disclosed that not only was he in fear of an attack on the house from the roman catholic gentry in the neighbourhood which was to take place as soon as parmas ships were seen on the coast but that he dreaded his own servants being tampered with by some whom he would not mention to take the life of the prisoner secretly  it hath been mooted to me he said lowering his voice to a whisper that to take such a deed on me would be good service to the queen and to religion but i cast the thought from me  it can be nought but a deadly sinaccursed of godand were i to consent i should be the first to be accused  it would be no better than the king of spain himself exclaimed humfrey  even so young man and right glad am i to find one who thinks with me  for the other practices they are none of mine and is it not written in the same pit which they laid privily is their foot taken  then there are other practices  ask me no questions mr talbot  all will be known soon enough  be content that i will lay nothing on you inconsistent with the honour of a christian man knowing that you will serve the queen faithfully  humfrey gave his word resolving that he would warn cicely to reckon henceforth on nothing on his part that did not befit a man in charge     chapter xxviii  hunting down the deer   humfrey had been sworn in of the service of the queen and had been put in charge of the guard mustered at chartley for about ten days during which he seldom saw cicely and wondered much not to have heard from home when a staghunt was arranged to take place at the neighbouring park of tickhill or tixall belonging to sir walter ashton  the chase always invigorated queen mary and she came down in cheerful spirits with cicely and mary seaton as her attendants and with the two secretaries nau and curll heading the other attendants  now she said to cicely shall i see this swain or this brother of thine who hath done us such good service and i promise you there will be more in my greeting than will meet sir amiass ear  but to cicelys disappointment humfrey was not among the horsemen mustered at the door to attend and guard the queen  my little maids eye is seeking for her brother said mary as sir amias advanced to assist her to her horse  he hath another charge which will keep him at home replied paulett somewhat gruffly and they rode on  it was a beautiful day in early august the trees in full foliage the fields seen here and there through them assuming their amber harvest tints the twin spires of lichfield rising in the distance the park and forest ground through which the little huntingparty rode rich with purple heather illuminated here and there with a bright yellow spike or star and the rapid motion of her brisk palfrey animated the queen she began to hope that humfrey had after all brought a false alarm and that either he had been mistaken or that langston was deceiving the council itself and though sir amias pauletts close proximity held her silent those who knew her best saw that her indomitably buoyant spirits were rising and she hummed to herself the refrain of a gay french huntingsong with the more zest perhaps that her warder held himself trebly upright stiff and solemn under it as one who thought such lively times equally unbefitting a lady a queen and a captive so at least cis imagined as she watched them little guessing that there might be deeper reasons of compassion and something like compunction to add to the gravity of the old knights face  as they came in sight of the gate of tickhill park they became aware of a company whose steel caps and shouldered arquebuses did not look like those of huntsmen  mary bounded in her saddle she looked round at her little suite with a glance of exultation in her eye which said as plainly as words my brave friends the hour has come and she quickened her steed expecting no doubt that she might have to outride sir amias in order to join them  one gentleman came forward from the rest  he held a parchment in his hand and as soon as he was alongside of the queen thus read  mary late queen of scots and queen dowager of france i thomas gorges attaint thee of high treason and of compassing the life of our most gracious majesty queen elizabeth in company with antony babington john ballard chidiock tichborne robert barnwell and others  mary held up her hands and raised her eyes to heaven and a protest was on her lips but gorges cut it short with it skills not denying it madam  the proofs are in our hands  i have orders to conduct you to tickhill while seals are put on your effects  that there may be proofs of your own making said the queen with dignity  i have experience of that mode of judgment  so sir amias paulett the chase you lured me to was truly of a poor hunted doe whom you think you have run down at last  a worthy chase indeed and of long continuance  i do but obey my orders madam said paulett gloomily  oh ay and so does the sleuthhound said mary  your grace must be pleased to ride on with me said mr gorges laying his hand on her bridle  what are you doing with those gentlemen cried mary sharply reining in her horse as she saw nau and curll surrounded by the armed men  they will be dealt with after her majestys pleasure returned paulett  mary dropped her rein and threw up her hands with a gesture of despair but as gorges was leading her away she turned on her saddle and raised her voice to call out farewell my true and faithful servants betide what may your mistress will remember you in her prayers curll we will take care of your wife  and she waved her hand to them as they were made with a strong guard to ride off in the direction of lichfield  all the way to tickhill whither she was conducted with gorges and paulett on either side of her horse cis could hear her pleading for consideration for poor barbara curll for whose sake she forgot her own dignity and became a suppliant  sir walter ashton a dull heavylooking country gentleman of burly form and ruddy countenance stood at his door and somewhat clownishly offered his services to hand her from her horse  she submitted passively till she had reached the upper chamber which had been prepared for her and there turning on the three gentlemen demanded the meaning of this treatment  you will soon know madam said paulett  i am sorry that thus it should be  thus repeated mary scornfully  what means this  it means madam said gorges a ruder man of less feeling even than paulett that your practices with recusants and seminary priests have been detected  the traitors are in the counter and will shortly be brought to judgment for the evil purposes which have been frustrated by the mercy of heaven  it is well if treason against my good sisters person have been detected and frustrated said mary but how doth that concern me  that madam the papers at chartley will show returned gorges meantime you will remain here till her majestys pleasure be known  where then are my women and my servants inquired the queen  your grace will be attended by the servants of sir walter ashton  gentlemen this is not seemly said mary the colour coming hotly into her face  i know it is not the will of my cousin the queen of england that i should remain here without any woman to attend me nor any change of garments  you are exceeding your commission and she shall hear of it  sir amias paulett here laid his hand on gorges arm and after exchanging a few words with him said  madam this young lady mistress talbot being simple and of a loyal house may remain with you for the present  for the rest seals are put on all your effects at chartley and nothing can be removed from thence but what is needful will be supplied by my lady ashton  i bid your grace farewell craving your pardon for what may have been hasty in this  mary stood in the centre of the floor full of her own peculiar injured dignity not answering but making a low ironical reverence mary seaton fell on her knees clung to the queens dress and declared that while she lived she would not leave her mistress  endure this also ma mie said the queen in french  give them no excuse for using violence  they would not scruple and as a demonstration to hinder frenchspeaking was made by the gentlemen fear not for me i shall not be alone  i understand your grace and obey said mary seaton rising with a certain bitterness in her tone which made mary say ah why must jealousy mar the fondest affection  remember it is their choice not mine my seaton friend of my youth  bear my loving greetings to all and take care of poor barbara  madam there must be no private messages said paulett  i send no messages save what you yourself may hear sir replied the queen  my greetings to my faithful servants and my entreaty that all care and tenderness may be shown to mrs curll  i will bear them madam said the knight and so i commend you to gods keeping praying that he may send you repentance  believe me madam i am sorry that this has been put upon me  to this mary only replied by a gesture of dismissal  the three gentlemen drew back a key grated in the lock and the mother and daughter were left alone  to cicely it was a terrible hopeless sound and even to her mother it was a lower depth of wretchedness  she had been practically a captive for nearly twenty years  she had been insulted watched guarded coerced but never in this manner locked up before  she clasped her hands together dropped on her knees at the table that stood by her and hid her face  so she continued till she was roused by the sound of cicelys sobs  frightened and oppressed and new to all terror and sorrow the girl had followed her example in kneeling but the very attempt to pray brought on a fit of weeping and the endeavour to restrain what might disturb the queen only rendered the sobs more choking and strangling till at last mary heard and coming towards her sat down on the floor gathered her into her arms and kissing her forehead said poor bairnie and did she weep for her mother  have the sorrows of her house come on her  o mother i could not help it  i meant to have comforted you said cicely between her sobs  and so thou dost my child  unwittingly they have left me that which was most precious to me  there was consolation in the fondness of the loving embrace at least to such sorrows as those of the maiden and queen mary had an inalienable power of charming the will and affections of those in contact with her so that insensibly there came into cicelys heart a sense that so far from weeping she should rejoice at being the one creature left to console her mother  and she said by and by looking up with a smile they must go to the bottom of the old well to find anything  hush lassie  never speak above thy breath in a prison till thou knowst whether walls have ears  and apropos let us examine what sort of a prison they have given us this time  so saying mary rose and leaning on her daughters arm proceeded to explore her new abode  like her apartment at the lodge it was at the top of the house a fashion not uncommon when it was desirable to make the lower regions defensible but whereas she had always hitherto been placed in the castles of the highest nobility she was now in that of a country knight of no great wealth or refinement and moreover taken by surprise  so the plenishing was of the simplest  the walls were covered with tapestry so faded that the pattern could hardly be detected  the hearth yawned dark and dull and by it stood one chair with a motheaten cushion  a heavy oaken table and two forms were in the middle of the room and there was the dreary fusty smell of want of habitation  the queen whose instincts for fresh air were always a distress to her ladies sprang to the mullioned window but the heavy lattice defied all her efforts  let us see the rest of our dominions she said turning to a door which led to a still more gloomy bedroom where the only articles of furniture were a great carved bed with curtains of some undefined dark colour and an oaken chest  the window was a mere slit and even more impracticable than that of the outer room  however this did not seem to horrify mary so much as it did her daughter  they cannot mean to keep us here long she said perhaps only for the day while they make their searchtheir unsuccessful searchthanks towe know whom little one  i hope so  how could we sleep there said cicely looking with a shudder at the bed  tush  i have seen worse in scotland mignonne ay and when i was welcomed as liege lady not as a captive  i have slept in a box like a coffin with one side open and i have likewise slept on a plaidie on the braw purple blossoms of freshly pulled heather  nay the very thought makes this chamber doubly mouldy and stifling  let the old knight beware  if he open not his window i shall break it  soft here he comes  sir walter ashton appeared louting low looking halfdogged halfsheepish and escorting two heavyfooted bluecoated servingmen who proceeded to lay the cloth which at least had the merit of being perfectly clean and white  two more brought in covered silver dishes one of which contained a yorkshire pudding the other a piece of roastbeef apparently calculated to satisfy five hungry men  a flagon of sack a tankard of ale a dish of apples and a large loaf of bread completed the meal at which the queen and cicely accustomed daily to a first table of sixteen dishes and a second of nine compounded by her graces own french cooks and pantlers looked with a certain amused dismay as sir walter standing by the table produced a dagger from a sheath at his belt and took up with it first a mouthful of the pudding then cut off a corner of the beef finished off some of the bread and having swallowed these as well as a draught of each of the liquors said good and sound meats not tampered with as i hereby testify  you take us suddenly madam but i thank heaven none ever found us unprovided  will it please you to fall to  your woman can eat after you  marys courtesy was unfailing and though she felt all a frenchwomans disgust at the roastbeef of old england she said we are too close companions not to eat together and i fear she will be the best trencher comrade for sir i am a woman sick and sorrowful and have little stomach for meat  as sir walter carved a huge red piece from the ribs she could not help shrinking back from it so that he said with some affront you need not be queasy madam it was cut from a homefed bullock only killed three days since and as prime a beast as any in stafford  ah yea sir  it is not the fault of the beef but of my feebleness mistress talbot will do it reason  but i methinks i could eat better were the windows opened  but sir walter replied that these windows were not of the newfangled sort made to open that honest men might get rheums and foolish maids prate therefrom  so there was no hope in that direction  he really seemed to be less ungracious than utterly clownish dull and untaught and extremely shy and embarrassed with his prisoner  cicely poured out some wine and persuaded her to dip some bread in which with an apple was all she could taste  however the fare though less nicely served than by good mrs susan was not so alien to cicely and she was of an age and constitution to be made hungry by anxiety and trouble so thatencouraged by the queen whenever she would have desistedshe ended by demolishing a reasonable amount  sir walter stood all the time looking on moodily and stolidly with his cap in his hand  the queen tried to talk to him and make inquiries of him but he had probably steeled himself to her blandishments for nothing but gruff monosyllables could be extracted from him except when he finally asked what she would be pleased to have for supper  mine own cook and pantler have hitherto provided for me  they would save your household the charge sir said mary and i would be at charges for them  madam i can bear the charge in the queens service  your black guard are under ward  and if not no french jackanapes shall ever brew his messes in my kitchen   command honest english fare madam and if it be within my compass you shall have it  no one shall be stinted in walter ashtons house but ill not away with any of your outlandish kickshaws  come what say you to eggs and bacon madam  as you will sir replied mary listlessly  and sir walter opening the door shouted to his servingman who speedily removed the meal he going last and making his clumsy reverence at the door which he locked behind him  so said mary i descend  i have had the statesman the earl the courtly knight the pedantic huguenot for my warders  now am i come to the clown  soon will it be the dungeon and the headsman  o dear madam mother speak not thus cried cicely  remember they can find nothing against you  they can make what they cannot find my poor child  if they thirst for my blood it will cost them little to forge a plea  ah lassie there have been times when nothing but my cousin elizabeths conscience or her pity stood between me and doom  if she be brought to think that i have compassed her death why then there is naught for it but to lay my head on the same pillow as norfolk and more and holy fisher and many another beside  well be it so  i shall die a martyr for the holy church and thus may i atone by gods mercy for my many sins  yea i offer myself a sacrifice she said folding her hands and looking upward with a light on her face  o do thou accept it and let my sufferings purge away my many misdeeds and render it a pure and acceptable offering unto thee  child child she added turning to cicely would that thou wert of my faith then couldst thou pray for me  o mother mother i can do that  i do pray for thee  and hand in hand with tears often rising they knelt while mary repeated in broken voice the miserere     chapter xxix  the search   humfrey had been much disappointed when instead of joining the hunt sir amias paulett bade him undertake the instruction of half a dozen extremely awkward peasants who had been called in to increase the guard but who did not know how to shoulder load or fire an arquebus had no command of their own limbs and if put to stand sentry would quite innocently loll in the nearest corner and go to sleep  however he reflected that if he were resident in the same house as cicely he could not expect opportunities to be daily made for their meeting and he addressed himself with all his might to the endeavour to teach his awkward squad to stand upright for five minutes together  sturdy fellows as they were he had not been able to hinder them from lopping over in all directions when horses were heard approaching  every man of them regardless of discipline lumbered off to stare and humfrey after shouting at them in vain and wishing he had them all on board ship gave up the endeavour to recall them and followed their example repairing to the halldoor when he found sir amias paulett dismounting together with a clerklylooking personage attended by will cavendish  mary seaton was being assisted from her horse evidently in great grief and others of the personal attendants of mary were there but neither herself cicely nor the secretaries  before he had time to ask questions his old companion came up to him you here still humfrey  well  you have come in for the outburst of the train you scented out when you were with us in london though i could not then speak explicitly  what mean you  where is cicely  where is the queen of scots asked humfrey anxiously  sir amias paulett heard him and replied your sister is safe master talbot and with the queen of scots at tixall castle  we permitted her attendance as being young simple and loyal she is less like to serve for plots than her elders in that ladys service  sir annas strode on conducting with him his guest whom cavendish explained to be mr wade sworn by her majestys council to take possession of queen marys effects and there make search for evidence of the conspiracy  cavendish followed and humfrey took leave to do the same  the doors of the queens apartment were opened at the summons of sir amias paulett and sir andrew melville mistress kennedy marie de courcelles and the rest stood anxiously demanding what was become of their queen  they were briefly and harshly told that her foul and abominable plots and conspiracies against the life of the queen and the peace of the kingdom had been brought to light and that she was under secure ward  jean kennedy demanded to be taken to her at once but paulett replied that must not be madam  we have strict commands to keep her secluded from all  marie de courcelles screamed aloud and wrung her hands crying if ye have slain her only tell us quickly  sir andrew melville gravely protested against such a barbarous insult to a queen of scotland and france and was answered no queen sir but a state criminal as we shall presently show  here barbara curll pressed forward asking wildly for her husband and wade replying with brutal brevity that he was taken to london to be examined for his practices before the council the poor lady well knowing that examination often meant torture fell back in a swoon  we shall do nothing with all these women crying and standing about said wade impatiently have them all away while we put seals on the effects  nay sirs said jean kennedy  suffer me first to send her grace some changes of garments  i tell thee woman said wade our orders are precise  not so much as a kerchief is to be taken from these chambers till search hath been made  we know what practices may lurk in the smallest rag  it is barbarous  it is atrocious  the king of france shall hear of it shrieked marie de courcelles  the king of france has enough to do to take care of himself my good lady returned wade with a sneer  sir said jean kennedy with more dignity turning to sir amias paulett i cannot believe that it can be by the orders of the queen of england herself a woman that my mistress her cousin should be deprived of all attendance and even of a change of linen  such unseemly commands can never have been issued from herself  she is not without attendance replied the knight the little talbot wench is with her and for the rest sir walter and lady ashton have orders to supply her needs during her stay among them she is treated with all honour and is lodged in the best chambers he added consolingly  we must dally no longer called out wade  have away all this throng into ward sir amias  we can do nothing with them here  there was no help for it  sir andrew melville did indeed pause to enter his protest but that of course went for nothing with the commissioners and humfrey was ordered to conduct them to the upper gallery there to await further orders  it was a long passage in the highly pointed roof with small chambers on either side which could be used when there was a press of guests  there was a steep stair as the only access and it could be easily guarded so sir amias directed humfrey to post a couple of men at the foot and to visit and relieve them from time to time  it was a sad procession that climbed up those narrow stairs of those faithful followers who were separated from their queen for the first time  the servants of lower rank were merely watched in their kitchen and not allowed to go beyond its courtyard but were permitted to cook for and wait on the others and bring them such needful furniture as was required  humfrey was very sorry for them having had some acquaintance with them all his life and he was dismayed to find himself instead of watching over cicely separated from her and made a jailer against his will and when he returned to the queens apartments he found cavendish holding a taper while paulett and wade were vigorously affixing cords fastened at each end by huge red seals bearing the royal arms to every receptacle and rudely plucking back the curtains that veiled the ivory crucifix  sir amiass zeal would have plucked down the idol as he said but wade restrained him by reminding him that all injury or damage was forbidden  not till all was sealed and a guard had been stationed at the doors would the commissioners taste any dinner and then their conversation was brief and guarded so that humfrey could discover little  he did indeed catch the name of babington in connection with the counter prison and a glance of inquiry to cavendish with a nod in return showed him that his suspicions were correct but he learnt little or nothing more till the two together with phillipps drew together in the deep window with wine apples and pears on the ledge before them for a private discussion  humfrey went away to see that the sentries at the staircase were relieved and to secure that a sufficient meal for the unfortunate captives in the upper stories had been allowed to pass  will cavendish went with him  he had known these ladies and gentlemen far more intimately than humfrey had done and allowed that it was harsh measure that they suffered for their fidelity to their native sovereign  no harm will come to them in the end he said but what can we do that very faithfulness would lead them to traverse our purposes did we not shut them up closely out of reach of meddling and there is no other place where it can be done  and what are these same purposes asked humfrey as having fulfilled his commission the two young men strolled out into the garden and threw themselves on the grass close to a large mulberrytree whose luscious fruit dropped round and hung within easy reach  to trace out all the coils of as villainous and bloodthirsty a plot as ever was hatched in a traitors brain said will but they little knew that we overlooked their designs the whole time  thou wast mystified in london honest humfrey i saw it plainly but i might not then speak out he added with all his official selfimportance  and poor tony hath brought himself within compass of the law  verily you may say so  but tony babington always was a fool and a wrongheaded fool who was sure to ruin himself sooner or later  you remember the decoy for the wildfowl  well never was silly duck or goose so ready to swim into the nets as was he  he always loved this queen yea and the old faith  he sucked in the poison with his mothers milk you may say  mrs babington was naught but a concealed papist and coming from her it cost nothing to this queen to beguile him when he was a mere lad and make him do her errands as you know full well  then what must my lord earl do but send him to that bitter puritan at cambridge who turned him all the more that way out of very contradiction  my lord thought him cured of his popish inclinations and never guessed they had only led him among those who taught him to dissemble  and that not over well said humfrey  my father never trusted him  and would not give him your sister  yea but the counterfeit was good enough for my lord who sees nothing but what is before his nose and for my mother who sees nothing but what she will see  well he had fallen in with those who deem this same mary our only lawful queen and would fain set her on the throne to bring back fire and faggot by the spanish sword among us  i deemed him wellnigh demented with brooding over her troubles and those of his church  demented in verity  his folly was surpassing  he put his faith in a recusant priestone john ballardwho goes ruffling about as captain fortescue in velvet hose and a silverlaced cloak  ha  hast seen him  ay in company with babington on the day i came to london passing through westminster  very like  their chief place of meeting was at a house at westminster belonging to a fellow named gage  we took some of them there  well this ballard teaches poor antony by way of gospel truth that tis the mere duty of a good catholic to slay the enemies of the church and that he who kills our gracious queen whom god defend will do the holiest deed just as they gulled the fellow who murdered the prince of orange and then died in torments deeming himself a holy martyr  but it was not babington whom i saw at richmond  hold i am coming to that  let me tell you the queen bore it in mind and asked after you  well babington has a number of friends as hotbrained and fanatical as himself and when once he had swallowed the notion of privily murdering the queen he got so enamoured of it that he swore in five more to aid him in the enterprise and then what must they do but have all their portraits taken in one picture with a latin motto around them  what  thou hast seen it  he showed it to me in pauls walk and said i should hear of them and i thought one of them marvellously like the fellow i had seen in richmond park  so thought her majesty  but more of that anon  on the selfsame day as the queen was to be slain by these sacrilegious wretches another band was to fall on this place free the lady and proclaim her while the prince of parma landed from the netherlands and brought fire and sword with him  and antony would have brought this upon us said humfrey still slow to believe it of his old comrade  all for the true religions sake said cavendish  they were ringing bells and giving thanks for the discovery and baffling thereof when we came down from london  as well they might said humfrey  but how was it detected and overthrown  was it through langston  ah ha we had had the strings in our hands all along  why langston as thou namest him though we call him maude and a master spy called gifford have kept us warned thoroughly of every stage in the business maude even contrived to borrow the picture under colour of getting it blessed by the popes agent and lent it to mr secretary walsingham by whom it was privily shown to the queen thereby she recognised the rogue barnwell an irishman it seems when she was walking in the park at richmond with only her women and sir christopher hatton who is better at dancing than at fighting  not a sign did she give but she kept him in check with her royal eye so that he durst not so much as draw his pistol from his cloak but she owned afterwards to my lady norris that she could have kissed you when you came between and all the more when you caught her meaning and followed her bidding silently  you will hear of it again humps  however that may be it is a noble thing to have seen such courage in a woman and a queen  but how could they let it go so near  i could shudder now to think of the risk to her person  there goes more to policy than you yet wot of said will in his patronising tone  in truth barnwell had started off unknown to his comrades hoping to have the glory of the achievement all to himself by forestalling them or else mr secretary would have been warned in time to secure the queen  but wherefore leave these traitors at large to work mischief  see you not you simple humfrey that as i said methinks some time since it is well sometimes to give a rogue rope enough and he will hang himself  close the trap too soon and you miss the biggest rat of all  so we waited until the prey seemed shy and about to escape babington had it seems suspected maude or langston or whatever you call him and had ridden out of town hiding in st johns wood with some of his fellows till they were starved out and trying to creep into some outbuildings at harrow were there taken and brought into london the morning we came away  ballard the blackest villain of all is likewise in ward and here we are to complete our evidence  nay throughout all you have said i have heard nothing to explain this mornings work  will laughed outright  and so you think all this would have been done without a word from their liege lady the princess they all wanted to deliver from captivity   no no sir  twas thus theres an honest man at burton a brewer who sends beer week by week for this house and very good ale it is as i can testify  i wish i had a tankard of it here to qualify these mulberries  this same brewer is instructed by gifford whose uncle lives in these parts to fit a false bottom to one of his barrels wherein is a box fitted for the receipt of letters and parcels  then by some means through langston i believe babington and gifford made known to the queen of scots and the french ambassador that here was a sure way of sending and receiving letters  the queens butler old hannibal was to look in the bottom of the barrel with the yellow hoop and one barnes a familiar of gifford and babington undertook the freight at the other end  the ambassador m de chateauneuf seemed to doubt at first and sent a single letter by way of experiment and that having been duly delivered and answered the bait was swallowed and not a week has gone by but letters have come and gone from hence all being first opened copied and deciphered by worthy mr phillipps and every word of them laid before the council  hum  we should not have reckoned that fair play when we went to master sniggiuss observed humfrey as he heard his companions tone of exultation  fair play is a jewel that will not pass current in statecraft responded cavendish  moreover that the plotter should be plotted against is surely only his desert  but thou art a mere sailor my talbot and these subtilties of policy are not for thee  for the which heaven be praised said humfrey  yet having as you say read all these letters by the way i see not wherefore ye are come down to seek for more  will here imitated the lord treasurers nod as well as in him lay not perhaps himself knowing the darker recesses of this same plot he did know so much as that every stage in it had been revealed to walsingham and burghley as it proceeded  he did not know that the entire scheme had been hatched not by a blind and fanatical partisan of marys doing evil that what he supposed to be good might come but by gifford and morgan walsinghams agents for the express purpose of causing mary totally to ruin herself and to compel elizabeth to put her to death and that the unhappy babington and his friends were thus recklessly sacrificed  the assassin had even been permitted to appear in elizabeths presence in order to terrify her into the conviction that her life could only be secured by marys death  they too did evil that good might come thinking marys death alone could ensure them from pope and spaniard but surely they descended into a lower depth of iniquity than did their victims  will himself was not certain what was wanted among the queens papers unless it might be the actual letters from babington copies of which had been given by phillips to the council so he only looked sagacious and humfrey thought of the castle well and felt the satisfaction there is in seeing a hunted creature escape  he asked however about cuthbert langston saying he isworse luck as you may have heardakin to my father who always pitied him as misguided but thought him as sincere in his folly as ever was this unlucky babington  so he seems to have been till of late  he hovered about in sundry disguises as you know much to the torment of us all but finally he seems to have taken some umbrage at the lady thinking she flouted his services or did not pay him high enough for them and gifford bought him over easily enough but he goes with us by the name of maude and the best of it is that the poor fools thought he was hoodwinking us all the time  they never dreamt that we saw through them like glass babington was himself with mr secretary only last week offering to go to france on business for himthe traitor hark there are more sounds of horse hoofs  who comes now i marvel  this was soon answered by a servingman who hurried out to tell humfrey that his father was arrived and in a few moments the young man was blessed and embraced by the good richard while diccon stood by considerably repaired in flesh and colour by his brief stay under his mothers care  mr richard talbot was heartily welcomed by sir amias paulett who regretted that his daughter was out of reach but did not make any offer of facilitating their meeting  richard explained that he was on his way to london on behalf of the earl  reports and letters not very clear had reached sheffield of young babington being engaged in a most horrible conspiracy against the queen and country and my lord and my lady who still preserved a great kindness for their former ward could hardly believe it and had sent their useful and trustworthy kinsman to learn the truth and to find out whether any amount of fine or forfeiture would avail to save his life  sir amias thought it would be a fruitless errand and so did richard himself when he had heard as much of the history as it suited paulett and wade to tell and though they esteemed and trusted him they did not care to go beneath that outer surface of the plot which was filling all london with fury  when having finished their afterdinner repose they repaired to make farther search taking cavendish to assist they somewhat reluctantly thought it due to mr talbot to invite his presence but he declined he and his son had much to say to one another he observed and not long to say it in  besides he added when he found himself alone with humfrey having despatched diccon on some errand to the stables tis a sorry sight to see all the poor ladys dainty hoards turned out by strangers  if it must be it must but it would irk me to be an idle gazer thereon  i would only said humfrey be assured that they would not light on the proofs of cicelys birth  thou mayst be at rest on that score my son  the lady saw them owned them and bade thy mother keep them saying ours were safer hands than hers  thy mother was sore grieved humfrey when she saw thee not but she sends thee her blessing and saith thou dost right to stay and watch over poor little cis  it were well if i were watching over her said humfrey but she is mewed up at tixall and i am only keeping guard over poor mistress seaton and the rest  thou hast seen her  yea and she was far more our own sweet maid than when she came back to us at bridgefield  and humfrey told his father all he had to tell of what he had seen and heard since he had been at chartley  his adventures in london had already been made known by diccon  mr talbot was aghast perhaps most of all at finding that his cousin cuthbert was a double traitor  from the roman catholic point of view there had been no treason in his former machinations on behalf of mary if she were in his eyes his rightful sovereign but the betrayal of confidence reposed in him was so horrible that the good master richard refused to believe it till he had heard the proofs again and again and then he exclaimed  that such a judas should ever call cousin with us  there could be little hope as both agreed of saving the unfortunate victims but richard was all the more bent on fulfilling lord shrewsburys orders and doing his utmost for babington  as to humfrey it would be better that he should remain where he was so that cicely might have some protector near her in case of any sudden dispersion of marys suite  poor maiden said her fosterfather she is in a manner ours and we cannot but watch over her but after all i doubt me whether it had not been better for her and for us if the waves had beaten the little life out of her ere i carried her home  she hath been the joy of my life said humfrey low and hoarsely  and i fear me she will be the sorrow of it  not by her fault poor wench but what hope canst thou have my son  none sir said humfrey except of giving up all if i can so defend her from aught  he spoke in a quiet matteroffact way that made his father look with some inquiry at his grave settled face quite calm as if saying nothing new but expressing a longformed quiet purpose  nor though humfrey was his eldest son and heir did richard talbot try to cross it  he asked whether he might see cicely before going on to london but sir amias said that in that case she would not be allowed to return to the queen and that to have had any intercourse with the prisoners might overthrow all his designs in london and he therefore only left with humfrey his commendations to her with a pot of fresh honey and a lavenderscented set of kerchiefs from mistress susan     chapter xxx  teteatete   during that close imprisonment at tixall cicely learnt to know her mother both in her strength and weakness  they were quite alone except that sir walter ashton daily came to perform the office of taster and carver at their meals and on the first evening his wife dragged herself upstairs to superintend the arrangement of their bedroom and to supply them with toilette requisites according to her own very limited notions and possessions  the dame was a very homely hardfeatured lady deaf and extremely fat and heavy one of the old uncultivated rustic gentry who had lagged far behind the general civilisation of the country and regarded all refinements as effeminate french vanities  she believed likewise all that was said against queen mary whom she looked on as barely restrained from plunging a dagger into elizabeths heart and letting parmas hellhounds loose upon tixall  to have such a guest imposed on her was no small grievance and nothing but her husbands absolute mandate could have induced her to come up with the maids who brought sheets for the bed pillows and the like needments  mary tried to make her requests as moderate as necessity would permit but when they had been shouted into her ears by one of the maids she shook her head at most of them as articles unknown to her  nor did she ever appear again  the arrangement of the bedchamber was performed by two maidservants the knight himself meanwhile standing a grim sentinel over the two ladies in the outer apartment to hinder their holding any communication through the servants  all requests had to be made to him and on the first morning mary made a most urgent one for writing materials books and either needlework or spinning  pen and ink had been expressly forbidden the only book in the house was a thumbed and torn primer but dame joan after much grumbling at fine ladies whims vouchsafed to send up a distaff some wool a piece of unbleached linen and a skein of white thread  queen mary executed therewith an exquisite piece of embroidery which having escaped dame joans first impulse to burn it on the spot remained for many years the show and the wonder of tixall  save for this employment she said she should have gone mad in her utter uncertainty about her own fate or that of those involved with her to ask questions of ashton was like asking them of a post  he would give her no notion whether her servants were at chartley or not whether they were at large or in confinement far less as to who was accused of the plot and what had been discovered  all that could be said for him was that his churlishness was passive and according to his ideas of duty  he was a very reluctant and uncomfortable jailer but he never insulted nor wilfully illused his unfortunate captive  thus mary was left to dwell on the little she knew namely that babington and his fellows were arrested and that she was supposed to be implicated but there her knowledge ceased except that humfreys warning convinced her that cuthbert langston had been at least one of the traitors  he had no doubt been offended and disappointed at that meeting during the hawking at tutbury  yet i need scarcely seek the why or the wherefore she said  i have spent my life in a world of treachery  no sooner do i take a step on ground that seems ever so firm than it proves a quicksand they will swallow me at last  dailymore than dailydid she and cicely go over together that hurried conversation on the moor and try to guess whether langston intended to hint at cicelys real birth  he had certainly not disclosed her secret as yet or paulett would never have selected her as sprung of a loyal house but he might guess at the truth and be waiting for an opportunity to sell it dearly to those who would regard her as possessed of dangerous pretensions  and far more anxiously did the queen recur to examining cicely on what she had gathered from humfrey  this was in fact nothing for he had been on his guard against either telling or hearing anything inconsistent with loyalty to the english queen and thus had avoided conversation on these subjects  nor did the queen communicate much  cicely never understood clearly what she dreaded what she expected to be found among her papers or what had been in the packet thrown into the well  the girl did not dare to ask direct questions and the queen always turned off indirect inquiries or else assured her that she was still a simple happy child and that it was better for her own sake that she should know nothing then caressed her and fondly pitied her for not being admitted to her mothers confidence but said piteously that she knew not what the secrets of queens and captives were not like those of mistress susan about the goose to be dressed or the crimson hose to be knitted for a surprise to her good husband  but cicely could see that she expected the worst and believed in a set purpose to shed her blood and she spent much time in devotion though sorely distressed by the absence of all those appliances which her church had taught her to rest upon  and these prayers which often began with floods of tears so that cicely drew away into the window with her distaff in order not to seem to watch them ended with rendering her serene and calm with a look of high resignation as having offered herself as a sacrifice and martyr for her church  and yet was it wholly as a roman catholic that she had been hated intrigued against and deposed in her own kingdom  was it simply as a roman catholic that she was as she said the subject of a more cruel plot than that of which she was accused  mysterious woman that she was she was never more mysterious than to her daughter in those seventeen days that they were shut up together it did not so much strike cicely at the time when she was carried along with all her mothers impulses and emotions without reflecting on them but when in after times she thought over all that then had passed she felt how little she had understood  they suffered a good deal from the heat and closeness of the rooms for mary was like a modern englishwoman in her craving for free air and these were the dogdays  they had contrived by the help of a diamond that the queen carried about with her after the fashion of the time to extract a pane or two from the lattices so ingeniously that the master of the house never found it out  and as their two apartments looked out different ways they avoided the full sunshine for they had neither curtains nor blinds to their windows by moving from one to the other but still the closeness was very oppressive and in the heat of the day just after dinner they could do nothing but lie on the table while the queen told stories of her old life in france till sometimes they both went to sleep  most of her dainty needlework was done in the long light mornings for she hardly slept at all in the hot nights cis scarcely saw her in bed for she prayed long after the maiden had fallen asleep and was up with the light and embroidering by the window  she only now began to urge cicely to believe as she did and to join her church taking blame to herself for never having attempted it more seriously  she told of the oneness and the glory of roman catholicism as she had seen it in france held out its promises and professions and dwelt on the comfort of the intercession of the blessed virgin and the saints assuring cicely that there was nothing but sacrilege confusion and cruelty on the other side  sometimes the maiden was much moved by the tender manner and persuasive words and she really had so much affection and admiration for her mother as to be willing to do all that she wished and to believe her the ablest and most clearsighted of human beings but whenever mary was not actually talking to her there was a curious swaying back of the pendulum in her mind to the conviction that what master richard and mistress susan believed must be the right thing that led to trustworthy goodness  she had an enthusiastic love for the queen but her faith and trust were in them and in humfrey and she could see religious matters from their point of view better than from that of her mother  so though the queen often felt herself carrying her daughter along she always found that there had been a slipping back to the old standpoint every time she began again  she was considering with some anxiety of the young maidens future  could i but send thee to my good sister the duchess of lorraine she would see thee well and royally married she said  then couldst thou be known by thine own name and rank as princess of scotland  if i can only see my courcelles again she would take thee safely and prove alland thy hand will be precious to many  it may yet bring back the true faith to england when my brave cousin of guise has put down the bearnese and when the poor stumblingblock here is taken away  oh speak not of that dear madam my mother  i must speak child  i must think how it will be with thee so marvellously saved and restored to be my comfort  i must provide for thy safety and honour  happily the saints guarded me from ever mentioning thee in my letters so that there is no fear that elizabeth should lay hands on thee unless langston should have spokenthe which can hardly be  but if all be broken up here i must find thee a dwelling with my kindred worthy of thy birth  mr and mrs talbot would take me home murmured cicely  girl  after all the training i have bestowed on thee is it possible that thou wouldst fain go back to make cheeses and brew small beer with those yorkshire boors rather than reign a princess i thought thy heart was nobler  cicely hung her head ashamed  i was very happy there she said in excuse  happyay with the milkmaids bliss  there may be fewer sorrows in such a life as thatjust as those comely kine of ashtons that i see grazing in the park have fewer sorrows than human creatures  but what know they of our joys or what know the commonalty of the joy of ruling calling brave men ones own riding before ones men in the field wielding counsels of state winning the love of thousands nay nay i will not believe it of my child unless tis the base border blood that is in her which speaks  cicely was somewhat overborne by being thus accused of meanness of tastes when she had heard the queen talk enviously of that same homely life which now she despised so heartily  she faltered in excuse methought madam you would be glad to think there was one loving shelter ever open to me  loving  ah  i see what it is said the queen in a tone of disgust it is the sailor loon that has overthrown it all  a couple of walks in the garden with him and the silly maid is ready to throw over all nobler thoughts  madam he spoke no such word to me  twas the infection childonly the infection  madam i pray you  whist child  thou wilt be a perilous bride for any commoner and let that thought if no other keep thee from lowering thine eyes to such as he  were i and thy brother taken out of the way none would stand between thee and both thrones  what would english or scots say to find thee a household joan wedded to one of drakes rude pirate fellows  i tell thee it would be the worse for him  they have made it treason to wed royal blood without elizabeths consent  no no for his sake as well as thine own thou must promise me never thus to debase thy royal lineage  mother neither he nor i have thought or spoken of such a matter since we knew how it was with me  and you give me your word  yea madam said cicely who had really never entertained the idea of marrying humfrey implicit as was her trust in him as a brother and protector  that is well  and so soon as i am restored to my poor servants if i ever am i will take measures for sending the french remnant to their own land nor shall my courcelles quit thee till she hath seen thee safe in the keeping of madame de lorraine or of queen louise who is herself a kinswoman of ours and they say is piety and gentleness itself  as you will madam said cicely her heart sinking at the thought of the strange new world before her but perceiving that she must not be the means of bringing humfrey into trouble and danger  perhaps she felt this the more from seeing how acutely her mother suffered at times from sorrow for those involved in her disaster she gave babington and his companions as well as nau and curll up for lost as the natural consequence of having befriended her and she blamed herself remorsefully after the long experience of the fatal consequences of meddling in her affairs for having entered into correspondence with the bright enthusiastic boy whom she remembered and having lured him without doubt to his death  alack alack she said and yet such is liberty that i should forget all i have gone through and do the like again if the door seemed opened to me  at least there is this comfort cruel child thy little heart was not set on him gracious and handsome though he wereand thy mothers most devoted knight  ah poor youth it wrings my soul to think of him  but at least he is a catholic his soul will be safe and i will have hundreds of masses sung for him oh that i knew how it goes with them  this torture of silent suspense is the most cruel of all  mary paced the room with impatient misery and in such a round the weary hours dragged by only mitigated by one welcome thunderstorm for seventeen days whose summer length made them seem the more endless cicely who had never before in her life been shut up in the house so many hours was pale listless and even fretful towards the queen who bore with her petulance so tenderly as more than once to make her weep bitterly for very shame  after one of these fits of tears mary pleaded earnestly with sir walter ashton for permission for the maiden to take a turn in the garden every day but though the good gentlemans complexion bore testimony that he lived in the fresh air he did not believe in its efficacy he said he had no orders and could do nothing without warrant  but that evening at supper the servingmaid brought up a large brew of herbs dark and nauseous which dame ashton had sent as good for the young ladys megrim  will you taste it sir asked the queen of sir walter with a revival of her lively humour  the foul fiend have me if a drop comes within my lips muttered the knight  i am not bound to taste for a tirewoman he added leaving it in doubt whether his objection arose from distaste to his ladys messes or from pride and he presently said perhaps halfashamed of himself and willing to cast the blame on the other side  it was kindly meant of my good dame and if you choose to flout at rather than benefit by it that is no affair of mine  he left the potion and cicely disposed of it by small instalments at the windows and a laugh over the evident horror it excited in the master did the captives at least as much good as the camomile centaury wormwood and other ingredients of the bowl  happily it was only two days later that sir walter announced that his custody of the queen was over and sir amias paulett was come for her there was little preparation to make for the two ladies had worn their ridingdresses all the time but on reaching the great door where sir amias attended by humfrey was awaiting them they were astonished to see a whole troop on horseback all armed with headpieces swords and pistols to the number of a hundred and forty  wherefore is this little army raised she asked  it is by order of the queen replied ashton with his accustomed surly manner and need enough in the time of such treasons  the queen turned to him with tears on her cheeks  good gentlemen she said i am not witting of anything against the queen  am i to be taken to the tower  no madam back to chartley replied sir amias  i knew they would never let me see my cousin sighed the queen sir as paulett placed her on her horse of your pity tell me whether i shall find all my poor servants there  yea madam save mr nau and mr curll who are answering for themselves and for you  moreover curlls wife was delivered two days since  this intelligence filled mary with more anxiety than she chose to manifest to her unsympathising surroundings cis meanwhile had been assisted to mount by humfrey who told her that mrs curll was thought to be doing well but that there were fears for the babe  it was impossible to exchange many words for they were immediately behind the queen and her two warders and humfrey could only tell her that his father had been at chartley and had gone on to london but there was inexpressible relief in hearing the sound of his voice and knowing she had some one to think for her and protect her  the promise she had made to the queen only seemed to make him more entirely her brother by putting that other love out of the question  there was a sad sight at the gatea whole multitude of wretchedlooking beggars and poor of all ages and degrees of misery who all held out their hands and raised one cry of alms alms gracious lady alms for the love of heaven  mary looked round on them with tearful eyes and exclaimed alack good folk i have nothing to give you  i am as much a beggar as yourselves  the escort dispersed them roughly paulett assuring her that they were nothing but a sort of idle folk who were only encouraged in laziness by her bounty which was very possibly true of a certain proportion of them but it had been a sore grief to her that since cuthbert langstons last approach in disguise she had been prevented from giving alms  in due time chartley was reached and the first thing the queen did on dismounting was to hurry to visit poor barbara curll who hadon her increasing illnessbeen removed to one of the guestchambers where the queen now found her still in much distress about her husband who was in close imprisonment in walsinghams house and had not been allowed to send her any kind of message and in still more immediate anxiety about her newborn infant who did not look at all as if its little life would last many hours  she lifted up her languid eyelids and scarcely smiled when the queen declared see barbara i am come back again to you to nurse you and my goddaughter into health to receive your husband again  nay have no fears for him  they cannot hurt him  he has done nothing and is a scottish subject beside  my son shall write to claim him she declared with such an assumed air of confidence that a shade of hope crossed the pale face and the fear for her child became the more pressing of the two griefs  we will christen her at once said mary turning to the nearest attendant  bear a request from me to sir amias that his chaplain may come at once and baptize my godchild  sir amias was waiting in the gallery in very illhumour at the queens delay which kept his supper waiting  moreover his party had a strong dislike to private baptism holding that the important point was the public covenant made by responsible persons and the notion of the sponsorship of a roman catholic likewise shocked him so he made ungracious answer that he would have no baptism save in church before the congregation with true protestant gossips  so saith he exclaimed mary when the reply was reported to her nay my poor little one thou shalt not be shut out of the kingdom of heaven for his churlishness  and taking the infant on her knee she dipped her hand in the bowl of water that had been prepared for the chaplain and baptized it by her own name of mary  the existing prayerbook had been made expressly to forbid lay baptism and baptism by women at the special desire of the reformers and sir amias was proportionately horrified and told her it was an offence for the archbishops court  very like said mary  your protestant courts love to slay both body and soul  will it please you to open my own chambers to me sir  sir amias handed the key to one of her servants but she motioned him aside  those who put me forth must admit me she said  the door was opened by one of the gentlemen of the household and they entered  every repository had been ransacked every cabinet stood open and empty every drawer had been pulled out  wearing apparel and the like remained but even this showed signs of having been tossed over and roughly rearranged by masculine fingers  mary stood in the midst of the room which had a strange air of desolation an angry light in her eyes and her hands clasped tightly one into the other  paulett attempted some expression of regret for the disarray pleading his orders  it needs not excuse sir said mary i understand to whom i owe this insult  there are two things that your queen can never take from meroyal blood and the catholic faith  one day some of you will be sorry for what you have now put upon me  i would be alone sir and she proudly motioned him to the door with a haughty gesture showing her still fully queen in her own apartments paulett obeyed and when he was gone the queen seemed to abandon the command over herself she had preserved all this time  she threw herself into jean kennedys arms and wept freely and piteously while the good lady rejoicing at heart to have recovered her bairn fondled and soothed her with soft scottish epithets as though the worn woman had been a child again yea nurse mine own nurse i am come back to thee for a little whileonly a little while nurse for they will have my blood and oh i would it were ended for i am aweary of it all  jean and elizabeth curll tried to cheer and console her alarmed at this unwonted depression but she only said get me to bed nurse i am sair forfaughten  she was altogether broken down by the long suspense the hardships and the imprisonment she had undergone and she kept her bed for several days hardly speaking but apparently reposing in the relief afforded by the recovered care and companionship of her muchloved attendants  there she was when paulett came to demand the keys of the caskets where her treasure was kept  melville had refused to yield them and all the queen said was robbery is to be added to the rest a sentence which greatly stung the knight but he actually seized all the coin that he found including what belonged to nau and curll and only retaining enough for present expenses sent the rest off to london     chapter xxxi  evidence   in the meantime the two richard talbots father and son had safely arrived in london and had been made welcome at the house of their noble kinsman  nau and curll they heard were in walsinghams house subjected to close examination babington and all his comrades were in the tower the council was continually sitting to deliberate over the fate of the latter unhappy men of whose guilt there was no doubt and neither lord talbot nor will cavendish thought there was any possibility of master richard gaining permission to plead how the unfortunate babington had been worked on and deceived  after the sentence should be pronounced cavendish thought that the request of the earl of shrewsbury might prevail to obtain permission for an interview between the prisoner and one commissioned by his former guardian  will was daily attending sir francis walsingham as his clerk and was not by any means unwilling to relate anything he had been able to learn  queen elizabeth was it seemed greatly agitated and distressed  the shock to her nerves on the day when she had so bravely overawed barnwell with the power of her eye had been such as not to be easily surmounted  she was restless and full of anxiety continually starting at every sound and beginning letters to the queen of scots which were never finished  she had more than once inquired after the brave sailor youths who had come so opportunely to her rescue and lord talbot thought it would be well to present diccon and his father to her and accordingly took them with him to greenwich palace where they had the benefit of looking on as loyal subjects while her majesty in royal fashion dined in public to the sound of drums trumpets fifes and stringed instruments  but though dressed with her usual elaborate care she looked older paler thinner and more haggard than when diccon had seen her three weeks previously and neither her eye nor mouth had the same steadiness  she did not eat with relish but almost as if she were forcing herself lest any lack of appetite might be observed and commented upon and her looks continually wandered as though in search of some lurking enemy for in truth no woman nor man either could easily forget the suggestion which had recently been brought to her knowledge that an assassin might lurk in her gallery and stab her with his dagger or if she should walk in her garden he might shoot her with his dagg or if she should walk abroad to take the air he might assault her with his arming sword and make sure work even though the enemies were safe in prison she knew not but that dagger dagg or arming sword might still be ready for her and she believed that any fatal charge openly made against mary at the trial might drive her friends to desperation and lead to the use of dagg or dagger  she was more unhinged than ever before and commanded herself with difficulty when going through all the scenes of her public life as usual  the talbots soon felt her keen eye on them and a look of recognition passed over her face as she saw diccon  as soon as the meal was over and the table of trestles removed she sent a page to command lord talbot to present them to her  so sir she said as richard the elder knelt before her you are the father of two brave sons whom you have bred up to do good service but i only see one of them here  where is the elder  so please your majesty sir amias paulett desired to retain him at chartley to assist in guarding the queen of scots  it is well  paulett knows a trusty lad when he sees him  and so do i  i would have the youths both for my gentlemen pensionersthe elder when he can be spared from his charge this stripling at once  we are much beholden to your majesty said richard bending his head the lower as he knelt on one knee for such an appointment gave both training and recommendation to young country gentlemen and was much sought after  methinks said elizabeth who had the royal faculty of remembering faces you have yourself so served us mr talbot  i was for three years in the band of your majestys sister queen mary said richard but i quitted it on her death to serve at sea and i have since been in charge at sheffield under my lord of shrewsbury  we have heard that he hath found you a faithful servant said the queen yea so well affected as even to have refused your daughter in marriage to this same babington  is this true  it is so please your majesty  and it was because you already perceived his villainy  there were many causes madam said richard catching at the chance of saying a word for the unhappy lad but it was not so much villainy that i perceived in him as a nature that might be easily practised upon by worse men than himself  not so much a villain ready made as the stuff villains are made of said the queen satisfied with her own repartee  so please your majesty the metal that in good hands becomes a brave sword in evil ones becomes a treacherous dagger  well said master captain and therefore we must destroy alike the dagger and the hands that perverted it  yet ventured richard the dagger attempered by your majestys clemency might yet do noble service  elizabeth however broke out fiercely with one of her wonted oaths  how now  thou wouldst not plead for the rascal  i would have you to know that to crave pardon for such a fellow is wellnigh treason in itself  you have license to leave us sir  i should scarce have brought you richard said lord talbot as soon as they had left the presence chamber had i known you would venture on such folly  know you not how incensed she is  naught but your proved loyalty and my fathers could have borne you off this time and it would be small marvel to me if the lads appointment were forgotten  i could not choose but run the risk said richard  what else came i to london for  well said his cousin you are a brave man richard talbot  i know those who had rather scale a spanish fortress than face queen elizabeth in her wrath  her tongue is sharper than even my stepdames though it doth not run on so long  lord talbot was not quite easy when that evening a gentleman clad in rich scarlet and gold and armed to the teeth presented himself at shrewsbury house and inquired for mr talbot of bridgefield however it proved to be the officer of the troop of gentlemen pensioners come to enroll diccon tell him the requirements and arrange when he should join in a capacity something like that of an esquire to one of the seniors of the troop  humfrey was likewise inquired for but it was thought better on all accounts that he should continue in his present situation since it was especially needful to have trustworthy persons at chartley in the existing crisis  master richard was well satisfied to find that his sons immediate superior would be a gentleman of a good yorkshire family whose father was known to him and who promised to have a care of master richard the younger and preserve him as far as possible from the perils of dicing drinking and running into bad company  launching a son in this manner and equipping him for service was an anxious task for a father while day after day the trial was deferred the examinations being secretly carried on before the council till as cavendish explained what was important should be disclosed  of course this implied what should be fatal to queen mary  the priest ballard was racked but he was a man of great determination and nothing was elicited from him  the other prisoners and nau and curll were questioned again and again under threats and promises before the council and the letters that had been copied on their transit through the beer barrels were read and made the subject of crossexaminationstill all in private for as cavendish said perilous stuff to the queens majesty might come out  he allowed however day after day that though there was quite enough to be fatal to ballard babington savage and barnwell whatever else was wanting was not forthcoming  at last however cavendish returned full of a certain exultation we have it he saida most undoubted treasonable letter which will catch her between the shoulders and the head  he spoke to lord talbot and richard who were standing together in a window and who knew only too well who was referred to and what the expression signified  on a further query from his stepbrother cavendish explained that it was a long letter dated july 16 arranging in detail the plan for the ladys own rescue from chartley at the moment of the landing of the spaniards and likewise showing her privy to the design of the six gentlemen against the life of the queen and desiring to know their names  nau had he said verified the cipher as one used in the correspondence and babington when it was shown to him had declared that it had been given to him in the street by a stranger servingman in a blue coat and that it had removed all doubt from his mind as it was an answer to a letter of his a copy of which had been produced but not the letter itself  which we have not found said cavendish  not for all that search of yours at chartley said richard methought it was thorough enough  the lady must have been marvellously prudent as to the keeping of letters said will or else she must have received some warning for there is absolutely naught to be found in her repositories that will serve our purpose  our purpose repeated richard as he recollected many little kindnesses that william cavendish when a boy had received from the prisoner at sheffield  yea master richard he returned unabashed  it is absolutely needful that we should openly prove this woman to be what we know her to be in secret  her majestys life will never be safe for a moment while she lives and what would become of us all did she overlive the queen  well will for all your mighty word we you are but the pen in mr secretarys hand so there is no need to argue the matter with you said richard  the speech considerably nettled master william especially as it made lord talbot laugh  father said diccon afterwards humfrey tried to warn mr babington that we had seen this langston who hath as many metamorphoses as there be in ovidius naso coming privily forth from sir francis walsinghams closet but he would not listen and declared that langston was holding mr secretary in play  deceiving and being deceived sighed his father  that is ever the way my son  remember that if thou playest false other men will play falser with thee and bring thee to thy ruin  i would not leave thee here save that the gentlemen pensioners are a more honest and manly sort of folk than yonder gentlemen with their state craft wherein they throw over all truth and honour as well as mercy  this conversation took place as the father and son were making their way to a house in westminster where antony babingtons wife was with her mother lady ratcliffe  it had been a match made by lady shrewsbury and it was part of richards commission to see and confer with the family  it was not a satisfactory interview  the wife was a dull childish little thing not yet sixteen and though she cried she had plainly never lived in any real sympathy or companionship with her husband who had left her with her parents while leading the life of mingled amusement and intrigue which had brought him to his present state and the mother a hardfeatured woman evidently thought herself cheated and ill used  she railed at babington and at my lady countess by turns at the one for his ruinous courses and neglect of her daughter at the other for having cozened her into giving her poor child to a treacherous papist who would be attainted in blood and thus bring her poor daughter and grandchild to poverty the old lady really seemed to have lost all pity for her soninlaw in indignation on her daughters account and to care infinitely less for the saving of his life than for the saving of his estate  nor did the young wife herself appear to possess much real affection for poor antony of whom she had seen very little  there must have been great faults on his side yet certainly richard felt that there was some excuse for him in the motherinlaw and that if the unfortunate young man could have married cicely his lot might have been different  yet the good captain felt all the more that if cis had been his own he still would never have given her to babington     chapter xxxii  westminster hall   beneath the noble roof of westminster hall with the morning sun streaming in high aloft at seven in the morning of the 14th of september the court met for the trial of antony babington and his confederates  the talbot name and recommendation obtained ready admission and lord talbot richard and his son formed one small party together with william cavendish who had his tablets on which to take notes for the use of his superior walsingham who was however one of the commissioners  there they sat those supreme judges the three chiefjustices in their scarlet robes of office forming the centre of the group which also numbered lords cobham and buckhurst sir francis knollys sir christopher hatton and most of the chief law officers of the crown  is mr secretary walsingham one of the judges here asked diccon methought he had been in the place of the accuser  peace boy and listen said his father these things pass my comprehension  nevertheless richard had determined that if the course of the trial should offer the least opportunity he would come forward and plead his former knowledge of young babington as a rash and weakheaded youth easily played upon by designing persons but likely to take to heart such a lesson as this and become a true and loyal subject  if he could obtain any sort of mitigation for the poor youth it would be worth the risk  the seven conspirators were brought in and richard could hardly keep a rush of tears from his eyes at the sight of those fine highspirited young men especially antony babington the playfellow of his own children  antony was carefully dressed in his favourite colour dark green his hair and beard trimmed and his demeanour calm and resigned  the fire was gone from his blue eye and his bright complexion had faded but there was an air of dignity about him such as he had never worn before his eyes as he took his place wandered round the vast assembly and rested at length on mr talbot as though deriving encouragement and support from the look that met his  next to him was another young man with the same look of birth and breeding namely chidiock tichborne but john savage an older man had the reckless bearing of the brutalised soldiery of the netherlandish wars  robert barnwell with his red shaggy brows and irish physiognomy was at once recognised by diccon  donne and salisbury followed and the seventh conspirator john ballard was carried in a chair  even diccons quick eye could hardly have detected the ruffling swaggering richlyclad captain fortescue in this tonsured man in priestly garb deadly pale and unable to stand from the effects of torture yet with undaunted penetrating eyes all unsubdued  after the proclamation oyez oyez and the command to keep silence sandys the clerk of the crown began the proceedings  john ballard antony babington john savage robert barnwell chidiock tichborne henry donne thomas salisbury hold up your hands and answer  the indictment was then read at great length charging them with conspiring to slay the queen to deliver mary queen of scots from custody to stir up rebellion to bring the spaniards to invade england and to change the religion of the country  the question was first put to ballard was he guilty of these treasons or not guilty  ballards reply was that i procured the delivery of the queen of scots i am guilty and that i went about to alter the religion i am guilty but that i intended to slay her majesty i am not guilty  not with his own hand muttered cavendish but for the rest  pity that what is so bravely spoken should be false thought richard yet it may be to leave the way open to defence  sandys however insisted that he must plead to the whole indictment and anderson the chiefjustice of common pleas declared that he must deny the whole generally or confess it generally while hatton put in ballard under thine own hand are all things confessed therefore now it is much vanity to stand vaingloriously in denying it  then sir i confess i am guilty he said with great calmness though it was the resignation of all hope  the same question was then put to babington  he with a mild countenance sober gesture and all his natural grace stood up and spoke saying that the time for concealment was past and that he was ready to avow how from his earliest infancy he had believed england to have fallen from the true religion and had trusted to see it restored thereto  moreover he had ever a deep love and compassion for the queen of scots  some he said who are yet at large and who are yet as deep in the matter as i  gifford morgan and another whispered cavendish significantly  have they escaped asked diccon  so tis said  the decoy ducks thought richard  babington was explaining that these men had proposed to him a great enterprise for the rescue and restoration of the queen of scots and the reestablishment of the catholic religion in england by the sword of the prince of parma  a body of gentlemen were to attack chartley free mary and proclaim her queen and at the same time queen elizabeth was to be put to death by some speedy and skilful method  my lords he said i swear that all that was in me cried out against the wickedness of thus privily slaying her majesty  some muttered the villain he lies but the kindly richard sighed inaudibly true poor lad  thou must have given thy conscience over to strange keepers to be thus led astray  and babington went on to say that they had brought this gentleman father ballard who had wrought with him to prove that his scruples were weak carnal and ungodly and that it would be a meritorious deed in the sight of heaven thus to remove the heretic usurper  here the judges sternly bade him not to blaspheme and he replied with that soberness and good grace which seems to have struck all the beholders that he craved patience and pardon meaning only to explain how he had been led to the madness which he now repented understanding himself to have been in grievous error though not for the sake of any temporal reward but being blinded to the guilt and assured that the deed was both lawful and meritorious  he thus had been brought to destruction through the persuasions of this ballard  a very fit author for so bad a fact responded hatton  very true sir said babington for from so bad a ground never proceed any better fruits  he it was who persuaded me to kill the queen and to commit the other treasons whereof i confess myself guilty  savage pleaded guilty at once with the reckless hardihood of a soldier accustomed to look on death as the fortune of war  barnwell denied any intention of killing the queen much to diccons surprise but pleaded guilty to the rest  donne said that on being told of the plot he had prayed that whatever was most to the honour and glory of heaven might be done and being pushed hard by hatton turned this into a confession of being guilty  salisbury declared that he had always protested against killing the queen and that he would not have done so for a kingdom but of the rest he was guilty tichborne showed that but for an accidental lameness he would have been at his home in hampshire but he could not deny his knowledge of the treason  all having pleaded guilty no trial was permitted such as would have brought out the different degrees of guilt which varied in all the seven  a long speech was however made by the counsel for the crown detailing the plot as it had been arranged for the public knowledge and reading aloud a letter from babington to queen mary describing his plans both for her rescue and the assassination saying he had appointed six noble gentlemen for the despatch of the wicked competitor  richard caught a look of astonishment on the unhappy young mans face but it passed into hopeless despondency and the speech went on to describe the picture of the conspirators and its strange motto concluding with an accusation that they meant to sack london burn the ships and cloy the ordnance  a shudder of horror went through the assembly and perhaps few except richard talbot felt that the examination of the prisoners ought to have been public  the form however was gone through of asking whether they had cause to render wherefore they should not be condemned to die  the first to speak was ballard  his eyes glanced round with an indomitable expression of scorn and indignation which as diccon whispered he could have felt to his very backbone  it was like that of a trapped and maimed lion as the man sat in his chair with crushed and racked limbs but with a spirit untamed in its defiance  cause my lords he replied  the cause i have to render will not avail here but it may avail before another judgmentseat where the question will be who used the weapons of treason not merely against whom they were employed  inquiry hath not been made here who suborned the priest dr gifford to fetch me over from paris that we might together overcome the scruples of these young men and lead them forward in a scheme for the promotion of the true religion and the right and lawful succession  no question hath here been put in open court who framed the conspiracy nor for what purpose  no my lords it would baffle the end you would bring about yea and blot the reputation of some who stand in high places if it came to light that the plot was devised not by the catholics who were to be the instruments thereof nor by the lady in whose favour all was to be donenot by these the mere victims but by him who by a triumph of policy thus sent forth his tempters to enclose them all within his netabove all the persecuted lady whom all true catholics own as the only lawful sovereign within these realms  such schemes when they succeed are termed policy  my lords i confess that by the justice of england we have been guilty of treason against queen elizabeth but by the eternal law of the justice of god we have suffered treachery far exceeding that for which we are about to die  i marvel that they let the fellow speak so far was cavendishs comment  nay but is it so asked diccon with startled eyes  hush you have yet to learn statecraft returned his friend  his fathers monitory hand only just saved the boy from bursting out with something that would have rather astonished westminster hall and caused him to be taken out by the ushers  it is not wonderful that no report of the priests speech has been preserved  the name of antony babington was then called  probably he had been too much absorbed in the misery of his position to pay attention to the preceding speech for his reply was quite independent of it  he prayed the lords to believe and to represent to her majesty that he had received with horror the suggestion of compassing her death and had only been brought to believe it a terrible necessity by the persuasions of this ballard  on this hatton broke forth in indignant compassiono ballard ballard what hast thou done  a sort of brave youth otherwise endowed with good gifts by thy inducement hast thou brought to their utter destruction and confusion  this apparently gave some hope to babington for he answeredyes i protest that before i met this ballard i never meant nor intended for to kill the queen but by his persuasions i was induced to believe that she being excommunicate it was lawful to murder her  for the first time ballard betrayed any pain  yes mr babington he said lay all the blame upon me but i wish the shedding of my blood might be the saving of your life  howbeit say what you will i will say no more  he is the bravest of them all was diccons comment  wot you that he was once our spy returned cavendish with a sneer while sir christopher with the satisfaction of a little nature in uttering reproaches returnednay ballard you must say more and shall say more for you must not commit treasons and then huddle them up  is this your religio catholica  nay rather it is diabolica  ballard scorned to answer this and the clerk passed on to savage who retained his soldierly fatalism and only shook his head barnwell again denied any purpose of injuring the queen and when hatton spoke of his appearance in richmond park he said all had been for conscience sake  so said henry donne but with far more piety and dignity adding fiat voluntas dei and thomas salisbury was the only one who made any entreaty for pardon  speeches followed from the attorneygeneral and from sir christopher hatton and then the lord chief justice anderson pronounced the terrible sentence  richard talbot sat with his head bowed between his hands  his son had begun listening with widestretched eyes and mouth as boyhood hearkens to the dreadful and with the hardness of an unmerciful time too apt to confound pity with weakness but when his eye fell on the man he had followed about as an elder playmate and realised all it conveyed his cheek blanched his jaw fell and he hardly knew how his father got him out of the court  there was clearly no hope  the form of the trial was such as to leave no chance of escape from the utmost penalty  no witnesses had been examined no degrees of guilt acknowledged no palliations admitted perhaps men who would have brought the spanish havoc on their native country and have murdered their sovereign were beyond the pale of compassion  all london clearly thought so and yet as richard talbot dwelt on their tones and looks and remembered how they had been deluded and tempted and made to believe their deed meritorious he could not but feel exceeding pity for the four younger men  ballard savage and barnwell might be justly doomed even babington had by his own admission entertained a fearfully evil design but the other three had evidently dipped far less deeply into the plot and tichborne had only concealed it out of friendship yet the ruthless judgment condemned all alike  and why  to justify a yet more cruel blow  no wonder honest richard talbot felt sick at heart     chapter xxxiii  in the tower   here is a letter from mr secretary to the lieutenant of the tower master richard bidding him admit you to speech of babington said will cavendish  he was loath to give it and nothing but my lord shrewsburys interest would have done it on my oath that you are a prudent and discreet man who hath been conversant in these matters for many years  yea and that long before you were master will said richard always a little entertained by the young gentlemans airs of patronage however i am beholden to you  that you may be for you are the only person who hath obtained admission to the prisoners  not even their wives  mrs tichborne is in the countryso best for herand mrs babington hath never demanded it  i trow there is not love enough between them to make them seek such a meeting  it was one of my mothers matches mistress cicely would have cleaved to him more closely though i am glad you saw through the fellow too well to give her to him  she would be a landless widow whereas this ratcliffe wife has a fair portion for her child  then dethick will be forfeited  ay  they say the queen hath promised it to raleigh  and there is no hope of mercy  not a tittle for any man of them  nay so far from it her majesty asked if there were no worse nor more extraordinary mode of death for them  i should not have thought it of her  her majesty hath been affrighted master richard sorely affrighted though she put so bold a face upon it and there is nothing a woman who prides herself on her courage can so little pardon  so richard sad at heart took boat and ascended the thames for his melancholy visit  the gateway was guarded by a stalwart yeoman halbert in hand who detained him while the officer of the guard was called  on showing the letter from sir francis walsingham mr talbot was conducted by this personage across the first paved court to the lodgings of the lieutenant under so close a guard that he felt as if he were about to be incarcerated himself and was there kept waiting in a sort of guardroom while the letter was delivered  presently the lieutenant sir owen hopton a wellbred courteous knight appeared and saluted him with apologies for his detention and all these precautions saying that the orders were to keep a close guard and to hinder all communication from without so that nothing short of this letter would have obtained entrance for the bearer whom he further required to set down his name and designation in full then after asking how long the visitor wished to remain with the prisonersfor tichborne and babington were quartered togetherhe called a warder and committed mr talbot to his guidance to remain for two hours locked up in the cell  sir added sir owen it is superfluous to tell you that on coming out you must either give me your word of honour that you convey nothing from the prisoners or else submit to be searched  richard smiled and observed that men were wont to trust his word of honour to which the knight heartily replied that he was sure of it and he then followed the warder up stone stairs and along vaulted passages where the clang of their footsteps made his heart sink the prisoners were in the white tower the central body of the grim building and the warder after unlocking the door announced with no unnecessary rudeness but rather as if he were glad of any comfort to his charges here sirs is a gentleman to visit you  they had both risen at the sound of the key turning in the lock and antony babingtons face lighted up as he exclaimed mr talbot  i knew you would come if it were possible  i come by my lords desire replied richard the close wringing of his hand expressing feeling to which he durst not give way in words  he took in at the moment that the room though stern and strong was not squalid  it was lighted fully by a window ironbarred but not small and according to custom the prisoners had been permitted to furnish at their own expense sufficient garniture for comfort and as both were wealthy men they were fairly provided and they were not fettered  both looked paler than when richard had seen them in westminster hall two days previously  antony was as usual neatly arrayed with welltrimmed hair and beard but tichbornes hung neglected and there was a hollow haggard look about his eyes as if of dismay at his approaching fate  neither was however forgetful of courtesy and as babington presented mr talbot to his friend the greeting and welcome would have befitted the halls of dethick or tichborne  sirs said the young man with a sad smile irradiating for a moment the restless despair of his countenance it is not by choice that i am an intruder on your privacy i will abstract myself so far as is possible  i have no secrets from my chidiock cried babington  but mr talbot may replied his friend therefore i will only first inquire whether he can tell us aught of the royal lady for whose sake we suffer  they have asked us many questions but answered none  richard was able to reply that after the seclusion at tixall she had been brought back to chartley and there was no difference in the manner of her custody moreover that she had recovered from her attack of illness tidings he had just received in a letter from humfrey  he did not feel it needful to inflict a pang on the men who were to die in two days time by letting them know that she was to be immediately brought to trial on the evidence extracted from them  on hearing that her captivity was not straitened both looked relieved and tichborne thanking him lay down on his own bed turned his face to the wall and drew the covering over his head  ah sighed babington is there no hope for himhe who has done naught but guard too faithfully my unhappy secret  is he to die for his faith and honour  alas antony i am forbidden to give thee hope for any  of that we must not speak  the time is short enough for what needs to be spoken  i knew that there was none for myself said antony but for those whom there was a gesture from tichborne as if he could not bear this and he went on yea there is a matter on which i must needs speak to you sir  the young ladywhere is shehe spoke earnestly and lowering his voice as he bent his head  she is still at chartley  that is well  but sir she must be guarded  i fear me there is one who is aware of her parentage  the scottish archer  no the truth  you knew it  not when i made my suit to her or i should never have dared to lift my eyes so far  i suppose your knowledge came from langston said richard more perturbed than amazed at the disclosure  even so  yet i am not certain whether he knows or only guesses but at any rate be on your guard for her sake  he has proved himself so unspeakable a villain that none can guess what he will do next  hehe it is above allyea above even gifford and ballard who has brought us to this pass  he was becoming fiercely agitated but putting a force upon himself said have patience good mr talbot of your kindness and i will tell you all that you may understand the coilings of the serpent who led me hither and if possible save her from them  antony then explained that so soon as he had become his own master he had followed the inclinations which led him to the church of his mother and of queen mary the two beings he had always regarded with the most fervent affection and love  his mothers kindred had brought him in contact with the roman catholic priests who circulated in england at the utmost peril of their lives to keep up the faith of the gentry and in many cases to intrigue for queen mary  among these plotters he fell in with cuthbert langston a jesuit of the third order though not a priest and one of the most active agents in corresponding with queen mary  his small stature colourless complexion and insignificant features rendered him almost a blank block capable of assuming any variety of disguise  he also knew several languages could imitate different dialects and counterfeit male and female voices so that very few could detect him  he had soon made himself known to babington as the huckster tibbott of days gone by and had then disclosed to him that cicely was certainly not the daughter of her supposed parents telling of her rescue from the wreck and hinting that her rank was exalted and that he knew secrets respecting her which he was about to make known to the queen of scots  with this purpose among others langston had adopted the disguise of the woman selling spars with the password beads and bracelets and being well known as an agent of correspondence to the suite of the captive queen he had been able to direct gorions attention to the maiden and to let him know that she was the same with the infant who had been put on board the bride of dunbar at dunbar  how much more did langston guess  he had told babington the story current among the outer circle of marys followers of the maiden being the daughter of the scotch archer and had taught him her true name encouraging too his aspirations towards her during the time of his courtship  babington believed langston to have been at that time still a sincere partizan of queen mary but all along to have entertained a suspicion that there was a closer relationship between bride hepburn and the queen than was avowed though to babington himself he had only given mysterious hints  but towards the end of the captivity at tutbury he had made some further discovery which confirmed his suspicions and had led to another attempt to accost cicely and to make the queen aware of his knowledge perhaps in order to verify it or it might be to gain power over her a reward for the introduction or to extort bribes to secrecy  for looking back antony could now perceive that by this time a certain greed of lucre had set in upon the man who had obtained large sums of secret service money from himself and avarice together with the rebuff he had received from the queen had doubtless rendered him accessible to the temptations of the archplotters gifford and morgan  richard could believe this for the knowledge had been forced on him that there were an incredible number of intriguers at that time spies and conspirators often in the pay of both parties impartially betraying the one to the other and sometimes through miscalculation meeting the fate they richly deserved  many a man who had begun enthusiastically to work in underground ways for what he thought the righteous cause became so enamoured of the undermining process and the gold there to be picked up that from a wrongheaded partizan he became a traitoroften a doublefaced oneand would work secretly in the interest of whichever cause would pay him best  poor babington had been far too youthfully simple to guess what he now perceived that he had been made the mere tool and instrument of these traitors  he had been instructed in giffords arrangement with the burton brewer for conveying letters to mary at chartley and had been made the means of informing her of it by means of his interview with cicely when he had brought the letter in the watch  the letter had been conveyed to him by langston the watch had been his own device it was after this meeting of which richard now heard for the first time that langston had fully told his belief respecting the true birth of bride hepburn and assured babington that there was no hope of his wedding her though the queen might allow him to delude himself with the idea of her favour in order to bind him to her service  it was then that babington consented to lady shrewsburys new match with the wellendowed eleanor ratcliffe  if he could not have cicely he cared not whom he had  he had been leading a wild and extravagant life about town when as poor tichborne afterwards said on the scaffold the flourishing estate of babington and tichborne was the talk of fleet street and the strand and he had also many calls for secret service money so that all his thought was to have more to spend in the service of queen mary and her daughter  oh sir  i have been as one distraught all this past year he said how often since i have been shut up here and i have seen how i have been duped and gulled have your words come back to me that to enter on crooked ways was the way to destruction for myself and others and that i might only be serving worse men than myself  and yet they were priests who misled me  even in your own religion there are many priests who would withhold you from such crimes said richard  there are  i know it  i have spoken with them  they say no priest can put aside the eternal laws of gods justice  so these others chidiock here donne and salisbury always cried out against the slaying of the queen thoughwretch that i wasand gulled by ballard and savage i deemed the exploit so noble and praiseworthy that i even joined tichborne with me in that accursed portraiture yea you may well deem me mad but it was gifford who encouraged me in having it made no doubt to assure our ruin  oh mr talbot was ever man so cruelly deceived as me  it is only too true antony  my heart is full of rage and indignation when i think thereof  and yet my poor lad what concerns thee most is to lay aside all such thoughts as may not tend to repentance before god  i know it i know it sir  all the more that we shall die without the last sacraments  commend us to the prayers of our queen sir and of her  but to proceed with what imports you to know for her sake while i have space to speak  he proceeded to tell how between dissipation and intrigue he had lived in a perpetual state of excitement going backwards and forwards between london and lichfield to attend to the correspondence with queen mary and the spanish ambassador in france and to arrange the details of the plot always being worked up to the highest pitch by gifford and ballard while langston continued to be the great assistant in all the correspondence  all the time sir francis walsingham who was really aware of all if not the prime mover in the intrigue appeared perfectly unsuspicious often received babington at his house and discussed a plan of sending him on a commission to france while in point of fact every letter that travelled in the burton barrels was deciphered by phillipps and laid before the secretary before being read by the proper owners  in none of these however as babington could assure mr talbot had cicely been mentionedthe only danger to her was through langston  things had come to a climax in july when babington had been urged to obtain from mary such definite approbation of his plans as might satisfy his confederates and had in consequence written the letter and obtained the answer copies of which had been read to him at his private examination and which certainly contained fatal matter to both him and the queen  they had no doubt been called forth with that intent and a doubt had begun to arise in the victims mind whether the last reply had been really the queens own  it had been delivered to him in the street not by the usual channel but by a bluecoated servingman  two or three days later humfrey had told him of langstons interview with walsingham which he had at the time laughed to scorn thinking himself able to penetrate any disguise of that proteus and likewise believing that he was blinding walsingham  he first took alarm a few days after humfreys departure and wrote to queen mary to warn her convinced that the traitor must be langston ballard became himself suspected and after lurking about in various disguises was arrested in babingtons own lodgings  to disarm suspicion antony went to walsingham to talk about the french mission and tried to resume his usual habits but in a tavern he became aware that langston under some fresh shape was watching him and hastily throwing down the reckoning he fled without his cloak or sword to gages house at westminster where he took horse hid himself in st johns wood and finally was taken half starved in an outhouse at harrow belonging to a farmer whose mercy involved him in the like doom  this was the substance of the story told by the unfortunate young man to richard talbot whom he owned as the best and wisest friend he had ever hadgoing back to the warnings twice given that no cause is served by departing from the right no kingdom safely won by worshipping the devil and sure i did worship him when i let myself be led by gifford he said  his chief anxiety was not for his wife and her child who he said would be well taken care of by the ratcliffe family and who alas had never won his heart  in fact he was relieved that he was not permitted to see the young thing even had she wished it it could do no good to either of them though he had written a letter which she was to deliver for the queen commending her to her majestys mercy  his love had been for cicely and even that had never been as richard saw such purifying restraining selfsacrificing affection as was humfreys  it was half romance half a sort of offshoot from his one great and absorbing passion of devotion to the queen of scots which was still as strong as ever  he entrusted richard with his humblest commendations to her and strove to rest in the belief that as many a conspirator beforesuch as norfolk throckmorton parryhad perished on her behalf while she remained untouched that so it might again be since surely if she were to be tried he would have been kept alive as a witness  the peculiar custom of the time in state prosecutions of hanging the witnesses before the trial had not occurred to him  but how would it be with cicely  is what this fellow guessed the very truth he asked  richard made a sign of affirmation saying is it only a guess on his part  babington believed the man stopped short of absolute certainty though he had declared himself to have reason to believe that a child must have been born to the captive queen at lochleven and if so where else could she be  was he waiting for clear proof to make the secret known to the council  did he intend to make profit of it and obtain in the poor girl a subject for further intrigue  was he withheld by consideration for richard talbot for whom babington declared that if such a villain could be believed in any respect he had much family regard and deep gratitude since richard had stood his friend when all his family had cast him off in much resentment at his change of purpose and opinion  at any rate he had in his power cicelys welfare and liberty if not the lives of her adopted parents since in the present juncture of affairs and of universal suspicion the concealment of the existence of one who stood so near the throne might easily be represented as high treason  where was he  no one knew  for appearance sake gifford had fled beyond seas happily only to fall into a prison of the duke of guise and they must hope that langston might have followed the same course meantime richard could but go on as before cicely being now in her own mothers hands  the avowal of her identity must remain for the present as might be determined by her who had the right to decide  i would i could feel hope for any i leave behind me said poor antony  i trow you will not bear the maiden my message for you will deem it a sin that i have loved her and only her to the last though i have been false to that love as to all else beside  tell humfrey how i long that i had been like him though he too must love on without hope  he sent warm greetings to good mistress susan talbot and craved her prayers  he had one other care namely to commend to mr talbot an old body servant harry gillingham by name who had attended on him in his boyhood at sheffield and had been with him all his life being admitted even now under supervision from the warders to wait on him when dressing and at his meals  the poor man was brokenhearted and so near desperation that his master wished much to get him out of london before the execution  so as mr talbot meant to sail for hull by the next days tide in the mastiff he promised to take the poor fellow with him back to bridgefield  all this had taken much time  antony did not seem disposed to go farther into his own feelings in the brief space that remained but he took up a paper from the table and indicating tichborne who still affected sleep he asked whether it was fit that a man who could write thus should die for a plot against which he had always protested richard read these touching lines            my prime of youth is but a frost of care             my feast of joy is but a dish of pain           my crop of corn is but a field of tares             and all my goods is but vain hope of gain           the day is fled and yet i saw no sun           and now i live and now my life is done            my spring is past and yet it hath not sprung             the fruit is dead and yet the leaves are green           my youth is past and yet i am but young             i saw the world and yet i was not seen           my thread is cut and yet it is not spun           and now i live and now my life is done            i sought for death and found it in the wombe             i lookt for life and yet it was a shade           i trode the ground and knew it was my tombe             and now i dye and now i am but made           the glass is full and yet my glass is run           and now i live and now my life is done  little used to poetry these lines made the good mans eyes fill with tears as he looked at the two goodly young men about to be cut off so earlyone indeed guilty but the victim of an iniquitous act of deliberate treachery  he asked if mr tichborne wished to entrust to him aught that could be done by word of mouth and a few commissions were given to him then antony bethought him of thanks to lord and lady shrewsbury for all they had done for him and above all for sending mr talbot and a message to ask pardon for having so belied the loyal education they had given him  the divided religion of the country had been his bane his mothers charge secretly to follow her faith had been the beginning and then had followed the charms of stratagem on behalf of queen mary  perhaps after all his death as a repentant man still single minded saved him from lapsing into the double vileness of the veteran intriguers whose prey he had been  i commend me to the mercy master who sees my heart he said  herewith the warder returned and at his request summoned gillingham a sturdy grizzled fellow looking grim with grief  babington told him of the arrangement made and that he was to leave london early in the morning with mr talbot but the man immediately dropped on his knees and swore a solemn oath that nothing should induce him to leave the place while his master breathed  thou foolish knave said antony thou canst do me no good and wilt but make thyself a more piteous wretch than thou art already why tis for love of thee that i would have thee spared the sight  am i a babe to be spared growled the man  and all that he could be induced to promise was that he would repair to bridgefield as soon as all was overunless said he i meet one of those accursed rogues and then a halter would be sweet if i had first had my will of them  hush harry or master warder will be locking thee up next said antony  and then came the farewell  it was at last a long speechless sorrowful embrace and then antony slipping from it to his knees saidbless me  oh bless me thou who hast been mine only true friend  bless me as a father  may god in heaven bless thee said richard solemnly laying his hand on his head  may he who knoweth how thou hast been led astray pardon thee  may he who hath felt the agonies and shame of the cross redeem thee and suffer thee not for any pains of death to fall from him  he was glad to hear afterwards when brokenhearted gillingham joined him that the last words heard from antony babingtons lips wereparce mihi domine jesu     chapter xxxiv  fotheringhay   is this my last journey said queen mary with a strange sad smile as she took her seat in the heavy lumbering coach which had been appointed for her conveyance from chartley her rheumatism having set in too severely to permit her to ride  say not so your grace has weathered many a storm before said marie de courcelles  this one will also pass over  ah my good marie never before have i felt this foreboding and sinking of the heart  i have always hoped before but i have exhausted the casket of pandora  even hope is flown  jean kennedy tried to say something of darkest before dawn  the dawn it may be of the eternal day said the queen  nay my friends the most welcome tidings that could greet me would be that my weary bondage was over for ever and that i should wreck no more gallant hearts  what mignonne art thou weeping  there will be freedom again for thee when that day comes  o madam i want not freedom at such a price  and yet cicely had never recovered her looks since those seventeen days at tickhill she still looked white and thin and her dark eyebrows lay in a heavy line seldom lifted by the merry looks and smiles that used to flash over her face  life had begun to press its weight upon her and day after day as humfrey watched her across the chapel and exchanged a word or two with her while crossing the yard had he grieved at her altered mien and vexed himself with wondering whether she had after all loved babington and were mourning for him  truly even without the passion of love there had been much to shock and appal a young heart in the fate of the playfellow of her childhood the suitor of her youth  it was the first death among those she had known intimately and even her small knowledge of the cause made her feel miserable and almost guilty for had not poor antony plotted for her mother and had not she been held out to him as a delusive inducement  moreover she felt the burden of a deep pitying love and admiration not wholly joined with perfect trust and reliance  she had been from the first startled by untruths and concealments  there was mystery all round her and the future was dark  there were terrible forebodings for her mother and if she looked beyond for herself only uncertainty and fear of being commanded to follow marie de courcelles to a foreign court perhaps to a convent while she yearned with an almost sick longing for home and kind mrs talbots motherly tenderness and trustworthiness and the very renunciation of humfrey that she had spoken so easily had made her aware of his full worth and wakened in her a longing for the right to rest on his stout arm and faithful heart  to look across at him and know him near often seemed her best support and was she to be cut off from him for ever  the devotions of the queen though she had been deprived of her almoner had been much increased of late as one preparing for death and with them were associated all her household of the roman catholic faith leaving out cicely and the two mrs curlls  the long oftrepeated latin orisons such as the penitential psalms would certainly have been wearisome to the girl but it gave her a pang to be pointedly excluded as one who had no part nor lot with her mother  perhaps this was done by calculation in order to incline her to embrace her mothers faith and the time was not spent very pleasantly as she had nothing but needlework to occupy her and no society save that of the sisters curll  barbaras spirits were greatly depressed by the loss of her infant and anxiety for her husband  his evidence might be life or death to the queen and his betrayal of her confidence or his being tortured for his fidelity were terrible alternatives for his wifes imagination  it was hard to say whether she were more sorry or glad when on leaving chartley she was forbidden to continue her attendance on the queen and set free to follow him to london  the poor lady knew nothing and dreaded everything  she could not help discussing her anxieties when alone with cicely thus rendering perceptible more and more of the ramifications of plot and intriguepast and presentat which she herself only guessed a part  assuredly the finding herself a princess and sharing the captivity of a queen had not proved so like a chapter of the morte darthur as it had seemed to cicely at buxton  it was as unlike as was riding a white palfrey through a forest guided by knights in armour to the being packed with all the ladies into a heavy jolting conveyance guarded before and behind by armed servants and yeomen among whom humfreys form could only now and then be detected  the queen had chosen her seat where she could best look out from the scant amount of window  she gazed at the harvestfields full of sheaves the orchards laden with ruddy apples the trees assuming their autumn tints with lingering eyes as of one who foreboded that these sights of earth were passing from her  two nights were spent on the road one at leicester and on the fourth day the captain in charge of the castle for the governor sir william fitzwilliam who had come to escort and receive her came to the carriage window and bade her look up  this is periho lane he said whence your grace may have the first sight of the poor house which is to have the honour of receiving you  perio i perish repeated mary an ominous road  the place showed itself to be of immense strength  the hollow sound caused by rolling over a drawbridge was twice heard and the carriage crossed two courts before stopping at the foot of a broad flight of stone steps where stood sir william fitzwilliam and sir amias paulett ready to hand out the queen  a few stone steps were mounted then an enormous hall had to be traversed  the little procession had formed in pairs and humfrey was able to give his hand to cicely and walk with her along the vast space on which many windows emblazoned with coats of arms shed their lightthe western ones full of the bright september sunshine  one of these emblazoned with the royal shield in crimson mantlings cast a bloodred stain on the white stone pavement  mary who was walking first holding by the arm of sir andrew melville paused shuddered pointed and said see andrew there will my blood be shed  madam madam speak not thus  by the help of the saints you will yet win through your troubles  ay andrew but only by one fate and she looked upwards  her faithful followers could not but notice that there was no eager assurance that no ill was intended her such as they had often heard from shrewsbury and sadler  cicely looked at humfrey with widelyopened eyes and the halfbreathed question what does it mean  he shook his head gravely and said i cannot tell but he could not keep his manner from betraying that he expected the worst  meanwhile mary was conducted on to her apartments up a stair as usual and forming another side of the inner court at right angles to the hall  there was no reason to complain of these marys furniture having as usual been sent forward with her inferior servants and arranged by them  she was weary and sat down at once on her chair and as soon as paulett had gone through his usual formalities with even more than his wonted stiffness and had left her she said i see what we are come here for  it is that yonder hall may be the place of my death  cheering assurances and deprecations of evil augury were poured on her but she put them aside saying nay my friends trow you not that i rejoice in the close of my weary captivity  she resumed her usual habits very calmly as far as her increased rheumatism would permit and showed anxiety that a large piece of embroidery should be completed and thus about a fortnight passed then came the first token of the future  sir amias paulett sir walter mildmay and a notary sought her presence and presented her with a letter from queen elizabeth informing her that there were heavy accusations against her and that as she was residing under the protection of the laws of england she must be tried by those laws and must make answer to the commissioners appointed for the purpose mary put on all her queenly dignity and declared that she would never condescend to answer as a subject of the queen of england but would only consent to refer their differences to a tribunal of foreign princes  as to her being under the protection of english law she had come to england of her own free will and had been kept there a prisoner ever since so that she did not consider herself protected by the law of england  meanwhile fresh noblemen commissioned to sit on the trial arrived day by day  there was trampling of horses and jingling of equipments and the captive suite daily heard reports of fresh arrivals and saw glimpses of new colours and badges flitting across the court while conferences were held with mary in the hope of inducing her to submit to the english jurisdiction  she was sorely perplexed seeing as she did that to persist in her absolute refusal to be bound by english law would be prejudicial to her claim to the english crown and being also assured by burghley that if she refused to plead the trial would still take place and she would be sentenced in her absence  her spirit rose at this threat and she answered disdainfully but it worked with her none the less when the treasurer had left her  oh she cried that night would but elizabeth be content to let me resign my rights to my son making them secure to him and then let me retire to some convent in lorraine or in germany or wherever she would so would i never trouble her more  will you not write this to her asked cicely  what would be the use of it child  they would tamper with the letter pledging me to what i never would undertake  i know how they can cut and garble add and take away  never have they let me see or speak to her as woman to woman  all i have said or done has been coloured  mother i would that i could go to her humfrey has seen and spoken to her why should not i  thou poor silly maid  they would drive cis talbot away with scorn and as to bride hepburn why she would but run into all her mothers dangers  it might be done and if so i will do it said cicely clasping her hands together  no child say no more  my wornout old life is not worth the risk of thy young freedom  but i love thee for it mine ain bairnie mon enfant a moi  if thy brother had thy spirit child  i hate the thought of him  call him not my brother cried cicely hotly  if he were worth one brass farthing he would have unfurled the scottish lion long ago and ridden across the border to deliver his mother  and how many do you think would have followed that same lion said mary sadly  then he should have come alone with his good horse and his good sword  to lose both crowns if not life  no no lassie he is a pawky chiel as they say in the north and cares not to risk aught for the mother he hath never seen and of whom he hath been taught to believe strange tales  the more the queen said in excuse for the indifference of her son the stronger was the purpose that grew up in the heart of the daughter while fresh commissioners arrived every day and further conversations were held with the queen  lord shrewsbury was known to be summoned and cicely spent half her time in watching for some wellknown face in the hope that he might bring her good fosterfather in his train  more than once she declared that she saw a cap or sleeve with the wellbeloved silver dog when it turned out to be a wyvern or the royal lion himself  queen mary even laughed at her for thinking her mastiff had gone on his hind legs when she once even imagined him in the warwick bear and ragged staff  at last however all unexpectedly while the queen was in conference with hatton there came a message by the steward of the household that master richard talbot had arrived and that permission had been granted by sir amias for him to speak with mistress cicely  she sprang up joyously but mrs kennedy demurred  set him up quoth she  my certie things are come to a pretty pass that any ones permission save her majestys should be speired for one of her women and i wonder that you my mistress should be the last to think of her honour  o mrs kennedy dear mrs jean entreated cicely hinder me not if i wait till i can ask her i may lose my sole hope of speaking with him  i know she would not be displeased and it imports indeed it imports  come mrs kennett said the steward who by no means shared his masters sourness if it were a young gallant that craved to see thy fair mistress i could see why you should doubt but being her father and brother there can surely be no objection  the young lady knows what i mean said the old gentlewoman with great dignity but if she will answer it to the queen  i will i will cried cicely whose colour had risen with eagerness and she was immediately marshalled by the steward beyond the door that closed in the royal captives suite of apartments to a gallery  at the door of communication three yeomen were always placed under an officer humfrey was one of those who took turns to command this guard but he was not now on duty  he was however standing beside his father awaiting cicelys coming  eagerly she moved up to master richard bent her knee for his blessing and raised her face for his paternal kiss with the same fond gladness as if she had been his daughter in truth  he took one hand and humfrey the other and they followed the steward who had promised to procure them a private interview so difficult a matter in the fulness of the castle that he had no place to offer them save the deep embrasure of a great oriel window at the end of the gallery they would be seen there but there was no fear of their being heard without their own consent and till the chapel bell rang for evening prayers and sermon there would be no interruption  and as cicely found herself seated between master richard and the window with humfrey opposite she was sensible of a repose and bien etre she had not felt since she quitted bridgefield  she had already heard on the way that all was well there and that my lord was not come though named in the commission as being earl marshal of england sending his kinsman of bridgefield in his stead with letters of excuse  in sooth he cannot bear to come and sit in judgment on one he hath known so long and closely said richard but he hath bidden me to come hither and remain so as to bring him a full report of all  how doth my lady countess take that asked humfrey  i question whether the countess would let him go if he wished it she is altogether changed in mind and come round to her first love for this lady declaring that it is all her lords fault that the custody was taken from them and that she could and would have hindered all this  that may be so said humfrey  if all be true that is whispered there have been dealings which would not have been possible at sheffield  so it may be  in any wise my lady is bitterly grieved and they send for thy mother every second day to pacify her  dear mother murmured cis when shall i see her again  i would that she had thee for a little space my wench said richard thou hast lost thy round ruddy cheeks  hast been sick  nay sir save as we all aresick at heart  but all seems well now you are here  tell me of little ned  is he as good scholar as ever  verily he is  we intend by gods blessing to bring him up for the ministry  i hope in another year to take him to cambridge  thy mother is knitting his hosen of gray and black already  other questions and answers followed about bridgefield tidings which still evidently touched cicely as closely as if she had been a born talbot  there was a kind of rest in dwelling on these before coming to the sadder more pressing concern of her other life  it was not till the slow striking of the castle clock warned them that they had less than an hour to spend together that they came to closer matters and richard transferred to cicely those last sad messages to her queen which he had undertaken for babington and tichborne  the queen hath shed many tears for them she said and hath writ to the french and spanish ambassadors to have masses said for them poor antony  did he send no word to me dear father  the man being dead mr talbot saw no objection to telling her how he had said he had never loved any other though he had been false to that love  ah poor antony said cis with her grave simplicity  but it would not have been right for me to be a hindrance to the marriage of one who could never have me  while he loved you it would said humfrey hastily  yea as she lifted up her eyes to him it would so as my father will tell you because he could not truly love that other woman  richard smiled sadly and could not but assent to his sons honest truth and faith  then said cis with the same straightforwardness sprung of their old fraternal intercourse you must quit all love for me save a brothers humfrey for my queen mother made me give her my word on my duty never to wed you  i know returned humfrey calmly  i have known all that these two years but what has that to do with my love  come come children said richard hardening himself though his eyes were moist i did not come here to hear you two discourse like the folks in a pastoral  we may not waste time  tell me child if thou be not forbidden hath she any purpose for thee  o sir i fear that what she would most desire is to bestow me abroad with some of her kindred of lorraine  but i mean to strive hard against it and pray her earnestly  and father i have one great purpose  she saith that these cruel statesmen who are all below in this castle have hindered queen elizabeth from ever truly hearing and knowing all and from speaking with her as woman to woman father i will go to london i will make my way to the queen and when she hears who i amof her own blood and kindredshe must listen to me and i will tell her what my mother queen really is and how cruelly she has been played upon and entreat of her to see her face to face and talk with her and judge whether she can have done all she is accused of  thou art a brave maiden cis exclaimed humfrey with deep feeling  will you take me sir said cicely looking up to master richard  child i cannot say at once  it is a perilous purpose and requires much to be thought over  but you will aid me she said earnestly  if it be thy duty woe be to me if i gainsay thee said richard but there is no need to decide as yet  we must await the issue of this trial if the trial ever take place  will cavendish saith put in humfrey that a trial there will be of some sort whether the lady consent to plead or not  until that is ended we can do nothing said his father  meantime cicely child we shall be here at hand and be sure that i will not be slack to aid thee in what may be thy duty as a daughter  so rest thee in that my wench and pray that we may be led to know the right  and richard spoke as a man of high moral courage in making this promise well knowing that it might involve himself in great danger the worst that could befall cicely might be imprisonment and a life of constraint jealously watched but his own long concealment of her birth might easily be construed into treason and the horrible consequences of such an accusation were only too fresh in his memory yet as he said afterwards to his son there was no forbidding the maiden to do her utmost for her own mother neither was there any letting her run the risk alone  to which humfrey heartily responded  the queen may forbid her or the purpose may pass away added richard or it may be clearly useless and impossible to make the attempt but i cannot as a christian man strive to dissuade her from doing what she can  and as thou saidst humfrey she is changed she hath borne her modestly and discreetly ay and truly through all  the childishness is gone out of her and i mark no lightness of purpose in her  on that afternoon queen mary announced that she had yielded to hattons representations so far as to consent to appear before the commissioners provided her protest against the proceedings were put on record  nay blame me not good melville she said i am wearied out with their arguments  what matters it how they do the deed on which they are bent  it was an ill thing when king harry the eighth brought in this fashion of forcing the law to give a colour to his will  in the good old times the blow came without being first baited by one and another and made a spectacle to all men in the name of justice forsooth  mary seaton faltered something of her majestys innocence shining out like the light of day  flatter not thyself so far ma mie said mary  were mine innocence clearer than the sun they would blacken it  all that can come of this same trial is that i may speak to posterity if they stifle my voice here and so be known to have died a martyr to my faith  get we to our prayers girls rather than feed on vain hopes de profundis clamavi     chapter xxxv  before the commissioners   who would be permitted to witness the trial  as small matters at hand eclipse great matters farther off this formed the immediate excitement in queen marys little household when it was disclosed that she was to appear only attended by sir andrew melville and her two maries before her judges  the vast hall had space enough on the ground for numerous spectators and a small gallery intended for musicians was granted with some reluctance to the ladies and gentlemen of the suite who as sir amias paulett observed could do no hurt if secluded there  thither then they proceeded and to cicelys no small delight found humfrey awaiting them there partly as a guard partly as a master of the ceremonies ready to explain the arrangements and tell the names of the personages who appeared in sight  there said he close below us where you cannot see it is the chair with a cloth of state over it  for our queen asked jean kennedy  no madam it is there to represent the majesty of queen elizabeth that other chair halfway down the hall with the canopy from the beam over it is for the queen of scots  jean kennedy sniffed the air a little at this but her attention was directed to the gentlemen who began to fill the seats on either side some of them had before had interviews with queen mary and thus were known by sight to her own attendants some had been seen by humfrey during his visit to london and even now at a great distance and a different table he had been taking his meals with them at the present juncture  the seats were long benches against the wall for the earls on one side the barons on the other  the lord chancellor bromley in his red and white gown and burghley the lord treasurer with long white beard and hard impenetrable face sat with them  that a man should have such a beard and yet dare to speak to the queen as he did two days ago whispered cis  see said mrs kennedy who is that burly figure with the black eyes and grizzled beard  that madam said humfrey is the earl of warwick  the brother of the minion leicester said jean kennedy  he hath scant show of his comeliness  nay they say he is become the best favoured said humfrey my lord of leicester being grown heavy and redfaced  he is away in the netherlands or you might judge of him  and who asked the lady may be yon with the strangelyplumed hat and long yellow hair like a halftamed borderer  he said humfrey  he is my lord of cumberland  i marvelled to see him back so soon  he is here there and everywhere and when i was in london was commanding a fleet bearing victuals to relieve the dutch in helvoetsluys  had i not other work in hand i would gladly sail with him though there be something fantastic in his humour but here come the knights of the privy council who are to my mind more noteworthy than the earls  the seats of these knights were placed a little below and beyond those of the noblemen  the courteous sir ralf sadler looked up and saluted the ladies in the gallery as he entered  he was always kindly said jean kennedy as she returned the bow  i am glad to see him here  but oh humfrey cried cicely who is yonder with the short cloak standing on end with pearls and the quilted satin waistcoat jewelled ears and frizzed head  he looks fitter to lead off a dance than a trial  he is sir christopher hatton her majestys vicechamberlain replied humfrey  who if rumour saith true made his fortune by a galliard said dr bourgoin  here is a contrast to him said jean kennedy  see that figure as puritanical as sir amias himself with the long face scant beard black skullcap and plain crimped ruff  his visage is pulled into so solemn a length that were we at home in edinburgh i should expect to see him ascend a pulpit and deliver a screed to us all on the iniquities of dancing and playing on the lute  that madam said humfrey is mr secretary sir francis walsingham  here elizabeth curll leant forward looked and shivered a little ah master humfrey is it in that mans power that my poor brother lies  tis true madam said humfrey but indeed you need not fear  i heard from will cavendish last night that mr curll is well  they have not touched either of the secretaries to hurt them and if aught have been avowed it was by monsieur nau and that on the mere threat  do you see old will yonder cicely just within mr secretarys callwith the poke of papers and the tablet  is that will cavendish  how precise and stiff he hath grown and why doth he not look up and greet us  he knoweth us far better than doth sir ralf sadler doth he not know we are here  ay mistress cicely said dr bourgoin from behind but the young gentleman has his fortune to make and knows better than to look on the seamy side of court favour  ah see those scarlet robes here exclaimed cis  are they the judges humfrey  ay the two chiefjustices and the chief baron of the exchequer there they sit in front of the earls and three more judges in front of the barons  and there are more red robes at that little table in front besides the black ones  those are doctors of law and those in black with coifs are the attorney and solicitor general  the rest are clerks and writers and the like  it is a mighty and fearful array said cicely with a long breath  a mighty comedy wherewith to mock at justice said jean  prudence madam and caution suggested dr bourgoin  and hush  a crier here shouted aloud oyez oyez oyez  mary queen of scotland and dowager of france come into the court  then from a door in the centre leaning on sir andrew melvilles arm came forward the queen in a black velvet dress her long transparent veil hanging over it from her cap and followed by the two maries one carrying a crimson velvet foldingchair and the other a footstool she turned at first towards the throne but she was motioned aside and made to perceive that her place was not there she drew her slender figure up with offended dignity  i am a queen she said i married a king of france and my seat ought to be there  however with this protest she passed on to her appointed place looking sadly round at the assembled judges and lawyers  alas she said so many counsellors and not one for me  were there any englishmen there besides richard talbot and his son who felt the pathos of this appeal  one defenceless woman against an array of the legal force of the whole kingdom  it may be feared that the feelings of most were as if they had at last secured some wild noxious and incomprehensible animal in their net on whose struggles they looked with the unpitying eye of the hunter  the lord chancellor began by declaring that the queen of england convened the court as a duty in one who might not bear the sword in vain to examine into the practices against her own life giving the queen of scots the opportunity of clearing herself  at the desire of burghley the commission was read by the clerk of the court and mary then made her public protest against its legality or power over her  it was a wonderful thing as those spectators in the gallery felt to see how brave and how acute was the defence of that solitary lady seated there with all those learned men against her her papers gone nothing left to her but her brain and her tongue  no loss of dignity nor of gentleness was shown in her replies they were always simple and direct  the difficulty for her was all the greater that she had not been allowed to know the form of the accusation before it was hurled against her in full force by mr serjeant gawdy who detailed the whole of the conspiracy of ballard and babington in all its branches and declared her to have known and approved of it and to have suggested the manner of executing it  breathlessly did cicely listen as the queen rose up  humfrey watched her almost more closely than the royal prisoner  when there was a denial of all knowledge or intercourse with ballard or babington jean kennedys hardlined face never faltered but cicelys brows came together in concern at the mention of the last name and did not clear as the queen explained that though many catholics might indeed write to her with offers of service she could have no knowledge of anything they might attempt  to confute this extracts from their confessions were read and likewise that letter of babingtons which he had written to her detailing his plans and that lengthy answer brought by the bluecoated servingman in which the mode of carrying her off from chartley was suggested and which had the postscript desiring to know the names of the six who were to remove the usurping competitor  the queen denied this letter flatly declaring that it might have been written with her alphabet of ciphers but was certainly none of hers there may have been designs against the queen and for procuring my liberty she said but i shut up in close prison was not aware of them and how can i be made to answer for them  only lately did i receive a letter asking my pardon if schemes were made on my behalf without my privity nor can anything be easier than to counterfeit a cipher as was lately proved by a young man in france verily i greatly fear that if these same letters were traced to their deviser it would prove to be the one who is sitting here think you she added turning to walsingham think you mr secretary that i am ignorant of your devices used so craftily against me  your spies surrounded me on every side but you know not perhaps that some of your spies have been false and brought intelligence to me  and if such have been his dealings my lords she said appealing to the judges and peers how can i be assured that he hath not counterfeited my ciphers to bring me to my death hath he not already practised against my life and that of my son  walsingham rose in his place and lifting up his hands and eyes declared i call god to record that as a private person i have done nothing unbeseeming an honest man nor as a public person have i done anything to dishonour my place  somewhat ironically mary admitted this disavowal and after some unimportant discussion the court adjourned until the next day it being already late according to the early habits of the time  cicely had been entirely carried along by her mothers pleading tears had started as queen mary wept her indignant tears and a glow had risen in her cheeks at the accusation of walsingham  ever and anon she looked to humfreys face for sympathy but he sat gravely listening his two hands clasped over the hilt of his sword and his chin resting on them as if to prevent a muscle of his face from moving  when they rose up to leave the galleries and there was the power to say a word she turned to him earnestly  a piteous sight he said and a right gallant defence  he did not mean it but the words struck like lead on cicelys heart for they did not amount to an acquittal before the tribunal of his secret conviction any more than did walsinghams disavowal for who could tell what mr secretarys conscience did think unbecoming to his office  cicely found her mother on her couch giving a free course to her tears in the reaction after the strain and effort of her defence melville and the maries were assuring her that she had most bravely confuted her enemies and that she had only to hold on with equal courage to the end  mrs kennedy and dr bourgoin came in to join in the same encouragements and the commendation evidently soothed her however it may end she said mary of scotland shall not go down to future ages as a craven spirit  but let us not discuss it further my dear friends my head aches and i can bear no farther word at present  dr bourgoin made her take some food and then lie down to rest while in an outer room a lute was played and a low soft song was sung  she had not slept all the previous night but she fell asleep holding the hand of cicely who was on a cushion by her side  the girl having been likewise much disturbed slept too and only gradually awoke as her mother was sitting up on her couch discussing the next days defence with melville and bourgoin  i fear me madam there is no holding to the profession of entire ignorance said melville  they have no letters from babington to me to show said the queen i took care of that by the help of this good bairn  i can defy them to produce the originals out of all my ransacked cabinets  they have the copies both of them and of your majestys replies and nan and curll to verify them  what are copies worth or what are dead and tortured mens confessions worth said mary  were your majesty a private person they would never be accepted as evidence said melville but  but because i am a queen and a catholic there is no justice for me said mary  well what is the defence you would have me confine myself to my sole privy counsellors  here cis to show she was awake pressed her mothers hand and looked up in her face but mary though returning the glance and the pressure did not send her away while melville recommended strongly that the queen should continue to insist on the imperfection of the evidence adduced against her which he said might so touch some of the lawyers or the nobles that burghley and walsingham might be afraid to proceed if this failed her she must allow her knowledge of the plot for her own escape and the spanish invasion but strenuously deny the part which concerned elizabeths life  that it is which they above all desire to fix on me said the queen  cicelys brain was in confusion  surely she had heard those letters read in the hall  were they false or genuine  the queen had utterly denied them there  now she seemed to think the only point was to prove that these were not the originals  dr bourgoin seemed to feel the same difficulty  madame will pardon me he said i have not been of her secret councils but can she not if rightly dealt with prove those two letters that were read to have been forged by her enemies  what i could do is this my good bourgoin said mary were i only confronted with nau and curll i could prove that the letter i received from babington bore nothing about the destroying the usurping competitor  the poor faithful lad was a fool but not so great a fool as to tell me such things  and on the other hand hath either of you my friends ever seen in me such symptoms of midsummer madness as that i should be asking the names of the six who were to do the deed  what cared i for their names  iwho only wished to know as little of the matter as possible  can your majesty prove that you knew nothing asked melville  mary paused  they cannot prove by fair means that i knew anything said she for i did not  of course i was aware that elizabeth must be taken out of the way or the heretics would be rallying round her but there is no lack of folk who delight in work of that sort and why should i meddle with the knowledge  with the prince of parma in london she if she hath the high courage she boasteth of would soon cause the spanish pikes to use small ceremony with her  why should i concern myself about poor antony and his five gentlemen  but it is the same as it was twenty years ago  what i know will have to be and yet choose not to hear of is made the head and front of mine offending that the real actors may go free  and because i have writ naught that they can bring against me they take my letters and add to and garble them till none knows where to have them  would that we were in france  there it was a good swordcut or pistolshot at once and one took ones chance of a return without all this hypocrisy of law and justice to weary one out and make men double traitors  methought walsingham winced when your majesty went to the point with him said bourgoin  and you put up with his explanation said melville  truly i longed to demand of what practices mr secretary in his officenot as a private personwould be ashamed but it seemed to me that they might call it womanish spite and to that the queen of scots will never descend  pity but that we had babingtons letter  then might we put him to confusion by proving the additions said melville  it is not possible my good friend  the letter is at the bottom of the castle well is it not mignonne  mourn for it not andrew  it would have been of little avail and it carried with it stuff that mr secretary would give almost his precious place to possess and that might be fatal to more of us  i hoped that there might have been safety for poor babington in the destruction of that packet never guessing at the villainy of yon burton brewer nor of those who set him on  come it serves not to fret ourselves any more  i must answer as occasion serves me speaking not so much to elizabeths commission who have foredoomed me as to all christendom and to the scots and english of all ages who will be my judges  her judges  ay but how  with the same enthusiastic pity and indignation mixed with the same misgiving as her own daughter felt not wholly innocent not wholly guilty yet far less guilty than those who had laid their own crimes on her in scotland or who plotted to involve her in meshes partly woven by herself in england the evil done to her was frightful but it would have been powerless had she been wholly blameless  alas is it not so with all of us  the second days trial came on  mary seaton was so overpowered with the strain she had gone through that the queen would not take her into the hall but let cicely sit at her feet instead  on this day none of the crown lawyers took part in the proceedings for as cavendish whispered to humfrey there had been high words between them and my lord treasurer and mr secretary and they had declared themselves incapable of conducting a prosecution so inconsistent with the forms of law to which they were accustomed  the pedantic fellows wanted more direct evidence he said and humfrey honoured them  lord burghley then conducted the proceedings and they had thus a more personal character  the queen however acted on melvilles advice and no longer denied all knowledge of the conspiracy but insisted that she was ignorant of the proposed murder of elizabeth and argued most pertinently that a copy of a deciphered cipher without the original was no proof at all desiring further that nau and curll should be examined in her presence  she reminded the commissioners how their queen herself had been called in question for wyatts rebellion in spite of her innocence  heaven is my witness she added that much as i desire the safety and glory of the catholic religion i would not purchase it at the price of blood i would rather play esther than judith  her defence was completed by her taking off the ring which elizabeth had sent to her at lochleven  this she said holding it up your queen sent to me in token of amity and protection  you best know how that pledge has been redeemed  therewith she claimed another days hearing with an advocate granted to her or else that being a princess she might be believed on the word of a princess  this completed her defence except so far that when burghley responded in a speech of great length she interrupted and battled point by point always keeping in view the strong point of the insufficient evidence and her own deprivation of the chances of confuting what was adduced against her  it was late in the afternoon when he concluded  there was a pause as though for a verdict by the commissioners  instead of this mary rose and repeated her appeal to be tried before the parliament of england at westminster  no reply was made and the court broke up     chapter xxxvi  a venture   mother dear mother do but listen to me  i must listen child when thou callest me so from your heart but it is of no use my poor little one  they have referred the matter to the star chamber that they may settle it there with closed doors and no forms of law  thou couldst do nothing  and could i trust thee to go wandering to london like a maiden in a ballad all alone  nay madam i should not go alone  my father i mean mr talbot would take me  come bairnie that is presuming overmuch on the good mans kindness  i do not speak without warrant madam  i told him what i longed to do and he said it might be my duty and if it were so he would not gainsay me but that he could not let me go alone and would go with me  and he can get access for me to the queen  he has seen her himself and so has humfrey and diccon is a gentleman pensioner  there have been ventures enough for me already said mary  i will bring no more faithful heads into peril  then will you not consent mother  he will quit the castle tomorrow and i am to see him in the morning and give him an answer if you would let me go he would crave license to take me home saying that i look paler than my wont  and so thou dost child  if i could be sure of ever seeing thee again i should have proposed thy going home to good mistress susans tendance for a little space  but it is not to be thought of  i could not risk thee or any honest loving heart on so desperate a stake as mine  i love thee mine ain true leal lassie all the more and i honour him but it may not be  ask me no more  mary was here interrupted by a request from sir christopher hatton for one of the many harassing interviews that beset her during the days following the trial when judgment was withheld according to the express command of the vacillating elizabeth and the case remitted to the star chamber  lord burghley considered this hesitation to be the effect of judicial blindnessso utterly had hatred and fear of the future shut his eyes to all sense of justice and fair play  cicely felt all youths disappointment in the rejection of its grand schemes  but to her surprise at night mary addressed her again my daughter did that truehearted fosterfather of thine speak in sooth  he never doth otherwise returned cicely  for said her mother i have thought of a way of gaining thee access to the queen far less perilous to him and less likely to fail  i will give thee letters to m de chateauneuf the french ambassador whom i have known in old times with full credentials it might be well to have with thee those that i left with mistress talbot  then he will gain thee admittance and work for thee as one sent from france and protected by the rights of the embassy  thus master richard need never appear in the matter at all and at any rate thou wouldst be secure  chateauneuf would find means of sending thee abroad if needful  oh i would return to you madam my mother or wait for you in london  that must be as the wills above decree said mary sadly  it is folly in me but i cannot help grasping at the one hope held out to me there is that within me that will hope and strive to the end though i am using my one precious jewel to weight the line i am casting across the gulf  at least they cannot do thee great harm my good child  the queen sat up half the night writing letters one to elizabeth one to chateauneuf and another to the duchess of lorraine which cis was to deliver in case of her being sent over to the continent  but the queen committed the conduct of the whole affair to m de chateauneuf since she could completely trust his discretion and regard for her and moreover it was possible that the face of affairs might undergo some great alteration before cicely could reach london  mr talbot must necessarily go home first being bound to do so by his commission to the earl  and hark thee said the queen what becomes of the young gallant  i have not heard madam said cicely not liking the tone  if my desires still have any effect said mary he will stay here i will not have my damosel errant squired by a youth under fiveandtwenty  i promised you madam and he wots it said cicely with spirit  he wots it doth he said the queen in rather a provoking voice no no mignonne with all respect to their honour and discretion we do not put flint and steel together when we do not wish to kindle a fire  nay little one i meant not to vex thee when thou art doing one of the noblest deeds daughter ever did for mother and for a mother who sent thee away from her and whom thou hast scarce known for more than two years  cicely was sure to see her fosterfather after morning prayers on the way from the chapel across the inner court  here she was able to tell him of the queens consent over which he looked grave having secretly persuaded himself that mary would think the venture too great and not hopeful enough to be made  he could not however wonder that the unfortunate lady should catch at the least hope of preserving her life and she had dragged too many down in the whirlpool to leave room for wonder that she should consent to peril her own daughter therein moreover he would have the present pleasure of taking her home with him to his susan and who could say what would happen in the meantime  thou hast counted the cost he said  yea sir cis answered as the young always do adding the queen saith that if we commit all to the french ambassador m de chateauneuf who is her very good friend he will save you from any peril  hm  i had rather be beholden to no frenchman muttered richard but we will see we will see  i must now to paulett to obtain consent to take thee with me  thou art pale and changed enough indeed to need a blast of hallamshire air my poor maid  so master richard betook him to the knight a man of many charges and made known that finding his daughter somewhat puling and sickly he wished having as she told him the consent of the queen of scots to take her home with him for a time  you do well mr talbot said sir amias  in sooth i have only marvelled that a pious and godly man like you should have consented to let her abide so long at her tender age among these papistical idolatrous and bloodthirsty women  i think not that she hath taken harm said richard  i have done my poor best i have removed the priest of baal said the knight i have caused godly ministers constantly to preach sound doctrine in the ears of all who would hearken and i have uplifted my testimony whensoever it was possible  but it is not well to expose the young to touching the accursed thing and this lady hath shown herself greatly affected to your daughter so that she might easily be seduced from the truth  yet sir bethink you is it well to remove the maiden from witnessing that which will be a warning for ever of the judgment that falleth on conspiracy and idolatry  you deem the matter so certain said richard  beyond a doubt sir  this lady will never leave these walls alive there can be no peace for england nor safety for our blessed and gracious queen while she lives  her guilt is certain and as mr secretary said to me last night he and the lord treasurer are determined that for no legal quibbles nor scruples of mercy from our everpitiful queen shall she now escape  her majesty however her womanish heart may doubt now will rejoice when the deed is done methinks i showed you the letter she did me the honour to write thanking me for the part i took in conveying the lady suddenly to tixall  richard had already read that letter three times so he avowed his knowledge of it  you will not remove your son likewise added sir amias  he hath an acquaintance with this ladys people which is useful in one so thoroughly to be trusted and moreover he will not be tampered with for sir i am never without dread of some attempt being made to deal with this lady privily in which case i should be the one to bear all the blame  wherefore i have made request to have another honourable gentleman joined with me in this painful wardship  richard had no desire to remove his son  he shared queen marys feelings on the inexpediency of humfrey forming part of the escort of the young lady and thought it was better for both to see as little of one another as possible  sir amias accordingly on his morning visit of inspection intimated to the queen that mr talbot wished his daughter to return home with him for the recovery of her health  he spoke as if the whole suite were at his own disposal and mary resented it in her dignified manner  the young lady hath already requested license from us she said and we have granted it  she will return when her health is fully restored  sir amias had forbearance enough not to hint that unless the return were speedy she would scarcely find the queen there and the matter was settled  master richard would not depart until after dinner when other gentlemen were going and this would enable cicely to make up her mails and there would still be time to ride a stage before dark  her own horse was in the stables and her goods would be bestowed in cloak bags on the saddles of the grooms who had accompanied mr talbot for small as was the estate of bridgefield for safetys sake he could not have gone on so long an expedition without a sufficient guard  the intervening time was spent by the queen in instructing her daughter how to act in various contingencies  if it were possible to the french ambassador to present her as freshly come from the soissons convent where she was to have been reared it would save mr talbot from all risk but the queen doubted whether she could support the character so english was her air though there were scottish and english nuns at soissons and still more at louvaine and douay who might have brought her up  i cannot feign madam said cicely alarmed  oh i hope i need only speak truth and her tone sounded much more like a confession of incapacity than a moral objection and so it was received poor child i know thou canst not act a part and thy return to the honest mastiffs will not further thee in it but i have bidden chateauneuf to do what he can for theeand after all the eyes will not be very critical  if there still was time cicely was to endeavour first of all to obtain of elizabeth that mary might be brought to london to see her and be judged before parliament with full means of defence  if this were no longer possible cicely might attempt to expose walsinghams contrivance but this would probably be too dangerous  chateauneuf must judge  or as another alternative queen mary gave cicely the ring already shown at the trial and with that as her pledge a solemn offer was to be made on her behalf to retire into a convent in austria or in one of the roman catholic cantons of switzerland out of the reach of spain and france and there take the veil resigning all her rights to her son  all her money had been taken away but she told cicely she had given orders to chateauneuf to supply from her french dowry all that might be needed for the expenses that must be incurred  now that the matter was becoming so real cicelys heart quailed a little  castles in the air that look heroic at the first glance would not so remain did not they show themselves terrible at a nearer approach and the maiden wondered whether queen elizabeth would be much more formidable than my lady countess in a rage  and what would become of herself  would she be detained in the bondage in which the poor sisters of the grey blood had been kept or would her mother carry her off to these strange lands  it was all strange and the very boldness of her offer since it had been thus accepted made her feel helpless and passive in the grasp of the powers that her simple wish had set moving  the letters were sewn up in the most ingenious manner in her dress by mary seaton in case any search should be made but the only woman sir amias would be able to employ in such a matter was purblind and helpless and they trusted much to his implicit faith in the talbots  there was only just time to complete her preparations before she was summoned and with an almost convulsive embrace from her mother and whispered benedictions from jean kennedy she left the dreary walls of fotheringhay  humfrey rode with them through the chase  both he and cicely were very silent  when the time came for parting cicely said as she laid her hand in his dear brother for my sake do all thou canst for her with honour  that will i said humfrey  would that i were going with thee cicely  so would not i she returned for then there would be one true heart the less to watch over her  come daughter said richard who had engaged one of the gentlemen in conversation so as to leave them to themselves  we must be jogging fare thee well my son till such time as thy duties permit thee to follow us     chapter xxxvii  my ladys remorse   and have you brought her back again  o my lass my lass cried mistress susan surprised and delighted out of her usual staid composure as going out to greet her husband an unexpected figure was seen by his side and cicely sprang into her arms as if they were truly a haven of rest  susan looked over her head even in the midst of the embrace with the eyes of one hungering for her firstborn son but her husband shook his head  no mother we have not brought thee the boy  thou must content thyself with her thou hast here for a little space  i hope it bodes not ill said susan  it bodes said richard that i have brought thee back a good daughter with a pair of pale cheeks which must be speedily coloured anew in our northern breezes  ah how sweet to be here at home cried cicely turning round in rapturous greeting to all the serving men and women and all the dogs we want only the boys  where is ned  their arrival having been unannounced ned was with master sniggius whose foremost scholar he now was and who kept him much later than the other lads to prepare him for cambridge but it was the return to this tender fostermother that seemed such extreme bliss to cicely all was most unlike her reluctant return two years previously when nothing but her inbred courtesy and natural sweetness of disposition had prevented her from being contemptuous of the country home  now every stone every leaf seemed precious to her and she showed herself even as she ascended the steps to the hall determined not to be the guest but the daughter  there was a little movement on the parents part as if they bore in mind that she came as a princess but she flew to draw up master richards chair and put his wifes beside it nor would she sit till they had prayed her to do so and it was all done with such a graceful bearing the noble carriage of her head had become so much more remarkable and a sweet readiness and responsiveness of manner had so grown upon her that susan looked at her in wondering admiration as something more her own and yet less her own than ever tracing in her for the first time some of the charms of the queen of scots  all the household hovered about in delight and confidences could not be exchanged just then the travellers had to eat and drink and they were only just beginning to do so when ned came home  he was of slighter make than his brothers and had a more scholarly aspect but his voice made itself heard before him  is it true  is it true that my father is come  and our cis too  ha and he rushed in hardly giving himself time for the respectful greeting to his father before he fell upon cis with undoubting brotherly delight  is humfrey come he asked as soon as he could take breath  no  i thought twas too good to be all true  how did you hear  hob the hunter brought up word that the queens head was off what as cicely gave a start and little scream  is it not so  no indeed boy said his father  what put that folly into his head  because he saw or thought he saw humfrey and cis riding home with you sir and so thought all was over with the queen of scots  my lady they say had one of her shrieking fits and my lord sent down to ask whether i knew aught and when he found that i did not would have me go home at once to bid you come up immediately to the manor and before i had gotten out dapple there comes another message to say that in as brief space as it will take to saddle them there will be beasts here to bring up you and my mother and cis to tell my lady countess all that has befallen  ciss countenance so changed that kind susan said i will make thine excuses to my lady  thou art weary and ill at ease and i cannot have thee set forth at once again  the queen would never have sent such sudden and hasty orders said cicely  mother can you not stay with mei have so much to say to you and my time is short  the talbots were however too much accustomed to obedience to the peremptory commands of their feudal chiefs to venture on such disobedience  susans proposal had been a great piece of audacity on which she would hardly have ventured but for her consciousness that the maiden was no talbot at all  yet to cis the dear company of her mother susan even in the countesss society seemed too precious to be resigned and she had likewise been told that lady shrewsburys mind had greatly changed towards mary and that since the irritation of the captives presence had been removed she remembered only the happier and kindlier portion of their past intercourse  there had been plenty of quarrels with her husband but none so desperate as before and at this present time the earl and countess were united against the surviving sons who with gilbert at their head were making large demands on them  cicely felt grateful to the earl for his absence from fotheringhay and though disappointed of her peaceful home evening declared she would come up to the lodge rather than lose sight of mother  the stable people more considerate than their lord and lady proved to have sent a horse litter for the conveyance of the ladies called out on the wet dark october evening and here it was that cis could enjoy her first precious moment of privacy with one for whom she had so long yearned susan rejoiced in the heavy lumbering conveyance as a luxury sparing the maidens fatigue and she was commencing some inquiries into the indisposition which had procured this holiday when cicely broke in o mother nothing aileth me  it is not for that causebut oh mother i am to go to see queen elizabeth and strive with her for herfor my mothers life and freedom  thou poor little maid  doth thy fatherwhat am i saying  doth my husband know  oh yes  he will take me  he saith it is my duty  then it must be well said susan in an altered voice on hearing this from whom came the proposal  i made it said cicely in a low feeble voice on the verge of tears oh dear mother thou wilt not tell any one how faint of heart i am i did mean it in sooth but i never guessed how dreadful it would grow now i am pledged to it  thou art pledged then and canst not falter  never said cicely i would not that any should know it not even my father but mother mother i could not help telling you  you will let no one guess  i know it is unworthy but  not unworthy to fear my poor child so long as thou dost not waver  it is it is unworthy of my lineage  my mother queen would say so cried cis drawing herself up  giving way would be unworthy said susan but turn thou to thy god my child and he will give thee strength to carry through whatever is the duty of a faithful daughter towards this poor lady and my husband thou sayest holds that so it is  yea madam he craved license to take me home since i have truly often been ailing since those dreadful days at tixall and he hath promised to go to london with me  and is this to be done in thine own true name asked susan trembling somewhat at the risk to her husband as well as to the maiden  i trow that it is said cis but the matter is to be put into the hands of m de chateauneuf the french ambassador  i have a letter here laying her hand on her bosom which the queen declares will thoroughly prove to him who i am and if i go as under his protection none can do my father any harm  susan hoped so but she trusted to understand all better from her husband though her heart failed her as much as or even perhaps more than did that of poor little cis  master richard had sped on before their tardy conveyance and had had time to give the heads of his intelligence before they reached the manor house and when they were conducted to my ladys chamber they saw him by the light of a large fire standing before the earl and countess cap in hand much as a groom or gamekeeper would now stand before his master and mistress  the earl however rose to receive the ladies but the countess no great observer of ceremony towards other people whatever she might exact from them towards herself cried out come hither come hither cicely talbot and tell me how it fares with the poor lady and as the maiden came forward in the dim light ha  what  ist she she cried with a sudden start  on my faith what has she done to thee thou art as like her as the foal to the mare  this exclamation disconcerted the visitors but luckily for them the earl laughed and declared that he could see no resemblance in mistress cicelys dark brows to the arched ones of the queen of scots to which his wife replied testily who said there was  the maid need not be uplifted for theres nothing alike between them only she hath caught the trick of her bearing so as to startle me in the dark my head running on the poor lady  i could have sworn twas she coming in as she was when she first came to our care fifteen years agone  pray heaven she may not haunt the place  how fareth she in health wench  well madam save when the rheumatic pains take her said cicely  and still of good courage  that madam nothing can daunt  seats though only joint stools were given to the ladies but susan found herself no longer trembling at the effects of the countesss insolence upon cicely who seemed to accept it all as a matter of course and almost of indifference though replying readily and with a gentle grace most unlike her childish petulance  many close inquiries from the earl and countess were answered by richard and the young lady until they had a tolerably clear idea of the situation  the countess wept bitterly and to cicelys great amazement began bemoaning herself that she was not still the poor ladys keeper  it was a shame to put her where there were no women to feel for her  lady shrewsbury had apparently forgotten that no one had been so virulent against the queen as herself  and when it was impossible to deny that things looked extremely ill and that burghley and walsingham seemed resolved not to let slip this opportunity of ridding themselves of the prisoner my lady burst out with ah there it is  she will die and my promise is broken and she will haunt me to my dying day all along of that venomous toad and spiteful viper mary talbot  a passionate fit of weeping succeeded mingled with vituperations of her daughter mary far more than of herself and amid it all during susans endeavours at soothing cicely gathered that the cause of the countesss despair was that in the time of her friendship and amity she had uttered an assurance that the queen need not fear death as she would contrive means of safety  and on her own ground in her own castle or lodge there could be little doubt that she would have been able to have done so  the earl indeed shook his head but repented for she laughed at him half angrily half hysterically for thinking he could have prevented anything that she was set upon  and now she said and fully believed that the misunderstanding which had resulted in the removal of the prisoner had been entirely due to the slanders and deceits of her own daughter mary and her husband gilbert with whom she was at this time on the worst of terms  and thus she laid on them the blame of the queens death if that was really decreed but though she outwardly blamed every creature save herself such agony of mind and even terror proved that in very truth there must have been the conviction at the bottom of her heart that it was her own fault  the earl had beckoned away master richard both glad to escape but cicely had to remain and filled with compassion for one whom she had always regarded previously as an enemy she could not help saying dear madam take comfort i am going to bear a petition to the queens majesty from the captive lady and if she will hear me all will yet be well  how  what  how  thou little moppet  knows she what she says susan talbot  susan made answer that she had had time to hear no particulars yet but that cicely averred that she was going with her fathers consent whereupon richard was immediately summoned back to explain  the earl and countess could hardly believe that he should have consented that his daughter should be thus employed and he had to excuse himself with what he could not help feeling were only half truths  the poor lady he said is denied all power of sending word or letter to the queen save through those whom she views as her enemies and therefore she longed earnestly either to see her majesty or to hold communication with her through one whom she knoweth to be both simple and her own friend  yea said the countess i could well have done this for her could i but have had speech with her  or she might have sent bess pierrepoint who surely would have been a more fitting messenger  save that she hath not had access to the queen of scots of late said richard  yea and her father would scarcely be willing to risk the queens displeasure said the earl  art thou ready to abide it master richard said the countess though after all it could do you little harm  and her tone marked the infinite distance she placed between him and sir henry pierrepoint the husband of her daughter  that is true madam said richard and moreover i cannot reconcile it to my conscience to debar the poor lady from any possible opening of safety  thou art a good man richard said the earl and therewith both he and the countess became extremely nay almost inconveniently desirous to forward the petitioner on her way  to listen to them that night they would have had her go as an emissary of the house of shrewsbury and only the previous quarrel with lord talbot and his wife prevented them from proposing that she should be led to the foot of the throne by gilbert himself  cicely began to be somewhat alarmed at plans that would disconcert all the instructions she had received and only her old habits of respect kept her silent when she thought master richard not ready enough to refuse all these offers  at last he succeeded in obtaining license to depart and no sooner was cicely again shut up with mistress susan in the litter than she exclaimed now will it be most hard to carry out the queens orders that i should go first to the french ambassador  i would that my lady countess would not think naught can succeed without her meddling  thou shouldst have let father tell thy purpose in his own way said susan  ah mother i am an indiscreet simpleton not fit for such a work as i have taken in hand said poor cis  here hath my foolish tongue traversed it already  fear not said susan as one who well knew the nature of her kinswoman belike she will have cooled tomorrow all the more because father said naught to the nayward  susan was uneasy enough herself and very desirous to hear all from her husband in private  and that night he told her that he had very little hope of the intercession being availing  he believed that the treasurer and secretary were absolutely determined on marys death and would sooner or later force consent from the queen but there was the possibility that elizabeths feelings might be so far stirred that on a sudden impulse she might set mary at liberty and place her beyond their reach  and hap what may he said when a daughter offereth to do her utmost for a mother in peril of death what right have i to hinder her  may god guard the duteous said susan  but oh husband is she worthy for whom the child is thus to lead you into peril  she is her mother repeated richard  had i erred  which you never could do broke in the wife  i am a sinful man said he  yea but there are deeds you never could have done  by gods grace i trust not but hear me out wife  mine errors nay my crimes would not do away with the duty owed to me by my sons  how then should any sins of this poor queen withhold her daughter from rendering her all the succour in her power  and thou thou thyself susan hast taken her for thine own too long to endure to let her undertake the matter alone and unaided  she would not attempt it thus said susan  i cannot tell but i should thus be guilty of foiling her in a brave and filial purpose  and yet thou dost hold her poor mother a guilty woman  said i so  nay susan i am as dubious as ever i was on that head  after hearing the trial  a word in thine ear my discreet wife  the trial convinced me far more that place makes honest men act like cruel knaves than of aught else  then thou holdest her innocent  i said not so  i have known too long how she lives by the weaving of webs  i know not how it is but these great folks seem not to deem that truth in word and deed is a part of their religion  for my part i should distrust whatever godliness did not lead to truth but a plain man never knows where to have them  that she and poor antony babington were in league to bring hither the spaniards and restore the pope i have no manner of doubt on the word of both but then they deem itheaven help thema virtuous act and it might be lawful in her seeing that she has always called herself a free sovereign unjustly detained  what he stuck at and she denies is the purpose of murdering the queens majesty  sure that was the head and front of the poor young mans offending  so it was but not until he had been urged thereto by his priests and had obtained her consent in a letter  heaven forgive me if i misjudge any one but my belief is thisthat the letters whereof only the deciphered copies were shown did not quit the hands of either the one or the other such as we heard them at fotheringhay so poor babington said so saith the queen of scots demanding vehemently to have them read in her presence before nau and curll who could testify to them cis deemeth that the true letter from babington is in a packet which on learning from humfrey his suspicion that there was treachery the queen gave her and she threw down a well at chartley  that was pity  say not so for had the original letter been seized it would only have been treated in the same manner as the copy and never allowed to reach queen elizabeth  i am glad poor cicelys mother can stand clear of that guilt said susan  i served her too long and received too much gentle treatment from her to brook the thought that she could be so far left to herself  mind you dame said richard i am not wholly convinced that she was not aware that her friends would in some way or other bring about the queens death and that she would scarce have visited it very harshly but she is far too wiseay and too tenderhearted to have entered into the matter beforehand  so i think her not wholly guiltless though the wrongs she hath suffered have been so great that i would do whatever was not disloyal to mine own queen to aid her to obtain justice  you are doing much much indeed said susan and all this time you have told me nothing of my son save what all might hear  how fares he is his heart still set on this poor maid  and ever will be said his father  his is not an outspoken babbling love like poor master nau who they say was so inspired at finding himself in the same city with bess pierrepoint that he could talk of nothing else and seemed to have no thought of his own danger or his queens  no but he hath told me that he will give up all to serve her without hope of requital for her mother hath made her forswear him and though she be not always on his tongue he will do so if i mistake not his steadfastness  susan sighed but she knew that the love that had begun when the lonely boy hailed the shipwrecked infant as his little sister was of a calm but unquenchable nature were it for weal or woe  she could not but be thankful that the express mandate of both the parents had withheld her son from sharing the danger which was serious enough even for her husbands prudence and coolness of head  by the morning as she had predicted the ardour of the earl and countess had considerably slackened and though still willing to forward the petitioner on her way they did not wish their names to appear in the matter  they did however make an important offer  the mastiff was newly come into harbour at hull and they offered richard the use of her as a conveyance  he gladly accepted it  the saving of expense was a great object for he was most unwilling to use queen marys order on the french ambassador and he likewise deemed it possible that such a means of evasion might be very useful  the mastiff was sometimes used by some of the talbot family on journeys to london and had a tolerably commodious cabin according to the notions of the time and though it was late in the year and poor cis was likely to be wretched enough on the voyage the additional security was worth having and cicely would be under the care of goatleys wife who made all the voyages with her husband the earl likewise charged richard talbot with letters and messages of conciliation to his son gilbert whose estrangement was a great grief to him arising as it did entirely from the quarrels of the two wives mother and daughter  he even charged his kinsman with the proposal to give up sheffield to lord and lady talbot and retire to wingfield rather than continue at enmity mr talbot knew the parties too well to have much hope of prevailing or producing permanent peace but the commission was welcome as it would give a satisfactory pretext for his presence in london  a few days were spent at bridgefield cicely making herself the most loving helpful and charming of daughters and really basking in the peaceful atmosphere of susans presence and thenwith many prayers and blessings from that good ladythey set forth for hull taking with them two servants besides poor babingtons man gillingham whose superior intelligence and knowledge of london would make him useful though there was a dark brooding look about him that made richard always dread some act of revenge on his part toward his masters foes     chapter xxxviii  master talbot and his charge   the afternoon on which they were to enter the old town of kingstonuponhull closed in with a dense seafog fast turning to drizzling rain  they could see but a little distance on either side and could not see the lordly old church tower  the beads of dew on the fringes of her ponys ears were more visible to cicely than anything else and as she kept along by master richards side she rejoiced both in the beaten welltrodden track and in the pealing bells which seemed to guide them into the haven while richard was resolving as he had done all through the journey where he could best lodge his companion so as to be safe and at the same time free from inconvenient curiosity  the wetness of the evening made promptness of decision the more needful while the bad weather which his experienced eye foresaw would make the choice more important  discerning through the increasing gloom a lantern moving in the street which seemed to him to light a substantial cloaked figure he drew up and asked if he were in the way to a wellknown hostel fortune had favoured him for a voice demanded in return do i hear the voice of good captain talbot  at your service  yea it is irichard talbot  is it you good master heatherthwayte  it is verily sir  well do i remember you good trusty captain and the goodly lady your wife  do i see her here returned the clergyman who had heartily grasped richards hand  no sir this is my daughter for whose sake i would ask you to direct me to some lodging for the night  nay if the young lady will put up with my humble chambers and my little daughter for her bedfellow i would not have so old an acquaintance go farther  richard accepted the offer gladly and mr heatherthwayte walked close to the horses using his lantern to direct them and sending flashes of light over the gabled ends of the old houses and the muffled passengers till they came to a long flagged passage when he asked them to dismount bidding the servants and horses to await his return and giving his hand to conduct the young lady along the narrow slippery alley which seemed to have either broken walls or houses on either aide  he explained to richard by the way that he had married the godly widow of a ship chandler but that it had pleased heaven to take her from him at the end of five years leaving him two young children but that her ancient nurse had the care of the house and the little ones  curates were not sumptuously lodged in those days  the cells which had been sufficient for monks commissioned by monasteries were no homes for men with families and where means were to be had a few rooms had been added without much grace or old cottages adaptedfor indeed the requirements of the clergy of the day did not soar above those of the farmer or petty dealer  master heatherthwayte pulled a string depending from a hole in a door the place of which he seemed to know by instinct and admitted the newcomers into a narrow paved entry where he called aloud here oil  dust  goody  bring a light  here are guests  a door was opened instantly into a large kitchen or keeping room bright with a fire and small lamp  a girl of nine or ten sprang forward but hung back at the sight of strangers a boy of twelve rose awkwardly from conning his lessons by the low unglazed lamp an old woman showed herself from some kind of pantry  here said the clergyman is my most esteemed friend captain talbot of bridgefield and his daughter who will do us the honour of abiding with us this night  do thou goody madge and thou oilofgladness make the young lady welcome and dry her garments while we go and see to the beasts  thou dustandashes mayest come with us and lead the gentlemans horse  the lad saddled with this dismal name and arrayed in garments which matched it in colour though not in uncleanliness sprang up with alacrity infinitely preferring fog rain and darkness to his accidence and never guessing that he owed this relaxation to his fathers recollection of mrs talbots ways and perception that the young lady would be better attended to without his presence  oilofgladness was a nice little rosy girl in the tightest and primmest of caps and collars and with the little housewifely hospitality that young mistresses of houses early attain to  there was no notion of equal terms between the curates daughter and the squires the child brought a chair and stood respectfully to receive the hood cloak and riding skirt seeming delighted at the smile and thanks with which cicely requited her attentions  the old woman felt the inner skirts to make sure that they were not damp and then the little girl brought warm water and held the bowl while her guest washed face and hands and smoothed her hair with the ivory comb which ladies always carried on a journey  the sweet power of setting people at ease was one cis had inherited and cultivated by imitation and oilofgladness was soon chattering away over her toilette  would the lady really sleep with her in her little bed she would promise not to kick if she could help it  then she exclaimed oh what fair thing was that at the ladys throat  was it a jewel of gold  she had never seen one for father said it was not for christian women to adorn themselves  oh no she did not mean and confused she ran off to help goody to lay the spotless tablecloth cis following to set the child at peace with herself and unloose the tongue again into hopes that the lady liked conger pie for father had bought a mighty conger for twopence and goody had made a goodly pie of him  by the time the homely meal was ready mr talbot had returned from disposing of his horses and servants at a hostel for whose comparative respectability mr heatherthwayte had answered  the clergyman himself alone sat down to supper with his guests  he would not hear of letting either of his children do so but while dustandashes retired to study his tasks for the grammar school by firelight oilofgladness assisted goody in waiting in a deft and ready manner pleasant to behold  no sooner did mr talbot mention the name cicely than master heatherthwayte looked up and saidmethinks it was i who spake that name over this young lady in baptism  even so said richard  she knoweth all but she hath ever been our good and dutiful daughter for which we are the more thankful that heaven hath given us none other maid child  he knew master heatherthwayte was inclined to curiosity about other peoples affairs and therefore turned the discourse on the doings of his sons hoping to keep him thus employed and avert all further conversation upon cicely and the cause of the journey  the good man was most interested in edward only he exhorted mr talbot to be careful with whom he bestowed the stripling at cambridge so that he might shed the pure light of the gospel undimmed by popish obscurities and idolatries  he began on his objections to the cross in baptism and the ring in marriage and dilated on them to his own satisfaction over the tankard of ale that was placed for him and his guest and the apples and nuts wherewith cicely was surreptitiously feeding oilofgladness and dustandashes while the old woman bustled about and at length made her voice heard in the announcement that the chamber was ready and the young lady was weary with travel and it was time she was abed and oil likewise  though not very young children oil and dust at a sign from their father knelt by his chair and uttered their evening prayers aloud after which he blessed and dismissed themthe boy to a shakedown in his own room the girl to the ecstasy of assisting the guest to undress and admiring the wonders of the very simple toilette apparatus contained in her little cloak bag  richard meantime was responding as best he could to the inquiries he knew would be inevitable as soon as he fell in with the reverend master heatherthwayte  he was going to london in the mastiff on some business connected with the queen of scots he said  whereupon mr heatherthwayte quoted something from the psalms about the wicked being taken in their own pits and devoutly hoped she would not escape this time  his uncharitableness might be excused by the fact that he viewed it as an immediate possibility that the prince of parma might any day enter the humber when he would assuredly be burnt alive and oilofgladness exposed to the fate of the children of haarlem  then he added i grieved to hear that you and your household were so much exposed to the witchcrafts of that same woman sir  i hope she hath done them little hurt said richard  is it true he added that the woman hath laid claim to the young lady now here as a kinswoman  it is true said richard but how hath it come to your knowledge my good friend  i deemed it known to none out of our house not even the earl and countess guess that she is no child of ours  nay mr talbot is it well to go on in a deceit  call it rather a concealment said richard  we have doubted it since but when we began it was merely that there was none to whom it seemed needful to explain that the babe was not the little daughter we buried here  but how did you learn it  it imports to know  sir do you remember your old servant colet gervass wife  it will be three years next whitsuntide that hearing a great outcry as of a woman maltreated as i passed in the street i made my way into the house and found gervas verily beating his wife with a broomstick after i had rebuked him and caused him to desist i asked him the cause and he declared it to be that his wife had been gadding to a stinking papist fellow who would be sure to do a mischief to his noble captain mr talbot  thereupon colet declares that she had done no harm the gentleman wist all before  she knew him again for the captains kinsman who was in the house the day that the captain brought home the babe  cuthbert langston  even so sir  it seems that he had been with this woman and questioned her closely on all she remembered of the child learning from her what i never knew before that there were marks branded on her shoulders and a letter sewn in her clothes  was it so sir  ay but my wife and i thought that even colet had never seen them  nothing can escape a woman sir  this man drew all from her by assuring her that the maiden belonged to some great folk and was even akin to the king and queen of scots and that she might have some great reward if she told her story to them  she even sold him some three or four gold and ivory beads which she says she found when sweeping out the room where the child was first undressed  hath she ever heard more of the fellow  nay but gervas since told me that he had met some of my lords men who told him that your daughter was one of the queen of scots ladies and said he i held my peace but methought it hath come of the talebearing of that fellow to whom my wife prated  gervas guessed right said richard that langston did contrive to make known to the queen of scots such tokens as led to her owning the maiden as of near kin to her by the mothers side and to her husband on the fathers but for many reasons she entreated us to allow the damsel still to bear our name and be treated as our child  i doubt me whether it were well done of you sir said mr heatherthwayte  of that said richard drawing up into himself no man can judge for another  she hath been with that woman she will have imbibed her popish vanities exclaimed the poor clergyman almost ready to start up and separate oilofgladness at once from the contamination  you may be easy on that score said richard drily  her faith is what my good wife taught her and she hath constantly attended the preachings of the chaplains of sir amias paulett who be all of your own way of thinking  you assure me said mr heatherthwayte for it is the nature of these folk to act a part even as did the parent the serpent  often as richard had thought so himself he was offended now and rose if you think i have brought a serpent into your house sir we will take shelter elsewhere  i will call her  mr heatherthwayte apologised and protested and showed himself willing to accept the assurance that cicely was as simple and guileless as his own little maid and mr talbot not wishing to be sent adrift with cicely at that time of night and certainly not to put such an affront on the good if overanxious father was pacified but the cordial tone of ease was at an end and they were glad to separate and retire to rest  richard had much cause for thought  he perceived what had always been a perplexity to him before how langston had arrived at the knowledge that enabled him to identify cicely with the babe of lochleven  mr talbot heard moanings and wailings of wind all night which to his experience here meant either a three days detention at hull or a land journey  with dawn there were gusts and showers  he rose betimes and went downstairs  he could hear his good host praying aloud in his room and feeling determined not to vex that puritan spirit by the presence of queen marys pupil he wrapped his cloak about him and went out to study the weather and inquire for lodgings to which he might remove cicely  he saw nothing he liked and determined on consulting his old mate goatley who generally acted as skipper but he had first to return so as not to delay the morning meal  he found on coming in cicely helping oilofgladness in making griddle cakes and buttering them so as to make mr heatherthwayte declare that he had not tasted the like since mistress susan quitted hull  moreover he had not sat down to the meal more than ten minutes before he discovered to his secret amusement that cicely had perfectly fascinated and charmed the good minister who would have shuddered had he known that she did so by the graces inherited and acquired from the object of his abhorrence  invitations to abide in their present quarters till it was possible to sail were pressed on them and though richard showed himself unwilling to accept them they were so cordially reiterated that he felt it wiser to accede to them rather than spread the mystery farther  he was never quite sure whether mr heatherthwayte looked on the young lady as untainted or whether he wished to secure her in his own instructions but he always described her as a modest and virtuous young lady and so far from thinking her presence dangerous only wished oil to learn as much from her as possible  cicely was sorely disappointed and wanted to ride on at once by land but when her fosterfather had shown her that the bad weather would be an almost equal obstacle and that much time would be lost on the road she submitted with the good temper she had cultivated under such a notable example  she taught oilofgladness the cookery of one of her mothers and the stitchery of the other she helped dustandashes with his accidence and enlightened him on the sports of the bridgefield boys so that his father looked round dismayed at the smothered laughter when she assured him that she was only telling how her brother diccon caught a coney or the like and in some magical way smoothed down his frowns with her smile  mistress cicely talbots visit was likely to be an unforgotten era with dustandashes and oilofgladness  the good curate entreated that she and her father would lodge there on their return and the invitation was accepted conditionally mr talbot writing to his wife by the carriers to send such a load of good cheer from bridgefield as would amply compensate for the expenses of this hospitality     chapter xxxix  the fetterlock court   people did not pity themselves so much for suspense when instead of receiving an answer in less than an hour they had to wait for it for weeks if not months  mrs talbot might be anxious at bridgefield and her son at fotheringhay and poor queen mary whose life hung in the balance more heartsick with what old writers well named wanhope than any of them but they had to live on and rise morning after morning without expecting any intelligence unable to do anything but pray for those who might be in perils unknown  after the strain and effort of her trial mary had become very ill and kept her bed for many days  humfrey continued to fulfil his daily duties as commander of the guards set upon her but he seldom saw or spoke with any of her attendants as sir andrew melville whom he knew the best of them had on some suspicion been separated from his mistress and confined in another part of the castle  sir amias paulett too was sick with gout and anxiety and was much relieved when sir drew drury was sent to his assistance  the new warder was a more courteous and easymannered person and did not fret himself or the prisoner with precautions like his colleague and on sir amiass reiterated complaint that the guards were not numerous enough he had brought down five fresh men hired in london fellows used to all sorts of weapons and at home in military discipline but as humfrey soon perceived at home likewise in the license of camps and most incongruous companions for the simple village bumpkins and the precise retainers who had hitherto formed the garrison  he did his best to keep order but marvelled how sir amias would view their excesses when he should come forth again from his sick chamber  the queen was better though still lame and on a fine november noontide she obtained by earnest entreaty permission to gratify her longing for free air by taking a turn in what was called the fetterlock court from the yorkist badge of the falcon and fetterlock carved profusely on the decorations  this was the inmost strength of the castle on the highest ground an octagon court with the keep closing one side of it and the others surrounded with huge massive walls shutting in a greensward with a well  there was a broad commodious terrace in the thickness of the walls intended as a station whence the defenders could shoot between the battlements but in time of peace forming a pleasant promenade sheltered from the wind and catching on its northern side the meridian rays of this martinmas summer day so that physician as well as jailer consented to permit the captive there to take the air  some watch there must be said paulett anxiously when his colleague reported the consent he had given  it will suffice then said sir drew drury if the officer of the guardtalbot call you himstands at the angle of the court so as to keep her in his view  he is a wellnurtured youth and will not vex her  let him have the guard within call said paulett and to this drury assented perhaps with a little amusement at the restless precautions of the invalid  accordingly humfrey took up his station as unobtrusively as he could at the corner of the terrace and presently through a doorway at the other end saw the queen hooded and cloaked come forth leaning heavily on the arm of dr bourgoin and attended by the two maries and the two elder ladies  she moved slowly and paused every few steps gazing round her inhaling the fresh air and enjoying the sunshine or speaking a caressing word to little bijou who leaped about and barked and whined with delight at having her out of doors again there was a seat in the wall and her ladies spread cushions and cloaks for her to sit on it warmed as it was by the sun and there she rested watching a starling running about on the turf his goldbespangled green plumage glistening  she hardly spoke she seemed to be making the most of the repose of the fair calm day humfrey would not intrude by making her sensible of his presence but he watched her from his station wondering within himself if she cared for the peril to which she had exposed the daughter so dear to him  such were his thoughts when an angry bark from bijou warned him to be on the alert  a manay one of the new menatarmswas springing up the ramp leading to the summit of the wall almost immediately in front of the little group  there was a gleam of steel in his hand with one long ringing whistle humfrey bounded from his place and at the moment when the ruffian was on the point of assailing the queen he caught him with one hand by the collar with the other tried to master the arm that held the weapon  it was a sharp struggle for the fellow was a trained soldier in the full strength of manhood and humfrey was a youth of twentythree and unarmed  they went down together rolling on the ground before marys chair but in another moment humfrey was the uppermost  he had his knee on the fellows chest and held aloft though in a bleeding hand the dagger wrenched from him  the victory had been won in a few seconds before the two men whom his whistle had brought had time to rush forward  they were ready now to throw themselves on the assailant  hold cried humfrey speaking for the first time  hurt him not  hold him fast till i have him to sir amias  each had an arm of the fallen man and humfrey rose to meet the eyes of the queen sparkling as she cried bravely bravely done sir we thank you  though it be but the poor remnant of a worthless life that you have saved we thank you  the sight of your manhood has gladdened us  humfrey bowed low and at the same time there was a cry among the ladies that he was bleeding  it was only his hand as he showed them the dagger had been drawn across the palm before he could capture it the kerchiefs were instantly brought forward to bind it up dr bourgoin saying that it ought to have master gorions attention  i may not wait for that sir said humfrey  i must carry this villain at once to sir amias and report on the affair  nay but you will come again to be tended said the queen while dr bourgoin fastened the knot of the temporary bandage  ah and is it humfrey talbot to whom i owe my life  there is one who will thank thee for it more than even i  but come back  gorion must treat that hand and then you will tell me what you have heard of her  naught alas madam said humfrey with an expressive shake of the head but ere he turned away mary extended her hand to him and as he bent his knee to kiss it she laid the other kindly on his dark curled head and said god bless thee brave youth  she was escorted to the door nearest to her apartments and as she sank back on her day bed she could not help murmuring to mary seaton a brave laddie  would that he had one drop of princely blood  the talbot blood is not amiss said the lady  true and were it but mine own scottish royalty that were in question i should see naught amiss but with this english right that hath been the bane of us all what can their love bring the poor children save woe  meantime humfrey was conducting his prisoner to sir amias paulett the man was a bronzed toughlooking ruffian with an air of having seen service and a certain foreign touch in his accent  he glanced somewhat contemptuously at his captor and said neatly done sir i marvel if youll get any thanks  what mean you said humfrey sharply but the fellow only shrugged his shoulders  the whole affair had been so noiseless that humfrey brought the first intelligence when he was admitted to the sick chamber where sir amias sat in a large chair by the fire  he had left his prisoner guarded by two men at the door  how now  what is it cried paulett at first sight of his bandaged hand  is she safe  even so sir and untouched said humfrey  thanks be to god he exclaimed  this is what i feared  who was it  one of the new menatarms from londonpeter pierson he called himself and said he had served in the netherlands  and after a few further words of explanation humfrey called in the prisoner and his guards and before his face gave an account of his attempt upon the helpless queen  godless and murderous villain said paulett what hast thou to say for thyself that i should not hang thee from the highest tower  naught that will hinder you worshipful seignior returned the man with a sneer  in sooth i see no great odds between taking life with a dagger and with an axe save that fewer folk are regaled with the spectacle  wretch said paulett wouldst thou confound private murder with the open judgment of god and man  judgment hath been pronounced said the fellow but it needs not to dispute the matter  only if this honest youth had not come blundering in and cut his fingers in the fray your captive would have been quietly rid of all her troubles and i should have had my reward from certain great folk you wot of  ay as sir amias turned still yellower you take my meaning sir  take him away said paulett collecting himself he would cloak his crime by accusing others of his desperate wickedness  where sir inquired humfrey  sir amias would have preferred hanging the fellow without inquiry but as fotheringhay was not under martial law he ordered him off to the dungeons for the present while the nearest justice of the peace was sent for  the knight bade humfrey remain while the prisoner was walked off under due guard and made a few more inquiries adding with a sigh you must double the guard master talbot and get rid of all those london roguessons of belial are they all and ill have none for whom i cannot answerfor i fear me tis all too true what the fellow says  who would set him on  that i may not say  but would you believe it humfrey talbot i have been blameday rated like a hound for that i will not lend myself to a privy murder  verily sir  verily and indeed young man  tis the part of a loyal subject they say to spare her majestys womanish feelings and her hatred of bloodshed and this lady having been condemned to take her off secretly so as to save the queen the pain and heartsearchings of signing the warrant  you credit me not sir but i have the letterto my sorrow and shame  no wonder that the poor precise hardhearted but religious and highprincipled man was laid up with a fit of the gout after receiving the shameful letter which he described which is still extant signed by walsingham and davison  strange loyalty said humfrey  and too much after the spanish sort for an english protestant said sir amias  i made answer that i would lay down my life to guard this unhappy woman to undergo the justice that is to be done upon her but murder her or allow her to be slain in my hands i neither can nor will so help me heaven as a true though sinful man  amen said humfrey  and no small cause of thanks have i that in you young sir i have one who may be trusted for faith as well as courage and i need not say discretion  as he spoke sir drew drury who had been out riding returned anxious to hear the details of this strange event  sir amias could not leave his room  sir drew accompanied humfrey to the queens apartments to hear her account and that of her attendants  it was given with praises of the young gentleman which put him to the blush and sir drew then gave permission for his hurt to be treated by maitre gorion and left him in the antechamber for the purpose  sir amias would perhaps have done more wisely if he had not detained humfrey from seeing the criminal guarded to his prison  for sir drew drury going from the queens presence to interrogate the fellow before sending for a magistrate found the cell empty  it had been the turn of duty of one of the new london menatarms and he had been placed as sentry at the door by the sergeantthe stupidest and trustiest of fellowswho stood gaping in utter amazement when he found that sentry and prisoner were both alike missing  on the whole the two warders agreed that it would be wiser to hush up the matter  when mary heard that the man had escaped she quietly said i understand  they know how to do such things better abroad  things returned to their usual state except that humfrey had permission to go daily to have his hand attended to by m gorion and the queen never let pass this opportunity of speaking to him though the very first time she ascertained that he knew as little as she did of the proceedings of his father and cicely  now for the first time did humfrey understand the charm that had captivated babington and that even his father confessed  ailing aging and suffering as she was and in daily expectation of her sentence of death there was still something more wonderfully winning about her a sweet pathetic cheerfulness kindness and resignation that filled his heart with devotion to her  and then she spoke of cicely the rarest and greatest delight that he could enjoy  she evidently regarded him with favour if not affection because he loved the maiden whom she could not but deny to him  would he not do anything for her  ay anything consistent with duty  and there came a twinge which startled him  was she making him value duty less never besides how few days he could see her  his hand was healing all too fast and what might not come any day from london  was queen marys last conquest to be that of humfrey talbot     chapter xl  the sentence   the tragedies of the stage compress themselves into a few hours but the tragedies of real life are of slow and heavy march and the heartsickness of delay and hope and dread alike deferred is one of their chief trials  humfreys hurt was quite well but as he was at once trusted by his superiors and acceptable to the captive he was employed in many of those lesser communications between her and her keepers for which the two knights did not feel it necessary to harass her with their presence  his post for half the twentyfour hours was on guard in the gallery outside her anteroom door but he often knocked and was admitted as bearer of some message to her or her household and equally often was called in to hear her requests and sometimes he could not help believing because it pleased her to see him even if there were nothing to tell her  nor was there anything known until the 19th of november when the sound of horses feet in large numbers and the blast of bugles announced the arrival of a numerous party  when marshalled into the ordinary dininghall they proved to be lord buckhurst a dignifiedlooking nobleman who bore a sad and grave countenance full of presage with mr beale the clerk of the council and two or three other officials and secretaries among whom humfrey perceived the inevitable will cavendish  the two old comrades quickly sought each other out will observing so here you are still humfrey  we are like to see the end of a long story  how so asked humfrey with a thrill of horror is she sentenced  by the commissioners all excepting my lord zouch and by both houses of parliament  we are come down to announce it to her  ill have you into the presencechamber if i can prevail  it will be a noteworthy thing to see how the daughter of a hundred kings brooks such a sentence  hath no one spoken for her asked humfrey thinking at least as much of cicely as of the victim  the king of scots hath sent an ambassage returned cavendish but when i say tis the master of gray you know what that means  king james may be urgent to save his mothernay he hath written more sharply and shrewishly than ever he did before but as for this gray whatever he may say openly we know that he has whispered to the queen the dead dont bite  the villain  that may be so far as he himself is concerned but the counsel is canny like the false scot himself  whats this i hear humfrey that you have been playing the champion and getting wounded in the defence  a mere nothing said humfrey opening his hand however to show the mark  i did but get my palm scored in hindering a villainous manatarms from slaying the poor lady  yea well are thy race named talbot said cavendish  sturdy watchdogs are ye all with never a notion that sometimes it may be for the good of all parties to look the other way  if you mean that i am to stand by and see a helpless woman  hush my good friend said will holding up his hand  i know thy breed far too well to mean any such thing  moreover thy precisian governor old paulett there hath repelled like instigations of satan more hints than one that pain might be saved to one queen and publicity to the other if he would have taken a leaf from don philips book and permitted the lady to be dealt with secretly  had he given an ear to the matter six months back it would have spared poor antony  speak not thus will said humfrey or thou wilt make me believe thee a worse man than thou art only for the sake of showing me how thou art versed in state policy  tell me instead if thou hast seen my father  thy father yea verily and i have a packet for thee from him  it is in my mails and i will give it thee anon  he is come on a bootless errand  as long as my mother and my sister mall are both living he might as well try to bring two catamounts together without hisses and scratches  where is he lying asked humfrey  in shrewsbury house after the family wont and gilbert makes him welcome enough but mall is angered with him for not lodging his daughter there likewise  i tell her he is afraid lest she should get hold of the wench and work up a fresh web of tales against this lady like those which did so much damage before  twould be rare if she made out that gravity himself in the person of old paulett had been entranced by her  peace with thy gibes said humfrey impatiently and tell me where my sister is  where thinkest thou  of all strange places in the world he hath bestowed her with madame de salmonnet the wife of one of the french ambassadors following to perfect her french as he saith  canst thou conceive wherefore he doth it  hath he any marriage in view for her mall tried to find out but he is secret  tell me numps what is it  if he be secret must not i be the same said humfrey laughing  nay thou owest me some return for all that i have told thee  marry will that is more like a maiden than a statesman  but be content comrade i know no more than thou what purposes there may be anent my sisters marriage he added  only if thou canst give me my fathers letter i should be beholden to thee  they were interrupted however by a summons to humfrey who was to go to the apartments of the queen of scots to bear the information that in the space of half an hour the lord buckhurst and master beale would do themselves the honour of speaking with her  so muttered cavendish to himself as humfrey went up the stairs there is then some secret  i marvel what it bodes  did not that crafty villain langston utter some sort of warning which i spurned knowing the bridgefield trustiness and good faith  this wench hath been mightily favoured by the lady  i must see to it  meantime humfrey had been admitted to queen marys room where she sat as usual at her needlework  you bring me tidings my friend she said as he bent his knee before her  methought i heard a fresh stir in the castle who is arrived  the lord buckhurst so please your grace and master beale  they crave an audience of your grace in half an hours time  yea and i can well guess wherefore said the queen  well fiat voluntas tua  buckhurst he is kinsman of elizabeth on the boleyn side methinks  she would do me grace you see my masters by sending me such tidings by her cousin  they cannot hurt me  i am far past that  so let us have no tears my lassies but receive them right royally as befits a message from one sovereign to another remember it is not before my lord buckhurst and master beale that we sit but before all posterities for evermore who will hear of mary stewart and her wrongs  tell them i am ready sir  nay but my son she added with a very different tone of the tender woman instead of the outraged sovereign i see thou hast news for me  is it of the child  even so madam  i wot little yet but what i know is hopeful  she is with madame de salmonnet wife of one of the suite of the french ambassador  ah that speaketh much said mary smiling more than you know young man  salmonnet is sprung of a scottish archer jockie of the salmon net whereof they made in france m de salmonnet  chateauneuf must have owned her and put her under the protection of the embassy hast thou had a letter from thy father  i am told that one is among will cavendishs mails madam and i hope to have it anon  these men have all unawares brought with them that which may well bear me up through whatever may be coming  a second message arrived from lord buckhurst himself to say how grieved he was to be the bearer of heavy tidings and to say that he would not presume to intrude on her majestys presence until she would notify to him that she was ready to receive him  they have become courteous said mary  but why should we dally the sooner this is over the better  the gentlemen were then admitted lord buckhurst grave sad stately and courteous sir annas paulett as usual grim and wooden in his puritanical stiffness sir drew drury keeping in the background as one grieved and mr beale who had already often harassed the queen before eager forward and peremptory as one whose exultation could hardly be repressed by respect for his superior lord buckhurst  bending low before her this nobleman craved her pardon for that which it was his duty to execute and having kissed her hand in token of her personal forgiveness he bade mr beale read the papers  the clerk of the council stood forth almost without obeisance till it was absolutely compelled from him by buckhurst  he read aloud the details of the judgment that mary had been found guilty by the commission of conspiracy against the kingdom and the life of the queen with the sentence from the high court of parliament that she was to die by being beheaded  mary listened with unmoved countenance only she stood up and made solemn protest against the authority and power of the commission either to try or condemn her  beale was about to reply but lord buckhurst checked him telling him it was simply his business to record the protest and then adding that he was charged to warn her to put away all hopes of mercy and to prepare for death  this he said was on behalf of his queen who implored her to disburthen her conscience by a full confession  it is not her work added buckhurst the sentence is not hers but this thing is required by her people inasmuch as her life can never be safe while your grace lives nor can her religion remain in any security  marys demeanour had hitherto been resolute  here a brightness and look of thankful joy came over her as she raised her eyes to heaven and joined her hands saying i thank you my lord you have made it all gladness to me by declaring me to be an instrument in the cause of my religion for which unworthy as i am i shall rejoice to shed my blood  saint and martyr indeed broke out paulett  that is fine when you are dying for plotting treason and murder  nay sir gently returned mary i am not so presumptuous as to call myself saint or martyr but though you have power over my body you have none over my soul nor can you prevent me from hoping that by the mercy of him who died for me my blood and life may be accepted by him as offerings freely made for his church  she then begged for the restoration of her almoner de preaux  she was told that the request would be referred to the queen but that she should have the attendance of an english bishop and dean paulett was so angered at the manner in which she had met the doom that he began to threaten her that she would be denied all that could serve to her idolatries  yea verily said she calmly i am aware that the english have never been noted for mercy  lord buckhurst succeeded in getting the knight away without any more bitter replies  humfrey and cavendish had of course to leave the room in their train and as it was the hour of guard for the former he had to take up his station and wait with what patience he could until it should please master william to carry him the packet  he opened it eagerly standing close beneath the little lamp that illuminated his post to read it but after all it was somewhat disappointing for mr talbot did not feel that absolute confidence in the consciences of gentlemeninplace which would make him certain of that of master cavendish supposing any notion should arise that cicelys presence in london could have any purpose connected with the prisoner   to my dear son humfrey greeting  i do you to wit that we are here safely arrived in london though we were forced by stress of weather to tarry seven days in hull at the house of good master heatherthwayte where we received good and hospitable entertainment  the voyage was a fair one and the old mastiff is as brave a little vessel as ever she was wont to be but thy poor sister lay abed all the time and was right glad when we came into smooth water  we have presented the letters to those whom we came to seek and so far matters have gone with us more towardly than i had expected  there are those who knew cicelys mother at her years who say there is a strange likeness between them and who therefore received her the more favourably  i am lying at present at shrewsbury house where my young lord makes me welcome but it hath been judged meet that thy sister should lodge with the good madame de salmonnet a lady of scottish birth who is wife to one of the secretaries of m de chateauneuf the french ambassador but who was bred in the convent of soissons  she is a virtuous and honourable lady and hath taken charge of thy sister while we remain in london for the purpose for which we came it goeth forward and those who should know assure me that we do not lose time here  diccon commendeth himself to thee he is well in health and hath much improved in all his exercises  mistress curll is lodging nigh unto the strand in hopes of being permitted to see her husband but that hath not yet been granted to her although she is assured that he is well in health and like ere long to be set free as well as monsieur nau  we came to london the day after the parliament had pronounced sentence upon the lady at fotheringhay  i promise you there was ringing of bells and firing of cannon and lighting of bonfires so that we deemed that there must have been some great defeat of the spaniards in the low countries and when we were told it was for joy that the parliament had declared the queen of scots guilty of death my poor cicely had wellnigh swooned to think that there could be such joy for the doom of one poor sick lady  there hath been a petition to the queen that the sentence may be carried out and she hath answered in a dubious and uncertain manner which leaves ground for hope and the king of scots hath written pressingly and sent the master of gray to speak in his mothers behalf also m de chateauneuf hath both urged mercy on the queen and so written to france that king henry is sending an ambassador extraordinary m de bellievre to intercede for her  i send these presents by favour of master cavendish who will tell thee more than i have here space to set down and can assure thee that nothing hasty is like to be done in the business on which he hath come down with these gentlemen  and so no more at present from thy loving father                                         richard talbot   humfrey had to gather what he could from this letter but he had no opportunity of speech with the prisoner on the remainder of that day nor on the next until after lord buckhurst and his followers had left fotheringhay bearing with them a long and most touching letter from the prisoner to queen elizabeth  on that day paulett worked himself up to the strange idea that it was for the good of the unfortunate prisoners soul and an act of duty to his own sovereign to march into the prison chamber and announce to queen mary that being a dead woman in the eye of the law no royal state could be permitted her in token of which he commanded her servants to remove the canopy over her chair  they all flatly refused to touch it and the women began to cry out upon him for being cowardly enough to insult their mistress and she calmly said sir you may do as you please  my royal state comes from god and is not yours to give or take away  i shall die a queen whatever you may do by such law as robbers in a forest might use with a righteous judge  intensely angered sir amias came hobbling and stumbling out to the door pale with rage and called on talbot to come and bring his men to tear down the rag of vanity in which this contumacious woman put her trust  the men are your servants sir said humfrey with a flush on his cheek and his teeth set i am here to guard the queen of scots not to insult her  how sirrah  do you know to whom you speak  have you not sworn obedience to me  in all things within my commission sir but this is as much beyond it as i believe it to be beyond yours  insolent disloyal varlet  you are under ward till i can account with and discharge you  to your chamber  humfrey could but walk away grieved that his power of bearing intelligence or alleviation to the prisoner had been forfeited and that he should probably not even take leave of her  was she to be left to all the insults that the malice of her persecutor could devise  yet it was not exactly malice  paulett would have guarded her life from assassination with his own though chiefly for his own sake and as he said for that of saving his poor posterity from so foul a blot but he could not bear as he told sir drew drury to see the popish bloodthirsty woman sit queening it so calmly and when he tore down her cloth of state and sat down in her presence with his hat on he did not so much intend to pain the woman mary as to express the triumph of elizabeth and of her religion  humfrey believed his service over and began to occupy himself with putting his clothes together while considering whether to seek his father in london or to go home  after about an hour he was summoned to the hall where he expected to have found sir amias paulett ready to give him his discharge  he found however only sir drew drury who thus accosted himyoung man you had better return to your duty  sir amias is willing to overlook what passed this morning  i thank you sir but i am not aware of having done aught to need forgiveness said humfrey  come come my fair youth stand not on these points  tis true my good colleague hath an excess of zeal and i could wish he could have found it in his heart to leave the poor lady these marks of dignity that hurt no one  i would have no hand in it and i am glad thou wouldst not  he knoweth that he had no power to require such service of thee  he will say no more and i trust that neither wilt thou for it would not be well to change warders at this time  another might not be so acceptable to the poor lady and i would fain save her all that i can  humfrey bowed and thanked him of milder mood nor was any further notice taken of this hasty dismissal  when next he had to enter the queens apartments the absence of all the tokens of her royal rank was to him truly a shock accustomed as he had been from his earliest childhood to connect them with her and knowing what their removal signified  mary who was writing looked up as with cap in hand he presented himself on one knee his head bowed lower than ever before perhaps to hide the tear that had sprung to his eye at sight of her pale patient countenance  how now sir she said  this obeisance is out of place to one already dead in law  don your bonnet  there is no queen here for an englishman  ah madam suffer me  my reverence cannot but be greater than ever faltered humfrey from his very heart his words lost in the kiss he printed on the hand she granted him  mary bent her gray discrowned head crowned in his eyes as the queen of sorrows and said to marie de courcelles who stood behind her is it not true ma mie that our griefs have this makeweight namely that they prove to us whose are the souls whose generosity is above all price  and what saith thy good father my humfrey  he had not ventured on bringing the letter into the apartments but he repeated most of the substance of it without however greatly raising the hopes of the queen though she was gratified that her cause was not neglected either by her son or by her brotherinlaw  they and above all my poor maid will be comforted to have done their utmost she said but i scarcely care that they should prevail  as i have written to my cousin elizabeth i am beholden to her for ending my long captivity and above all for conferring on me the blessings and glories of one who dies for her faith all unworthy as i am and she clasped her hands while a rapt expression came upon her countenance  her chief desire seemed to be that neither cicely nor her fosterfather should run into danger on her account and she much regretted that she had not been able to impress upon humfrey messages to that effect before he wrote in answer to his father sending his letter by cavendish  thou wilt not write again she asked  i doubt its being safe said humfrey  i durst not speak openly even in the scroll i sent yesterday  then mary recurred to the power which he possessed of visiting sir andrew melville and the almoner the abbe de preaux who were shut up in the fetterlock tower and court and requested him to take a billet which she had written to the latter  the request came like a blow to the young man  with permission he began  i tell thee said mary this concerns naught but mine own soul it is nothing to the state but all and everything to me a dying woman  ah madam  let me but obtain consent  what go to paulett that he may have occasion to blaspheme my faith and insult me said the queen offended  i should go to sir drew drury who is of another mould said humfrey  but who dares not lift a finger to cross his fellow said mary leaning back resignedly  and this is the young gentlemans love for your grace exclaimed jean kennedy  nay madam said humfrey stung to the quick but i am sworn  let him alone nurse jeanie said mary  he is like the rest of the english  they know not how to distinguish between the spirit and the letter  i understand it all though i had thought for a moment that in him there was a love for me and mine that would perceive that i could ask nothing that could damage his honour or his good faith iwho had almost a mothers love and trust in him  madam cried humfrey you know i would lay down my life for you but i cannot break my trust  your trust fule laddie exclaimed mrs kennedy  ane wad think the queen speired of ye to carry a letter to mendoza to burn and slay instead of a bit scart of the pen to ask the good father for his prayers or the like  but you are all alike ye will not stir a hand to aid her poor soul  pardon me madam entreated humfrey  the matter is not what the letter may bear but how my oath binds me  i may not be the bearer of aught in writing from this chamber  twas the very reason i would not bring in my fathers letter  madam say but you pardon me  of course i pardon you returned mary coldly  i have so much to pardon that i can well forgive the lukewarmness and precision that are so bred in your nature that you cannot help them  i pardon injuries and i may well try to pardon disappointments  fare you well mr talbot may your fidelity have its reward from sir amias paulett  humfrey was obliged to quit the apartment cruelly wounded sometimes wondering whether he had really acted on a harsh selfish punctilio in cutting off the dying woman from the consolations of religion and thus taking part with the persecutors while his heart bled for her sometimes it seemed to him as if he had been on the point of earning her consent to his marriage with her daughter and had thrown it away and at other moments a horror came over him lest he was being beguiled as poor antony had been before him  and if he let his faith slip how should he meet his father again  yet his affection for the queen repelled this idea like a cruel injury while day by day it was renewed pain and grief to be treated by her with the gentlest and most studied courtesy but no longer as almost one of her own inner circle of friends and confidants  and as sir andrew melville was in a few days more restored to her service he was far less often required to bear messages or do little services in the prison apartments and he felt himself excluded and cut off from the intimacy that had been very sweet and even a little hopeful to him     chapter xli  her royal highness   cicely had been living in almost as much suspense in london as her mother at fotheringhay  for greater security mr talbot had kept her on board the mastiff till he had seen m daubepine chateauneuf and presented to him queen marys letter  the ambassador an exceedingly polished and graceful frenchman was greatly astonished and at first incredulous but he could not but accept the queens letter as genuine and he called into his counsels his secretary de salmonnet an elderly man whose wife a scotswoman by birth preferred her husbands society to the delights of paris  she was a hamilton who had been a pensionnaire in the convent at soissons and she knew that it had been expected that an infant from lochleven might be sent to the abbess but that it had never come and that after many months of waiting tidings had arrived that the vessel which carried the babe had been lost at sea  m de chateauneuf thereupon committed the investigation to her and her husband  richard talbot took them first to the rooms where mrs barbara curll had taken up her abode so as to be near her husband who was still a prisoner in walsinghams house  she fully confirmed all that mr talbot said of the queens complete acceptance of cis as her daughter and moreover consented to come with the salmonnets and mr talbot to visit the young lady on board the mastiff  accordingly they went down the river together in mr talbots boat and found cicely well cloaked and muffled sitting under an awning under the care of old goatley who treated her like a little queen and was busy explaining to her all the different craft which filled the river  she sprang up with the utmost delight at the sight of mrs curll and threw herself into her arms  there was an interchange of inquiries and comments thatunpremeditated as they werecould not but convince the auditor of the terms on which the young lady had stood with queen mary and her suite  afterwards cicely took the two ladies to her cabin a tiny box but not uncomfortable according to her habits and there on barbaras persuasion she permitted madame de salmonnet to see the monograms on her shoulders  the lady went home convinced of her identity and came again the next day with a gentleman in slouched hat mask and cloak  as cicely rose to receive him he uttered an exclamation of irrepressible astonishment then added your highness will pardon me exactly thus did her royal mother stand when i took leave of her at calais  the ambassador had thus been taken by storm although the resemblance was more in figure and gesture than feature but mrs curll could aver that those who had seen bothwell were at no loss to trace the derivation of the dark brows and somewhat homely features in which the girl differed from the royal race of scotland  what was to be done  queen marys letter to him begged him so far as was possible to give her french protection and avoid compromising that excellent talbot and he thought it would be wisest for her to await the coming of the envoy extraordinary m de pomponne bellievre and be presented by him  in the meantime her remaining on board ship in this winter weather would be miserably uncomfortable and richmond and greenwich were so near that any intercourse with her would be dangerous especially if langston was still in england lodgings or inns where a young lady from the country could safely be bestowed were not easily to be procured without greater familiarity with the place than mr talbot possessed and he could as little think of placing her with lady talbot whose gossiping tongue and shrewish temper were not for a moment to be trusted  therefore m de chateauneufs proposal that the young lady should become madame de salmonnets guest at the embassy was not unwelcome  the lady was elderly scottish and as m de chateauneuf with something of a shudder assured mr talbot most respectable  and it was hoped that it would not be for long  so having seen her safely made over to the ladys care richard ventured for the first time to make his presence in london known to his son and to his kindred and he was the more glad to have her in these quarters because diccon told him that there was no doubt that langston was lurking about the town and indeed he was convinced that he had recognised that spy entering walsinghams house in the dress of a scrivener  he would not alarm cicely but he bade her keep all her goods in a state ready for immediate departure in case it should be needful to leave london at once after seeing the queen  the french ambassadors abode was an old conventual building on the riverside consisting of a number of sets of separate chambers like those of a college opening on a quadrangle in the centre and with one side occupied by the state apartments and chapel  this arrangement eminently suited the french suite every one of whom liked to have his own little arrangements of cookery and to look after his own marmite in his own way all being alike horrified at the gross english diet and lack of vegetables  many tried experiments in the way of growing salads in little gardens of their own with little heed to the once beautiful green grassplot which they broke up  inside that gate it was like a new country and as all the shrill thin intonations of the french rang in her ears cicely could hardly believe that she hadshe saidonly a brick wall between her and old england  m de salmonnet was unmistakably a scot by descent though he had never seen the land of his ancestors  his grandfather bad been ennobled but only belonged to the lesser order of the noblesse being exempted from imposts but not being above employment especially in diplomacy  he had acted as secretary interpreter and general factotum to a whole succession of ambassadors and thus his little loge as he called it had become something of a home  his wife had once or twice before had to take charge of young ladies french or english who were confided to the embassy and she had a guest chamber for them a small room but with an oriel window overhanging the thames and letting in the southern sun so as almost to compensate for the bareness of the rest where there was nothing but a square boxbed a chest and a few toilette essentials to break upon the dulness of the dark wainscoted walls madame herself came to sleep with her guest for lonely nights were regarded with dread in those times and indeed she seemed to regard it as her duty never to lose sight of her charge for a moment  madame de salmonnets proper bedchamber was the only approach to this little room but that mattered the less as it was also the parlour the bed likewise a box was in the faroff recesses and the family were up and astir long before the november sun  dressed madame could scarcely be calledthe costume in which she assisted babette and queer wizened old pierrot in doing the mornings work horrified cicely used as she was to mistress susans scrupulous neatness  downstairs there was a sort of office room of monsieurs where the family meals were taken and behind it an exceedingly small kitchen where madame and pierrot performed marvels of cookery surpassing those of queen marys five cooks  cicely longed to assist in them and after a slight demur she was permitted to do so chiefly because her duenna could not otherwise watch her and the confections at the same time  cis could never make out whether it was as princess or simply as maiden that she was so closely watched for madame bristled and swelled like a mother cat about to spring at a strange dog if any gentleman of the suite showed symptoms of accosting her  nay when mr talbot once brought diccon in with him and there was a greeting which to cicelys mind was dismally cold and dry the lady was so scandalised that cicely was obliged formally to tell her that she would answer for it to the queen  on sunday mr talbot always came to take her to church and this was a terrible grievance to madame though it was to cicely the one refreshment of the week  if it had been only the being out of hearing of her hostesss incessant tongue the walk would have been a refreshment  madame de salmonnet had been transported from home so young that she was far more french than scottish she was a small woman full of activity and zeal of all kinds though perhaps most of all for her pot au feu  she was busied about her domestic affairs morning noon and night and never ceased chattering the whole time till cicely began to regard the sound like the clack of the mill at bridgefield  yet talker as she was she was a safe woman and never had been known to betray secrets  indeed much more of her conversation consisted of speculations on the tenderness of the poultry or the freshness of the fish than of anything that went much deeper  she did however spend much time in describing the habits and customs of the pensioners at soissons the maigre food they had to eat their tricks upon the elder and graver nuns and a good deal besides that was amusing at first but which became rather wearisome and made cicely wonder what either of her mothers would have thought of it  the excuse for all this was to enable the maiden to make her appearance before queen elizabeth as freshly brought from soissons by her mothers danger  mary herself had suggested this as removing all danger from the talbots and as making it easier for the french embassy to claim and protect cis herself and m de chateauneuf had so far acquiesced as to desire madame de salmonnet to see whether the young lady could be prepared to assume the character before eyes that would not be over qualified to judge  cis however had always been passive when the proposal was made and the more she heard from madame de salmonnet the more averse she was to it  the only consideration that seemed to her in its favour was the avoidance of implicating her fosterfather but a sunday morning spent with him removed the scruple  i know i cannot feign she said  they all used to laugh at me at chartley for being too much of the downright mastiff to act a part  i am right glad to hear it said richard  moreover added cicely if i did try to turn my words with the scottish or french ring i wot that the sight of the queens majesty and my anxiety would drive out from me all i should strive to remember and i should falter and utter mere folly and if she saw i was deceiving her there would be no hope at all  nay how could i ask god almighty to bless my doing with a lie in my mouth  there spake my susans own maid said richard  tis the joy of my heart that they have not been able to teach thee to lie with a good grace  trust my word my wench truth is the only wisdom and one would have thought they might have learnt it by this time  i only doubted lest it should be to your damage dear father  can they call it treason  i trow not my child  the worst that could hap would be that i might be lodged in prison a while or have to pay a fine and liefer far liefer would i undergo the like than that those lips of thine should learn guile  i say not that there is safety for any of us least of all for thee my poor maid but the danger is tenfold increased by trying to deceive and moreover it cannot be met with a good conscience  moreover said cicely i have pleadings and promises to make on my motherqueens behalf that would come strangely amiss if i had to feign that i had never seen her  may i not seek the queen at once without waiting for this french gentleman  then would this weary weary time be at an end  each time i hear a bell or a cannon shot i start and think oh has she signed the warrant  is it too late  there is no fear of that said richard i shall know from will cavendish the instant aught is done and through diccon i could get thee brought to the queens very chamber in time to plead  meantime the queen is in many minds  she cannot bear to give up her kinswoman she sits apart and mutters aut fer aut feri and ne feriare feri her ladies say she tosses and sighs all night and hath once or twice awoke shrieking that she was covered with blood it is burghley and walsingham who are forcing this on and not her free will  strengthen but her better will and let her feel herself secure and she will spare and gladly  that do i hope to do said cicely encouraged  the poor girl had to endure many a vicissitude and heartsinking before m de bellievre appeared and when he did come he was a disappointment  he was a most magnificent specimen of the mignons of henris court the embassy rang with stories of the number of mails he had brought of the milk baths he sent for the gloves he slept in the valets who tweaked out superfluous hairs from his eyebrows the delicacies required for his little dogs  m de salmonnet reported that on hearing the story of mademoiselle as cicely was called in the embassy he had twirled the waxed ends of his moustaches into a satirical twist and observed that is well found and may serve as a last resource  he never would say that he disbelieved what he was told of her and when presented to her he behaved with an exaggerated deference which angered her intensely for it seemed to her mockery of her pretensions no doubt his desire was that marys life should be granted to the intercession of his king rather than to any other consideration and therefore once twice thrice he had interviews with elizabeth and still he would not take the anxious suppliant who was in an agony at each disappointment as she watched the gay barge float down the river and who began to devise setting forth alone to seek the queen at richmond and end it all  she would have done so but that diccon told her that since the alarm caused by barnwell it had become so much more difficult to approach the queen that she would have no hope  but she was in a restless state that made madame de salmonnets chatter almost distracting when at last far on in january m de salmonnet came in  well mademoiselle the moment is come  the passports are granted but monsieur the ambassador extraordinary has asked for a last private audience and he prays your highness to be ready to accompany him at nine of the clock tomorrow morning  cicelys first thought was to send tidings to mr talbot and in this m de salmonnet assisted her though his wife thought it very superfluous to drag in the great dull heavy english sailor  the girl longed for a sight and speech of him all that evening in vain though she was sure she saw the mastiffs boat pass down the river and most earnestly did she wish she could have had her chamber to herself for the prayers and preparations on which madames tongue broke so intolerably that she felt as if she should ere long be wild and senseless and unable to recollect anything  she had only a little peace when madame rose early in the morning and left her thinking her asleep for a brief interval which gave her time to rally her thoughts and commend herself to her only guide  she let madame dress her as had been determined in perfectly plain black with a cap that would have suited a novice out of convent shade  it was certainly the most suitable garb for a petitioner for her mothers life  in her hand she took the queens letter and the most essential proofs of her birth  she was cloaked and hooded over all as warmly as possible to encounter the cold of the river and madame de salmonnet sighing deeply at the cold arranged herself to chaperon her and tried to make her fortify herself with food but she was too tremulous to swallow anything but a little bread and wine poor child  she felt frightfully alone amongst all those foreign tongues above all when the two ambassadors crossed the court to m de salmonnets little door  bellievre rolled up in splendid sables from head to foot bowed down to the ground before her almost sweeping the pavement with his plume and asked in his deferential voice of mockery if her royal highness would do him the honour of accepting his escort  cicely bent her head and said in french i thank you sir giving him her hand and there was a grave dignity in the action that repressed him so that he did not speak again as he led her to the barge which was covered in at the stern so as to afford a shelter from the wind  her quick eye detected the mastiffs boat as she was handed down the stairs and this was some relief while she was placed in the seat of honour with an ambassador on each side of her  may i ask demanded bellievre waving a scented handkerchief what her highness is prepared to say in case i have to confirm it  i thank your excellency replied cicely but i mean to tell the simple truth and as your excellency has had no previous knowledge of me i do not see how you can confirm it  the two gentlemen looked at one another and chateauneuf said do i understand her royal highness that she does not come as the pensionnaire from soissons as the queen had recommended  no sir said cicely i have considered the matter and i could not support the character  all that i ask of your excellencies is to bring me into the presence of queen elizabeth  i will do the rest myself with the help of god  perhaps she is right said the one ambassador to the other  these english are incomprehensible     chapter xlii  the supplication   in due time the boat drew up at the stairs leading to the palace of richmond  cicely in the midst of her trepidation perceived that diccon was among the gentlemen pensioners who made a lane from the landing to receive them as she was handed along by m de bellievre in the hall there was a pause during which the mufflings were thrown off and cicely appeared in her simple black a great contrast to her cavalier who was clad from neck to knee in pale pink satin quilted and with a pearl at each intersection earrings in his ears perfumed and longfringed gloves in his handa perfect specimen of the foppery of the court of france  however he might have been in hodden gray without her perceiving it  she had the sensation of having plunged into deep unknown waters without rope or plank and being absolutely forced to strike out for herself yet the very urgency of the moment acting on her high blood and recent training made her outwardly perfectly selfpossessed and calm  she walked along holding her head in the regal manner that was her inheritance and was so utterly absorbed in the situation that she saw nothing and thought only of the queen  this was to be a private audience and after a minutes demur with the clerk of the chamber when chateauneuf made some explanation a door was opened a curtain withdrawn and the two ambassadors and the young lady were admitted to elizabeths closet where she sat alone in an armchair with a table before her  cicelys first glance at the queen reminded her of the countess though the face was older and had an intellect and a grandeur latent in it such as bess of hardwicke had never possessed but it was haggard and worn the eyelids red either with weeping or with sleeplessness and there was an anxious look about the keen light hazel eyes which was sometimes almost pathetic and gave cicely hope  to the end of her days she never could recollect how the queen was arrayed she saw nothing but the expression in those falcon eyes and the strangely sensitive mouth which bewrayed the shrewish nose and chin and the equally inconsistent firmness of the jaw  the first glance cicely encountered was one of utter amazement and wrath as the queen exclaimed whom have you brought hither messieurs  before either could reply she whom they had thought a raw helpless girl moved forward and kneeling before elizabeth said it is i so please your majesty i who have availed myself of the introduction of their excellencies to lay before your majesty a letter from my mother the queen of scots  queen elizabeth made so vehement and incredulous an exclamation of amazement that cicely was the more reminded of the countess and this perhaps made her task the easier and besides she was not an untrained rustic but had really been accustomed to familiar intercourse with a queen who captive as she was maintained full state and etiquette  she therefore made answer with dignity if it will please your majesty to look at this letter you will see the proofs of what i say and that i am indeed bride hepburn the daughter of queen marys last marriage i was born at lochleven on the 20th of february of the year of grace 1567 footnote1568 according to our calendar and thence secretly sent in the bride of dunbar to be bred up in france  the ship was wrecked and all lost on board but i was by the grace of god picked up by a good and gallant gentleman of my lord of shrewsburys following master richard talbot of bridgefield who brought me up as his own daughter all unknowing whence i came or who i was until three years ago when one of the secret agents who had knowledge of the affairs of the queen of scots made known to her that i was the babe who had been embarked in the bride of dunbar  verily thou must be a bold wench to expect me to believe such a mere minstrels tale said elizabeth  nevertheless madam it is the simple truth as you will see if you deign to open this packet  and who or where is this same honourable gentleman who brought you uprichard talbot  i have heard that name before  he is here madam  he will confirm all i say  the queen touched a little bell and ordered master talbot of bridgefield to be brought to her while hastily casting her eyes on the credentials she demanded of chateauneuf knew you aught of this sir  i know only what the queen of scotland has written and what this monsieur talbot has told me madam said chateauneuf  there can be no doubt that the queen of scotland has treated her as a daughter and owns her for such in her letter to me as well as to your majesty  and the letters are no forgery  mine is assuredly not madam i know the private hand of the queen of scots too well to be deceived  moreover madame curll the wife of the secretary and others can speak to the manner in which this young lady was treated  openly treated as a daughter  that passes sir  my faithful subjects would never have left me uninformed  so please your majesty here the maiden ventured i have always borne the name of cicely talbot and no one knows what is my real birth save those who were with my mother at lochleven excepting mrs curll the rest even of her own attendants only understood me to be a scottish orphan  my true lineage should never have been known were it not a daughters duty to plead for her mother  by this time mr talbot was at the door and he was received by the queen with so ho master talbot how is this  you that have been vaunted to us as the very pink of fidelity working up a tale that smacks mightily of treason and leasing  the truth is oft stranger than any playwright can devise said richard as he knelt  if it be truth the worse for you sir said the queen hotly what colour can you give to thus hiding one who might forsooth claim royal blood tainted though it be  pardon me your grace  for many years i knew not who the babe was whom i had taken from the wreck and when the secret of her birth was discovered i deemed it not mine own but that of the queen of scots  a captives secrets are not her own and are only kept by traitors said elizabeth severely  at this cicely threw herself forward with glowing cheeks  madam madam traitor never was named in the same breath with master talbots name before  if he kept the secret it was out of pity and knowing no hurt could come to your majesty by it  thou hast a tongue wench be thou who thou mayst said elizabeth sharply  stand back and let him tell his own tale  richard very briefly related the history of the rescue of the infant which he said he could confirm by the testimony of goatley and of heatherthwayte  he then explained how langston had been present when she was brought home and had afterwards made communications to the queen of scots that led to the girl already in attendance on her being claimed and recognised after which he confessed that he had not the heart to do what might separate the mother and daughter by declaring their relationship  elizabeth meanwhile was evidently comparing his narrative with the letters of the queen of scots asking searching questions here and there  she made a sound of perplexity and annoyance at the end and said this must be further inquired into  here cicely fearing an instant dismissal clasped her hands and on her knees exclaimed madam it will not matter  no trouble shall ever be caused by my drop of royal blood no one shall ever even know that bride of scotland exists save the few who now know it and have kept the secret most faithfully  i seek no state all i ask is my mothers life  o madam would you but see her and speak with her you would know how far from her thoughts is any evil to your royal person  tush wench we know better  is this thy lesson  none hath taught me any lesson madam  i know what my mothers enemies have as they say proved against her and i know they say that while she lives your grace cannot be in security  that is what moves my people to demand her death said elizabeth  it is not of your own free will madam nor of your own kind heart cried cicely  that i well know  and madam i will show you the way let but my mother be escorted to some convent abroad in france or austria or anywhere beyond the reach of spain and her name should be hidden from everyone  none should know where to seek her not even the abbess should know her name  she would be prisoned in a cell but she would be happy for she would have life and the free exercise of her religion  no english papist no leaguer none should ever trace her and she would disquiet you no more  and who is to answer that when once beyond english bounds she should not stir up more trouble than ever demanded elizabeth  that do i said the girl  here am i bride hepburn ready to live in your majestys hands as a hostage whom you might put to death at the first stirring on her behalf  silly maid we have no love of putting folk to death said elizabeth rather hurt  that is only for traitors when they forfeit our mercy  then o madam madam what has been done in her name cannot forfeit mercy for her  she was shut up in prison i was with her day and night and i know she had naught to do with any evil purpose towards your majesty  ah you do not believe me  i know they have found her guilty and that is not what i came to say she continued getting bewildered in her earnestness for a moment  no  but gracious queen you have spared her often i have heard her say that you had again and again saved her life from those who would fain have her blood  it is true said elizabeth half softened  save her then now madam entreated the girl  let her go beyond their reach yet where none shall find her to use her name against you let me go to her at fotheringhay with these terms  she will consent and bless and pray for you for ever and here am i ready to do what you will with me  to hang about court and be found secretly wedded to some base groom  no madam  i give you my solemn word as a queens daughter that i will never wed save by your consent if my mothers life be granted the king of scots knows not that there is such a being  he need never know it i will thank and bless you whether you throw me into the tower or let me abide as the humblest of your servingwomen under the name i have always borne cicely talbot  foolish maid thou mayest purpose as thou sayest but i know what wenches are made of too well to trust thee  ah madam pardon me but you know not how strong a maidens heart can be for a mothers sake  madam you have never seen my mother if you but knew her patience and her tenderness you would know how not only i but every man or woman in her train would gladly lay down life and liberty for her could we but break her bonds and win her a shelter among those of her own faith  art a papist asked the queen observing the pronoun  not so ant please your majesty  this gentleman bred me up in our own church nor would i leave it  strangestrange matters muttered elizabeth and they need to be duly considered  i will then abide your majestys pleasure said cicely craving license that it may be at fotheringhay with my mother  then can i bear her the tidings and she will write in full her consent to these terms o madam i see mercy in your looks  receive a daughters blessing and thanks  over fast over fast maiden  who told thee that i had consented  your majestys own countenance replied cicely readily  i see pity in it and the recollection that all posterity for evermore will speak of the clemency of elizabeth as the crown of all her glories  child child said the queen really moved heaven knows that i would gladly practise clemency if my people would suffer it but they fear for my life and still more for themselves were i removed nor can i blame them  your majesty i know that  but my mother would be dead to the world leaving her rights solemnly made over to her son  none would know where to find her and she would leave in your hands and those of the parliament a resignation of all her claims  and would she do this  am i to take it on thy word girl  your majesty knows this ring sent to her at lochleven said cicely holding it up  it is the pledge that she binds herself to these conditions  oh let me but bear them to her and you shall have them signed and sealed and your majesty will know the sweet bliss of pardoning  may i carry the tidings to her  i can go with this gentleman as cis talbot returning to her service  elizabeth bent her head as though assenting thoughtfully  how shall i thank you gracious queen cried cicely joining hands in a transport but elizabeth sharply cut her short  what means the wench  i have promised nothing  i have only said i will look into this strange story of thine and consider this proposalthat is if thy mother as thou callest her truly intend itay and will keep to it  that is all i could ask of your majesty said cicely  the next messenger after my return shall carry her full consent to these conditions and there will i abide your pleasure until the time comes for her to be conducted to her convent if not to see your face which would be best of all  o madam what thanks will be worthy of such a grace  wait to see whether it is a grace little cousin said elizabeth but with a kiss to the young round cheek and a friendliness of tone that surprised all  messieurs she added to the ambassadors you came if i mistake not to bring me this young demoiselle  who has i hope pleaded more effectually than i returned bellievre  i have made no promises sir said the queen drawing herself up proudly  still your majesty forbids us not to hope said chateauneuf  wherewith they found themselves dismissed  there was a great increase of genuine respect in the manner in which bellievre handed the young lady from the queens chamber through the gallery and hall and finally to the boat  no one spoke for there were many standing around but cicely could read in a glance that passed between the frenchmen that they were astonished at her success  her own brain was in a whirl her heart beating high she could hardly realise what had passed but when again placed in the barge the first words she heard were from bellievre  your royal highness will permit me to congratulate you  at the same time she saw to her great joy that m de chateauneuf had caused her fosterfather to enter the barge with them  if the queen of scotland were close at hand the game would be won said bellievre  ah  milord treasurer and m le secretaire are far too cunning to have let her be within reach said chateauneuf  could we but have bound the queen to anything added bellievre  that she always knows how to avoid said the resident ambassador  at least said cicely she has permitted that i should bear the terms to my mother at fotheringhay  that is true said chateauneuf and in my opinion no time should be lost in so doing  i doubt he added looking at richard whether now that her highnesss exalted rank is known the embassy will be permitted to remain a shelter to her in case the queen should demand her of me  your excellency speaks my thought said richard  i am even disposed to believe that it would be wiser to begin our journey this very day  i grieve for the apparent inhospitality and disrespect to one whom i honour so highly said chateauneuf but i verily believe it would be the wiser plan  look you sir the enemies of the unfortunate queen of scotland have done all in their power to hinder my colleague from seeing the queen but today the lord treasurer is occupied at westminster and monsieur le secretaire is sick  she sent for us in one of those wilful moods in which she chooses to assert herself without their knowledge and she remains as it were stunned by the surprise and touched by her royal highnesss pleading  but let these gentlemen discover what has passed or let her recover and send for them and bah they will inquire and messengers will go forth at once to stop her highness and yourself  all will be lost  but if you can actually be on the way to this castle before they hear of itand it is possible you may have a full day in advancethey will be unable to hinder the conditions from being laid before the queen of scots and we are witnesses of what they were  oh let us go let us go at once dear sir entreated cicely  i burn to carry my mother this hope  it was not yet noon so early had been the audience and dark and short as were the days it was quite possible to make some progress on the journey before night  cicely had kept the necessaries for her journey ready and so had mr talbot even to the purchase of horses which were in the shrewsbury house stables  the rest of the mails could be fetched by the mastiffs crew and brought to hull under charge of goatley  madame de salmonnet was a good deal scandalised at son altesse royale going off with only a male escort and to cicelys surprise wept over her and prayed aloud that she might have good success and bring safety and deliverance to the good and persecuted queen for whom she had attempted so much  sir said chateauneuf as he stood beside richard waiting till the girls preparations were over if there could have been any doubts of the royal lineage of your charge her demeanour today would have disproved them  she stood there speaking as an equal all undaunted before that queen before whom all tremble save when they can cajole her  she stood there in the strength of truth and innocence said richard  whereat the frenchman again looked perplexed at these incomprehensible english  cicely presently appeared  it was wonderful to see how that one effort had given her dignity and womanhood  she thanked the two ambassadors for the countenance they had given to her and begged them to continue their exertions in her mothers cause  and she added i believe my mother has already requested of you to keep this matter a secret  they bowed and she added you perceive gentlemen that the very conditions i have offered involve secrecy both as to my mothers future abode and my existence  therefore i trust that you will not consider it inconsistent with your duty to the king of france to send no word of this  again they assured her of their secrecy and the promise was so far kept that the story was reserved for the private ear of henri iii on bellievres return and never put into the despatches  two days later cicely enjoyed some of the happiest hours of her life she stood by the bed where her mother was lying and was greeted with the cry my child my child i thought i never should see thee more domine nunc dimittis  nay dearest mother but i trust she will show mercy  i bring you conditions  mary laid her head on her daughters shoulder and listened  it might be that she had too much experience of elizabeths vacillations to entertain much hope of her being allowed to retire beyond her grasp into a foreign convent and she declared that she could not endure that her beloved devoted child should wear away her life under elizabeths jealous eye but cis put this aside saying with a smile i think she will not be hard with me  she will be no worse than my lady countess and i shall have a secret of joy within me in thinking of you resting among the good nuns  and mary caught hope from the anticipations she would not damp and gave herself to the description of the peaceful cloister life reviewing in turn the nunneries she had heard described and talking over their rules  there would indeed be as little liberty as here but she would live in the midst of prayer and praise and be at rest from the plots and plans the hopes and fears of her long captivity and be at leisure for penitence  for ah my child guiltless though i be of much that is laid to my charge thy mother is a sinful woman all unworthy of what her brave and innocent daughter has dared and done for her  almost equally precious with that mothers greeting was the grave congratulating look of approval which cicely met in humfreys eyes when he had heard all from his father  he could exult in her even while he thought sadly of the future which she had so bravely risked watching over her from a distance in his silent selfrestrained unselfish devotion  the queens coldness towards humfrey had meantime diminished daily though he could not guess whether she really viewed his course as the right one or whether she forgave this as well as all other injuries in the calm gentle state into which she had come not greatly moved by hope or fear content alike to live or die  richard in much anxiety was to remain another day or two at fotheringhay on the plea of his wearied horses and of the sunday rest  meantime mary diligently wrote the conditions but perhaps more to satisfy her daughter than with much hope of their acceptance     chapter xliii  the warrant   yea madam they are gone  they stole away at once and are far on the way to fotheringhay with these same conditions  so spoke davison undersecretary walsingham being still indisposed  and therefore will i see whether the queen of scots will ratify them ere i go farther in the matter returned elizabeth  she will ratify them without question said the secretary ironically seeing that to escape into the hands of one of your majestys enemies is just what she desires  she leaves her daughter as a pledge  yea a piece of tinsel to delude your majesty  elizabeth swore an oath that there was truth in every word and gesture of the maiden  the poor wench may believe all she said herself said davison nay she is as much deluded as the rest and so is that honest dullpated sailor talbot  if your majesty will permit me to call in a fellow i have here i can make all plain  who is he  you know i cannot abide those foul carrion rascals you make use of said elizabeth with an air of disgust  this man is gentleman born  villain he may be but there is naught to offend your majesty in him  he is one langston a kinsman of this talbots and having once been a papist but now having seen the error of his ways he did good service in the unwinding of the late horrible plot  well if no other way will serve you but i must hear the fellow have him in  a neatlydressed small elderly man entirely arrayed in black was called in and knelt most humbly before the queen  being bidden to tell what he knew respecting the lady who had appeared before the queen the day before calling herself bride hepburn he returned for answer that he believed it to be verily her name but that she was the daughter of a man who had fled to france and become an archer of the scottish guard  he told how he had been at hull when the infant had been saved from the wreck and brought home to mistress susan talbot who left the place the next day and had he understood bred up the child as her own  he himself being then as he confessed led astray by the delusions of popery had much commerce with the queens party and had learnt from some of the garrison of dunfermline that the child on board the lost ship was the offspring of this same hepburn and of one of queen marys many namesake kindred who had died in childbirth at lochleven  and now langston professed bitterly to regret what he had done when in his disguise at buxton he had made known to some of marys suite that the supposed cicely talbot was of their country and kindred  she had been immediately made a great favourite by the queen of scots and the attendants all knew who she really was though she still went by the name of talbot  he imagined that the queen of scots whose charms were not so imperishable as those which dazzled his eyes at this moment wanted a fresh bait for her victims since she herself was growing old and thus had actually succeeded in binding babington to her service though even then the girl was puffed up with notions of her own importance and had flouted him and now all other hope having vanished queen marys last and ablest resource had been to possess the poor maiden with an idea of being actually her own child and then to work on her filial obedience to offer herself as a hostage whom mary herself could without scruple leave to her fate so soon as she was ready to head an army of invaders  davison further added that the secretary nau could corroborate that bride hepburn was known to the suite as a kinswoman of the queen and that mr cavendish clerk to sir francis walsingham knew that babington had been suitor to the young lady and had crossed swords with young talbot on her account  elizabeth listened and made no comment at the time save that she sharply questioned langston but his tale was perfectly coherent and as it threw the onus of the deception entirely on mary it did not conflict either with the sincerity evident in both cicely and her fosterfather or with the credentials supplied by the queen of scots of the ciphered letter and of the monograms elizabeth had never heard though if she had asked for further proof they would have been brought forward  she heard all dismissed langston and with some petulance bade davison likewise begone being aware that her ministers meant her to draw the moral that she had involved herself in difficulties by holding a private audience of the french ambassadors without their knowledge or presence  it may be that the very sense of having been touched exasperated her the more  she paced up and down the room restlessly and her ladies heard her mutteringthat she should cheat me thus  i have pitied her often i will pity her no more  to breed up that poor child to be palmed on me  i will make an end of it i can endure this no longer  these tossings to and fro are more than i can bear and all for one who is false false false false my brain will bear no more hap what hap an end must be made of it she or i she or i must die and which is best for england and the faith  that girl had wellnigh made me pity her and it was all a vile cheat  thus it was that elizabeth sent for davison and bade him bring the warrant with him  and thus it was that in the midst of dinner in the hall on the sunday the 5th of february the meine of the castle were startled by the arrival of mr beale the clerk of the council always a bird of sinister omen and accompanied by a still more alarming figure a strong burly man clad in black velvet from head to foot  every one knew who he was and a thrill of dismay that what had been so long expected had come at last went through all who saw him pass through the hall  sir amias was summoned from table and remained in conference with the two arrivals all through evening chapel timean event in itself extraordinary enough to excite general anxiety  it was humfreys turn to be on guard and he had not long taken his station before he was called into the queens apartments where she sat at the foot of her bed in a large chair with a small table before her  no one was with her but her two mediciners bourgoin and gorion  here she said is the list our good doctor has writ of the herbs he requires for my threatened attack of rheumatism  i will endeavour with sir amiass permission to seek them in the park said humfrey  but tell me said mary fixing her clear eyes upon him tell me truly  is there not a surer and more lasting cure for all my ills in preparation  who was it who arrived tonight  madame said humfrey bowing his head low as he knelt on one knee it was mr beale  ay and who besides  madam i heard no name butas she waited for him to speak further he uttered in a choked voiceit was one clad in black  i perceive said mary looking up with a smile  a more effectual doctor than you my good bourgoin  i thank my god and my cousin elizabeth for giving me the martyrs hope at the close of the most mournful life that ever woman lived  nay leave me not as yet good humfrey  i have somewhat to say unto thee  i have a charge for thee something in her tone led him to look up earnestly in her face  thou lovest my child i think she added  the young mans voice was scarcely heard and he only said yea madam but there was an intensity in the tone and eyes which went to her heart  thou dost not speak but thou canst do  wilt thou take her humfrey and with her all the inheritance of peril and sorrow that dogs our unhappy race  ohand there was a mighty sob that almost cut off his voicemy life is already hers and would be spent in her service wherever whatever she was  i guessed it said the queen letting her hand rest on his shoulder and for her thou wilt endure if needful suspicion danger exile  they will be welcome so i may shield her  i trust thee she said and she took his firm strong hand into her own white wasted one  but will thy father consent  thou art his eldest son and heir  he loves her like his own daughter  my brother may have the lands  tis strange said mary that in wedding a princess tis no crown no kingdom that is set before thee only the loss of thine own inheritance  for now that the poor child has made herself known to elizabeth there will be no safety for her between these seas  i have considered it well  i had thought of sending her abroad with my french servants and making her known to my kindred there  that would have been well if she could have accepted the true faith or ifif her heart had not been thine but to have sent her as she is would only expose her to persecution and she hath not the mounting spirit that would cast aside love for the sake of rising  she lived too long with thy mother to be aught save a homely cis  i would have made a princess of her but it passes my powers  nay the question is whether it may yet be possible to prevent the queen from laying hands on her  my father is still here said humfrey and i deem not that any orders have come respecting her  might not he crave permission to take her home that is if she will leave your grace  i will lay my commands on her  it is well thought of said the queen  how soon canst thou have speech with him  he is very like to come to my post said humfrey and then we can walk the gallery and talk unheard  it is well  let him make his demand and i will have her ready to depart as early as may be tomorrow morn  bourgoin i would ask thee to call the maiden hither  cicely appeared from the apartment where she had been sitting with the other ladies  child said the queen as she came in is thy mind set on wedding an archduke  marriage is not for me madam said cicely perplexed and shaken by this strange address and by humfreys presence  nay didst not once tell me of a betrothal now many years ago  what wouldst say if thine own mother were to ratify it  ah madam said cicely blushing crimson however but i pledged myself never to wed save with queen elizabeths consent  on one condition said the queen  but if that condition were not observed by the other party  howwhat mother exclaimed cicely with a scream  there is no fearhumfrey have you heard aught  nothing is certain said mary calmly  i ask thee not to break thy word  i ask thee if thou wert free to marry if thou wouldst be an austrian or lorraine duchess or content thee with an honest english youth whose plighted word is more precious to him than gold  o mother how can you ask said cicely dropping down and hiding her face in the queens lap  then humfrey talbot i give her to thee my child my bride of scotland  thou wilt guard her and shield her and for thine own sake as well as hers save her from the wrath and jealousy of elizabeth hark hark  rise my child  they are presenting arms we shall have paulett in anon to convey my reresupper  they had only just time to compose themselves before paulett came in looking as they all thought grimmer and more starched than ever and not well pleased to find humfrey there but the queen was equal to the occasion  here is dr bourgoins list of the herbs that he needs to ease my aches she said  master talbot is so good as to say that being properly instructed he will go in search of them  they will not be needed said paulett but he spoke no farther to the queen  outside however he said to humfrey young man you do not well to waste the sabbath evening in converse with that blinded woman and meeting mr talbot himself on the stair he said you are going in quest of your son sir  you would do wisely to admonish him that he will bring himself into suspicion if not worse by loitering amid the snares and wiles of the woman whom wrath is even now overtaking  richard found his son pacing the gallery almost choked with agitation and with the endeavour to conceal it from the two stolid heavy yeomen who dozed behind the screen  not till he had reached the extreme end did humfrey master his voice enough to utter in his fathers ear she has given her to me  richard could not answer for a moment then he said i fear me it will be thy ruin humfrey  not ruin in love or faithfulness said the youth  father you know i should everywhere have followed her and watched over her even to the death even if she could never have been mine  i trow thou wouldst said richard  nor would you have it otherwiseyour child your only daughter to be left unguarded  nay i know not that i would said richard  i cannot but care for the poor maid like mine own and i would not have thee less truehearted humfrey even though it cost thee thine home and us our eldest son  you have diccon and ned said humfrey  and then he told what had passed and his father observed that beale had evidently no knowledge of cicelys conference with the queen and apparently no orders to seize her  it had oozed out that a commission had been sent to five noblemen to come and superintend the execution since sir amias paulett had again refused to let it take place without witnesses and richard undertook to apply at once to sir amias for permission to remove his daughter on the ground of saving her tender youth from the shock  then said he i will leave a token at nottingham where i have taken her whether home or at once to hull  if i leave brown roundle at the inn for thee then come home but if it be white blossom then come to hull  it will be best that thou dost not know while here and i cannot go direct to hull because the fens at this season may not be fit for riding  heatherthwayte will need no proofs to convince him that she is not thy sister and can wed you at once and you will also be able to embark in case there be any endeavour to arrest her  taking service in holland said humfrey until there may be safety in returning to england  richard sighed  the risk and sacrifice were great and it was to him like the loss of two children but the die was cast humfrey never could be other than cicelys devoted champion and guardian and it was better that it should be as her husband  so he repaired to sir amias and told him that he desired not to expose his daughters tender years and feeble spirits to the sight of the queens death and claimed permission to take her away with him the next day saying that the permission of the queen had already been granted through his son whom he would gladly also take with him  paulett hemmed and hawed  he thought it a great error in mr talbot to avoid letting his daughter be edified by a spectacle that might go far to moderate the contagion of intercourse with so obstinate a papist and deceiver  being of pitiless mould himself he was incapable of appreciating richards observation that compassion would only increase her devotion to the unfortunate lady  he would not or could not part with humfrey  he said that there would be such a turmoil and concourse that the services of the captain of his yeomen would be indispensable but that he himself and all the rest would be free on the thursday at latest  mr talbots desire to be away was a surprise to him for he was in difficulties how even in that enormous hall to dispose of all who claimed by right or by favour to witness what he called the tardy fulfilment of judgment  yet though he thought it a weakness he did not refuse and ere night mr talbot was able to send formal word that the horses would be ready for mistress cicely at break of day the next morning  the message was transmitted through the ladies as the queen sat writing at her table and she at once gave orders to elizabeth curll to prepare the cloak bag with necessaries for the journey  cicely cried out o madam my mother do not send me from you  there is no help for it little one  it is the only hope of safety or happiness for thee  but i pledged myself to await queen elizabeths reply here  she has replied said mary  how cried cicely  methought your letter confirming mine offers had not yet been sent  it hath not but she hath made known to me that she rejects thy terms my poor maid  is there then no hope said the girl under her breath which came short with dismay  hope yea said mary with a ray of brightness on her face but not earthly hope  that is over and i am more at rest and peace than i can remember to have been since i was a babe at my mothers knee but little one i must preserve thee for thine humfrey and for happiness and so thou must be gone ere the hounds be on thy track  never mother i cannot leave you  you bid no one else to go said cis clinging to her with a face bathed in tears  no one else is imperilled by remaining as thy bold venture has imperilled thee my sweet maid  think child how fears for thee would disturb my spirit when i would fain commune only with heaven seest thou not that to lose thy dear presence for the few days left to me will be far better for me than to be rent with anxiety for thee and it may be to see thee snatched from me by these stern harsh men  to quit you now  it is unnatural  i cannot  you will go child  as queen and as mother alike i lay my commands on you  let not the last almost the only commands i ever gave thee be transgressed and waste not these last hours in a vain strife  she spoke with an authority against which cis had no appeal save by holding her hand tight and covering it with kisses and tears  mary presently released her hand and went on writing giving her a little time to restrain her agony of bitter weeping  the first words spoken were i shall not name thee in my will nor recommend thee to thy brother  it would only bring on thee suspicion and danger  here however is a letter giving full evidence of thy birth and mentioning the various witnesses who can attest it  i shall leave the like with melville but it will be for thy happiness and safety if it never see the light  should thy brother die without heirs then it might be thy duty to come forward and stretch out thy hand for these two crowns which have more thorns than jewels in them alas would that i could dare to hope they might be exchanged for a crown of stars  but lie down on the bed my bairnie  i have much still to do and thou hast a long journey before thee  cicely would fain have resisted but was forced to obey though protesting that she should not sleep and she lay awake for a long time watching the queen writing until unawares slumber overpowered her eyes  when she awoke the queen was standing over her saying it is time thou wert astir little one  oh and have i lost all these hours of you cried cicely as her senses awoke to the remembrance of the situation of affairs mother why did you not let me watch with you  mary only smiled and kissed her brow  the time went by in the preparations in all of which the queen took an active part  her money and jewels had been restored to her by elizabeths orders during her daughters absence and she had put twenty gold pieces in the silken and pearl purse which she always used  more i may not give thee she said  i know not whether i shall be able to give my poor faithful servants enough to carry them to their homes  this thou must have to provide thee  and for my jewels they should be all thine by right but the more valuable ones which bear tokens might only bring thee under suspicion poor child  she wished cicely to choose among them but the poor girl had no heart for choice and the queen herself put in her hand a small case containing a few which were unobtrusive yet well known to her and among them a ring with the hepburn arms given by bothwell  she also showed her a gold chain which she meant to give to humfrey  in this manner time passed till a message came in that master richard talbot was ready  who brought it asked the queen and when she heard that it was humfrey himself who was at the door she bade him be called in  children she said we were interrupted last night  let me see you give your betrothal kiss and bless you  one word my mother said cicely  humfrey will not bear me illwill if i say that while there can still be any hope that queen elizabeth will accept me for her prisoner in your stead i neither can nor ought to wed him  thou mayst safely accept the condition my son said mary  then if these messengers should come to conduct my mother abroad and to take me as her hostage humfrey will know where to find me  yea thou art a good child to the last my little one said mary  you promise humfrey said cicely  i do he said knowing as well as the queen how little chance there was that he would be called on to fulfil it but feeling that the agony of the parting was thus in some degree softened to cicely  mary gave the betrothal ring to humfrey and she laid her hands on their clasped ones  my daughter and my son she said i leave you my blessing  if filial love and unshaken truth can bring down blessings from above they will be yours  think of your mother in times to come as one who hath erred but suffered and repented  if your church permits you pray often for her  remember when you hear her blamed that in the glare of courts she had none to breed her up in godly fear and simple truth like your good mother at bridgefield but that she learnt to think what you view in the light of deadly sin as the mere lawful instruments of government above all for the weaker condemn her not utterly but pray pray with all your hearts that her god and saviour will accept her penitence and unite her sufferings with those of her lord since he has done her the grace of letting her die in part for his church  now she added kissing each brow and then holding her daughter in her embrace take her away humfrey and let me turn my soul from all earthly loves and cares     chapter xliv  on the humber   master talbot had done considerately in arranging that cicely should at least begin her journey on a pillion behind himself for her anguish of suppressed weeping unfitted her to guide a horse and would have attracted the attention of any servingman behind whom he could have placed her whereas she could lay her head against his shoulder and feel a kind of dreary repose there  he would have gone by the more direct way to hull through lincoln but that he feared that february filldyke would have rendered the fens impassable so he directed his course more to the northwest cicely was silent crushed but more capable of riding than of anything else in fact the air and motion seemed to give her a certain relief  he meant to halt for the night at a large inn at nottingham  there was much stir in the court and it seemed to be full of the train of some great noble  richard knew not whether to be glad or sorry when he perceived the shrewsbury colours and the silver mastiff badge and was greeted by a cry of master richard of bridgefield  two or three retainers of higher degree came round him as he rode into the yard and while demanding his news communicated their own that my lord was on his way to fotheringhay to preside at the execution of the queen of scots  he could feel cicelys shudder as he lifted her off her horse and he replied repressively i am bringing my daughter from thence  come in and see my lord said the gentleman  he is a woeful man at the work that is put on him  lord shrewsbury did indeed look sad almost broken as he held out his hand to richard and said  this is a piteous errand cousin on which i am bound  and thou my young kinswoman thou didst not succeed with her majesty  she is sick with grief and weariness said richard  i would fain take her to her chamber  the evident intimacy of the newcomers with so great a personage as my lord procured for them better accommodation than they might otherwise have had and richard obtained for cicely a tiny closet within the room where he was himself to sleep  he even contrived that she should be served alone partly by himself partly by the hostess a kind motherly woman to whom he committed her while he supped with the earl and was afterwards called into his sleeping chamber to tell him of his endeavours at treating with lord and lady talbot and also to hear his lamentations over the business he had been sent upon  he had actually offered to make over his office as earl marshal to burghley for the nonce but as he said that of all the nobles in england such work should fall to the lot of him who had been for fourteen years the poor ladys host and knew her admirable patience and sweet conditions was truly hard  moreover he was joined in the commission with the earl of kent a sour puritan who would rejoice in making her drink to the dregs of the cup of bitterness  he was sick at heart with the thought richard represented that he would at least be able to give what comfort could be derived from mildness and compassion  not i not i said the poor man always weak  not with those harsh yokefellows kent and paulett to drive me on and that viper beale to report to the privy council any strain of mercy as mere treason  what can i do  you would do much my lord if you would move them to restorefor these last hoursto her those faithful servants melville and de preaux whom paulett hath seen fit to seclude from her  it is rank cruelty to let her die without the sacraments of her church when her conscience will not let her accept ours  it is true richard over true  i will do what i can but i doubt me whether i shall prevail where paulett looks on a mass as mere idolatry and will not brook that it should be offered in his house but come you back with me kinsman  we will send old master purvis to take your daughter safely home  richard of course refused and at the same time thinking an explanation necessary and due to the earl disclosed to him that cicely was no child of his but a near kinswoman of the scottish queen whom it was desirable to place out of queen elizabeths reach for the present adding that there had been love passages between her and his son humfrey who intended to wed her and see some foreign service lord shrewsbury showed at first some offence at having been kept in ignorance all these years of such a fact and wondered what his countess would say marvelled too that his cousin should consent to his sons throwing himself away on a mere stranger of perilous connection and going off to foreign wars but the good nobleman was a placable man and always considerably influenced by the person who addressed him and he ended by placing the mastiff at richards disposal to take the young people to scotland or holland or wherever they might wish to go  this decided mr talbot on making at once for the seaport and accordingly he left behind him the horse which was to serve as a token to his son that such was his course  cicely had been worn out with her days journey and slept late and sound so that she was not ready to leave her chamber till the earl and his retinue were gone and thus she was spared actual contact with him who was to doom her mother and see that doom carried out  she was recruited by rest and more ready to talk than on the previous day but she was greatly disappointed to find that she might not be taken to bridgefield  if i could only be with mother susan for one hour she sighed  would that thou couldst my poor maid said richard  the mother hath the trick of comfort  twas not comfort i thought of  none can give me that said the poor girl but she would teach me how to be a good wife to humfrey  these words were a satisfaction to richard who had begun to feel somewhat jealous for his sons sake and to doubt whether the girls affection rose to the point of requiting the great sacrifice made for his sake though truly in those days parents were not wont to be solicitous as to the mutual attachment between a betrothed pair however cicelys absolute resignation of herself and her fate into humfreys hands without even a question and with entire confidence and peace was evidence enough that her heart was entirely his nay had been his throughout all the little flights of ambition now so entirely passed away without apparently a thought on her part  it was on the friday forenoon a day very unlike their last entrance into hull that they again entered the old town in the brightness of a crisp frost but poor cicely could not but contrast her hopeful mood of november with her present overwhelming sorrow where however there was one drop of sweetness  her fosterfather took her again to good mr heatherthwaytes according to the previous invitation and was rejoiced to see that the joyous welcome of oilofgladness awoke a smile and the little girl being well trained in soberness and discretion did not obtrude upon her grief  stern puritan as he was the minister himself contained his satisfaction that the papist woman was to die and never reign over england until he was out of hearing of the pale maiden who hadstrange as it seemed to himloved her enough to be almost brokenhearted at her death  richard saw goatley and set him to prepare the mastiff for an immediate voyage  her crew somewhat like those of a few modern yachts were permanently attached to her and lived in the neighbourhood of the wharf so that under the personal superintendence of one who was as much loved and looked up to as captain talbot all was soon in a state of forwardness and gillingham made himself very useful  when darkness put a stop to the work and supper was being made ready richard found time to explain matters to mr heatherthwayte for his honourable mind would not permit him to ask his host unawares to perform an office that might possibly be construed as treasonable  in spite of the preparation which he had already received through colets communications the ministers wonder was extreme  daughter to the queen of scots say you sir   yonder modest shamefast maiden of such seemly carriage and gentle speech  richard smiled and saidmy good friend had you seen that poor ladyto whom god be mercifulas i have done you would know that what is sweetest in our cicelys outward woman is derived from her for the inner graces i cannot but trace them to mine own good wife  mr heatherthwayte seemed at first hardly to hear him so overpowered was he with the notion that the daughter of her whom he was in the habit of classing with athaliah and herodias was in his house resting on the innocent pillow of oilofgladness  he made his guest recount to him the steps by which the discovery had been made and at last seemed to embrace the idea  then he asked whether master talbot were about to carry the young lady to the protection of her brother in scotland and when the answer was that it might be poor protection even if conferred and that by all accounts the court of scotland was by no means a place in which to leave a lonely damsel with no faithful guardian the minister asked  how then will you bestow the maiden  in that sir i came to ask you to aid me  my son humfrey is following on our steps leaving fotheringhay so soon as his charge there is ended and i ask of you to wed him to the maid whom we will then take to holland when he will take service with the states  the amazement of the clergyman was redoubled and he began at first to plead with richard that a perilous overleaping ambition was leading him thus to mate his son with an evil though a royal race  at this richard smiled and shook his head pointing out that the very last thing any of them desired was that cicelys birth should be known and that even if it were her mothers marriage was very questionable it was no ambition he said that actuated his son but you saw yourself how nineteen years ago the little lad welcomed her as his little sister come back to him  that love hath grown up with him when at fifteen years old he learnt that she was a nameless stranger his first cry was that he would wed her and give her his name  never hath his love faltered and even when this misfortune of her rank was known and he lost all hope of gaining her while her mother bade her renounce him his purpose was even still to watch over and guard her and at the end beyond all our expectations they have had her mothers dying blessing and entreaty that he would take her  sir do you give me your word for that  yea master heatherthwayte as i am a true man  mind you worldly matters look as different to a poor woman who knoweth the headsman is in the house as to one who hath her head on her dying pillow  this queen had devised plans for sending our poor cis abroad to her french and lorraine kindred with some of the french ladies of her train  heaven forbid broke out heatherthwayte in horror  the rankest of papists  even so and with recommendations to give her in marriage to some adventurous prince whom the spaniards might abet in working woe to us in her name  but when she saw how staunch the child is in believing as mine own good dame taught her she saw no doubt that this would be mere giving her over to be persecuted and mewed in a convent  then the woman hath some bowels of mercy though a papist  she even saith that she doubteth not that such as live honestly and faithfully by the light that is in them shall be saved  so when she saw she prevailed nothing with the maid she left off her endeavours moreover my son not only saved her life but won her regard by his faith and honour and she called him to her and even besought him to be her daughters husband  i came to you reverend sir as one who has known from the first that the young folk are no kin to one another and as i think the peril to you is small i deemed that you would do them this office  otherwise i must take her to holland and see them wedded by a stranger there  mr heatherthwayte was somewhat touched but he sat and considered perceiving that to marry the young lady to a loyal englishman was the safest way of hindering her from falling into the clutches of a popish prince but he still demurred and asked how mr talbot could talk of the mere folly of love and for its sake let his eldest son and heir become a mere exile and fugitive cut off it might be from home  for that matter sir said richard my son is not one to loiter about as the lubberly heir cumbering the land at home  he would so long as i am spared in health and strength be doing service by land or sea and i trust that by the time he is needed at home all this may be so forgotten that cis may return safely  the maid hath been our child too long for us to risk her alone  and for such love being weak and foolish surely sir it was the voice of one greater than you or i that bade a man leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife  mr heatherthwayte still murmured something about youth and lightly undertaken and master talbot observed with a smile that when he had seen humfrey he might judge as to the lightness of purpose  richard meanwhile was watching somewhat anxiously for the arrival of his son who he had reckoned would make so much more speed than was possible for cis that he might have almost overtaken them if the fatal business had not been delayed longer than he had seen reason to anticipate  however these last words had not long been out of his mouth when a mans footsteps eager yet with a tired sound and with the clank of spurs came along the paved way outside and there was a knock at the door  some one else had been watching for as the street door was opened cicely sprang forward as humfrey held out his arms then as she rested against his breast he said so that she alone could hear her last words to me were give her my love and blessing and tell her my joy is comesuch joy as i never knew before  then they knew the deed was done and richard said god have mercy on her soul  nor did mr heatherthwayte rebuke him  indeed there was no time for humfrey exclaimed she is swooning  he gathered her in his arms and carried her where they lighted him laying her on oils little bed but she was not entirely unconscious and rallied her senses so as to give him a reassuring look not quite a smile and yet wondrously sweet even in the eyes of others  then as the lamp flashed on his figure she sprang to her feet all else forgotten in the exclamation  o humfrey thou art hurt  what is it  sit thee down  they then saw that his face was indeed very pale and jaded and that his dress was muddied from head to foot and in some places there were marks of blood but as she almost pushed him down on the chest beside the bed he said in a voice hoarse and sunk betraying weariness  naught naught cis only my beast fell with me going down a hill and lamed himself so that i had to lead him the last four or five miles moreover this cut on my hand must needs break forth bleeding more than i knew in the dark or i had not frighted thee by coming in such sorry plight and he in his turn gazed reassuringly into her eyes as she stood over him anxiously examining as if she scarce durst trust him that if stiff and bruised at all it mattered not then she begged a cup of wine for him and sent oil for water and linen and humfrey had to abandon his hand to her to be cleansed and bound up neither of them uttering a word more than needful as she knelt by the chest performing this work with skilful hands though there was now and then a tremor over her whole frame  now dear maid said richard thou must let him come with us and don some dry garments then shalt thou see him again  rest and foodhe needs them said cis in a voice weak and tremulous though the selfrestraint of her princely nature strove to control it  take him father methinks i cannot hear more tonight he will tell me all when we are away together  i would be alone and in the dark i know he is come and you are caring for him  that is enough and i can still thank god  her face quivered and she turned away nor did humfrey dare to shake her further by another demonstration but stumbled after his father to the ministers chamber where some incongruous clerical attire had been provided for him since he disdained the offer of supping in bed  mr heatherthwayte was much struck with the undemonstrativeness of their meeting for there was high esteem for austerity in the puritan world in contrast to the utter want of selfrestraint shown by the more secular characters  when humfrey presently made his appearance with his fathers cloak wrapped over the ministers clean shirt and nether garments richard said son humfrey this good gentleman who baptized our cis would fain be certain that there is no lightness of purpose in this thy design  nay nay mr talbot broke in the minister i spake ere i had seen this gentleman  from what i have now beheld i have no doubts that be she who she may it is a marriage made and blessed in heaven  i thank you sir said humfrey gravely it is my one hope fulfilled  they spoke no more till he had eaten for he was much spent having never rested more than a couple of hours and not slept at all since leaving fotheringhay  he had understood by the colour of the horse left at nottingham which road to take and at the hostel at hull had encountered gillingham who directed him on to mr heatherthwaytes  what he brought himself to tell of the last scene at fotheringhay has been mostly recorded by history and need not here be dwelt upon when bourgoin and melville fell back unable to support their mistress along the hall to the scaffold the queen had said to him thou wilt do me this last service and had leant on his arm along the crowded hall and had taken that moment to speak those last words for cicely  she had blessed james openly and declared her trust that he would find salvation if he lived well and sincerely in the faith he had chosen with him she had secretly blessed her other child  humfrey was much shaken and could hardly command his voice to answer the questions of master heatherthwayte but he so replied to them that one by one the phrases and turns were relinquished which the worthy man had prepared for a sundays sermon on go see now this accursed woman and bury her for she is a kings daughter and he even began to consider of choosing for his text something that would bid his congregation not to judge after the sight of their eyes nor condemn after the hearing of their ears  when humfrey had eaten and drunk and the ruddy hue was returning to his cheek mr heatherthwayte discovered that he must speak with his churchwarden that night  probably the pleasure of communicating the tidings that the deed was accomplished added force to the consideration that the father and son would rather be alone together for he lighted his lantern with alacrity and carried off dustandashes with him  then humfrey had more to tell which brooked no delay  on the day after the departure of his father and cicely will cavendish had arrived and humfrey had been desired to demand from the prisoner an immediate audience for that gentleman  mary had said this is anent the child call him in humfrey and as cavendish had passed the guard he had struck his old comrade on the shoulder and observed what gulls we have at hallamshire  he had come out from his conference fuming and desiring to hear from humfrey whether he were aware of the imposture that had been put on the queen and upon them all and to which yonder stubborn woman still chose to cleavelittle cis talbot supposing herself a queens daughter and they all even grave master richard being duped  it was too much for will  a gentleman so nearly connected with the privy council was not to be deceived like these simple soldiers and sailors though it suited queen marys purposes to declare the maid to be in sooth her daughter and to refuse to disown her  he supposed it was to embroil england for the future that she left such a seed of mischief  and old paulett had been fool enough to let the girl leave the castle whereas cavendishs orders had been to be as secret as possible lest the mischievous suspicion of the existence of such a person should spread but to arrest her and bring her to london as soon as the execution should be over when as he said no harm would happen to her provided she would give up the pretensions with which she had been deceived  it would have been safer for you both said poor queen mary to humfrey afterwards if i had denied her but i could not disown my poor child or prevent her from yet claiming royal rights  moreover i have learnt enough of you talbots to know that you would not owe your safety to falsehood from a dying woman  but wills conceit might be quite as effectual  he was under orders to communicate the matter to no one not already aware of it and as above all things he desired to see the execution as the most memorable spectacle he was likely to behold in his life and he believed cicely to be safe at bridgefield he thought it unnecessary to take any farther steps until that should be over  humfrey had listened to all with what countenance he might and gave as little sign as possible  but when the tragedy had been consummated and he had seen the fair head fall and himself withdrawn poor little bijou from beneath his dead mistresss garment handing him to jean kennedy he hadwith blood still curdling with horrorgone down to the stables taken his horse and ridden away  there would no doubt be pursuit so soon as richard and cicely were found not to be at bridgefield but there was a space in which to act and mr talbot at once said the mastiff is wellnigh ready to sail ye must be wedded tomorrow morn and go on board without delay  they judged it better not to speak of this to the poor bride in her heavy grief and humfrey having heard from their little hostess that mistress cicely lay quite still and sent him her loving greeting consented to avail himself of the hospitable ministers own bed hoping as he confided to his father that very weariness would hinder him from seeing the block the axe and the convulsed face that had haunted him on the only previous time when he had tried to close his eyes  long before day cicely heard her fathers voice bidding her awake and dress herself and handing in a light  the call was welcome for it had been a night of strange dreams and sadder wakenings to the sense it had come at lastyet the one comfort humfrey is near  she dressed herself in those plain black garments she had assumed in london and in due time came down to where her father awaited her she was pale silent and passive and obeyed mechanically as he made her take a little food  she looked about as if for some one and he said humfrey will meet us anon  then he himself put on her cloak hood and muffler  she was like one in a dream never asking where they were going and thus they left the house  there was light from a waning moon and by it he led her to the church  it was a strange wedding in that morning moonlight streaming in at the east window of that grand old church and casting the shadows of the columns and arches on the floor only aided by one wax light which as mr heatherthwayte took care to protest was not placed on the holy table out of superstition but because he could not see without it indeed the table stood lengthways in the centre aisle and would have been bare even of a white cloth had not richard begged for a communion for the young pair to speed them on their perilous way and mr heatherthwaytealmost under protestconsented since a sea voyage and warlike service in a foreign land lay before them  but except that he wore no surplice he had resigned himself to master richard on that most unnatural morning and stifled his inmost sighs when he had to pronounce the name bride given not by himself but by some romish priestwhen the bridegroom with the hand wounded for queen marys sake gave a ruby ring most unmistakably coming from that same perilous quarterand above all when the pair and the father knelt in deep reverence  yet their devotion was evidently so earnest and so heartfelt that he knew not how to blame it and he could not but bless them with his whole heart as he walked down with them to the wharf all were silent except that cicely once paused and said she wanted to speak to father  he came to her side and she took his arm instead of humfreys  sir she said it has come to me that now my sweet mother is left alone it would be no small joy to her and of great service to our good hosts little daughter if oilofgladness could take my place at home for a year or two  none will do that cis but there is much that would be well in the notion and i will consider of it  she is a maid of good conditions and the mother is lonesome  his consideration resulted in his making the proposal much startling though greatly gratifying  master heatherthwayte who thanked him talked of his honour for that discreet and godly woman mistress susan and said he must ponder and pray upon it and would reply when mr talbot returned from his voyage  at the wharf lay the mastiffs boat in charge of gervas and gillingham all three stepped into it together the most silent bride and bridegroom perhaps that the humber had ever seen  only each of the three wrung the hand of the good clergyman  at that moment all the bells in hull broke forth with a joyous peal which by the association made the bride look up with a smile  her husband forced one in return but his fathers eyes which she could not see filled with tears  he knew it was in exultation at her mothers death and they hurried into the boat lest she should catch the purport of the shouts that were beginning to arise as the townsfolk awoke to the knowledge that their enemy was dead  the fires of smithfield were in the remembrance of this generation the cities of flanders were writhing under the spanish yoke the richest spoils of mexico the stoutest hearts of spain were already mustering to reduce england to the condition of antwerp or haarlem and only elizabeths life had seemed to lie between them and her who was bound by her religion to bring all this upon the peaceful land no wonder those who knew not the tissue of cruel deceits and treacheries that had worked the final ruin of the captive and believed her guilty of fearful crimes should have burst forth in a wild tumult of joy such as saddened even the protestant soul of mr heatherthwayte as he turned homewards after giving his blessing to the mournful young girl whom the boat was bearing over the muddy waters of the hull  they soon had her on board but the preparations were hardly yet complete nor could the vessel make her way down the river until the evening tide  it was a bright clear day and a seat on deck was arranged for the lady where she sat with humfrey beside her holding her cloak round her and telling herstrange theme for a bridal dayall he thought well to tell her of those last hours when mary had truly shown herself purified by her long patience and exalted by the hope that her death had in it somewhat of martyrdom  his father meantime superintended the work of the crew being extremely anxious to lose no time and to sail before night  mr heatherthwaytes anxiety brought him on board again for he wanted to ask more questions about the bridgefield doings ere beginning his ponderings and his prayers respecting his decision for his little daughter nor had he taken his final leave when the anchor was at length weighed and the ship had passed by the strange old gables timbered houses and open lofts that bounded the harbour out from the hull river into the humber itself while both the talbots breathed more freely but as the chill air of evening made itself felt they persuaded cicely to let her husband take her down to her cabin  it was at this moment in the deepening twilight that the ship was hailed and a boat came alongside and there was a summons in the queens name and a slightly made lean figure in black came up the side  he was accompanied by a stout man apparently a constable there was a moments pause then the newcomer said kinsman talbot  i count no kindred with betrayers cuthbert langston said richard drawing himself up with folded arms  scorn me not richard talbot was the reply you stood my friend once when none other did so and for that cause have i hindered much hurt to you and yours  but for me you had been in a london jail for these three weeks past  nor do i come to do you evil now  give up the wench and your name shall never be brought forward since the matter is to be private  behold a warrant from the council empowering me to bring before them the person of bride hepburn otherwise called cicely talbot  man of treacheries and violence said mr heatherthwayte standing forward an imposing figure in his full black gown and white ruff go back  the lady is not for thy doubledealing nor is there now any such person as either bride hepburn or cicely talbot  i cry you mercy sneered langston  i see how it is  i shall have to bear your reverence likewise away for a treasonable act in performing the office of matrimony for a person of royal blood without consent of the queen  and your reverence knows the penalty  at that instant there rang from the forecastle a nevertobeforgotten howl of triumphant hatred and fury and with a spring like that of a tiger gillingham bounded upon him with a shout remember babington and grappled with him dragging him backwards to the bulwark  richard and the constable both tried to seize the fiercely struggling forms but in vain  they were over the side in a moment and there was a heavy splash into the muddy waters of the humber thick with the downcome of swollen rivers thrown back by the flowing tide  humfrey came dashing up from below demanding who was overboard and ready to leap to the rescue wherever any should point in the darkness but his father withheld him nor indeed was there sound or eddy to be perceived  it is the manifest judgment of god said mr heatherthwayte in a low awestricken voice  but the constable cried aloud that a murder had been done in resisting the queens warrant  with a ready gesture the minister made humfrey understand that he must keep his wife in the cabin and richard at the same time called mr heatherthwayte and all present to witness that murder as it undoubtedly was it had not been in resisting the queens warrant but in private revenge of the servant harry gillingham for his master babington whom he believed to have been betrayed by this gentleman  it appeared that the constable knew neither the name of the gentleman nor whom the warrant mentioned  he had only been summoned in the queens name to come on board the mastiff to assist in securing the person of a young gentlewoman but who she was or why she was to be arrested the man did not know  he saw no lady on deck and he was by no means disposed to make any search and the presence of master heatherthwayte likewise impressed him much with the belief that all was right with the gentlemen  of course it would have been his duty to detain the mastiff for an inquiry into the matter but the poor man was extremely ill at ease in the vessel and among the retainers of my lord of shrewsbury and in point of fact they might all have been concerned in a crime of much deeper dye without his venturing to interfere  he saw no one to arrest the warrant was lost the murderer was dead and he was thankful enough to be returned to his boat with master richard talbots assurance that it was probable that no inquiry would be made but that if it were the pilot would be there to bear witness of his innocence and that he himself should return in a month at latest with the mastiff  master heatherthwayte consoled the constable further by saying he would return in his boat and speak for him if there were any inquiry after the other passenger  i must speak my farewells here he said and trust we shall have no coil to meet you on your return master richard  but for her said humfrey i could not let my father face it alone when she is in safety  tush lad said his father such plotters as yonder poor wretch had become are not such choice prizes as to be inquired for  men are only too glad to be rid of them when their foul work is done  so farewell good master heatherthwayte added humfrey with thanks for this days work  i have read of good and evil geniuses or angels be they which they may haunting us for life and striving for the mastery  methinks my cis hath found both on the same humber which brought her to us  nay go not forth with pagan nor popish follies on thy tongue young man said heatherthwayte but rather pray that the blessing of the holy one the god of abraham isaac and jacob the god of thy father may be with thee and thine in this strange land and bring thee safely back in his own time  and surely he will bless the faithful  and richard talbot said amen     chapter xlv  ten years after   it was ten years later in the reign of elizabeth when james vi was under one of his many eclipses of favour and when the united english and dutch fleets had been performing gallant exploits at cadiz and tercera that license for a few weeks absence was requested for one of the lieutenants in her majestys guard master richard talbot  and wherefore demanded the royal lady of sir walter raleigh the captain of her guard who made the request  to go to the hague to look after his brothers widow and estate so please your majesty mores the pity said raleigh  his brothers widow repeated the queen  yea madam  for it may be feared that young humfrey talboti know not whether your majesty ever saw himbut he was my brave brother humfrey gilberts godson and sailed with us to the west some sixteen years back  he was as gallant a sailor as ever trod a deck and i never could see why he thought fit to take service with the states but he did good work in the time of the armada and i saw him one of the foremost in the attack on cadiz  nay he was one of those knighted by my lord of essex in the marketplace  then he sailed with my lord of cumberland for the azores now six months since and hath not since been heard of as his brother tells me and therefore doth talbot request this favour of your majesty  send the young man to me returned the queen  diccon to give him his old name was not quite so unsophisticated as when his father had first left him in london  though a good deal shocked by what a new arrival from holland had just told him of the hopelessness of ever seeing the ark of fortune and her captain again he was not so overpowered with grief as to prevent him from being full of excitement and gratification at the honour of an interview with the queen and he arranged his rich scarlet and gold attire so as to set himself off to the best advantage that so he might be pronounced a proper man  queen elizabeth was now some years over sixty and her nose and chin began to meet but otherwise she was as well preserved as ever and quite as alert and dignified  to his increased surprise she was alone and as she was becoming a little deaf she made him kneel very near her chair  so master talbot she said you are the son of richard talbot of bridgefield  an it so please your majesty  and you request license from us to go to the hague  an it so please your majesty repeated diccon wondering what was coming next and as she paused for him to continuethere are grave rumours and great fears for my brothers shiphe being in the dutch serviceand i would fain learn the truth and see what may be done for his wife  who is his wife demanded the queen fixing her keen glittering eyes on him but he replied with readiness  she was an orphan brought up by my father and mother  young man speak plainly  no tampering serves here  she is the wench who came hither to plead for the queen of scots  yea madam said diccon seeing that direct answers were required  tell me truly continued the queen  on your duty to your queen is she what she called herself  to the best of my belief she is madam he answered  look you sir cavendish brought back word that it was all an ingenious figment which had deceived your father mother and the maid herselfand no wonder since the queen of scots persisted therein to the last  yea madam but my mother still keeps absolute proofs in the garments and the letter that were found on the child when recovered from the wreck  i had never known that she was not my sister till her journey to london and when next i went to the north my mother told me the whole truth  i pray then how suits it with the boasted loyalty of your house that this brother of yours should have wedded the maid  madam it was not prudent but he had never a thought save for her throughout his life  her mother committed her to him and holding the matter a deep and dead secret he thought to do your majesty no wrong by the marriage  if he erred be merciful madam  pah foolish youth to whom should i be merciful since the man is dead  no doubt he hath left half a score of children to be puffed up with the wind of their royal extraction  not one madam  when last i heard they were still childless  and now you are on your way to take on you the cheering of your sisterinlaw the widow said the queen and as diccon made a gesture of assent she stretched out her hand and drew him nearer she is then alone in the world  she is my kinswoman if so be she is all she calls herself  now master talbot go not openmouthed about your work but tell this lady that if she can prove her kindred to me and bring evidence of her birth at lochleven i will welcome her here treat her as my cousin the princess of scotland and it may be put her on her way to higher preferment so she prove herself worthy thereof  you take me sir  diccon did take in the situation  he had understood how cavendish partly blinded by langston partly unwilling to believe in any competitor who would be nearer the throne than his niece arabella stewart and partly disconcerted by langstons disappearance had made such a report to the queen and the french ambassador that they had thought that the whole matter was an imposture and had been so ashamed of their acquiescence as to obliterate all record of it  but the queens mind had since recurred to the matter and as in these later years of her reign one of her constant desires was to hinder james from making too sure of the succession she was evidently willing to play his sister off against him  nay in the general uncertainty dreams came over diccon of possible royal honours to queen bridget and then what glories would be reflected on the house of talbot  his father and mother were too old no doubt to bask in the sunshine of the court and nedpity that he was a clergyman and had done so dull a thing as marry that little pupil of his mothers laetitia as he had rendered her puritan name but he might be made a bishop and his mothers scholar would always become any station  and for diccon himselfassuredly the mastiff race would rejoice in a new coronet  seven weeks later diccon was back again and was once more summoned to the queens apartment  he looked crestfallen and she began  well sir  have you brought the lady  not so ant please your majesty  and wherefore  fears she to come or has she sent no message nor letter  she sends her deep and humble thanks madam for the honour your majesty intended her but she  how now  is she too great a fool to accept of it  yea madam  she prays your grace to leave her in her obscurity at the hague  elizabeth made a sound of utter amazement and incredulity and then said this is new madness  come young man tell me all  this is as good and new as ever was play  let me hear  what like is she and what is her house to be preferred to mine  diccon saw his cue and began  her house madam is one of those tall dutch mansions with high roof and many small windows therein with a stoop or broad flight of steps below on the banks of a broad and pleasant canal shaded with fine elmtrees  there i found her on the stoop in the shade with two or three children round her for she is a mother to all the english orphans there and they are but too many  they bring them to her as a matter of course when their parents die and she keeps them till their kindred in england claim them  madam her queenliness of port hath gained on her  had she come she would not have shamed your majesty and it seems that none knowing her true birth she is yet wellnigh a princess among the many wives of officers and merchants who dwell at the hague and doubly so among the men to whom she and her husband have never failed to do a kindness  well madam i weary you  she greeted me as the tender sister she has ever been but she would not brook to hear of fears or compassion for my brother  she would listen to no word of doubt that he was safe but kept the whole household in perfect readiness for him to come  at last i spake your majestys gracious message and madam pardon me but all i got was a sound rating that i should think any hope of royal splendour or preferment should draw her from waiting for humfrey  ay she knew he would come and if not she would never be more than his faithful widow  had he not given up all for her should she fail in patience because his ship tarried awhile  no he should find her ready in his home that he had made for her  why this is as good as the globe theatre cried the queen but with a tear glittering in her eye  your majesty would have said so truly said diccon for as i sat at evening striving hard to make her give over these fantastic notions and consult her true interest behold she gave a crytis his foot yea and verily there was humfrey brown as a berry having been so far with his mate as to the very mouth of the river plate  he had indeed lost his ark of fortune but he has come home with a carrack that quadruples her burthen and with a thousand bars of silver in her hold and then madam the joy the kisses the embraces and even morethe look of perfect content and peace and trust were enough to make a bachelor long for a wife  long to be a fool broke out the queen sharply  look you lad there may be such couples as this humfrey andwhat call you herhere and there  my father and mother are such  yea saucy cockerel as you are but for one such there are a hundred others who fret the yoke and long to be free  ay and this brother of thine what hath he got with this wife of his but banishment and dread of his own land  even so madam but they still count all they either could have had or hoped for nought in comparison with their love to one another  after ten years  ha  they are no subjects for this real world of ours are they not rather swains in my poor philip sidneys arcadia ho no twere pity to meddle with them  leave them to their dutch household and their carracks  let them keep their own secret ill meddle in the matter no more  and so though after elizabeths death and jamess accession sir humfrey and lady talbot gladdened the eyes of the loving and venerable pair at bridgefield the princess bride of scotland still remained in happy obscurity unknown to history     the end
