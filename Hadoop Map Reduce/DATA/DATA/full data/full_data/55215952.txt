55215952	the new magdalen  by wilkie collins     to the memory of charles allston collins 9th april 1873     first scenethe cottage on the frontier   preamble  the place is france  the time is autumn in the year eighteen hundred and seventythe year of the war between france and germany  the persons are captain arnault of the french army surgeon surville of the french ambulance surgeon wetzel of the german army mercy merrick attached as nurse to the french ambulance and grace roseberry a traveling lady on her way to england    chapter i the two women   it was a dark night the rain was pouring in torrents  late in the evening a skirmishing party of the french and a skirmishing party of the germans had met by accident near the little village of lagrange close to the german frontier in the struggle that followed the french had for once got the better of the enemy for the time at least a few hundreds out of the host of the invaders had been forced back over the frontier it was a trifling affair occurring not long after the great german victory of weissenbourg and the newspapers took little or no notice of it  captain arnault commanding on the french side sat alone in one of the cottages of the village inhabited by the miller of the district the captain was reading by the light of a solitary tallowcandle some intercepted dispatches taken from the germans he had suffered the wood fire scattered over the large open grate to burn low the red embers only faintly illuminated a part of the room on the floor behind him lay some of the millers empty sacks in a corner opposite to him was the millers solid walnutwood bed on the walls all around him were the millers colored prints representing a happy mixture of devotional and domestic subjects a door of communication leading into the kitchen of the cottage had been torn from its hinges and used to carry the men wounded in the skirmish from the field they were now comfortably laid at rest in the kitchen under the care of the french surgeon and the english nurse attached to the ambulance a piece of coarse canvas screened the opening between the two rooms in place of the door a second door leading from the bedchamber into the yard was locked and the wooden shutter protecting the one window of the room was carefully barred sentinels doubled in number were placed at all the outposts the french commander had neglected no precaution which could reasonably insure for himself and for his men a quiet and comfortable night  still absorbed in his perusal of the dispatches and now and then making notes of what he read by the help of writing materials placed at his side captain arnault was interrupted by the appearance of an intruder in the room surgeon surville entering from the kitchen drew aside the canvas screen and approached the little round table at which his superior officer was sitting  what is it said the captain sharply  a question to ask replied the surgeon are we safe for the night  why do you want to know inquired the captain suspiciously  the surgeon pointed to the kitchen now the hospital devoted to the wounded men  the poor fellows are anxious about the next few hours he replied they dread a surprise and they ask me if there is any reasonable hope of their having one nights rest what do you think of the chances  the captain shrugged his shoulders the surgeon persisted  surely you ought to know he said  i know that we are in possession of the village for the present retorted captain arnault and i know no more here are the papers of the enemy he held them up and shook them impatiently as he spoke they give me no information that i can rely on for all i can tell to the contrary the main body of the germans outnumbering us ten to one may be nearer this cottage than the main body of the french draw your own conclusions i have nothing more to say  having answered in those discouraging terms captain arnault got on his feet drew the hood of his greatcoat over his head and lit a cigar at the candle  where are you going asked the surgeon  to visit the outposts  do you want this room for a little while  not for some hours to come are you thinking of moving any of your wounded men in here  i was thinking of the english lady answered the surgeon the kitchen is not quite the place for her she would be more comfortable here and the english nurse might keep her company  captain arnault smiled not very pleasantly they are two fine women he said and surgeon surville is a ladies man let them come in if they are rash enough to trust themselves here with you he checked himself on the point of going out and looked back distrustfully at the lighted candle caution the women he said to limit the exercise of their curiosity to the inside of this room  what do you mean  the captains forefinger pointed significantly to the closed windowshutter  did you ever know a woman who could resist looking out of window he asked dark as it is sooner or later these ladies of yours will feel tempted to open that shutter tell them i dont want the light of the candle to betray my headquarters to the german scouts how is the weather still raining  pouring  so much the better the germans wont see us with that consolatory remark he unlocked the door leading into the yard and walked out  the surgeon lifted the canvas screen and called into the kitchen  miss merrick have you time to take a little rest  plenty of time answered a soft voice with an underlying melancholy in it plainly distinguishable though it had only spoken three words  come in then continued the surgeon and bring the english lady with you here is a quiet room all to yourselves  he held back the canvas and the two women appeared  the nurse led the waytall lithe gracefulattired in her uniform dress of neat black stuff with plain linen collar and cuffs and with the scarlet cross of the geneva convention embroidered on her left shoulder pale and sad her expression and manner both eloquently suggestive of suppressed suffering and sorrow there was an innate nobility in the carriage of this womans head an innate grandeur in the gaze of her large gray eyes and in the lines of her finely proportioned face which made her irresistibly striking and beautiful seen under any circumstances and clad in any dress her companion darker in complexion and smaller in stature possessed attractions which were quite marked enough to account for the surgeons polite anxiety to shelter her in the captains room the common consent of mankind would have declared her to be an unusually pretty woman she wore the large gray cloak that covered her from head to foot with a grace that lent its own attractions to a plain and even a shabby article of dress the languor in her movements and the uncertainty of tone in her voice as she thanked the surgeon suggested that she was suffering from fatigue her dark eyes searched the dimlylighted room timidly and she held fast by the nurses arm with the air of a woman whose nerves had been severely shaken by some recent alarm  you have one thing to remember ladies said the surgeon beware of opening the shutter for fear of the light being seen through the window for the rest we are free to make ourselves as comfortable here as we can compose yourself dear madam and rely on the protection of a frenchman who is devoted to you he gallantly emphasized his last words by raising the hand of the english lady to his lips at the moment when he kissed it the canvas screen was again drawn aside a person in the service of the ambulance appeared announcing that a bandage had slipped and that one of the wounded men was to all appearance bleeding to death the surgeon submitting to destiny with the worst possible grace dropped the charming englishwomans hand and returned to his duties in the kitchen the two ladies were left together in the room  will you take a chair madam asked the nurse  dont call me madam returned the young lady cordially my name is grace roseberry what is your name  the nurse hesitated not a pretty name like yours she said and hesitated again call me mercy merrick she added after a moments consideration  had she given an assumed name was there some unhappy celebrity attached to her own name miss roseberry did not wait to ask herself these questions how can i thank you she exclaimed gratefully for your sisterly kindness to a stranger like me  i have only done my duty said mercy merrick a little coldly dont speak of it  i must speak of it what a situation you found me in when the french soldiers had driven the germans away my travelingcarriage stopped the horses seized i myself in a strange country at nightfall robbed of my money and my luggage and drenched to the skin by the pouring rain i am indebted to you for shelter in this placei am wearing your clothesi should have died of the fright and the exposure but for you what return can i make for such services as these  mercy placed a chair for her guest near the captains table and seated herself at some little distance on an old chest in a corner of the room may i ask you a question she said abruptly  a hundred questions cried grace if you like she looked at the expiring fire and at the dimly visible figure of her companion seated in the obscurest corner of the room that wretched candle hardly gives any light she said impatiently it wont last much longer cant we make the place more cheerful come out of your corner call for more wood and more lights  mercy remained in her corner and shook her head candles and wood are scarce things here she answered we must be patient even if we are left in the dark tell me she went on raising her quiet voice a little how came you to risk crossing the frontier in wartime  graces voice dropped when she answered the question graces momentary gayety of manner suddenly left her  i had urgent reasons she said for returning to england  alone rejoined the other without any one to protect you  graces head sank on her bosom i have left my only protectormy fatherin the english burialground at rome she answered simply my mother died years since in canada  the shadowy figure of the nurse suddenly changed its position on the chest she had started as the last word passed miss roseberrys lips  do you know canada asked grace  well was the brief answerreluctantly given short as it was  were you ever near port logan  i once lived within a few miles of port logan  when  some time since with those words mercy merrick shrank back into her corner and changed the subject your relatives in england must be very anxious about you she said  grace sighed i have no relatives in england you can hardly imagine a person more friendless than i am we went away from canada when my fathers health failed to try the climate of italy by the doctors advice his death has left me not only friendless but poor she paused and took a leather lettercase from the pocket of the large gray cloak which the nurse had lent to her my prospects in life she resumed are all contained in this little case here is the one treasure i contrived to conceal when i was robbed of my other things  mercy could just see the lettercase as grace held it up in the deepening obscurity of the room have you got money in it she asked  no only a few family papers and a letter from my father introducing me to an elderly lady in englanda connection of his by marriage whom i have never seen the lady has consented to receive me as her companion and reader if i dont return to england soon some other person may get the place  have you no other resource  none my education has been neglectedwe led a wild life in the far west i am quite unfit to go out as a governess i am absolutely dependent on this stranger who receives me for my fathers sake she put the lettercase back in the pocket of her cloak and ended her little narrative as unaffectedly as she had begun it mine is a sad story is it not she said  the voice of the nurse answered her suddenly and bitterly in these strange words  there are sadder stories than yours there are thousands of miserable women who would ask for no greater blessing than to change places with you  grace started what can there possibly be to envy in such a lot as mine  your unblemished character and your prospect of being established honorably in a respectable house  grace turned in her chair and looked wonderingly into the dim corner of the room  how strangely you say that she exclaimed there was no answer the shadowy figure on the chest never moved grace rose impulsively and drawing her chair after her approached the nurse is there some romance in your life she asked why have you sacrificed yourself to the terrible duties which i find you performing here you interest me indescribably give me your hand  mercy shrank back and refused the offered hand  are we not friends grace asked in astonishment  we can never be friends  why not  the nurse was dumb grace called to mind the hesitation that she had shown when she had mentioned her name and drew a new conclusion from it should i be guessing right she asked eagerly if i guessed you to be some great lady in disguise  mercy laughed to herselflow and bitterly i a great lady she said contemptuously for heavens sake let us talk of something else  graces curiosity was thoroughly roused she persisted once more she whispered persuasively let us be friends she gently laid her hand as she spoke on mercys shoulder mercy roughly shook it off there was a rudeness in the action which would have offended the most patient woman living grace drew back indignantly ah she cried you are cruel  i am kind answered the nurse speaking more sternly than ever  is it kind to keep me at a distance i have told you my story  the nurses voice rose excitedly dont tempt me to speak out she said you will regret it  grace declined to accept the warning i have placed confidence in you she went on it is ungenerous to lay me under an obligation and then to shut me out of your confidence in return  you will have it said mercy merrick you shall have it sit down again graces heart began to quicken its beat in expectation of the disclosure that was to come she drew her chair closer to the chest on which the nurse was sitting with a firm hand mercy put the chair back to a distance from her not so near me she said harshly  why not  not so near repeated the sternly resolute voice wait till you have heard what i have to say  grace obeyed without a word more there was a momentary silence a faint flash of light leaped up from the expiring candle and showed mercy crouching on the chest with her elbows on her knees and her face hidden in her hands the next instant the room was buried in obscurity as the darkness fell on the two women the nurse spoke    chapter ii magdalenin modern times  when your mother was alive were you ever out with her after nightfall in the streets of a great city  in those extraordinary terms mercy merrick opened the confidential interview which grace roseberry had forced on her grace answered simply i dont understand you  i will put it in another way said the nurse its unnatural hardness and sternness of tone passed away from her voice and its native gentleness and sadness returned as she made that reply you read the newspapers like the rest of the world she went on have you ever read of your unhappy fellowcreatures the starving outcasts of the population whom want has driven into sin  still wondering grace answered that she had read of such things often in newspapers and in books  have you heardwhen those starving and sinning fellowcreatures happened to be womenof refuges established to protect and reclaim them  the wonder in graces mind passed away and a vague suspicion of something painful to come took its place these are extraordinary questions she said nervously what do you mean  answer me the nurse insisted have you heard of the refuges have you heard of the women  yes  move your chair a little further away from me she paused her voice without losing its steadiness fell to its lowest tones i was once of those women she said quietly  grace sprang to her feet with a faint cry she stood petrified incapable of uttering a word  i have been in a refuge pursued the sweet sad voice of the other woman i have been in a prison do you still wish to be my friend do you still insist on sitting close by me and taking my hand she waited for a reply and no reply came you see you were wrong she went on gently when you called me crueland i was right when i told you i was kind  at that appeal grace composed herself and spoke i dont wish to offend you she began confusedly  mercy merrick stopped her there  you dont offend me she said without the faintest note of displeasure in her tone i am accustomed to stand in the pillory of my own past life i sometimes ask myself if it was all my fault i sometimes wonder if society had no duties toward me when i was a child selling matches in the streetwhen i was a hardworking girl fainting at my needle for want of food her voice faltered a little for the first time as it pronounced those words she waited a moment and recovered herself its too late to dwell on these things now she said resignedly society can subscribe to reclaim me but society cant take me back you see me here in a place of trustpatiently humbly doing all the good i can it doesnt matter here or elsewhere what i am can never alter what i was for three years past all that a sincerely penitent woman can do i have done it doesnt matter once let my past story be known and the shadow of it covers me the kindest people shrink  she waited again would a word of sympathy come to comfort her from the other womans lips no miss roseberry was shocked miss roseberry was confused i am very sorry for you was all that miss roseberry could say  everybody is sorry for me answered the nurse as patiently as ever everybody is kind to me but the lost place is not to be regained i cant get back i cant get back she cried with a passionate outburst of despairchecked instantly the moment it had escaped her shall i tell you what my experience has been she resumed will you hear the story of magdalenin modern times  grace drew back a step mercy instantly understood her  i am going to tell you nothing that you need shrink from hearing she said a lady in your position would not understand the trials and the struggles that i have passed through my story shall begin at the refuge the matron sent me out to service with the character that i had honestly earnedthe character of a reclaimed woman i justified the confidence placed in me i was a faithful servant one day my mistress sent for mea kind mistress if ever there was one yet mercy i am sorry for you it has come out that i took you from a refuge i shall lose every servant in the house you must go i went back to the matronanother kind woman she received me like a mother we will try again mercy dont be cast down i told you i had been in canada  grace began to feel interested in spite of herself she answered with something like warmth in her tone she returned to her chairplaced at its safe and significant distance from the chest  the nurse went on  my next place was in canada with an officers wife gentlefolks who had emigrated more kindness and this time a pleasant peaceful life for me i said to myself is the lost place regained have i got back my mistress died new people came into our neighborhood there was a young lady among themmy master began to think of another wife i have the misfortune in my situation to be what is called a handsome woman i rouse the curiosity of strangers the new people asked questions about me my masters answers did not satisfy them in a word they found me out the old story again mercy i am very sorry scandal is busy with you and with me we are innocent but there is no help for itwe must part i left the place having gained one advantage during my stay in canada which i find of use to me here  what is it  our nearest neighbors were frenchcanadians i learned to speak the french language  did you return to london  where else could i go without a character said mercy sadly i went back again to the matron sickness had broken out in the refuge i made myself useful as a nurse one of the doctors was struck with mefell in love with me as the phrase is he would have married me the nurse as an honest woman was bound to tell him the truth he never appeared again the old story i began to be weary of saying to myself i cant get back i cant get back despair got hold of me the despair that hardens the heart i might have committed suicide i might even have drifted back into my old lifebut for one man  at those last words her voicequiet and even through the earlier part of her sad storybegan to falter once more she stopped following silently the memories and associations roused in her by what she had just said had she forgotten the presence of another person in the room graces curiosity left grace no resource but to say a word on her side  who was the man she asked how did he befriend you  befriend me he doesnt even know that such a person as i am is in existence  that strange answer naturally enough only strengthened the anxiety of grace to hear more you said just now she began  i said just now that he saved me he did save me you shall hear how one sunday our regular clergyman at the refuge was not able to officiate his place was taken by a stranger quite a young man the matron told us the strangers name was julian gray i sat in the back row of seats under the shadow of the gallery where i could see him without his seeing me his text was from the words joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance what happier women might have thought of his sermon i cannot say there was not a dry eye among us at the refuge as for me he touched my heart as no man has touched it before or since the hard despair melted in me at the sound of his voice the weary round of my life showed its nobler side again while he spoke from that time i have accepted my hard lot i have been a patient woman i might have been something more i might have been a happy woman if i could have prevailed on myself to speak to julian gray  what hindered you from speaking to him  i was afraid  afraid of what  afraid of making my hard life harder still  a woman who could have sympathized with her would perhaps have guessed what those words meant grace was simply embarrassed by her and grace failed to guess  i dont understand you she said  there was no alternative for mercy but to own the truth in plain words she sighed and said the words i was afraid i might interest him in my sorrows and might set my heart on him in return the utter absence of any fellowfeeling with her on graces side expressed itself unconsciously in the plainest terms  you she exclaimed in a tone of blank astonishment  the nurse rose slowly to her feet graces expression of surprise told her plainlyalmost brutallythat her confession had gone far enough  i astonish you she said ah my young lady you dont know what rough usage a womans heart can bear and still beat truly before i saw julian gray i only knew men as objects of horror to me let us drop the subject the preacher at the refuge is nothing but a remembrance nowthe one welcome remembrance of my life i have nothing more to tell you you insisted on hearing my storyyou have heard it  i have not heard how you found employment here said grace continuing the conversation with uneasy politeness as she best might  mercy crossed the room and slowly raked together the last living embers of the fire  the matron has friends in france she answered who are connected with the military hospitals it was not difficult to get me the place under those circumstances society can find a use for me here my hand is as light my words of comfort are as welcome among those suffering wretches she pointed to the room in which the wounded men were lying as if i was the most reputable woman breathing and if a stray shot comes my way before the war is overwell society will be rid of me on easy terms  she stood looking thoughtfully into the wreck of the fireas if she saw in it the wreck of her own life common humanity made it an act of necessity to say something to her grace consideredadvanced a step toward herstoppedand took refuge in the most trivial of all the common phrases which one human being can address to another  if there is anything i can do for you she began the sentence halting there was never finished miss roseberry was just merciful enough toward the lost woman who had rescued and sheltered her to feel that it was needless to say more  the nurse lifted her noble head and advanced slowly toward the canvas screen to return to her duties miss roseberry might have taken my hand she thought to herself bitterly no miss roseberry stood there at a distance at a loss what to say next what can you do for me mercy asked stung by the cold courtesy of her companion into a momentary outbreak of contempt can you change my identity can you give me the name and the place of an innocent woman if i only had your chance if i only had your reputation and your prospects she laid one hand over her bosom and controlled herself stay here she resumed while i go back to my work i will see that your clothes are dried you shall wear my clothes as short a time as possible  with those melancholy wordstouchingly not bitterly spokenshe moved to pass into the kitchen when she noticed that the pattering sound of the rain against the window was audible no more dropping the canvas for the moment she retraced her steps and unfastening the wooden shutter looked out  the moon was rising dimly in the watery sky the rain had ceased the friendly darkness which had hidden the french position from the german scouts was lessening every moment in a few hours more if nothing happened the english lady might resume her journey in a few hours more the morning would dawn  mercy lifted her hand to close the shutter before she could fasten it the report of a rifleshot reached the cottage from one of the distant posts it was followed almost instantly by a second report nearer and louder than the first mercy paused with the shutter in her hand and listened intently for the next sound    chapter iii the german shell  a third rifleshot rang through the night air close to the cottage grace started and approached the window in alarm  what does that firing mean she asked  signals from the outposts the nurse quietly replied  is there any danger have the germans come back  surgeon surville answered the question he lifted the canvas screen and looked into the room as miss roseberry spoke  the germans are advancing on us he said their vanguard is in sight  grace sank on the chair near her trembling from head to foot mercy advanced to the surgeon and put the decisive question to him  do we defend the position she inquired  surgeon surville ominously shook his head  impossible we are outnumbered as usualten to one  the shrill roll of the french drums was heard outside  there is the retreat sounded said the surgeon the captain is not a man to think twice about what he does we are left to take care of ourselves in five minutes we must be out of this place  a volley of rifleshots rang out as he spoke the german vanguard was attacking the french at the outposts grace caught the surgeon entreatingly by the arm take me with you she cried oh sir i have suffered from the germans already dont forsake me if they come back the surgeon was equal to the occasion he placed the hand of the pretty englishwoman on his breast fear nothing madam he said looking as if he could have annihilated the whole german force with his own invincible arm a frenchmans heart beats under your hand a frenchmans devotion protects you graces head sank on his shoulder monsieur surville felt that he had asserted himself he looked round invitingly at mercy she too was an attractive woman the frenchman had another shoulder at her service unhappily the room was darkthe look was lost on mercy she was thinking of the helpless men in the inner chamber and she quietly recalled the surgeon to a sense of his professional duties  what is to become of the sick and wounded she asked  monsieur surville shrugged one shoulderthe shoulder that was free  the strongest among them we can take away with us he said the others must be left here fear nothing for yourself dear lady there will be a place for you in the baggagewagon  and for me too grace pleaded eagerly  the surgeons invincible arm stole round the young ladys waist and answered mutely with a squeeze  take her with you said mercy my place is with the men whom you leave behind  grace listened in amazement think what you risk she said if you stop here  mercy pointed to her left shoulder  dont alarm yourself on my account she answered the red cross will protect me  another roll of the drum warned the susceptible surgeon to take his place as directorgeneral of the ambulance without any further delay he conducted grace to a chair and placed both her hands on his heart this time to reconcile her to the misfortune of his absence wait here till i return for you he whispered fear nothing my charming friend say to yourself surville is the soul of honor surville is devoted to me he struck his breast he again forgot the obscurity in the room and cast one look of unutterable homage at his charming friend a bientot he cried and kissed his hand and disappeared  as the canvas screen fell over him the sharp report of the riflefiring was suddenly and grandly dominated by the roar of cannon the instant after a shell exploded in the garden outside within a few yards of the window  grace sank on her knees with a shriek of terror mercy without losing her selfpossession advanced to the window and looked out  the moon has risen she said the germans are shelling the village  grace rose and ran to her for protection  take me away she cried we shall be killed if we stay here she stopped looking in astonishment at the tall black figure of the nurse standing immovably by the window are you made of iron she exclaimed will nothing frighten you  mercy smiled sadly why should i be afraid of losing my life she answered i have nothing worth living for  the roar of the cannon shook the cottage for the second time a second shell exploded in the courtyard on the opposite side of the building  bewildered by the noise panicstricken as the danger from the shells threatened the cottage more and more nearly grace threw her arms round the nurse and clung in the abject familiarity of terror to the woman whose hand she had shrunk from touching not five minutes since where is it safest she cried where can i hide myself  how can i tell where the next shell will fall mercy answered quietly  the steady composure of the one woman seemed to madden the other releasing the nurse grace looked wildly round for a way of escape from the cottage making first for the kitchen she was driven back by the clamor and confusion attending the removal of those among the wounded who were strong enough to be placed in the wagon a second look round showed her the door leading into the yard she rushed to it with a cry of relief she had just laid her hand on the lock when the third report of cannon burst over the place  starting back a step grace lifted her hands mechanically to her ears at the same moment the third shell burst through the roof of the cottage and exploded in the room just inside the door mercy sprang forward unhurt from her place at the window the burning fragments of the shell were already firing the dry wooden floor and in the midst of them dimly seen through the smoke lay the insensible body of her companion in the room even at that dreadful moment the nurses presence of mind did not fail her hurrying back to the place that she had just left near which she had already noticed the millers empty sacks lying in a heap she seized two of them and throwing them on the smoldering floor trampled out the fire that done she knelt by the senseless woman and lifted her head  was she wounded or dead  mercy raised one helpless hand and laid her fingers on the wrist while she was still vainly trying to feel for the beating of the pulse surgeon surville alarmed for the ladies hurried in to inquire if any harm had been done  mercy called to him to approach i am afraid the shell has struck her she said yielding her place to him see if she is badly hurt  the surgeons anxiety for his charming patient expressed itself briefly in an oath with a prodigious emphasis laid on one of the letters in itthe letter r take off her cloak he cried raising his hand to her neck poor angel she has turned in falling the string is twisted round her throat  mercy removed the cloak it dropped on the floor as the surgeon lifted grace in his arms get a candle he said impatiently they will give you one in the kitchen he tried to feel the pulse his hand trembled the noise and confusion in the kitchen bewildered him just heaven he exclaimed my emotions overpower me mercy approached him with the candle the light disclosed the frightful injury which a fragment of the shell had inflicted on the englishwomans head surgeon survilles manner altered on the instant the expression of anxiety left his face its professional composure covered it suddenly like a mask what was the object of his admiration now an inert burden in his armsnothing more  the change in his face was not lost on mercy her large gray eyes watched him attentively is the lady seriously wounded she asked  dont trouble yourself to hold the light any longer was the cool reply its all overi can do nothing for her  dead  surgeon surville nodded and shook his fist in the direction of the outposts accursed germans he cried and looked down at the dead face on his arm and shrugged his shoulders resignedly the fortune of war he said as he lifted the body and placed it on the bed in one corner of the room next time nurse it may be you or me who knows bah the problem of human destiny disgusts me he turned from the bed and illustrated his disgust by spitting on the fragments of the exploded shell we must leave her there he resumed she was once a charming personshe is nothing now come away miss mercy before it is too late  he offered his arm to the nurse the creaking of the baggagewagon starting on its journey was heard outside and the shrill roll of the drums was renewed in the distance the retreat had begun  mercy drew aside the canvas and saw the badly wounded men left helpless at the mercy of the enemy on their straw beds she refused the offer of monsieur survilles arm  i have already told you that i shall stay here she answered  monsieur surville lifted his hands in polite remonstrance mercy held back the curtain and pointed to the cottage door  go she said my mind is made up  even at that final moment the frenchman asserted himself he made his exit with unimpaired grace and dignity madam he said you are sublime with that parting compliment the man of gallantrytrue to the last to his admiration of the sexbowed with his hand on his heart and left the cottage  mercy dropped the canvas over the doorway she was alone with the dead woman  the last tramp of footsteps the last rumbling of the wagon wheels died away in the distance no renewal of firing from the position occupied by the enemy disturbed the silence that followed the germans knew that the french were in retreat a few minutes more and they would take possession of the abandoned village the tumult of their approach should become audible at the cottage in the meantime the stillness was terrible even the wounded wretches who were left in the kitchen waited their fate in silence  alone in the room mercys first look was directed to the bed  the two women had met in the confusion of the first skirmish at the close of twilight separated on their arrival at the cottage by the duties required of the nurse they had only met again in the captains room the acquaintance between them had been a short one and it had given no promise of ripening into friendship but the fatal accident had roused mercys interest in the stranger she took the candle and approached the corpse of the woman who had been literally killed at her side  she stood by the bed looking down in the silence of the night at the stillness of the dead face  it was a striking faceonce seen in life or in death not to be forgotten afterward the forehead was unusually low and broad the eyes unusually far apart the mouth and chin remarkably small with tender hands mercy smoothed the disheveled hair and arranged the crumpled dress not five minutes since she thought to herself i was longing to change places with you she turned from the bed with a sigh i wish i could change places now  the silence began to oppress her she walked slowly to the other end of the room  the cloak on the floorher own cloak which she had lent to miss roseberryattracted her attention as she passed it she picked it up and brushed the dust from it and laid it across a chair this done she put the light back on the table and going to the window listened for the first sounds of the german advance the faint passage of the wind through some trees near at hand was the only sound that caught her ears she turned from the window and seated herself at the table thinking was there any duty still left undone that christian charity owed to the dead was there any further service that pressed for performance in the interval before the germans appeared  mercy recalled the conversation that had passed between her illfated companion and herself miss roseberry had spoken of her object in returning to england she had mentioned a ladya connection by marriage to whom she was personally a strangerwho was waiting to receive her some one capable of stating how the poor creature had met with her death ought to write to her only friend who was to do it there was nobody to do it but the one witness of the catastrophe now left in the cottagemercy herself  she lifted the cloak from the chair on which she had placed it and took from the pocket the leather lettercase which grace had shown to her the only way of discovering the address to write to in england was to open the case and examine the papers inside mercy opened the caseand stopped feeling a strange reluctance to carry the investigation any farther  a moments consideration satisfied her that her scruples were misplaced if she respected the case as inviolable the germans would certainly not hesitate to examine it and the germans would hardly trouble themselves to write to england which were the fittest eyes to inspect the papers of the deceased ladythe eyes of men and foreigners or the eyes of her own countrywoman mercys hesitation left her she emptied the contents of the case on the table  that trifling action decided the whole future course of her life    chapter iv the temptation  some letters tied together with a ribbon attracted mercys attention first the ink in which the addresses were written had faded with age the letters directed alternately to colonel roseberry and to the honorable mrs roseberry contained a correspondence between the husband and wife at a time when the colonels military duties had obliged him to be absent from home mercy tied the letters up again and passed on to the papers that lay next in order under her hand  these consisted of a few leaves pinned together and headed in a womans handwriting my journal at rome a brief examination showed that the journal had been written by miss roseberry and that it was mainly devoted to a record of the last days of her fathers life  after replacing the journal and the correspondence in the case the one paper left on the table was a letter the envelope which was unclosed bore this address lady janet roy mablethorpe house kensington london mercy took the inclosure from the open envelope the first lines she read informed her that she had found the colonels letter of introduction presenting his daughter to her protectress on her arrival in england  mercy read the letter through it was described by the writer as the last efforts of a dying man colonel roseberry wrote affectionately of his daughters merits and regretfully of her neglected educationascribing the latter to the pecuniary losses which had forced him to emigrate to canada in the character of a poor man fervent expressions of gratitude followed addressed to lady janet i owe it to you the letter concluded that i am dying with my mind at ease about the future of my darling girl to your generous protection i commit the one treasure i have left to me on earth through your long lifetime you have nobly used your high rank and your great fortune as a means of doing good i believe it will not be counted among the least of your virtues hereafter that you comforted the last hours of an old soldier by opening your heart and your home to his friendless child  so the letter ended mercy laid it down with a heavy heart what a chance the poor girl had lost a woman of rank and fortune waiting to receive hera woman so merciful and so generous that the fathers mind had been easy about the daughter on his deathbedand there the daughter lay beyond the reach of lady janets kindness beyond the need of lady janets help  the french captains writingmaterials were left on the table mercy turned the letter over so that she might write the news of miss roseberrys death on the blank page at the end she was still considering what expressions she should use when the sound of complaining voices from the next room caught her ear the wounded men left behind were moaning for helpthe deserted soldiers were losing their fortitude at last  she entered the kitchen a cry of delight welcomed her appearancethe mere sight of her composed the men from one straw bed to another she passed with comforting words that gave them hope with skilled and tender hands that soothed their pain they kissed the hem of her black dress they called her their guardian angel as the beautiful creature moved among them and bent over their hard pillows her gentle compassionate face i will be with you when the germans come she said as she left them to return to her unwritten letter courage my poor fellows you are not deserted by your nurse  courage madam the men replied and god bless you  if the firing had been resumed at that momentif a shell had struck her dead in the act of succoring the afflicted what christian judgment would have hesitated to declare that there was a place for this woman in heaven but if the war ended and left her still living where was the place for her on earth where were her prospects where was her home  she returned to the letter instead however of seating herself to write she stood by the table absently looking down at the morsel of paper  a strange fancy had sprung to life in her mind on reentering the room she herself smiled faintly at the extravagance of it what if she were to ask lady janet roy to let her supply miss roseberrys place she had met with miss roseberry under critical circumstances and she had done for her all that one woman could do to help another there was in this circumstance some little claim to notice perhaps if lady janet had no other companion and reader in view suppose she ventured to plead her own causewhat would the noble and merciful lady do she would write back and say send me references to your character and i will see what can be done her character her references mercy laughed bitterly and sat down to write in the fewest words all that was needed from hera plain statement of the facts  no not a line could she put on the paper that fancy of hers was not to be dismissed at will her mind was perversely busy now with an imaginative picture of the beauty of mablethorpe house and the comfort and elegance of the life that was led there once more she thought of the chance which miss roseberry had lost unhappy creature what a home would have been open to her if the shell had only fallen on the side of the window instead of on the side of the yard  mercy pushed the letter away from her and walked impatiently to and fro in the room  the perversity in her thoughts was not to be mastered in that way her mind only abandoned one useless train of reflection to occupy itself with another she was now looking by anticipation at her own future what were her prospects if she lived through it when the war was over the experience of the past delineated with pitiless fidelity the dreary scene go where she might do what she might it would always end in the same way curiosity and admiration excited by her beauty inquiries made about her the story of the past discovered society charitably sorry for her society generously subscribing for her and still through all the years of her life the same result in the endthe shadow of the old disgrace surrounding her as with a pestilence isolating her among other women branding her even when she had earned her pardon in the sight of god with the mark of an indelible disgrace in the sight of man there was the prospect and she was only fiveandtwenty last birthday she was in the prime of her health and her strength she might live in the course of nature fifty years more  she stopped again at the bedside she looked again at the face of the corpse  to what end had the shell struck the woman who had some hope in her life and spared the woman who had none the words she had herself spoken to grace roseberry came back to her as she thought of it if i only had your chance if i only had your reputation and your prospects and there was the chance wasted there were the enviable prospects thrown away it was almost maddening to contemplate that result feeling her own position as she felt it in the bitter mockery of despair she bent over the lifeless figure and spoke to it as if it had ears to hear her oh she said longingly if you could be mercy merrick and if i could be grace roseberry now  the instant the words passed her lips she started into an erect position she stood by the bed with her eyes staring wildly into empty space with her brain in a flame with her heart beating as if it would stifle her if you could be mercy merrick and if i could be grace roseberry now in one breathless moment the thought assumed a new development in her mind in one breathless moment the conviction struck her like an electric shock she might be grace roseberry if she dared there was absolutely nothing to stop her from presenting herself to lady janet roy under graces name and in graces place  what were the risks where was the weak point in the scheme  grace had said it herself in so many wordsshe and lady janet had never seen each other her friends were in canada her relations in england were dead mercy knew the place in which she had livedthe place called port loganas well as she had known it herself mercy had only to read the manuscript journal to be able to answer any questions relating to the visit to rome and to colonel roseberrys death she had no accomplished lady to personate grace had spoken herselfher fathers letter spoke also in the plainest termsof her neglected education everything literally everything was in the lost womans favor the people with whom she had been connected in the ambulance had gone to return no more her own clothes were on miss roseberry at that momentmarked with her own name miss roseberrys clothes marked with her name were drying at mercys disposal in the next room the way of escape from the unendurable humiliation of her present life lay open before her at last what a prospect it was a new identity which she might own anywhere a new name which was beyond reproach a new past life into which all the world might search and be welcome her color rose her eyes sparkled she had never been so irresistibly beautiful as she looked at the moment when the new future disclosed itself radiant with new hope  she waited a minute until she could look at her own daring project from another point of view where was the harm of it what did her conscience say  as to grace in the first place what injury was she doing to a woman who was dead the question answered itself no injury to the woman no injury to her relations her relations were dead also  as to lady janet in the second place if she served her new mistress faithfully if she filled her new sphere honorably if she was diligent under instruction and grateful for kindnessif in one word she was all that she might be and would be in the heavenly peace and security of that new lifewhat injury was she doing to lady janet once more the question answered itself she might and would give lady janet cause to bless the day when she first entered the house  she snatched up colonel roseberrys letter and put it into the case with the other papers the opportunity was before her the chances were all in her favor her conscience said nothing against trying the daring scheme she decided then and thereill do it  something jarred on her finer sense something offended her better nature as she put the case into the pocket of her dress she had decided and yet she was not at ease she was not quite sure of having fairly questioned her conscience yet what if she laid the lettercase on the table again and waited until her excitement had all cooled down and then put the contemplated project soberly on its trial before her own sense of right and wrong  she thought onceand hesitated before she could think twice the distant tramp of marching footsteps and the distant clatter of horses hoofs were wafted to her on the night air the germans were entering the village in a few minutes more they would appear in the cottage they would summon her to give an account of herself there was no time for waiting until she was composed again which should it bethe new life as grace roseberry or the old life as mercy merrick  she looked for the last time at the bed graces course was run graces future was at her disposal her resolute nature forced to a choice on the instant held by the daring alternative she persisted in the determination to take graces place  the tramping footsteps of the germans came nearer and nearer the voices of the officers were audible giving the words of command  she seated herself at the table waiting steadily for what was to come  the ineradicable instinct of the sex directed her eyes to her dress before the germans appeared looking it over to see that it was in perfect order her eyes fell upon the red cross on her left shoulder in a moment it struck her that her nurses costume might involve her in a needless risk it associated her with a public position it might lead to inquiries at a later time and those inquiries might betray her  she looked round the gray cloak which she had lent to grace attracted her attention she took it up and covered herself with it from head to foot  the cloak was just arranged round her when she heard the outer door thrust open and voices speaking in a strange tongue and arms grounded in the room behind her should she wait to be discovered or should she show herself of her own accord it was less trying to such a nature as hers to show herself than to wait she advanced to enter the kitchen the canvas curtain as she stretched out her hand to it was suddenly drawn back from the other side and three men confronted her in the open doorway    chapter v the german surgeon  the youngest of the three strangersjudging by features complexion and mannerwas apparently an englishman he wore a military cap and military boots but was otherwise dressed as a civilian next to him stood an officer in prussian uniform and next to the officer was the third and the oldest of the party he also was dressed in uniform but his appearance was far from being suggestive of the appearance of a military man he halted on one foot he stooped at the shoulders and instead of a sword at his side he carried a stick in his hand after looking sharply through a large pair of tortoiseshell spectacles first at mercy then at the bed then all round the room he turned with a cynical composure of manner to the prussian officer and broke the silence in these words  a woman ill on the bed another woman in attendance on her and no one else in the room any necessity major for setting a guard here  no necessity answered the major he wheeled round on his heel and returned to the kitchen the german surgeon advanced a little led by his professional instinct in the direction of the bedside the young englishman whose eyes had remained riveted in admiration on mercy drew the canvas screen over the doorway and respectfully addressed her in the french language  may i ask if i am speaking to a french lady he said  i am an englishwoman mercy replied  the surgeon heard the answer stopping short on his way to the bed he pointed to the recumbent figure on it and said to mercy in good english spoken with a strong german accent  can i be of any use there  his manner was ironically courteous his harsh voice was pitched in one sardonic monotony of tone mercy took an instantaneous dislike to this hobbling ugly old man staring at her rudely through his great tortoiseshell spectacles  you can be of no use sir she said shortly the lady was killed when your troops shelled this cottage  the englishman started and looked compassionately toward the bed the german refreshed himself with a pinch of snuff and put another question  has the body been examined by a medical man he asked  mercy ungraciously limited her reply to the one necessary word yes  the present surgeon was not a man to be daunted by a ladys disapproval of him he went on with his questions  who has examined the body he inquired next  mercy answered the doctor attached to the french ambulance  the german grunted in contemptuous disapproval of all frenchmen and all french institutions the englishman seized his first opportunity of addressing himself to mercy once more  is the lady a countrywoman of ours he asked gently  mercy considered before she answered him with the object she had in view there might be serious reasons for speaking with extreme caution when she spoke of grace  i believe so she said we met here by accident i know nothing of her  not even her name inquired the german surgeon  mercys resolution was hardly equal yet to giving her own name openly as the name of grace she took refuge in flat denial  not even her name she repeated obstinately  the old man stared at her more rudely than ever considered with himself and took the candle from the table he hobbled back to the bed and examined the figure laid on it in silence the englishman continued the conversation no longer concealing the interest that he felt in the beautiful woman who stood before him  pardon me he said you are very young to be alone in wartime in such a place as this  the sudden outbreak of a disturbance in the kitchen relieved mercy from any immediate necessity for answering him she heard the voices of the wounded men raised in feeble remonstrance and the harsh command of the foreign officers bidding them be silent the generous instincts of the woman instantly prevailed over every personal consideration imposed on her by the position which she had assumed reckless whether she betrayed herself or not as nurse in the french ambulance she instantly drew aside the canvas to enter the kitchen a german sentinel barred the way to her and announced in his own language that no strangers were admitted the englishman politely interposing asked if she had any special object in wishing to enter the room  the poor frenchmen she said earnestly her heart upbraiding her for having forgotten them the poor wounded frenchmen  the german surgeon advanced from the bedside and took the matter up before the englishman could say a word more  you have nothing to do with the wounded frenchmen he croaked in the harshest notes of his voice the wounded frenchmen are my business and not yours they are our prisoners and they are being moved to our ambulance i am ingatius wetzel chief of the medical staffand i tell you this hold your tongue he turned to the sentinel and added in german draw the curtain again and if the woman persists put her back into this room with your own hand  mercy attempted to remonstrate the englishman respectfully took her arm and drew her out of the sentinels reach  it is useless to resist he said the german discipline never gives way there is not the least need to be uneasy about the frenchmen the ambulance under surgeon wetzel is admirably administered i answer for it the men will be well treated he saw the tears in her eyes as he spoke his admiration for her rose higher and higher kind as well as beautiful he thought what a charming creature  well said ignatius wetzel eying mercy sternly through his spectacles are you satisfied and will you hold your tongue  she yielded it was plainly useless to resist but for the surgeons resistance her devotion to the wounded men might have stopped her on the downward way that she was going if she could only have been absorbed again mind and body in her good work as a nurse the temptation might even yet have found her strong enough to resist it the fatal severity of the german discipline had snapped asunder the last tie that bound her to her better self her face hardened as she walked away proudly from surgeon wetzel and took a chair  the englishman followed her and reverted to the question of her present situation in the cottage  dont suppose that i want to alarm you he said there is i repeat no need to be anxious about the frenchmen but there is serious reason for anxiety on your own account the action will be renewed round this village by daylight you ought really to be in a place of safety i am an officer in the english armymy name is horace holmcroft i shall be delighted to be of use to you and i can be of use if you will let me may i ask if you are traveling  mercy gathered the cloak which concealed her nurses dress more closely round her and committed herself silently to her first overt act of deception she bowed her head in the affirmative  are you on your way to england  yes  in that case i can pass you through the german lines and forward you at once on your journey  mercy looked at him in unconcealed surprise his stronglyfelt interest in her was restrained within the strictest limits of goodbreeding he was unmistakably a gentleman did he really mean what he had just said  you can pass me through the german lines she repeated you must possess extraordinary influence sir to be able to do that  mr horace holmcroft smiled  i possess the influence that no one can resist he answeredthe influence of the press i am serving here as war correspondent of one of our great english newspapers if i ask him the commanding officer will grant you a pass he is close to this cottage what do you say  she summoned her resolutionnot without difficulty even nowand took him at his word  i gratefully accept your offer sir  he advanced a step toward the kitchen and stopped  it may be well to make the application as privately as possible he said i shall be questioned if i pass through that room is there no other way out of the cottage  mercy showed him the door leading into the yard he bowedand left her  she looked furtively toward the german surgeon ignatius wetzel was still at the bed bending over the body and apparently absorbed in examining the wound which had been inflicted by the shell mercys instinctive aversion to the old man increased tenfold now that she was left alone with him she withdrew uneasily to the window and looked out at the moonlight  had she committed herself to the fraud hardly yet she had committed herself to returning to englandnothing more there was no necessity thus far which forced her to present herself at mablethorpe house in graces place there was still time to reconsider her resolutionstill time to write the account of the accident as she had proposed and to send it with the lettercase to lady janet roy suppose she finally decided on taking this course what was to become of her when she found herself in england again there was no alternative open but to apply once more to her friend the matron there was nothing for her to do but to return to the refuge  the refuge the matron what past association with these two was now presenting itself uninvited and taking the foremost place in her mind of whom was she now thinking in that strange place and at that crisis in her life of the man whose words had found their way to her heart whose influence had strengthened and comforted her in the chapel of the refuge one of the finest passages in his sermon had been especially devoted by julian gray to warning the congregation whom he addressed against the degrading influences of falsehood and deceit the terms in which he had appealed to the miserable women round himterms of sympathy and encouragement never addressed to them beforecame back to mercy merrick as if she had heard them an hour since she turned deadly pale as they now pleaded with her once more oh she whispered to herself as she thought of what she had proposed and planned what have i done what have i done  she turned from the window with some vague idea in her mind of following mr holmcroft and calling him back as she faced the bed again she also confronted ignatius wetzel he was just stepping forward to speak to her with a white handkerchiefthe handkerchief which she had lent to graceheld up in his hand  i have found this in her pocket he said here is her name written on it she must be a countrywoman of yours he read the letters marked on the handkerchief with some difficulty her name ismercy merrick  his lips had said itnot hers he had given her the name  mercy merrick is an english name pursued ignatius wetzel with his eyes steadily fixed on her is it not so  the hold on her mind of the past association with julian gray began to relax one present and pressing question now possessed itself of the foremost place in her thoughts should she correct the error into which the german had fallen the time had cometo speak and assert her own identity or to be silent and commit herself to the fraud  horace holmcroft entered the room again at the moment when surgeon wetzels staring eyes were still fastened on her waiting for her reply  i have not overrated my interest he said pointing to a little slip of paper in his hand here is the pass have you got pen and ink i must fill up the form  mercy pointed to the writing materials on the table horace seated himself and dipped the pen in the ink  pray dont think that i wish to intrude myself into your affairs he said i am obliged to ask you one or two plain questions what is your name  a sudden trembling seized her she supported herself against the foot of the bed her whole future existence depended on her answer she was incapable of uttering a word  ignatius wetzel stood her friend for once his croaking voice filled the empty gap of silence exactly at the right time he doggedly held the handkerchief under her eyes he obstinately repeated mercy merrick is an english name is it not so  horace holmcroft looked up from the table mercy merrick he said who is mercy merrick  surgeon wetzel pointed to the corpse on the bed  i have found the name on the handkerchief he said this lady it seems had not curiosity enough to look for the name of her own countrywoman he made that mocking allusion to mercy with a tone which was almost a tone of suspicion and a look which was almost a look of contempt her quick temper instantly resented the discourtesy of which she had been made the object the irritation of the momentso often do the most trifling motives determine the most serious human actionsdecided her on the course that she should pursue she turned her back scornfully on the rude old man and left him in the delusion that he had discovered the dead womans name  horace returned to the business of filling up the form pardon me for pressing the question he said you know what german discipline is by this time what is your name  she answered him recklessly defiantly without fairly realizing what she was doing until it was done  grace roseberry she said  the words were hardly out of her mouth before she would have given everything she possessed in the world to recall them  miss asked horace smiling  she could only answer him by bowing her head  he wrote miss grace roseberryreflected for a momentand then added interrogatively returning to her friends in england her friends in england mercys heart swelled she silently replied by another sign he wrote the words after the name and shook the sandbox over the wet ink that will be enough he said rising and presenting the pass to mercy i will see you through the lines myself and arrange for your being sent on by the railway where is your luggage  mercy pointed toward the front door of the building in a shed outside the cottage she answered it is not much i can do everything for myself if the sentinel will let me pass through the kitchen  horace pointed to the paper in her hand you can go where you like now he said shall i wait for you here or outside  mercy glanced distrustfully at ignatius wetzel he was again absorbed in his endless examination of the body on the bed if she left him alone with mr holmcroft there was no knowing what the hateful old man might not say of her she answered  wait for me outside if you please  the sentinel drew back with a military salute at the sight of the pass all the french prisoners had been removed there were not more than halfadozen germans in the kitchen and the greater part of them were asleep mercy took grace roseberrys clothes from the corner in which they had been left to dry and made for the sheda rough structure of wood built out from the cottage wall at the front door she encountered a second sentinel and showed her pass for the second time she spoke to this man asking him if he understood french he answered that he understood a little mercy gave him a piece of money and said i am going to pack up my luggage in the shed be kind enough to see that nobody disturbs me the sentinel saluted in token that he understood mercy disappeared in the dark interior of the shed  left alone with surgeon wetzel horace noticed the strange old man still bending intently over the english lady who had been killed by the shell  anything remarkable he asked in the manner of that poor creatures death  nothing to put in a newspaper retorted the cynic pursuing his investigations as attentively as ever  interesting to a doctoreh said horace  yes interesting to a doctor was the gruff reply  horace goodhumoredly accepted the hint implied in those words he quitted the room by the door leading into the yard and waited for the charming englishwoman as he had been instructed outside the cottage  left by himself ignatius wetzel after a first cautious look all round him opened the upper part of graces dress and laid his left hand on her heart taking a little steel instrument from his waistcoat pocket with the other hand he applied it carefully to the wound raised a morsel of the broken and depressed bone of the skull and waited for the result aha he cried addressing with a terrible gayety the senseless creature under his hands the frenchman says you are dead my deardoes he the frenchman is a quack the frenchman is an ass he lifted his head and called into the kitchen max a sleepy young german covered with a dressers apron from his chin to his feet drew the curtain and waited for his instructions bring me my black bag said ignatius wetzel having given that order he rubbed his hands cheerfully and shook himself like a dog now i am quite happy croaked the terrible old man with his fierce eyes leering sidelong at the bed my dear dead englishwoman i would not have missed this meeting with you for all the money i have in the world ha you infernal french quack you call it death do you i call it suspended animation from pressure on the brain  max appeared with the black bag  ignatius wetzel selected two fearful instruments bright and new and hugged them to his bosom my little boys he said tenderly as if they were his children my blessed little boys come to work he turned to the assistant do you remember the battle of solferino maxand the austrian soldier i operated on for a wound on the head  the assistants sleepy eyes opened wide he was evidently interested i remember he said i held the candle  the master led the way to the bed  i am not satisfied with the result of that operation at solferino he said i have wanted to try again ever since its true that i saved the mans life but i failed to give him back his reason along with it it might have been something wrong in the operation or it might have been something wrong in the man whichever it was he will live and die mad now look here my little max at this dear young lady on the bed she gives me just what i wanted here is the case at solferino once more you shall hold the candle again my good boy stand there and look with all your eyes i am going to try if i can save the life and the reason too this time  he tucked up the cuffs of his coat and began the operation as his fearful instruments touched graces head the voice of the sentinel at the nearest outpost was heard giving the word in german which permitted mercy to take the first step on her journey to england  pass the english lady  the operation proceeded the voice of the sentinel at the next post was heard more faintly in its turn pass the english lady  the operation ended ignatius wetzel held up his hand for silence and put his ear close to the patients mouth  the first trembling breath of returning life fluttered over grace roseberrys lips and touched the old mans wrinkled cheek aha he cried good girl you breatheyou live as he spoke the voice of the sentinel at the final limit of the german lines barely audible in the distance gave the word for the last time  pass the english lady     second scenemablethorpe house  preamble  the place is england  the time is winter in the year eighteen hundred and seventy  the persons are julian gray horace holmcroft lady janet roy grace roseberry and mercy merrick    chapter vi lady janets companion  it is a glorious winters day the sky is clear the frost is hard the ice bears for skating  the diningroom of the ancient mansion called mablethorpe house situated in the london suburb of kensington is famous among artists and other persons of taste for the carved woodwork of italian origin which covers the walls on three sides on the fourth side the march of modern improvement has broken in and has va ried and brightened the scene by means of a conservatory forming an entrance to the room through a wintergarden of rare plants and flowers on your right hand as you stand fronting the conservatory the monotony of the paneled wall is relieved by a quaintly patterned door of old inlaid wood leading into the library and thence across the great hall to the other receptionrooms of the house a corresponding door on the left hand gives access to the billiardroom to the smokingroom next to it and to a smaller hall commanding one of the secondary entrances to the building on the left side also is the ample fireplace surmounted by its marble mantelpiece carved in the profusely and confusedly ornate style of eighty years since to the educated eye the diningroom with its modern furniture and conservatory its ancient walls and doors and its lofty mantelpiece neither very old nor very new presents a startling almost a revolutionary mixture of the decorative workmanship of widely differing schools to the ignorant eye the one result produced is an impression of perfect luxury and comfort united in the friendliest combination and developed on the largest scale  the clock has just struck two the table is spread for luncheon  the persons seated at the table are three in number first lady janet roy second a young lady who is her reader and companion third a guest staying in the house who has already appeared in these pages under the name of horace holmcroftattached to the german army as war correspondent of an english newspaper  lady janet roy needs but little introduction everybody with the slightest pretension to experience in london society knows lady janet roy  who has not heard of her old lace and her priceless rubies who has not admired her commanding figure her beautifully dressed white hair her wonderful black eyes which still preserve their youthful brightness after first opening on the world seventy years since who has not felt the charm of her frank easily flowing talk her inexhaustible spirits her goodhumored gracious sociability of manner where is the modern hermit who is not familiarly acquainted by hearsay at least with the fantastic novelty and humor of her opinions with her generous encouragement of rising merit of any sort in all ranks high or low with her charities which know no distinction between abroad and at home with her large indulgence which no ingratitude can discourage and no servility pervert everybody has heard of the popular old ladythe childless widow of a longforgotten lord everybody knows lady janet roy  but who knows the handsome young woman sitting on her right hand playing with her luncheon instead of eating it nobody really knows her  she is prettily dressed in gray poplin trimmed with gray velvet and set off by a ribbon of deep red tied in a bow at the throat she is nearly as tall as lady janet herself and possesses a grace and beauty of figure not always seen in women who rise above the medium height judging by a certain innate grandeur in the carriage of her head and in the expression of her large melancholy gray eyes believers in blood and breeding will be apt to guess that this is another noble lady alas she is nothing but lady janets companion and reader her head crowned with its lovely light brown hair bends with a gentle respect when lady janet speaks her fine firm hand is easily and incessantly watchful to supply lady janets slightest wants the old ladyaffectionately familiar with herspeaks to her as she might speak to an adopted child but the gratitude of the beautiful companion has always the same restraint in its acknowledgment of kindness the smile of the beautiful companion has always the same underlying sadness when it responds to lady janets hearty laugh is there something wrong here under the surface is she suffering in mind or suffering in body what is the matter with her  the matter with her is secret remorse this delicate and beautiful creature pines under the slow torment of constant selfreproach  to the mistress of the house and to all who inhabit it or enter it she is known as grace roseberry the orphan relative by marriage of lady janet roy to herself alone she is known as the outcast of the london streets the inmate of the london refuge the lost woman who has stolen her way backafter vainly trying to fight her way backto home and name there she sits in the grim shadow of her own terrible secret disguised in another persons identity and established in another persons place mercy merrick had only to dare and to become grace roseberry if she pleased she has dared and she has been grace roseberry for nearly four months past  at this moment while lady janet is talking to horace holmcroft something that has passed between them has set her thinking of the day when she took the first fatal step which committed her to the fraud  how marvelously easy of accomplishment the act of personation had been at first sight lady janet had yielded to the fascination of the noble and interesting face no need to present the stolen letter no need to repeat the readymade story the old lady had put the letter aside unopened and had stopped the story at the first words your face is your introduction my dear your father can say nothing for you which you have not already said for yourself there was the welcome which established her firmly in her false identity at the outset thanks to her own experience and thanks to the journal of events at rome questions about her life in canada and questions about colonel roseberrys illness found her ready with answers which even if suspicion had existed would have disarmed suspicion on the spot while the true grace was slowly and painfully winning her way back to life on her bed in a german hospital the false grace was presented to lady janets friends as the relative by marriage of the mistress of mablethorpe house from that time forward nothing had happened to rouse in her the faintest suspicion that grace roseberry was other than a deadandburied woman so far as she now knewso far as any one now knewshe might live out her life in perfect security if her conscience would let her respected distinguished and beloved in the position which she had usurped    she rose abruptly from the table the effort of her life was to shake herself free of the remembrances which haunted her perpetually as they were haunting her now her memory was her worst enemy her one refuge from it was in change of occupation and change of scene  may i go into the conservatory lady janet she asked  certainly my dear  she bent her head to her protectress looked for a moment with a steady compassionate attention at horace holmcroft and slowly crossing the room entered the wintergarden the eyes of horace followed her as long as she was in view with a curious contradictory expression of admiration and disapproval when she had passed out of sight the admiration vanished but the disapproval remained the face of the young man contracted into a frown he sat silent with his fork in his hand playing absently with the fragments on his plate  take some french pie horace said lady janet  no thank you  some more chicken then  no more chicken  will nothing tempt you  i will take some more wine if you will allow me  he filled his glass for the fifth or sixth time with claret and emptied it sullenly at a draught lady janets bright eyes watched him with sardonic attention lady janets ready tongue spoke out as freely as usual what was passing in her mind at the time  the air of kensington doesnt seem to suit you my young friend she said the longer you have been my guest the oftener you fill your glass and empty your cigarcase those are bad signs in a young man when you first came here you arrived invalided by a wound in your place i should not have exposed myself to be shot with no other object in view than describing a battle in a newspaper i suppose tastes differ are you ill does your wound still plague you  not in the least  are you out of spirits  horace holmcroft dropped his fork rested his elbows on the table and answered  awfully  even lady janets large toleration had its limits it embraced every human offense except a breach of good manners she snatched up the nearest weapon of correction at handa tablespoonand rapped her young friend smartly with it on the arm that was nearest to her  my table is not the club table said the old lady hold up your head dont look at your forklook at me i allow nobody to be out of spirits in my house i consider it to be a reflection on me if our quiet life here doesnt suit you say so plainly and find something else to do there is employment to be had i supposeif you choose to apply for it you neednt smile i dont want to see your teethi want an answer  horace admitted with all needful gravity that there was employment to be had the war between france and germany he remarked was still going on the newspaper had offered to employ him again in the capacity of correspondent  dont speak of the newspapers and the war cried lady janet with a sudden explosion of anger which was genuine anger this time i detest the newspapers i wont allow the newspapers to enter this house i lay the whole blame of the blood shed between france and germany at their door  horaces eyes opened wide in amazement the old lady was evidently in earnest what can you possibly mean he asked are the newspapers responsible for the war  entirely responsible answered lady janet why you dont understand the age you live in does anybody do anything nowadays fighting included without wishing to see it in the newspapers i subscribe to a charity thou art presented with a testimonial he preaches a sermon we suffer a grievance you make a discovery they go to church and get married and i thou he we you they all want one and the same thingwe want to see it in the papers are kings soldiers and diplomatists exceptions to the general rule of humanity not they i tell you seriously if the newspapers of europe had one and all decided not to take the smallest notice in print of the war between france and germany it is my firm conviction the war would have come to an end for want of encouragement long since let the pen cease to advertise the sword and i for one can see the result no reportno fighting  your views have the merit of perfect novelty maam said horace would you object to see them in the newspapers  lady janet worsted her young friend with his own weapons  dont i live in the latter part of the nineteenth century she asked in the newspapers did you say in large type horace if you love me  horace changed the subject  you blame me for being out of spirits he said and you seem to think it is because i am tired of my pleasant life at mablethorpe house i am not in the least tired lady janet he looked toward the conservatory the frown showed itself on his face once more the truth is he resumed i am not satisfied with grace roseberry  what has grace done  she persists in prolonging our engagement nothing will persuade her to fix the day for our marriage  it was true mercy had been mad enough to listen to him and to love him but mercy was not vile enough to marry him under her false character and in her false name between three and four months had elapsed since horace had been sent home from the war wounded and had found the beautiful englishwoman whom he had befriended in france established at mablethorpe house invited to become lady janets guest he had passed his holidays as a schoolboy under lady janets rooffree to spend the idle time of his convalescence from morning to night in mercys societythe impression originally produced on him in a french cottage soon strengthened into love before the month was out horace had declared himself and had discovered that he spoke to willing ears from that moment it was only a question of persisting long enough in the resolution to gain his point the marriage engagement was ratifiedmost reluctantly on the ladys sideand there the further progress of horace holmcrofts suit came to an end try as he might he failed to persuade his betrothed wife to fix the day for the marriage there were no obstacles in her way she had no near relations of her own to consult as a connection of lady janets by marriage horaces mother and sisters were ready to receive her with all the honors due to a new member of the family no pecuniary considerations made it necessary in this case to wait for a favorable time horace was an only son and he had succeeded to his fathers estate with an ample income to support it on both sides alike there was absolutely nothing to prevent the two young people from being married as soon as the settlements could be drawn and yet to all appearance here was a long engagement in prospect with no better reason than the ladys incomprehensible perversity to explain the delay can you account for graces conduct asked lady janet her manner changed as she put the question she looked and spoke like a person who was perplexed and annoyed  i hardly like to own it horace answered but i am afraid she has some motive for deferring our marriage which she cannot confide either to you or to me  lady janet started  what makes you think that she asked  i have once or twice caught her in tears every now and thensometimes when she is talking quite gaylyshe suddenly changes color and becomes silent and depressed just now when she left the table didnt you notice it she looked at me in the strangest wayalmost as if she was sorry for me what do these things mean  horaces reply instead of increasing lady janets anxiety seemed to relieve it he had observed nothing which she had not noticed herself you foolish boy she said the meaning is plain enough grace has been out of health for some time past the doctor recommends change of air i shall take her away with me  it would be more to the purpose horace rejoined if i took her away with me she might consent if you would only use your influence is it asking too much to ask you to persuade her my mother and my sisters have written to her and have produced no effect do me the greatest of all kindnessesspeak to her today he paused and possessing himself of lady janets hand pressed it entreatingly you have always been so good to me he said softly and pressed it again  the old lady looked at him it was impossible to dispute that there were attractions in horace holmcrofts face which made it well worth looking at many a woman might have envied him his clear complexion his bright blue eyes and the warm amber tint in his light saxon hair menespecially men skilled in observing physiognomymight have noticed in the shape of his forehead and in the line of his upper lip the signs indicative of a moral nature deficient in largeness and breadthof a mind easily accessible to strong prejudices and obstinate in maintaining those prejudices in the face of conviction itself  to the observation of women these remote defects were too far below the surface to be visible he charmed the sex in general by his rare personal advantages and by the graceful deference of his manner to lady janet he was endeared not by his own merits only but by old associations that were connected with him his father had been one of her many admirers in her young days circumstances had parted them her marriage to another man had been a childless marriage in past times when the boy horace had come to her from school she had cherished a secret fancy too absurd to be communicated to any living creature that he ought to have been her son and might have been her son if she had married his father she smiled charmingly old as she wasshe yielded as his mother might have yieldedwhen the young man took her hand and entreated her to interest herself in his marriage must i really speak to grace she asked with a gentleness of tone and manner far from characteristic on ordinary occasions of the lady of mablethorpe house horace saw that he had gained his point he sprang to his feet his eyes turned eagerly in the direction of the conservatory his handsome face was radiant with hope lady janet with her mind full of his father stole a last look at him sighed as she thought of the vanished days and recovered herself  go to the smokingroom she said giving him a push toward the door away with you and cultivate the favorite vice of the nineteenth century horace attempted to express his gratitude go and smoke was all she said pushing him out go and smoke  left by herself lady janet took a turn in the room and considered a little  horaces discontent was not unreasonable there was really no excuse for the delay of which he complained whether the young lady had a special motive for hanging back or whether she was merely fretting because she did not know her own mind it was in either case necessary to come to a distinct understanding sooner or later on the serious question of the marriage the difficulty was how to approach the subject without giving offense i dont understand the young women of the present generation thought lady janet in my time when we were fond of a man we were ready to marry him at a moments notice and this is an age of progress they ought to be readier still  arriving by her own process of induction at this inevitable conclusion she decided to try what her influence could accomplish and to trust to the inspiration of the moment for exerting it in the right way grace she called out approaching the conservatory door the tall lithe figure in its gray dress glided into view and stood relieved against the green background of the wintergarden  did your ladyship call me  yes i want to speak to you come and sit down by me  with those words lady janet led the way to a sofa and placed her companion by her side    chapter vii the man is coming  you look very pale this morning my child  mercy sighed wearily i am not well she answered the slightest noises startle me i feel tired if i only walk across the room  lady janet patted her kindly on the shoulder we must try what a change will do for you which shall it be the continent or the seaside  your ladyship is too kind to me  it is impossible to be too kind to you  mercy started the color flowed charmingly over her pale face oh she exclaimed impulsively say that again  say it again repeated lady janet with a look of surprise  yes dont think me presuming only think me vain i cant hear you say too often that you have learned to like me is it really a pleasure to you to have me in the house have i always behaved well since i have been with you  the one excuse for the act of personationif excuse there could belay in the affirmative answer to those questions it would be something surely to say of the false grace that the true grace could not have been worthier of her welcome if the true grace had been received at mablethorpe house  lady janet was partly touched partly amused by the extraordinary earnestness of the appeal that had been made to her  have you behaved well she repeated my dear you talk as if you were a child she laid her hand caressingly on mercys arm and continued in a graver tone it is hardly too much to say grace that i bless the day when you first came to me i do believe i could be hardly fonder of you if you were my own daughter  mercy suddenly turned her head aside so as to hide her face lady janet still touching her arm felt it tremble what is the matter with you she asked in her abrupt downright manner  i am only very grateful to your ladyshipthat is all the words were spoken faintly in broken tones the face was still averted from lady janets view what have i said to provoke this wondered the old lady is she in the melting mood today if she is now is the time to say a word for horace keeping that excellent object in view lady janet approached the delicate topic with all needful caution at starting  we have got on so well together she resumed that it will not be easy for either of us to feel reconciled to a change in our lives at my age it will fall hardest on me what shall i do grace when the day comes for parting with my adopted daughter  mercy started and showed her face again the traces of tears were in her eyes why should i leave you she asked in a tone of alarm  surely you know exclaimed lady janet  indeed i dont tell me why  ask horace to tell you  the last allusion was too plain to be misunderstood mercys head drooped she began to tremble again lady janet looked at her in blank amazement  is there anything wrong between horace and you she asked  no  you know your own heart my dear child you have surely not encouraged horace without loving him  oh no  and yet  for the first time in their experience of each other mercy ventured to interrupt her benefactress dear lady janet she interposed gently i am in no hurry to be married there will be plenty of time in the future to talk of that you had something you wished to say to me what is it  it was no easy matter to disconcert lady janet roy but that last question fairly reduced her to silence after all that had passed there sat her young companion innocent of the faintest suspicion of the subject that was to be discussed between them what are the young women of the present time made of thought the old lady utterly at a loss to know what to say next mercy waited on her side with an impenetrable patience which only aggravated the difficulties of the position the silence was fast threatening to bring the interview to a sudden and untimely end when the door from the library opened and a manservant bearing a little silver salver entered the room  lady janets rising sense of annoyance instantly seized on the servant as a victim what do you want she asked sharply i never rang for you  a letter my lady the messenger waits for an answer  the man presented his salver with the letter on it and withdrew  lady janet recognized the handwriting on the address with a look of surprise excuse me my dear she said pausing with her oldfashioned courtesy before she opened the envelope mercy made the necessary acknowledgment and moved away to the other end of the room little thinking that the arrival of the letter marked a crisis in her life lady janet put on her spectacles odd that he should have come back already she said to herself as she threw the empty envelope on the table  the letter contained these lines the writer of them being no other than the man who had preached in the chapel of the refuge  dear aunti am back again in london before my time my friend the rector has shortened his holiday and has resumed his duties in the country i am afraid you will blame me when you hear of the reasons which have hastened his return the sooner i make my confession the easier i shall feel besides i have a special object in wishing to see you as soon as possible may i follow my letter to mablethorpe house and may i present a lady to youa perfect strangerin whom i am interested pray say yes by the bearer and oblige your affectionate nephew  julian gray   lady janet referred again suspiciously to the sentence in the letter which alluded to the lady  julian gray was her only surviving nephew the son of a favorite sister whom she had lost he would have held no very exalted position in the estimation of his auntwho regarded his views in politics and religion with the strongest aversionbut for his marked resemblance to his mother this pleaded for him with the old lady aided as it was by the pride that she secretly felt in the early celebrity which the young clergyman had achieved as a writer and a preacher thanks to these mitigating circumstances and to julians inexhaustible goodhumor the aunt and the nephew generally met on friendly terms apart from what she called his detestable opinions lady janet was sufficiently interested in julian to feel some curiosity about the mysterious lady mentioned in the letter had he determined to settle in life was his choice already made and if so would it prove to be a choice acceptable to the family lady janets bright face showed signs of doubt as she asked herself that last question julians liberal views were capable of leading him to dangerous extremes his aunt shook her head ominously as she rose from the sofa and advanced to the library door  grace she said pausing and turning round i have a note to write to my nephew i shall be back directly  mercy approached her from the opposite extremity of the room with an exclamation of surprise  your nephew she repeated your ladyship never told me you had a nephew  lady janet laughed i must have had it on the tip of my tongue to tell you over and over again she said but we have had so many things to talk aboutand to own the truth my nephew is not one of my favorite subjects of conversation i dont mean that i dislike him i detest his principles my dear thats all however you shall form your own opinion of him he is coming to see me today wait here till i return i have something more to say about horace  mercy opened the library door for her closed it again and walked slowly to and fro alone in the room thinking  was her mind running on lady janets nephew no lady janets brief allusion to her relative had not led her into alluding to him by his name mercy was still as ignorant as ever that the preacher at the refuge and the nephew of her benefactress were one and the same man her memory was busy now with the tribute which lady janet had paid to her at the outset of the interview between them it is hardly too much to say grace that i bless the day when you first came to me for the moment there was balm for her wounded spirit in the remembrance of those words grace roseberry herself could surely have earned no sweeter praise than the praise that she had won the next instant she was seized with a sudden horror of her own successful fraud the sense of her degradation had never been so bitterly present to her as at that moment if she could only confess the truthif she could innocently enjoy her harmless life at mablethorpe housewhat a grateful happy woman she might be was it possible if she made the confession to trust to her own good conduct to plead her excuse no her calmer sense warned her that it was hopeless the place she had wonhonestly wonin lady janets estimation had been obtained by a trick nothing could alter nothing could excuse that she took out her handkerchief and dashed away the useless tears that had gathered in her eyes and tried to turn her thoughts some other way what was it lady janet had said on going into the library she had said she was coming back to speak about horace mercy guessed what the object was she knew but too well what horace wanted of her how was she to meet the emergency in the name of heaven what was to be done could she let the man who loved herthe man whom she loveddrift blindfold into marriage with such a woman as she had been no it was her duty to warn him how could she break his heart could she lay his life waste by speaking the cruel words which might part them forever i cant tell him i wont tell him she burst out passionately the disgrace of it would kill me her varying mood changed as the words escaped her a reckless defiance of her own better naturethat saddest of all the forms in which a womans misery can express itselffilled her heart with its poisoning bitterness she sat down again on the sofa with eyes that glittered and cheeks suffused with an angry red i am no worse than another woman she thought another woman might have married him for his money the next moment the miserable insufficiency of her own excuse for deceiving him showed its hollowness selfexposed she covered her face with her hands and found refugewhere she had often found refuge beforein the helpless resignation of despair oh that i had died before i entered this house oh that i could die and have done with it at this moment so the struggle had ended with her hundreds of times already so it ended now    the door leading into the billiardroom opened softly horace holmcroft had waited to hear the result of lady janets interference in his favor until he could wait no longer  he looked in cautiously ready to withdraw again unnoticed if the two were still talking together the absence of lady janet suggested that the interview had come to an end was his betrothed wife waiting alone to speak to him on his return to the room he advanced a few steps she never moved she sat heedless absorbed in her thoughts were they thoughts of him he advanced a little nearer and called to her  grace  she sprang to her feet with a faint cry i wish you wouldnt startle me she said irritably sinking back on the sofa any sudden alarm sets my heart beating as if it would choke me  horace pleaded for pardon with a lovers humility in her present state of nervous irritation she was not to be appeased she looked away from him in silence entirely ignorant of the paroxysm of mental suffering through which she had just passed he seated himself by her side and asked her gently if she had seen lady janet she made an affirmative answer with an unreasonable impatience of tone and manner which would have warned an older and more experienced man to give her time before he spoke again horace was young and weary of the suspense that he had endured in the other room he unwisely pressed her with another question  has lady janet said anything to you  she turned on him angrily before he could finish the sentence you have tried to make her hurry me into marrying you she burst out i see it in your face  plain as the warning was this time horace still failed to interpret it in the right way dont be angry he said goodhumoredly is it so very inexcusable to ask lady janet to intercede for me i have tried to persuade you in vain my mother and my sisters have pleaded for me and you turn a deaf ear  she could endure it no longer she stamped her foot on the door with hysterical vehemence i am weary of hearing of your mother and your sisters she broke in violently you talk of nothing else  it was just possible to make one more mistake in dealing with herand horace made it he took offense on his side and rose from the sofa his mother and sisters were high authorities in his estimation they variously represented his ideal of perfection in women he withdrew to the opposite extremity of the room and administered the severest reproof that he could think of on the spur of the moment  it would be well grace if you followed the example set you by my mother and my sisters he said they are not in the habit of speaking cruelly to those who love them  to all appearance the rebuke failed to produce the slightest effect she seemed to be as indifferent to it as if it had not reached her ears there was a spirit in hera miserable spirit born of her own bitter experiencewhich rose in revolt against horaces habitual glorification of the ladies of his family it sickens me she thought to herself to hear of the virtues of women who have never been tempted where is the merit of living reputably when your life is one course of prosperity and enjoyment has his mother known starvation have his sisters been left forsaken in the street it hardened her heartit almost reconciled her to deceiving himwhen he set his relatives up as patterns for her would he never understand that women detested having other women exhibited as examples to them she looked round at him with a sense of impatient wonder he was sitting at the luncheontable with his back turned on her and his head resting on his hand if he had attempted to rejoin her she would have repelled him if he had spoken she would have met him with a sharp reply he sat apart from her without uttering a word in a mans hands silence is the most terrible of all protests to the woman who loves him violence she can endure words she is always ready to meet by words on her side silence conquers her after a moments hesitation mercy left the sofa and advanced submissively toward the table she had offended himand she alone was in fault how should he know it poor fellow when he innocently mortified her step by step she drew closer and closer he never looked round he never moved she laid her hand timidly on his shoulder forgive me horace she whispered in his ear i am suffering this morning i am not myself i didnt mean what i said pray forgive me there was no resisting the caressing tenderness of voice and manner which accompanied those words he looked up he took her hand she bent over him and touched his forehead with her lips am i forgiven she asked  oh my darling he said if you only knew how i loved you  i do know it she answered gently twining his hair round her finger and arranging it over his forehead where his hand had ruffled it  they were completely absorbed in each other or they must at that moment have heard the library door open at the other end of the room  lady janet had written the necessary reply to her nephew and had returned faithful to her engagement to plead the cause of horace the first object that met her view was her client pleading with conspicuous success for himself i am not wanted evidently thought the old lady she noiselessly closed the door again and left the lovers by themselves  horace returned with unwise persistency to the question of the deferred marriage at the first words that he spoke she drew back directlysadly not angrily  dont press me today she said i am not well today  he rose and looked at her anxiously may i speak about it tomorrow  yes tomorrow she returned to the sofa and changed the subject what a time lady janet is away she said what can be keeping her so long  horace did his best to appear interested in the question of lady janets prolonged absence what made her leave you he asked standing at the back of the sofa and leaning over her  she went into the library to write a note to her nephew bytheby who is her nephew  is it possible you dont know  indeed i dont  you have heard of him no doubt said horace lady janets nephew is a celebrated man he paused and stooping nearer to her lifted a lovelock that lay over her shoulder and pressed it to his lips lady janets nephew he resumed is julian gray  she started off her seat and looked round at him in blank bewildered terror as if she doubted the evidence of her own senses  horace was completely taken by surprise my dear grace he exclaimed what have i said or done to startle you this time  she held up her hand for silence lady janets nephew is julian gray she repeated and i only know it now  horaces perplexity increased my darling now you do know it what is there to alarm you he asked  there was enough to alarm the boldest woman livingin such a position and with such a temperament as hers to her mind the personation of grace roseberry had suddenly assumed a new aspect the aspect of a fatality it had led her blindfold to the house in which she and the preacher at the refuge were to meet he was comingthe man who had reached her inmost heart who had influenced her whole life was the day of reckoning coming with him  dont notice me she said faintly i have been ill all the morning you saw it yourself when you came in here even the sound of your voice alarmed me i shall be better directly i am afraid i startled you  my dear grace it almost looked as if you were terrified at the sound of julians name he is a public celebrity i know and i have seen ladies start and stare at him when he entered a room but you looked perfectly panicstricken  she rallied her courage by a desperate effort she laugheda harsh uneasy laughand stopped him by putting her hand over his mouth absurd she said lightly as if mr julian gray had anything to do with my looks i am better already see for yourself she looked round at him again with a ghastly gayety and returned with a desperate assumption of indifference to the subject of lady janets nephew of course i have heard of him she said do you know that he is expected here today dont stand there behind meits so hard to talk to you come and sit down  he obeyedbut she had not quite satisfied him yet his face had not lost its expression of anxiety and surprise she persisted in playing her part determined to set at rest in him any possible suspicion that she had reasons of her own for being afraid of julian gray tell me about this famous man of yours she said putting her arm familiarly through his arm what is he like  the caressing action and the easy tone had their effect on horace his face began to clear he answered her lightly on his side  prepare yourself to meet the most unclerical of clergymen he said julian is a lost sheep among the parsons and a thorn in the side of his bishop preaches if they ask him in dissenters chapels declines to set up any pretensions to priestly authority and priestly power goes about doing good on a plan of his own is quite resigned never to rise to the high places in his profession says its rising high enough for him to be the archdeacon of the afflicted the dean of the hungry and the bishop of the poor with all his oddities as good a fellow as ever lived immensely popular with the women they all go to him for advice i wish you would go too  mercy changed color what do you mean she asked sharply  julian is famous for his powers of persuasion said horace smiling if he spoke to you grace he would prevail on you to fix the day suppose i ask julian to plead for me  he made the proposal in jest mercys unquiet mind accepted it as addressed to her in earnest he will do it she thought with a sense of indescribable terror if i dont stop him there is but one chance for her the only certain way to prevent horace from appealing to his friend was to grant what horace wished for before his friend entered the house she laid her hand on his shoulder she hid the terrible anxieties that were devouring her under an assumption of coquetry painful and pitiable to see  dont talk nonsense she said gayly what were we saying just nowbefore we began to speak of mr julian gray  we were wondering what had become of lady janet horace replied  she tapped him impatiently on the shoulder no no it was something you said before that  her eyes completed what her words had left unsaid horaces arm stole round her waist  i was saying that i loved you he answered in a whisper  only that  are you tired of hearing it  she smiled charmingly are you so very much in earnest aboutabout she stopped and looked away from him  about our marriage  yes  it is the one dearest wish of my life  really  really  there was a pause mercys fingers toyed nervously with the trinkets at her watchchain when would you like it to be she said very softly with her whole attention fixed on the watchchain  she had never spoken she had never looked as she spoke and looked now horace was afraid to believe in his own good fortune oh grace he exclaimed you are not trifling with me  what makes you think i am trifling with you  horace was innocent enough to answer her seriously you would not even let me speak of our marriage just now he said  never mind what i did just now she retorted petulantly they say women are changeable it is one of the defects of the sex  heaven be praised for the defects of the sex cried horace with devout sincerity do you really leave me to decide  if you insist on it  horace considered for a momentthe subject being the law of marriage we may be married by license in a fortnight he said i fix this day fortnight  she held up her hands in protest  why not my lawyer is ready there are no preparations to make you said when you accepted me that it was to be a private marriage  mercy was obliged to own that she had certainly said that  we might be married at onceif the law would only let us this day fortnight sayyes he drew her closer to him there was a pause the mask of coquetrybadly worn from the firstdropped from her her sad gray eyes rested compassionately on his eager face dont look so serious he said only one little word grace only yes  she sighed and said it he kissed her passionately it was only by a resolute effort that she released herself  leave me she said faintly pray leave me by myself  she was in earneststrangely in earnest she was trembling from head to foot horace rose to leave her i will find lady janet he said i long to show the dear old lady that i have recovered my spirits and to tell her why he turned round at the library door you wont go away you will let me see you again when you are more composed  i will wait here said mercy  satisfied with that reply he left the room  her hands dropped on her lap her head sank back wearily on the cushions at the head of the sofa there was a dazed sensation in her her mind felt stunned she wondered vacantly whether she was awake or dreaming had she really said the word which pledged her to marry horace holmcroft in a fortnight a fortnight something might happen in that time to prevent it she might find her way in a fortnight out of the terrible position in which she stood anyway come what might of it she had chosen the preferable alternative to a private interview with julian gray she raised herself from her recumbent position with a start as the idea of the interviewdismissed for the last few minutespossessed itself again of her mind her excited imagination figured julian gray as present in the room at that moment speaking to her as horace had proposed she saw him seated close at her sidethis man who had shaken her to the soul when he was in the pulpit and when she was listening to him unseen at the other end of the chapelshe saw him close by her looking her searchingly in the face seeing her shameful secret in her eyes hearing it in her voice feeling it in her trembling hands forcing it out of her word by word till she fell prostrate at his feet with the confession of the fraud her head dropped again on the cushions she hid her face in horror of the scene which her excited fancy had conjured up even now when she had made that dreaded interview needless could she feel sure meeting him only on the most distant terms of not betraying herself she could not feel sure something in her shuddered and shrank at the bare idea of finding herself in the same room with him she felt it she knew it her guilty conscience owned and feared its master in julian gray  the minutes passed the violence of her agitation began to tell physically on her weakened frame  she found herself crying silently without knowing why a weight was on her head a weariness was in all her limbs she sank lower on the cushionsher eyes closedthe monotonous ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece grew drowsily fainter and fainter on her ear little by little she dropped into slumberslumber so light that she started when a morsel of coal fell into the grate or when the birds chirped and twittered in their aviary in the wintergarden  lady janet and horace came in she was faintly conscious of persons in the room after an interval she opened her eyes and half rose to speak to them the room was empty again they had stolen out softly and left her to repose her eyes closed once more she dropped back into slumber and from slumber in the favoring warmth and quiet of the place into deep and dreamless sleep    chapter viii the man appears  after an interval of rest mercy was aroused by the shutting of a glass door at the far end of the conservatory this door leading into the garden was used only by the inmates of the house or by old friends privileged to enter the receptionrooms by that way assuming that either horace or lady janet was returning to the diningroom mercy raised herself a little on the sofa and listened  the voice of one of the menservants caught her ear it was answered by another voice which instantly set her trembling in every limb  she started up and listened again in speechless terror yes there was no mistaking it the voice that was answering the servant was the unforgotten voice which she had heard at the refuge the visitor who had come in by the glass door wasjulian gray  his rapid footsteps advanced nearer and nearer to the diningroom she recovered herself sufficiently to hurry to the library door her hand shook so that she failed at first to open it she had just succeeded when she heard him againspeaking to her  pray dont run away i am nothing very formidable only lady janets nephewjulian gray  she turned slowly spellbound by his voice and confronted him in silence  he was standing hat in hand at the entrance to the conservatory dressed in black and wearing a white cravat but with a studious avoidance of anything specially clerical in the make and form of his clothes young as he was there were marks of care already on his face and the hair was prematurely thin and scanty over his forehead his slight active figure was of no more than the middle height his complexion was pale the lower part of his face without beard or whiskers was in no way remarkable an average observer would have passed him by without notice but for his eyes these alone made a marked man of him the unusual size of the orbits in which they were set was enough of itself to attract attention it gave a grandeur to his head which the head broad and firm as it was did not possess as to the eyes themselves the soft lustrous brightness of them defied analysis no two people could agree about their color divided opinion declaring alternately that they were dark gray or black painters had tried to reproduce them and had given up the effort in despair of seizing any one expression in the bewildering variety of expressions which they presented to view they were eyes that could charm at one moment and terrify at another eyes that could set people laughing or crying almost at will in action and in repose they were irresistible alike when they first descried mercy running to the door they brightened gayly with the merriment of a child when she turned and faced him they changed instantly softening and glowing as they mutely owned the interest and the admiration which the first sight of her had roused in him his tone and manner altered at the same time he addressed her with the deepest respect when he spoke his next words  let me entreat you to favor me by resuming your seat he said and let me ask your pardon if i have thoughtlessly intruded on you  he paused waiting for her reply before he advanced into the room still spellbound by his voice she recovered selfcontrol enough to bow to him and to resume her place on the sofa it was impossible to leave him now after looking at her for a moment he entered the room without speaking to her again she was beginning to perplex as well as to interest him no common sorrow he thought has set its mark on that womans face no common heart beats in that womans breast who can she be  mercy rallied her courage and forced herself to speak to him  lady janet is in the library i believe she said timidly shall i tell her you are here  dont disturb lady janet and dont disturb yourself with that answer he approached the luncheontable delicately giving her time to feel more at her ease he took up what horace had left of the bottle of claret and poured it into a glass my aunts claret shall represent my aunt for the present he said smiling as he turned toward her once more i have had a long walk and i may venture to help myself in this house without invitation is it useless to offer you anything  mercy made the necessary reply she was beginning already after her remarkable experience of him to wonder at his easy manners and his light way of talking  he emptied his glass with the air of a man who thoroughly understood and enjoyed good wine my aunts claret is worthy of my aunt he said with comic gravity as he set down the glass both are the genuine products of nature he seated himself at the table and looked critically at the different dishes left on it one dish especially attracted his attention what is this he went on a french pie it seems grossly unfair to taste french wine and to pass over french pie without notice he took up a knife and fork and enjoyed the pie as critically as he had enjoyed the wine worthy of the great nation he exclaimed with enthusiasm vive la france  mercy listened and looked in inexpressible astonishment he was utterly unlike the picture which her fancy had drawn of him in everyday life take off his white cravat and nobody would have discovered that this famous preacher was a clergyman  he helped himself to another plateful of the pie and spoke more directly to mercy alternately eating and talking as composedly and pleasantly as if they had known each other for years  i came here by way of kensington gardens he said for some time past i have been living in a flat ugly barren agricultural district you cant think how pleasant i found the picture presented by the gardens as a contrast the ladies in their rich winter dresses the smart nursery maids the lovely children the ever moving crowd skating on the ice of the round pond it was all so exhilarating after what i have been used to that i actually caught myself whistling as i walked through the brilliant scene in my time boys used always to whistle when they were in good spirits and i have not got over the habit yet who do you think i met when i was in full song  as well as her amazement would let her mercy excused herself from guessing she had never in all her life before spoken to any living being so confusedly and so unintelligently as she now spoke to julian gray  he went on more gayly than ever without appearing to notice the effect that he had produced on her  whom did i meet he repeated when i was in full song my bishop if i had been whistling a sacred melody his lordship might perhaps have excused my vulgarity out of consideration for my music unfortunately the composition i was executing at the moment i am one of the loudest of living whistlers was by verdila donna e mobilefamiliar no doubt to his lordship on the street organs he recognized the tune poor man and when i took off my hat to him he looked the other way strange in a world that is bursting with sin and sorrow to treat such a trifle seriously as a cheerful clergyman whistling a tune he pushed away his plate as he said the last words and went on simply and earnestly in an altered tone i have never been able he said to see why we should assert ourselves among other men as belonging to a particular caste and as being forbidden in any harmless thing to do as other people do the disciples of old set us no such example they were wiser and better than we are i venture to say that one of the worst obstacles in the way of our doing good among our fellowcreatures is raised by the mere assumption of the clerical manner and the clerical voice for my part i set up no claim to be more sacred and more reverend than any other christian man who does what good he can he glanced brightly at mercy looking at him in helpless perplexity the spirit of fun took possession of him again are you a radical he asked with a humorous twinkle in his large lustrous eyes i am  mercy tried hard to understand him and tried in vain could this be the preacher whose words had charmed purified ennobled her was this the man whose sermon had drawn tears from women about her whom she knew to be shameless and hardened in crime yes the eyes that now rested on her humorously were the beautiful eyes which had once looked into her soul the voice that had just addressed a jesting question to her was the deep and mellow voice which had once thrilled her to the heart in the pulpit he was an angel of mercy out of the pulpit he was a boy let loose from school  dont let me startle you he said goodnaturedly noticing her confusion public opinion has called me by harder names than the name of radical i have been spending my time latelyas i told you just nowin an agricultural district my business there was to perform the duty for the rector of the place who wanted a holiday how do you think the experiment has ended the squire of the parish calls me a communist the farmers denounce me as an incendiary my friend the rector has been recalled in a hurry and i have now the honor of speaking to you in the character of a banished man who has made a respectable neighborhood too hot to hold him  with that frank avowal he left the luncheon table and took a chair near mercy  you will naturally be anxious he went on to know what my offense was do you understand political economy and the laws of supply and demand  mercy owned that she did not understand them  no more do iin a christian country he said that was my offense you shall hear my confession just as my aunt will hear it in two words he paused for a little while his variable manner changed again mercy shyly looking at him saw a new expression in his eyesan expression which recalled her first remembrance of him as nothing had recalled it yet i had no idea he resumed of what the life of a farmlaborer really was in some parts of england until i undertook the rectors duties never before had i seen such dire wretchedness as i saw in the cottages never before had i met with such noble patience under suffering as i found among the people the martyrs of old could endure and die i asked myself if they could endure and live like the martyrs whom i saw round melive week after week month after month year after year on the brink of starvation live and see their pining children growing up round them to work and want in their turn live with the poor mans parish prison to look to as the end when hunger and labor have done their worst was gods beautiful earth made to hold such misery as this i can hardly think of it i can hardly speak of it even now with dry eyes  his head sank on his breast he waitedmastering his emotion before he spoke again now at last she knew him once more now he was the man indeed whom she had expected to see unconsciously she sat listening with her eyes fixed on his face with his heart hanging on his words in the very attitude of the bygone day when she had heard him for the first time  i did all i could to plead for the helpless ones he resumed i went round among the holders of the land to say a word for the tillers of the land these patient people dont want much i said in the name of christ give them enough to live on political economy shrieked at the horrid proposal the laws of supply and demand veiled their majestic faces in dismay starvation wages were the right wages i was told and why because the laborer was obliged to accept them i determined so far as one man could do it that the laborer should not be obliged to accept them i collected my own resourcesi wrote to my friendsand i removed some of the poor fellows to parts of england where their work was better paid such was the conduct which made the neighborhood too hot to hold me so let it be i mean to go on i am known in london i can raise subscriptions the vile laws of supply and demand shall find labor scarce in that agricultural district and pitiless political economy shall spend a few extra shillings on the poor as certainly as i am that radical communist and incendiaryjulian gray  he rosemaking a little gesture of apology for the warmth with which he had spokenand took a turn in the room fired by his enthusiasm mercy followed him her purse was in her hand when he turned and faced her  pray let me offer my little tributesuch as it is she said eagerly  a momentary flush spread over his pale cheeks as he looked at the beautiful compassionate face pleading with him  no no he said smiling though i am a parson i dont carry the beggingbox everywhere mercy attempted to press the purse on him the quaint humor began to twinkle again in his eyes as he abruptly drew back from it dont tempt me he said the frailest of all human creatures is a clergyman tempted by a subscription mercy persisted and conquered she made him prove the truth of his own profound observation of clerical human nature by taking a piece of money from the purse if i must take iti must he remarked thank you for setting the good example thank you for giving the timely help what name shall i put down on my list  mercys eyes looked confusedly away from him no name she said in a low voice my subscription is anonymous  as she replied the library door opened to her infinite reliefto julians secret disappointmentlady janet roy and horace holmcroft entered the room together  julian exclaimed lady janet holding up her hands in astonishment  he kissed his aunt on the cheek your ladyship is looking charmingly he gave his hand to horace horace took it and passed on to mercy they walked away together slowly to the other end of the room julian seized on the chance which left him free to speak privately to his aunt  i came in through the conservatory he said and i found that young lady in the room who is she  are you very much interested in her asked lady janet in her gravely ironical way  julian answered in one expressive word indescribably  lady janet called to mercy to join her  my dear she said let me formally present my nephew to you julian this is miss grace roseberry she suddenly checked herself the instant she pronounced the name julian started as if it was a surprise to him what is it she asked sharply  nothing he answered bowing to mercy with a marked absence of his former ease of manner she returned the courtesy a little restrainedly on her side she too had seen him start when lady janet mentioned the name by which she was known the start meant something what could it be why did he turn aside after bowing to her and address himself to horace with an absent look in his face as if his thoughts were far away from his words a complete change had come over him and it dated from the moment when his aunt had pronounced the name that was not her namethe name that she had stolen  lady janet claimed julians attention and left horace free to return to mercy your room is ready for you she said you will stay here of course julian accepted the invitationstill with the air of a man whose mind was preoccupied instead of looking at his aunt when he made his reply he looked round at mercy with a troubled curiosity in his face very strange to see lady janet tapped him impatiently on the shoulder i expect people to look at me when people speak to me she said what are you staring at my adopted daughter for  your adopted daughter julian repeatedlooking at his aunt this time and looking very earnestly  certainly as colonel roseberrys daughter she is connected with me by marriage already did you think i had picked up a foundling  julians face cleared he looked relieved i had forgotten the colonel he answered of course the young lady is related to us as you say  charmed i am sure to have satisfied you that grace is not an impostor said lady janet with satirical humility she took julians arm and drew him out of hearing of horace and mercy about that letter of yours she proceeded there is one line in it that rouses my curiosity who is the mysterious lady whom you wish to present to me  julian started and changed color  i cant tell you now he said in a whisper  why not  to lady janets unutterable astonishment instead of replying julian looked round at her adopted daughter once more  what has she got to do with it asked the old lady out of all patience with him  it is impossible for me to tell you he answered gravely while miss roseberry is in the room    chapter ix news from mannheim  lady janets curiosity was by this time thoroughly aroused summoned to explain who the nameless lady mentioned in his letter could possibly be julian had looked at her adopted daughter asked next to explain what her adopted daughter had got to do with it he had declared that he could not answer while miss roseberry was in the room  what did he mean lady janet determined to find out  i hate all mysteries she said to julian and as for secrets i consider them to be one of the forms of illbreeding people in our rank of life ought to be above whispering in corners if you must have your mystery i can offer you a corner in the library come with me  julian followed his aunt very reluctantly whatever the mystery might be he was plainly embarrassed by being called upon to reveal it at a moments notice lady janet settled herself in her chair prepared to question and crossquestion her nephew when an obstacle appeared at the other end of the library in the shape of a manservant with a message one of lady janets neighbors had called by appointment to take her to the meeting of a certain committee which assembled that day the servant announced that the neighboran elderly ladywas then waiting in her carriage at the door  lady janets ready invention set the obstacle aside without a moments delay she directed the servant to show her visitor into the drawingroom and to say that she was unexpectedly engaged but that miss roseberry would see the lady immediately she then turned to julian and said with her most satirical emphasis of tone and manner would it be an additional convenience if miss roseberry was not only out of the room before you disclose your secret but out of the house  julian gravely answered it may possibly be quite as well if miss roseberry is out of the house  lady janet led the way back to the diningroom  my dear grace she said you looked flushed and feverish when i saw you asleep on the sofa a little while since it will do you no harm to have a drive in the fresh air our friend has called to take me to the committee meeting i have sent to tell her that i am engagedand i shall be much obliged if you will go in my place  mercy looked a little alarmed does your ladyship mean the committee meeting of the samaritan convalescent home the members as i understand it are to decide today which of the plans for the new building they are to adopt i cannot surely presume to vote in your place  you can vote my dear child just as well as i can replied the old lady architecture is one of the lost arts you know nothing about it i know nothing about it the architects themselves know nothing about it one plan is no doubt just as bad as the other vote as i should vote with the majority or as poor dear dr johnson said shout with the loudest mob away with youand dont keep the committee waiting  horace hastened to open the door for mercy  how long shall you be away he whispered confidentially i had a thousand things to say to you and they have interrupted us  i shall be back in an hour  we shall have the room to ourselves by that time come here when you return you will find me waiting for you  mercy pressed his hand significantly and went out lady janet turned to julian who had thus far remained in the background still to all appearance as unwilling as ever to enlighten his aunt  well she said what is tying your tongue now grace is out of the room why wont you begin is horace in the way  not in the least i am only a little uneasy  uneasy about what  i am afraid you have put that charming creature to some inconvenience in sending her away just at this time  horace looked up suddenly with a flush on his face  when you say that charming creature he asked sharply i suppose you mean miss roseberry  certainly answered julian why not  lady janet interposed gently julian she said grace has only been introduced to you hitherto in the character of my adopted daughter  and it seems to be high time horace added haughtily that i should present her next in the character of my engaged wife  julian looked at horace as if he could hardly credit the evidence of his own ears your wife he exclaimed with an irrepressible outburst of disappointment and surprise  yes my wife returned horace we are to be married in a fortnight may i ask he added with angry humility if you disapprove of the marriage  lady janet interposed once more nonsense horace she said julian congratulates you of course  julian coldly and absently echoed the words oh yes i congratulate you of course  lady janet returned to the main object of the interview  now we thoroughly understand one another she said let us speak of a lady who has dropped out of the conversation for the last minute or two i mean julian the mysterious lady of your letter we are alone as you desired lift the veil my reverend nephew which hides her from mortal eyes blush if you likeand can is she the future mrs julian gray  she is a perfect stranger to me julian answered quietly  a perfect stranger you wrote me word you were interested in her  i am interested in her and what is more you are interested in her too  lady janets fingers drummed impatiently on the table have i not warned you julian that i hate mysteries will you or will you not explain yourself  before it was possible to answer horace rose from his chair perhaps i am in the way he said  julian signed to him to sit down again  i have already told lady janet that you are not in the way he answered i now tell youas miss roseberrys future husbandthat you too have an interest in hearing what i have to say  horace resumed his seat with an air of suspicious surprise julian addressed himself to lady janet  you have often heard me speak he began of my old friend and schoolfellow john cressingham  yes the english consul at mannheim  the same when i returned from the country i found among my other letters a long letter from the consul i have brought it with me and i propose to read certain passages from it which tell a very strange story more plainly and more credibly than i can tell it in my own words  will it be very long inquired lady janet looking with some alarm at the closely written sheets of paper which her nephew spread open before him  horace followed with a question on his side  you are sure i am interested in it he asked the consul at mannheim is a total stranger to me  i answer for it replied julian gravely neither my aunts patience nor yours horace will be thrown away if you will favor me by listening attentively to what i am about to read  with those words he began his first extract from the consuls letter     my memory is a bad one for dates but full three months must have passed since information was sent to me of an english patient received at the hospital here whose case i as english consul might feel an interest in investigating  i went the same day to the hospital and was taken to the bedside  the patient was a womanyoung and when in health i should think very pretty when i first saw her she looked to my uninstructed eye like a dead woman i noticed that her head had a bandage over it and i asked what was the nature of the injury that she had received the answer informed me that the poor creature had been present nobody knew why or wherefore at a skirmish or night attack between the germans and the french and that the injury to her head had been inflicted by a fragment of a german shell  horacethus far leaning back carelessly in his chairsuddenly raised himself and exclaimed good heavens can this be the woman i saw laid out for dead in the french cottage  it is impossible for me to say replied julian listen to the rest of it the consuls letter may answer your question  he went on with his reading  the wounded woman had been reported dead and had been left by the french in their retreat at the time when the german forces took possession of the enemys position she was found on a bed in a cottage by the director of the german ambulance  ignatius wetzel cried horace  ignatius wetzel repeated julian looking at the letter  it is the same said horace lady janet we are really interested in this you remember my telling you how i first met with grace and you have heard more about it since no doubt from grace herself  she has a horror of referring to that part of her journey home replied lady janet she mentioned her having been stopped on the frontier and her finding herself accidentally in the company of another englishwoman a perfect stranger to her i naturally asked questions on my side and was shocked to hear that she had seen the woman killed by a german shell almost close at her side neither she nor i have had any relish for returning to the subject since you were quite right julian to avoid speaking of it while she was in the room i understand it all now grace i suppose mentioned my name to her fellowtraveler the woman is no doubt in want of assistance and she applies to me through you i will help her but she must not come here until i have prepared grace for seeing her again a living woman for the present there is no reason why they should meet  i am not sure about that said julian in low tones without looking up at his aunt  what do you mean is the mystery not at an end yet  the mystery has not even begun yet let my friend the consul proceed  julian returned for the second time to his extract from the letter  after a careful examination of the supposed corpse the german surgeon arrived at the conclusion that a case of suspended animation had in the hurry of the french retreat been mistaken for a case of death feeling a professional interest in the subject he decided on putting his opinion to the test he operated on the patient with complete success after performing the operation he kept her for some days under his own care and then transferred her to the nearest hospitalthe hospital at mannheim he was obliged to return to his duties as army surgeon and he left his patient in the condition in which i saw her insensible on the bed neither he nor the hospital authorities knew anything whatever about the woman no papers were found on her all the doctors could do when i asked them for information with a view to communicating with her friends was to show me her linen marked with her name i left the hospital after taking down the name in my pocketbook it was mercy merrick  lady janet produced her pocketbook let me take the name down too she said i never heard it before and i might otherwise forget it go on julian  julian advanced to his second extract from the consuls letter  under these circumstances i could only wait to hear from the hospital when the patient was sufficiently recovered to be able to speak to me some weeks passed without my receiving any communication from the doctors on calling to make inquiries i was informed that fever had set in and that the poor creatures condition now alternated between exhaustion and delirium in her delirious moments the name of your aunt lady janet roy frequently escaped her otherwise her wanderings were for the most part quite unintelligible to the people at her bedside i thought once or twice of writing to you and of begging you to speak to lady janet but as the doctors informed me that the chances of life or death were at this time almost equally balanced i decided to wait until time should determine whether it was necessary to trouble you or not  you know best julian said lady janet but i own i dont quite see in what way i am interested in this part of the story  just what i was going to say added horace it is very sad no doubt but what have we to do with it  let me read my third extract julian answered and you will see  he turned to the third extract and read as follows  at last i received a message from the hospital informing me that mercy merrick was out of danger and that she was capable though still very weak of answering any questions which i might think it desirable to put to her on reaching the hospital i was requested rather to my surprise to pay my first visit to the head physician in his private room i think it right said this gentleman to warn you before you see the patient to be very careful how you speak to her and not to irritate her by showing any surprise or expressing any doubts if she talks to you in an extravagant manner we differ in opinion about her here some of us myself among the number doubt whether the recovery of her mind has accompanied the recovery of her bodily powers without pronouncing her to be madshe is perfectly gentle and harmlesswe are nevertheless of opinion that she is suffering under a species of insane delusion bear in mind the caution which i have given youand now go and judge for yourself i obeyed in some little perplexity and surprise the sufferer when i approached her bed looked sadly weak and worn but so far as i could judge seemed to be in full possession of herself her tone and manner were unquestionably the tone and manner of a lady after briefly introducing myself i assured her that i should be glad both officially and personally if i could be of any assistance to her in saying these trifling words i happened to address her by the name i had seen marked on her clothes the instant the words miss merrick passed my lips a wild vindictive expression appeared in her eyes she exclaimed angrily dont call me by that hateful name its not my name all the people here persecute me by calling me mercy merrick and when i am angry with them they show me the clothes say what i may they persist in believing they are my clothes dont you do the same if you want to be friends with me remembering what the physician had said to me i made the necessary excuses and succeeded in soothing her without reverting to the irritating topic of the name i merely inquired what her plans were and assured her that she might command my services if she required them why do you want to know what my plans are she asked suspiciously i reminded her in reply that i held the position of english consul and that my object was if possible to be of some assistance to her you can be of the greatest assistance to me she said eagerly find mercy merrick i saw the vindictive look come back into her eyes and an angry flush rising on her white cheeks abstaining from showing any surprise i asked her who mercy merrick was a vile woman by her own confession was the quick reply how am i to find her i inquired next look for a woman in a black dress with the red geneva cross on her shoulder she is a nurse in the french ambulance what has she done i have lost my papers i have lost my own clothes mercy merrick has taken them how do you know that mercy merrick has taken them nobody else could have taken themthats how i know it do you believe me or not she as beginning to excite herself again i assured her that i would at once send to make inquiries after mercy merrick she turned round contented on the pillow theres a good man she said come back and tell me when you have caught her such was my first interview with the english patient at the hospital at mannheim it is needless to say that i doubted the existence of the absent person described as a nurse however it was possible to make inquiries by applying to the surgeon ignatius wetzel whose whereabouts was known to his friends in mannheim i wrote to him and received his answer in due time after the night attack of the germans had made them masters of the french position he had entered the cottage occupied by the french ambulance he had found the wounded frenchmen left behind but had seen no such person in attendance on them as the nurse in the black dress with the red cross on her shoulder the only living woman in the place was a young english lady in a gray traveling cloak who had been stopped on the frontier and who was forwarded on her way home by the war correspondent of an english journal  that was grace said lady janet  and i was the war correspondent added horace  a few words more said julian and you will understand my object in claiming your attention  he returned to the letter for the last time and concluded his extracts from it as follows  instead of attending at the hospital myself i communicated by letter the failure of my attempt to discover the missing nurse for some little time afterward i heard no more of the sick woman whom i shall still call mercy merrick it was only yesterday that i received another summons to visit the patient she had by this time sufficiently recovered to claim her discharge and she had announced her intention of returning forthwith to england the head physician feeling a sense of responsibility had sent for me it was impossible to detain her on the ground that she was not fit to be trusted by herself at large in consequence of the difference of opinion among the doctors on the case all that could be done was to give me due notice and to leave the matter in my hands on seeing her for the second time i found her sullen and reserved she openly attributed my inability to find the nurse to want of zeal for her interests on my part i had on my side no authority whatever to detain her i could only inquire whether she had money enough to pay her traveling expenses her reply informed me that the chaplain of the hospital had mentioned her forlorn situation in the town and that the english residents had subscribed a small sum of money to enable her to return to her own country satisfied on this head i asked next if she had friends to go to in england i have one friend she answered who is a host in herselflady janet roy you may imagine my surprise when i heard this i found it quite useless to make any further inquiries as to how she came to know your aunt whether your aunt expected her and so on my questions evidently offended her they were received in sulky silence under these circumstances well knowing that i can trust implicitly to your humane sympathy for misfortune i have decided after careful reflection to insure the poor creatures safety when she arrives in london by giving her a letter to you you will hear what she says and you will be better able to discover than i am whether she really has any claim on lady janet roy one last word of information which it may be necessary to add and i shall close this inordinately long letter at my first interview with her i abstained as i have already told you from irritating her by any inquiries on the subject of her name on this second occasion however i decided on putting the question  as he read those last words julian became aware of a sudden movement on the part of his aunt lady janet had risen softly from her chair and had passed behind him with the purpose of reading the consuls letter for herself over her nephews shoulder julian detected the action just in time to frustrate lady janets intention by placing his hand over the last two lines of the letter  what do you do that for inquired his aunt sharply  you are welcome lady janet to read the close of the letter for yourself julian replied but before you do so i am anxious to prepare you for a very great surprise compose yourself and let me read on slowly with your eye on me until i uncover the last two words which close my friends letter  he read the end of the letter as he had proposed in these terms  i looked the woman straight in the face and i said to her you have denied that the name marked on the clothes which you wore when you came here was your name if you are not mercy merrick who are you she answered instantly my name is   julian removed his hand from the page lady janet looked at the next two words and started back with a loud cry of astonishment which brought horace instantly to his feet  tell me one of you he cried what name did she give  julian told him  grace roseberry    chapter x a council of three  for a moment horace stood thunderstruck looking in blank astonishment at lady janet his first words as soon as he had recovered himself were addressed to julian is this a joke he asked sternly if it is i for one dont see the humor of it  julian pointed to the closely written pages of the consuls letter a man writes in earnest he said when he writes at such length as this the woman seriously gave the name of grace roseberry and when she left mannheim she traveled to england for the express purpose of presenting herself to lady janet roy he turned to his aunt you saw me start he went on when you first mentioned miss roseberrys name in my hearing now you know why he addressed himself once more to horace you heard me say that you as miss roseberrys future husband had an interest in being present at my interview with lady janet now you know why  the woman is plainly mad said lady janet but it is certainly a startling form of madness when one first hears of it of course we must keep the matter for the present at least a secret from grace  there can be no doubt horace agreed that grace must be kept in the dark in her present state of health the servants had better be warned beforehand in case of this adventuress or madwoman whichever she may be attempting to make her way into the house  it shall be done immediately said lady janet what surprises me julian ring the bell if you please is that you should describe yourself in your letter as feeling an interest in this person  julian answeredwithout ringing the bell  i am more interested than ever he said now i find that miss roseberry herself is your guest at mablethorpe house  you were always perverse julian as a child in your likings and dislikings lady janet rejoined why dont you ring the bell  for one good reason my dear aunt i dont wish to hear you tell your servants to close the door on this friendless creature  lady janet cast a look at her nephew which plainly expressed that she thought he had taken a liberty with her  you dont expect me to see the woman she asked in a tone of cold surprise  i hope you will not refuse to see her julian answered quietly i was out when she called i must hear what she has to sayand i should infinitely prefer hearing it in your presence when i got your reply to my letter permitting me to present her to you i wrote to her immediately appointing a meeting here  lady janet lifted her bright black eyes in mute expostulation to the carved cupids and wreaths on the diningroom ceiling  when am i to have the honor of the ladys visit she inquired with ironical resignation  today answered her nephew with impenetrable patience  at what hour  julian composedly consulted his watch she is ten minutes after her time he said and put his watch back in his pocket again  at the same moment the servant appeared and advanced to julian carrying a visiting card on his little silver tray  a lady to see you sir  julian took the card and bowing handed it to his aunt  here she is he said just as quietly as ever  lady janet looked at the card and tossed it indignantly back to her nephew miss roseberry she exclaimed printedactually printed on her card julian even my patience has its limits i refuse to see her  the servant was still waitingnot like a human being who took an interest in the proceedings but as became a perfectly bred footman like an article of furniture artfully constructed to come and go at the word of command julian gave the word of command addressing the admirably constructed automaton by the name of james  where is the lady now he asked  in the breakfastroom sir  leave her there if you please and wait outside within hearing of the bell  the legs of the furniturefootman acted and took him noiselessly out of the room julian turned to his aunt  forgive me he said for venturing to give the man his orders in your presence i am very anxious that you should not decide hastily surely we ought to hear what this lady has to say  horace dissented widely from his friends opinion its an insult to grace he broke out warmly to hear what she has to say  lady janet nodded her head in high approval i think so too said her ladyship crossing her handsome old hands resolutely on her lap  julian applied himself to answering horace first  pardon me he said i have no intention of presuming to reflect on miss roseberry or of bringing her into the matter at allthe consuls letter he went on speaking to his aunt mentions if you remember that the medical authorities of mannheim were divided in opinion on their patients case some of themthe physicianinchief being among the numberbelieve that the recovery of her mind has not accompanied the recovery of her body  in other words lady janet remarked a madwoman is in my house and i am expected to receive her  dont let us exaggerate said julian gently it can serve no good interest in this serious matter to exaggerate anything the consul assures us on the authority of the doctor that she is perfectly gentle and harmless if she is really the victim of a mental delusion the poor creature is surely an object of compassion and she ought to be placed under proper care ask your own kind heart my dear aunt if it would not be downright cruelty to turn this forlorn woman adrift in the world without making some inquiry first  lady janets inbred sense of justice admitted not over willinglythe reasonableness as well as the humanity of the view expressed in those words there is some truth in that julian she said shifting her position uneasily in her chair and looking at horace dont you think so too she added  i cant say i do answered horace in the positive tone of a man whose obstinacy is proof against every form of appeal that can be addressed to him  the patience of julian was firm enough to be a match for the obstinacy of horace at any rate he resumed with undiminished good temper we are all three equally interested in setting this matter at rest i put it to you lady janet if we are not favored at this lucky moment with the very opportunity that we want miss roseberry is not only out of the room but out of the house if we let this chance slip who can say what awkward accident may not happen in the course of the next few days  let the woman come in cried lady janet deciding headlong with her customary impatience of all delay at once julianbefore grace can come back will you ring the bell this time  this time julian rang it may i give the man his orders he respectfully inquired of his aunt  give him anything you like and have done with it retorted the irritable old lady getting briskly on her feet and taking a turn in the room to compose herself  the servant withdrew with orders to show the visitor in  horace crossed the room at the same timeapparently with the intention of leaving it by the door at the opposite end  you are not going away exclaimed lady janet  i see no use in my remaining here replied horace not very graciously  in that case retorted lady janet remain here because i wish it  certainlyif you wish it only remember he added more obstinately than ever that i differ entirely from julians view in my opinion the woman has no claim on us  a passing movement of irritation escaped julian for the first time dont be hard horace he said sharply all women have a claim on us  they had unconsciously gathered together in the heat of the little debate turning their backs on the library door at the last words of the reproof administered by julian to horace their attention was recalled to passing events by the slight noise produced by the opening and closing of the door with one accord the three turned and looked in the direction from which the sounds had come    chapter xi the dead alive  just inside the door there appeared the figure of a small woman dressed in plain and poor black garments she silently lifted her black net veil and disclosed a dull pale worn weary face the forehead was low and broad the eyes were unusually far apart the lower features were remarkably small and delicate in health as the consul at mannheim had remarked this woman must have possessed if not absolute beauty at least rare attractions peculiarly her own as it was now sufferingsullen silent selfcontained sufferinghad marred its beauty attention and even curiosity it might still rouse admiration or interest it could excite no longer  the small thin black figure stood immovably inside the door the dull worn white face looked silently at the three persons in the room  the three persons in the room on their side stood for a moment without moving and looked silently at the stranger on the threshold there was something either in the woman herself or in the sudden and stealthy manner of her appearance in the room which froze as if with the touch of an invisible cold hand the sympathies of all three accustomed to the world habitually at their ease in every social emergency they were now silenced for the first time in their lives by the first serious sense of embarrassment which they had felt since they were children in the presence of a stranger  had the appearance of the true grace roseberry aroused in their minds a suspicion of the woman who had stolen her name and taken her place in the house  not so much as the shadow of a suspicion of mercy was at the bottom of the strange sense of uneasiness which had now deprived them alike of their habitual courtesy and their habitual presence of mind it was as practically impossible for any one of the three to doubt the identity of the adopted daughter of the house as it would be for you who read these lines to doubt the identity of the nearest and dearest relative you have in the world circumstances had fortified mercy behind the strongest of all natural rightsthe right of first possession circumstances had armed her with the most irresistible of all natural forcesthe force of previous association and previous habit not by so much as a hairbreadth was the position of the false grace roseberry shaken by the first appearance of the true grace roseberry within the doors of mablethorpe house lady janet felt suddenly repelled without knowing why julian and horace felt suddenly repelled without knowing why asked to describe their own sensations at the moment they would have shaken their heads in despair and would have answered in those words the vague presentiment of some misfortune to come had entered the room with the entrance of the woman in black but it moved invisibly and it spoke as all presentiments speak in the unknown tongue  a moment passed the crackling of the fire and the ticking of the clock were the only sounds audible in the room  the voice of the visitorhard clear and quietwas the first voice that broke the silence  mr julian gray she said looking interrogatively from one of the two gentlemen to the other  julian advanced a few steps instantly recovering his selfpossession i am sorry i was not at home he said when you called with your letter from the consul pray take a chair  by way of setting the example lady janet seated herself at some little distance with horace in attendance standing near she bowed to the stranger with studious politeness but without uttering a word before she settled herself in her chair i am obliged to listen to this person thought the old lady but i am not obliged to speak to her that is julians businessnot mine dont stand horace you fidget me sit down armed beforehand in her policy of silence lady janet folded her handsome hands as usual and waited for the proceedings to begin like a judge on the bench  will you take a chair julian repeated observing that the visitor appeared neither to heed nor to hear his first words of welcome to her  at this second appeal she spoke to him is that lady janet roy she asked with her eyes fixed on the mistress of the house  julian answered and drew back to watch the result  the woman in the poor black garments changed her position for the first time she moved slowly across the room to the place at which lady janet was sitting and addressed her respectfully with perfect selfpossession of manner her whole demeanor from the moment when she had appeared at the door had expressedat once plainly and becominglyconfidence in the reception that awaited her  almost the last words my father said to me on his deathbed she began were words madam which told me to expect protection and kindness from you  it was not lady janets business to speak she listened with the blandest attention she waited with the most exasperating silence to hear more  grace roseberry drew back a stepnot intimidatedonly mortified and surprised was my father wrong she asked with a simple dignity of tone and manner which forced lady janet to abandon her policy of silence in spite of herself  who was your father she asked coldly  grace roseberry answered the question in a tone of stern surprise  has the servant not given you my card she said dont you know my name  which of your names rejoined lady janet  i dont understand your ladyship  i will make myself understood you asked me if i knew your name i ask you in return which name it is the name on your card is miss roseberry the name marked on your clothes when you were in the hospital was mercy merrick  the selfpossession which grace had maintained from the moment when she had entered the diningroom seemed now for the first time to be on the point of failing her she turned and looked appealingly at julian who had thus far kept his place apart listening attentively  surely she said your friend the consul has told you in his letter about the mark on the clothes  something of the girlish hesitation and timidity which had marked her demeanor at her interview with mercy in the french cottage reappeared in her tone and manner as she spoke those words the changesmostly changes for the worsewrought in her by the suffering through which she had passed since that time were now for the moment effaced all that was left of the better and simpler side of her character asserted itself in her brief appeal to julian she had hitherto repelled him he began to feel a certain compassionate interest in her now  the consul has informed me of what you said to him he answered kindly but if you will take my advice i recommend you to tell your story to lady janet in your own words  grace again addressed herself with submissive reluctance to lady janet  the clothes your ladyship speaks of she said were the clothes of another woman the rain was pouring when the soldiers detained me on the frontier i had been exposed for hours to the weatheri was wet to the skin the clothes marked mercy merrick were the clothes lent to me by mercy merrick herself while my own things were drying i was struck by the shell in those clothes i was carried away insensible in those clothes after the operation had been performed on me  lady janet listened to perfectionand did no more she turned confidentially to horace and said to him in her gracefully ironical way she is ready with her explanation  horace answered in the same tone a great deal too ready  grace looked from one of them to the other a faint flush of color showed itself in her face for the first time  am i to understand she asked with proud composure that you dont believe me  lady janet maintained her policy of silence she waved one hand courteously toward julian as if to say address your inquiries to the gentleman who introduces you julian noticing the gesture and observing the rising color in graces cheeks interfered directly in the interests of peace  lady janet asked you a question just now he said lady janet inquired who your father was  my father was the late colonel roseberry  lady janet made another confidential remark to horace her assurance amazes me she exclaimed  julian interposed before his aunt could add a word more pray let us hear her he said in a tone of entreaty which had something of the imperative in it this time he turned to grace have you any proof to produce he added in his gentler voice which will satisfy us that you are colonel roseberrys daughter  grace looked at him indignantly proof she repeated is my word not enough  julian kept his temper perfectly pardon me he rejoined you forget that you and lady janet meet now for the first time try to put yourself in my aunts place how is she to know that you are the late colonel roseberrys daughter  graces head sunk on her breast she dropped into the nearest chair the expression of her face changed instantly from anger to discouragement ah she exclaimed bitterly if i only had the letters that have been stolen from me  letters asked julian introducing you to lady janet  yes she turned suddenly to lady janet let me tell you how i lost them she said in the first tones of entreaty which had escaped her yet  lady janet hesitated it was not in her generous nature to resist the appeal that had just been made to her the sympathies of horace were far less easily reached he lightly launched a new shaft of satireintended for the private amusement of lady janet another explanation he exclaimed with a look of comic resignation  julian overheard the words his large lustrous eyes fixed themselves on horace with a look of unmeasured contempt  the least you can do he said sternly is not to irritate her it is so easy to irritate her he addressed himself again to grace endeavoring to help her through her difficulty in a new way never mind explaining yourself for the moment he said in the absence of your letters have you any one in london who can speak to your identity  grace shook her head sadly i have no friends in london she answered  it was impossible for lady janetwho had never in her life heard of anybody without friends in londonto pass this over without notice no friends in london she repeated turning to horace  horace shot another shaft of light satire of course not he rejoined  grace saw them comparing notes my friends are in canada she broke out impetuously plenty of friends who could speak for me if i could only bring them here  as a place of referencementioned in the capital city of englandcanada there is no denying it is open to objection on the ground of distance horace was ready with another shot far enough off certainly he said  far enough off as you say lady janet agreed  once more julians inexhaustible kindness strove to obtain a hearing for the stranger who had been confided to his care a little patience lady janet he pleaded a little consideration horace for a friendless woman  thank you sir said grace it is very kind of you to try and help me but it is useless they wont even listen to me she attempted to rise from her chair as she pronounced the last words julian gently laid his hand on her shoulder and obliged her to resume her seat  i will listen to you he said you referred me just now to the consuls letter the consul tells me you suspected some one of taking your papers and your clothes  i dont suspect was the quick reply i am certain i tell you positively mercy merrick was the thief she was alone with me when i was struck down by the shell she was the only person who knew that i had letters of introduction about me she confessed to my face that she had been a bad womanshe had been in a prisonshe had come out of a refuge  julian stopped her there with one plain question which threw a doubt on the whole story  the consul tells me you asked him to search for mercy merrick he said is it not true that he caused inquiries to be made and that no trace of any such person was to be heard of  the consul took no pains to find her grace answered angrily he was like everybody else in a conspiracy to neglect and misjudge me  lady janet and horace exchanged looks this time it was impossible for julian to blame them the further the strangers narrative advanced the less worthy of serious attention he felt it to be the longer she spoke the more disadvantageously she challenged comparison with the absent woman whose name she so obstinately and so audaciously persisted in assuming as her own  granting all that you have said julian resumed with a last effort of patience what use could mercy merrick make of your letters and your clothes  what use repeated grace amazed at his not seeing the position as she saw it my clothes were marked with my name one of my papers was a letter from my father introducing me to lady janet a woman out of a refuge would be quite capable of presenting herself here in my place  spoken entirely at random spoken without so much as a fragment of evidence to support them those last words still had their effect they cast a reflection on lady janets adopted daughter which was too outrageous to be borne lady janet rose instantly give me your arm horace she said turning to leave the room i have heard enough  horace respectfully offered his arm your ladyship is quite right he answered a more monstrous story never was invented  he spoke in the warmth of his indignation loud enough for grace to hear him what is there monstrous in it she asked advancing a step toward him defiantly  julian checked her he toothough he had only once seen mercyfelt an angry sense of the insult offered to the beautiful creature who had interested him at his first sight of her silence he said speaking sternly to grace for the first time you are offendingjustly offendinglady janet you are talking worse than absurdlyyou are talking offensivelywhen you speak of another woman presenting herself here in your place  graces blood was up stung by julians reproof she turned on him a look which was almost a look of fury  are you a clergyman are you an educated man she asked have you never read of cases of false personation in newspapers and books i blindly confided in mercy merrick before i found out what her character really was she left the cottagei know it from the surgeon who brought me to life againfirmly persuaded that the shell had killed me my papers and my clothes disappeared at the same time is there nothing suspicious in these circumstances there were people at the hospital who thought them highly suspiciouspeople who warned me that i might find an impostor in my place she suddenly paused the rustling sound of a silk dress had caught her ear lady janet was leaving the room with horace by way of the conservatory with a last desperate effort of resolution grace sprung forward and placed herself in front of them  one word lady janet before you turn your back on me she said firmly one word and i will be content has colonel roseberrys letter found its way to this house or not if it has did a woman bring it to you  lady janet lookedas only a great lady can look when a person of inferior rank has presumed to fail in respect toward her  you are surely not aware she said with icy composure that these questions are an insult to me  and worse than an insult horace added warmly to grace  the little resolute black figure still barring the way to the conservatory was suddenly shaken from head to foot the womans eyes traveled backward and forward between lady janet and horace with the light of a new suspicion in them  grace she exclaimed what grace thats my name lady janet you have got the letter the woman is here  lady janet dropped horaces arm and retraced her steps to the place at which her nephew was standing  julian she said you force me for the first time in my life to remind you of the respect that is due to me in my own house send that woman away  without waiting to be answered she turned back again and once more took horaces arm  stand back if you please she said quietly to grace  grace held her ground  the woman is here she repeated confront me with herand then send me away if you like  julian advanced and firmly took her by the arm you forget what is due to lady janet he said drawing her aside you forget what is due to yourself  with a desperate effort grace broke away from him and stopped lady janet on the threshold of the conservatory door  justice she cried shaking her clinched hand with hysterical frenzy in the air i claim my right to meet that woman face to face where is she confront me with her confront me with her  while those wild words were pouring from her lips the rumbling of carriage wheels became audible on the drive in front of the house in the allabsorbing agitation of the moment the sound of the wheels followed by the opening of the house door passed unnoticed by the persons in the diningroom horaces voice was still raised in angry protest against the insult offered to lady janet lady janet herself leaving him for the second time was vehemently ringing the bell to summon the servants julian had once more taken the infuriated woman by the arms and was trying vainly to compose herwhen the library door was opened quietly by a young lady wearing a mantle and a bonnet mercy merrick true to the appointment which she had made with horace entered the room  the first eyes that discovered her presence on the scene were the eyes of grace roseberry starting violently in julians grasp she pointed toward the library door ah she cried with a shriek of vindictive delight there she is  mercy turned as the sound of the scream rang through the room and metresting on her in savage triumphthe living gaze of the woman whose identity she had stolen whose body she had left laid out for dead on the instant of that terrible discoverywith her eyes fixed helplessly on the fierce eyes that had found hershe dropped senseless on the floor    chapter xii exit julian  julian happened to be standing nearest to mercy he was the first at her side when she fell  in the cry of alarm which burst from him as he raised her for a moment in his arms in the expression of his eyes when he looked at her deathlike face there escaped the plaintoo plainconfession of the interest which he felt in her of the admiration which she had aroused in him horace detected it there was the quick suspicion of jealousy in the movement by which he joined julian there was the ready resentment of jealousy in the tone in which he pronounced the words leave her to me julian resigned her in silence a faint flush appeared on his pale face as he drew back while horace carried her to the sofa his eyes sunk to the ground he seemed to be meditating selfreproachfully on the tone in which his friend had spoken to him after having been the first to take an active part in meeting the calamity that had happened he was now to all appearance insensible to everything that was passing in the room  a touch on his shoulder roused him  he turned and looked round the woman who had done the mischiefthe stranger in the poor black garmentswas standing behind him she pointed to the prostrate figure on the sofa with a merciless smile  you wanted a proof just now she said there it is  horace heard her he suddenly left the sofa and joined julian his face naturally ruddy was pale with suppressed fury  take that wretch away he said instantly or i wont answer for what i may do  those words recalled julian to himself he looked round the room lady janet and the housekeeper were together in attendance on the swooning woman the startled servants were congregated in the library doorway one of them offered to run to the nearest doctor another asked if he should fetch the police julian silenced them by a gesture and turned to horace compose yourself he said leave me to remove her quietly from the house he took grace by the hand as he spoke she hesitated and tried to release herself julian pointed to the group at the sofa and to the servants looking on you have made an enemy of every one in this room he said and you have not a friend in london do you wish to make an enemy of me her head drooped she made no reply she waited dumbly obedient to the firmer will than her own julian ordered the servants crowding together in the doorway to withdraw he followed them into the library leading grace after him by the hand before closing the door he paused and looked back into the diningroom  is she recovering he asked after a moments hesitation  lady janets voice answered him not yet  shall i send for the nearest doctor  horace interposed he declined to let julian associate himself even in that indirect manner with mercys recovery  if the doctor is wanted he said i will go for him myself  julian closed the library door he absently released grace he mechanically pointed to a chair she sat down in silent surprise following him with her eyes as he walked slowly to and fro in the room  for the moment his mind was far away from her and from all that had happened since her appearance in the house it was impossible that a man of his fineness of perception could mistake the meaning of horaces conduct toward him he was questioning his own heart on the subject of mercy sternly and unreservedly as it was his habit to do after only once seeing her he thought has she produced such an impression on me that horace can discover it before i have even suspected it myself can the time have come already when i owe it to my friend to see her no more he stopped irritably in his walk as a man devoted to a serious calling in life there was something that wounded his selfrespect in the bare suspicion that he could be guilty of the purely sentimental extravagance called love at first sight  he had paused exactly opposite to the chair in which grace was seated weary of the silence she seized the opportunity of speaking to him  i have come here with you as you wished she said are you going to help me am i to count on you as my friend  he looked at her vacantly it cost him an effort before he could give her the attention that she had claimed  you have been hard on me grace went on but you showed me some kindness at first you tried to make them give me a fair hearing i ask you as a just man do you doubt now that the woman on the sofa in the next room is an impostor who has taken my place can there be any plainer confession that she is mercy merrick than the confession she has made you saw it they saw it she fainted at the sight of me  julian crossed the roomstill without answering herand rang the bell when the servant appeared he told the man to fetch a cab  grace rose from her chair what is the cab for she asked sharply  for you and for me julian replied i am going to take you back to your lodgings  i refuse to go my place is in this house neither lady janet nor you can get over the plain facts all i asked was to be confronted with her and what did she do when she came into the room she fainted at the sight of me  reiterating her one triumphant assertion she fixed her eyes on julian with a look which said plainly answer that if you can in mercy to her julian answered it on the spot  as far as i understand he said you appear to take it for granted that no innocent woman would have fainted on first seeing you i have something to tell you which will alter your opinion on her arrival in england this lady informed my aunt that she had met with you accidentally on the french frontier and that she had seen you so far as she knew struck dead at her side by a shell remember that and recall what happened just now without a word to warn her of your restoration to life she finds herself suddenly face to face with you a living womanand this at a time when it is easy for any one who looks at her to see that she is in delicate health what is there wonderful what is there unaccountable in her fainting under such circumstances as these  the question was plainly put where was the answer to it  there was no answer to it mercys wisely candid statement of the manner in which she had first met with grace and of the accident which had followed had served mercys purpose but too well it was simply impossible for persons acquainted with that statement to attach a guilty meaning to the swoon the false grace roseberry was still as far beyond the reach of suspicion as ever and the true grace was quick enough to see it she sank into the chair from which she had risen her hands fell in hopeless despair on her lap  everything is against me she said the truth itself turns liar and takes her side she paused and rallied her sinking courage no she cried resolutely i wont submit to have my name and my place taken from me by a vile adventuress say what you like i insist on exposing her i wont leave the house  the servant entered the room and announced that the cab was at the door  grace turned to julian with a defiant wave of her hand dont let me detain you she said i see i have neither advice nor help to expect from mr julian gray  julian beckoned to the servant to follow him into a corner of the room  do you know if the doctor has been sent for he asked  i believe not sir it is said in the servants hall that the doctor is not wanted  julian was too anxious to be satisfied with a report from the servants hall he hastily wrote on a slip of paper has she recovered and gave the note to the man with directions to take it to lady janet  did you hear what i said grace inquired while the messenger was absent in the dining room  i will answer you directly said julian  the servant appeared again as he spoke with some lines in pencil written by lady janet on the back of julians note thank god we have revived her in a few minutes we hope to be able to take her to her room  the nearest way to mercys room was through the library graces immediate removal had now become a necessity which was not to be trifled with julian addressed himself to meeting the difficulty the instant he was left alone with grace  listen to me he said the cab is waiting and i have my last words to say to you you are now thanks to the consuls recommendation in my care decide at once whether you will remain under my charge or whether you will transfer yourself to the charge of the police  grace started what do you mean she asked angrily  if you wish to remain under my charge julian proceeded you will accompany me at once to the cab in that case i will undertake to give you an opportunity of telling your story to my own lawyer he will be a fitter person to advise you than i am nothing will induce we to believe that the lady whom you have accused has committed or is capable of committing such a fraud as you charge her with you will hear what the lawyer thinks if you come with me if you refuse i shall have no choice but to send into the next room and tell them that you are still here the result will be that you will find yourself in charge of the police take which course you like i will give you a minute to decide in and remember thisif i appear to express myself harshly it is your conduct which forces me to speak out i mean kindly toward you i am advising you honestly for your good  he took out his watch to count the minute  grace stole one furtive glance at his steady resolute face she was perfectly unmoved by the manly consideration for her which julians last words had expressed all she understood was that he was not a man to be trifled with future opportunities would offer themselves of returning secretly to the house she determined to yieldand deceive him  i am ready to go she said rising with dogged submission your turn now she muttered to herself as she turned to the lookingglass to arrange her shawl my turn will come  julian advanced toward her as if to offer her his arm and checked himself firmly persuaded as he was that her mind was derangedreadily as he admitted that she claimed in virtue of her affliction every indulgence that he could extend to herthere was something repellent to him at that moment in the bare idea of touching her the image of the beautiful creature who was the object of her monstrous accusationthe image of mercy as she lay helpless for a moment in his armswas vivid in his mind while he opened the door that led into the hall and drew back to let grace pass out before him he left the servant to help her into the cab the man respectfully addressed him as he took his seat opposite to grace  i am ordered to say that your room is ready sir and that her ladyship expects you to dinner  absorbed in the events which had followed his aunts invitation julian had forgotten his engagement to stay at mablethorpe house could he return knowing his own heart as he now knew it could he honorably remain perhaps for weeks together in mercys society conscious as he now was of the impression which she had produced on him no the one honorable course that he could take was to find an excuse for withdrawing from his engagement beg her ladyship not to wait dinner for me he said i will write and make my apologies the cab drove off the wondering servant waited on the doorstep looking after it i wouldnt stand in mr julians shoes for something he thought with his mind running on the difficulties of the young clergymans position there she is along with him in the cab what is he going to do with her after that  julian himself if it had been put to him at the moment could not have answered the question                  lady janets anxiety was far from being relieved when mercy had been restored to her senses and conducted to her own room  mercys mind remained in a condition of unreasoning alarm which it was impossible to remove over and over again she was told that the woman who had terrified her had left the house and would never be permitted to enter it more over and over again she was assured that the strangers frantic assertions were regarded by everybody about her as unworthy of a moments serious attention she persisted in doubting whether they were telling her the truth a shocking distrust of her friends seemed to possess her she shrunk when lady janet approached the bedside she shuddered when lady janet kissed her she flatly refused to let horace see her she asked the strangest questions about julian gray and shook her head suspiciously when they told her that he was absent from the house at intervals she hid her face in the bedclothes and murmured to herself piteously oh what shall i do what shall i do at other times her one petition was to be left alone i want nobody in my roomthat was her sullen crynobody in my room  the evening advanced and brought with it no change for the better lady janet by the advice of horace sent for her own medical adviser  the doctor shook his head the symptoms he said indicated a serious shock to the nervous system he wrote a sedative prescription and he gave with a happy choice of language some sound and safe advice it amounted briefly to this take her away and try the seaside lady janets customary energy acted on the advice without a moments needless delay she gave the necessary directions for packing the trunks overnight and decided on leaving mablethorpe house with mercy the next morning  shortly after the doctor had taken his departure a letter from julian addressed to lady janet was delivered by private messenger  beginning with the necessary apologies for the writers absence the letter proceeded in these terms   before i permitted my companion to see the lawyer i felt the necessity of consulting him as to my present position toward her first  i told himwhat i think it only right to repeat to youthat i do not feel justified in acting on my own opinion that her mind is deranged in the case of this friendless woman i want medical authority and more even than that i want some positive proof to satisfy my conscience as well as to confirm my view  finding me obstinate on this point the lawyer undertook to consult a physician accustomed to the treatment of the insane on my behalf  after sending a message and receiving the answer he said bring the lady herein half an hour she shall tell her story to the doctor instead of telling it to me the proposal rather staggered me i asked how it was possible to induce her to do that he laughed and answered i shall present the doctor as my senior partner my senior partner will be the very man to advise her you know that i hate all deception even where the end in view appears to justify it on this occasion however there was no other alternative than to let the lawyer take his own course or to run the risk of a delay which might be followed by serious results  i waited in a room by myself feeling very uneasy i own until the doctor joined me after the interview was over  his opinion is briefly this  after careful examination of the unfortunate creature he thinks that there are unmistakably symptoms of mental aberration but how far the mischief has gone and whether her case is or is not sufficiently grave to render actual restraint necessary he cannot positively say in our present state of ignorance as to facts  thus far he observed we know nothing of that part of her delusion which relates to mercy merrick the solution of the difficulty in this case is to be found there i entirely agree with the lady that the inquiries of the consul at mannheim are far from being conclusive furnish me with satisfactory evidence either that there is or is not such a person really in existence as mercy merrick and i will give you a positive opinion on the case whenever you choose to ask for it  those words have decided me on starting for the continent and renewing the search for mercy merrick  my friend the lawyer wonders jocosely whether i am in my right senses his advice is that i should apply to the nearest magistrate and relieve you and myself of all further trouble in that way  perhaps you agree with him my dear aunt as you have often said i do nothing like other people i am interested in this case i cannot abandon a forlorn woman who has been confided to me to the tender mercies of strangers so long as there is any hope of my making discoveries which may be instrumental in restoring her to herselfperhaps also in restoring her to her friends  i start by the mailtrain of tonight my plan is to go first to mannheim and consult with the consul and the hospital doctors then to find my way to the german surgeon and to question him and that done to make the last and hardest effort of allthe effort to trace the french ambulance and to penetrate the mystery of mercy merrick  immediately on my return i will wait on you and tell you what i have accomplished or how i have failed  in the meanwhile pray be under no alarm about the reappearance of this unhappy woman at your house she is fully occupied in writing at my suggestion to her friends in canada and she is under the care of the landlady at her lodgingsan experienced and trustworthy person who has satisfied the doctor as well as myself of her fitness for the charge that she has undertaken  pray mention this to miss roseberry whenever you think it desirable with the respectful expression of my sympathy and of my best wishes for her speedy restoration to health and once more forgive me for failing under stress of necessity to enjoy the hospitality of mablethorpe house    lady janet closed julians letter feeling far from satisfied with it she sat for a while pondering over what her nephew had written to her  one of two things thought the quickwitted old lady either the lawyer is right and julian is a fit companion for the madwoman whom he has taken under his charge or he has some second motive for this absurd journey of his which he has carefully abstained from mentioning in his letter what can the motive be  at intervals during the night that question recurred to her ladyship again and again the utmost exercise of her ingenuity failing to answer it her one resource left was to wait patiently for julians return and in her own favorite phrase to have it out of him then  the next morning lady janet and her adopted daughter left mablethorpe house for brighton horace who had begged to be allowed to accompany them being sentenced to remain in london by mercys express desire whynobody could guess and mercy refused to say    chapter xiii enter julian  a week has passed the scene opens again in the diningroom at mablethorpe house  the hospitable table bears once more its burden of good things for lunch but on this occasion lady janet sits alone her attention is divided between reading her newspaper and feeding her cat the cat is a sleek and splendid creature he carries an erect tail he rolls luxuriously on the soft carpet he approaches his mistress in a series of coquettish curves he smells with dainty hesitation at the choicest morsels that can be offered to him the musical monotony of his purring falls soothingly on her ladyships ear she stops in the middle of a leading article and looks with a careworn face at the happy cat upon my honor cries lady janet thinking in her inveterately ironical manner of the cares that trouble her all things considered tom i wish i was you  the cat startsnot at his mistresss complimentary apostrophe but at a knock at the door which follows close upon it lady janet says carelessly enough come in looks round listlessly to see who it is and starts like the cat when the door opens and disclosesjulian gray  youor your ghost she exclaims  she has noticed already that julian is paler than usual and that there is something in his manner at once uneasy and subduedhighly uncharacteristic of him at other times he takes a seat by her side and kisses her hand butfor the first time in his aunts experience of himhe refuses the good things on the luncheon table and he has nothing to say to the cat that neglected animal takes refuge on lady janets lap lady janet with her eyes fixed expectantly on her nephew determining to have it out of him at the first opportunity waits to hear what he has to say for himself julian has no alternative but to break the silence and tell his story as he best may    i got back from the continent last night he began and i come here as i promised to report myself on my return how does your ladyship do how is miss roseberry  lady janet laid an indicative finger on the lace pelerine which ornamented the upper part of her dress here is the old lady well she answeredand pointed next to the room above them and there she added is the young lady ill is anything the matter with you julian  perhaps i am a little tired after my journey never mind me is miss roseberry still suffering from the shock  what else should she be suffering from i will never forgive you julian for bringing that crazy impostor into my house  my dear aunt when i was the innocent means of bringing her here i had no idea that such a person as miss roseberry was in existence nobody laments what has happened more sincerely than i do have you had medical advice  i took her to the seaside a week since by medical advice  has the change of air don e her no good  none whatever if anything the change of air has made her worse sometimes she sits for hours together as pale as death without looking at anything and without uttering a word sometimes she brightens up and seems as if she was eager to say something and then heaven only knows why checks herself suddenly as if she was afraid to speak i could support that but what cuts me to the heart julian is that she does not appear to trust me and to love me as she did she seems to be doubtful of me she seems to be frightened of me if i did not know that it was simply impossible that such a thing could be i should really think she suspected me of believing what that wretch said of her in one word and between ourselves i begin to fear she will never get over the fright which caused that faintingfit there is serious mischief somewhere and try as i may to discover it it is mischief beyond my finding  can the doctor do nothing  lady janets bright black eyes answered before she replied in words with a look of supreme contempt  the doctor she repeated disdainfully i brought grace back last night in sheer despair and i sent for the doctor this morning he is at the head of his profession he is said to be making ten thousand a year and he knows no more about it than i do i am quite serious the great physician has just gone away with two guineas in his pocket one guinea for advising me to keep her quiet another guinea for telling me to trust to time do you wonder how he gets on at this rate my dear boy they all get on in the same way the medical profession thrives on two incurable diseases in these modern daysa hedisease and a shedisease shediseasenervous depression hediseasesuppressed gout remedies one guinea if you go to the doctor two guineas if the doctor goes to you i might have bought a new bonnet cried her ladyship indignantly with the money i have given to that man let us change the subject i lose my temper when i think of it besides i want to know something why did you go abroad  at that plain question julian looked unaffectedly surprised i wrote to explain he said have you not received my letter  oh i got your letter it was long enough in all conscience and long as it was it didnt tell me the one thing i wanted to know  what is the one thing  lady janets reply pointednot too palpably at firstat that second motive for julians journey which she had suspected julian of concealing from her  i want to know she said why you troubled yourself to make your inquiries on the continent in person you know where my old courier is to be found you have yourself pronounced him to be the most intelligent and trustworthy of men answer me honestlycould you not have sent him in your place  i might have sent him julian admitted a little reluctantly  you might have sent the courierand you were under an engagement to stay here as my guest answer me honestly once more why did you go away  julian hesitated lady janet paused for his reply with the air of a women who was prepared to wait if necessary for the rest of the afternoon  i had a reason of my own for going julian said at last  yes rejoined lady janet prepared to wait if necessary till the next morning  a reason julian resumed which i would rather not mention  oh said lady janet another mysteryeh and another woman at the bottom of it no doubt thank youthat will doi am sufficiently answered no wonder as a clergyman that you look a little confused there is perhaps a certain grace under the circumstances in looking confused we will change the subject again you stay here of course now you have come back  once more the famous pulpit orator seemed to find himself in the inconceivable predicament of not knowing what to say once more lady janet looked resigned to wait if necessary until the middle of next week  julian took refuge in an answer worthy of the most commonplace man on the face of the civilized earth  i beg your ladyship to accept my thanks and my excuses he said  lady janets manyringed fingers mechanically stroking the cat in her lap began to stroke him the wrong way  lady janets inexhaustible patience showed signs of failing her at last  mighty civil i am sure she said make it complete say mr julian gray presents his compliments to lady janet roy and regrets that a previous engagementjulian exclaimed the old lady suddenly pushing the cat off her lap and flinging her last pretense of good temper to the windsjulian i am not to be trifled with there is but one explanation of your conductyou are evidently avoiding my house is there somebody you dislike in it is it me  julian intimated by a gesture that his aunts last question was absurd the muchinjured cat elevated his back waved his tail slowly walked to the fireplace and honored the rug by taking a seat on it  lady janet persisted is it grace roseberry she asked next  even julians patience began to show signs of yielding his manner assumed a sudden decision his voice rose a tone louder  you insist on knowing he said it is miss roseberry  you dont like her cried lady janet with a sudden burst of angry surprise  julian broke out on his side if i see any more of her he answered the rare color mounting passionately in his cheeks i shall be the unhappiest man living if i see any more of her i shall be false to my old friend who is to marry her keep us apart if you have any regard for my peace of mind keep us apart  unutterable amazement expressed itself in his aunts lifted hands ungovernable curiosity uttered itself in his aunts next words  you dont mean to tell me you are in love with grace  julian sprung restlessly to his feet and disturbed the cat at the fireplace the cat left the room  i dont know what to tell you he said i cant realize it to myself no other woman has ever roused the feeling in me which this woman seems to have called to life in an instant in the hope of forgetting her i broke my engagement here i purposely seized the opportunity of making those inquiries abroad quite useless i think of her morning noon and night i see her and hear her at this moment as plainly as i see and hear you she has made herself a part of myself i dont understand my life without her my power of will seems to be gone i said to myself this morning i will write to my aunt i wont go back to mablethorpe house here i am in mablethorpe house with a mean subterfuge to justify me to my own conscience i owe it to my aunt to call on my aunt that is what i said to myself on the way here and i was secretly hoping every step of the way that she would come into the room when i got here i am hoping it now and she is engaged to horace holmcroftto my oldest friend to my best friend am i an infernal rascal or am i a weak fool god knowsi dont keep my secret aunt i am heartily ashamed of myself i used to think i was made of better stuff than this dont say a word to horace i must and will conquer it let me go  he snatched up his hat lady janet rising with the activity of a young woman pursued him across the room and stopped him at the door  no answered the resolute old lady i wont let you go come back with me  as she said those words she noticed with a certain fond pride the brilliant color mounting in his cheeksthe flashing brightness which lent an added luster to his eyes he had never to her mind looked so handsome before she took his arm and led him to the chairs which they had just left it was shocking it was wrong she mentally admitted to look on mercy under the circumstances with any other eye than the eye of a brother or a friend in a clergyman perhaps doubly shocking doubly wrong but with all her respect for the vested interests of horace lady janet could not blame julian worse still she was privately conscious that he had somehow or other risen rather than fallen in her estimation within the last minute or two who could deny that her adopted daughter was a charming creature who could wonder if a man of refined tastes admired her upon the whole her ladyship humanely decided that her nephew was rather to be pitied than blamed what daughter of eve no matter whether she was seventeen or seventy could have honestly arrived at any other conclusion do what a man maylet him commit anything he likes from an error to a crimeso long as there is a woman at the bottom of it there is an inexhaustible fund of pardon for him in every other womans heart sit down said lady janet smiling in spite of herself and dont talk in that horrible way again a man julianespecially a famous man like youought to know how to control himself  julian burst out laughing bitterly  send upstairs for my selfcontrol he said its in her possessionnot in mine good morning aunt  he rose from his chair lady janet instantly pushed him back into it  i insist on your staying here she said if it is only for a few minutes longer i have something to say to you  does it refer to miss roseberry  it refers to the hateful woman who frightened miss roseberry now are you satisfied  julian bowed and settled himself in his chair  i dont much like to acknowledge it his aunt went on but i want you to understand that i have something really serious to speak about for once in a way julian that wretch not only frightens graceshe actually frightens me  frightens you she is quite harmless poor thing  poor thing repeated lady janet did you say poor thing  yes  is it possible that you pity her  from the bottom of my heart  the old ladys temper gave way again at that reply i hate a man who cant hate anybody she burst out if you had been an ancient roman julian i believe you would have pitied nero himself  julian cordially agreed with her i believe i should he said quietly all sinners my dear aunt are more or less miserable sinners nero must have been one of the wretchedest of mankind  wretched exclaimed lady janet nero wretched a man who committed robbery arson and murder to his own violin accompanimentonly wretched what next i wonder when modern philanthropy begins to apologize for nero modern philanthropy has arrived at a pretty pass indeed we shall hear next that bloody queen mary was as playful as a kitten and if poor dear henry the eighth carried anything to an extreme it was the practice of the domestic virtues ah how i hate cant what were we talking about just now you wander from the subject julian you are what i call birdwitted i protest i forget what i wanted to say to you no i wont be reminded of it i may be an old woman but i am not in my dotage yet why do you sit there staring have you nothing to say for yourself of all the people in the world have you lost the use of your tongue  julians excellent temper and accurate knowledge of his aunts character exactly fitted him to calm the rising storm he contrived to lead lady janet insensibly back to the lost subject by dexterous reference to a narrative which he had thus far left untoldthe narrative of his adventures on the continent  i have a great deal to say aunt he replied i have not yet told you of my discoveries abroad  lady janet instantly took the bait  i knew there was something forgotten she said you have been all this time in the house and you have told me nothing begin directly  patient julian began    chapter xiv coming events cast their shadows before  i went first to mannheim lady janet as i told you i should in my letter and i heard all that the consul and the hospital doctors could tell me no new fact of the slightest importance turned up i got my directions for finding the german surgeon and i set forth to try what i could make next of the man who performed the operation on the question of his patients identity he had as a perfect stranger to her nothing to tell me on the question of her mental condition however he made a very important statement he owned to me that he had operated on another person injured by a shellwound on the head at the battle of solferino and that the patient recovering also in this case recoveredmad that is a remarkable admission dont you think so  lady janets temper had hardly been allowed time enough to subside to its customary level  very remarkable i dare say she answered to people who feel any doubt of this pitiable lady of yours being mad i feel no doubtand thus far i find your account of yourself julian tiresome in the extreme go on to the end did you lay your hand on mercy merrick  no  did you hear anything of her  nothing difficulties beset me on every side the french ambulance had shared in the disasters of franceit was broken up the wounded frenchmen were prisoners somewhere in germany nobody knew where the french surgeon had been killed in action his assistants were scatteredmost likely in hiding i began to despair of making any discovery when accident threw in my way two prussian soldiers who had been in the french cottage they confirmed what the german surgeon told the consul and what horace himself told menamely that no nurse in a black dress was to be seen in the place if there had been such a person she would certainly the prussians inform me have been found in attendance on the injured frenchmen the cross of the geneva convention would have been amply sufficient to protect her no woman wearing that badge of honor would have disgraced herself by abandoning the wounded men before the germans entered the place  in short interposed lady janet there is no such person as mercy merrick  i can draw no other conclusion said julian unless the english doctors idea is the right one after hearing what i have just told you he thinks the woman herself is mercy merrick  lady janet held up her hand as a sign that she had an objection to make here  you and the doctor seem to have settled everything to your entire satisfaction on both sides she said but there is one difficulty that you have neither of you accounted for yet  what is it aunt  you talk glibly enough julian about this womans mad assertion that grace is the missing nurse and that she is grace but you have not explained yet how the idea first got into her head and more than that how it is that she is acquainted with my name and address and perfectly familiar with graces papers and graces affairs these things are a puzzle to a person of my average intelligence can your clever friend the doctor account for them  shall i tell you what he said when i saw him this morning  will it take long  it will take about a minute  you agreeably surprise me go on  you want to know how she gained her knowledge of your name and of miss roseberrys affairs julian resumed the doctor says in one of two ways either miss roseberry must have spoken of you and of her own affairs while she and the stranger were together in the french cottage or the stranger must have obtained access privately to miss roseberrys papers do you agree so far  lady janet began to feel interested for the first time  perfectly she said i have no doubt grace rashly talked of matters which an older and wiser person would have kept to herself  very good do you also agree that the last idea in the womans mind when she was struck by the shell might have been quite probably the idea of miss roseberrys identity and miss roseberrys affairs you think it likely enough well what happens after that the wounded woman is brought to life by an operation and she becomes delirious in the hospital at mannheim during her delirium the idea of miss roseberrys identity ferments in her brain and assumes its present perverted form in that form it still remains as a necessary consequence she persists in reversing the two identities she says she is miss roseberry and declares miss roseberry to be mercy merrick there is the doctor s explanation what do you think of it  very ingenious i dare say the doctor doesnt quite satisfy me however for all that i think  what lady janet thought was not destined to be expressed she suddenly checked herself and held up her hand for the second time  another objection inquired julian  hold your tongue cried the old lady if you say a word more i shall lose it again  lose what aunt  what i wanted to say to you ages ago i have got it back againit begins with a question no more of the doctori have had enough of him where is sheyour pitiable lady my crazy wretchwhere is she now still in london  yes  and still at large  still with the landlady at her lodgings  very well now answer me this what is to prevent her from making another attempt to force her way or steal her way into my house how am i to protect grace how am i to protect myself if she comes here again  is that really what you wished to speak to me about  that and nothing else    they were both too deeply interested in the subject of their conversation to look toward the conservatory and to notice the appearance at that moment of a distant gentleman among the plants and flowers who had made his way in from the garden outside advancing noiselessly on the soft indian matting the gentleman ere long revealed himself under the form and features of horace holmcroft before entering the diningroom he paused fixing his eyes inquisitively on the back of lady janets visitorthe back being all that he could see in the position he then occupied after a pause of an instant the visitor spoke and further uncertainty was at once at an end horace nevertheless made no movement to enter the room he had his own jealous distrust of what julian might be tempted to say at a private interview with his aunt and he waited a little longer on the chance that his doubts might be verified  neither you nor miss roseberry need any protection from the poor deluded creature julian went on i have gained great influence over herand i have satisfied her that it is useless to present herself here again  i beg your pardon interposed horace speaking from the conservatory door you have done nothing of the sort  he had heard enough to satisfy him that the talk was not taking the direction which his suspicions had anticipated and as an additional incentive to show himself a happy chance had now offered him the opportunity of putting julian in the wrong  good heavens horace exclaimed lady janet where did you come from and what do you mean  i heard at the lodge that your ladyship and grace had returned last night and i came in at once without troubling the servants by the shortest way he turned to julian next the woman you were speaking of just now he proceeded has been here again alreadyin lady janets absence  lady janet immediately looked at her nephew julian reassured her by a gesture  impossible he said there must be some mistake  there is no mistake horace rejoined i am repeating what i have just heard from the lodgekeeper himself he hesitated to mention it to lady janet for fear of alarming her only three days since this person had the audacity to ask him for her ladyships address at the seaside of course he refused to give it  you hear that julian said lady janet  no signs of anger or mortification escaped julian the expression in his face at that moment was an expression of sincere distress  pray dont alarm yourself he said to his aunt in his quietest tones if she attempts to annoy you or miss roseberry again i have it in my power to stop her instantly  how asked lady janet  how indeed echoed horace if we give her in charge to the police we shall become the subject of a public scandal  i have managed to avoid all danger of scandal julian answered the expression of distress in his face becoming more and more marked while he spoke before i called here today i had a private consultation with the magistrate of the district and i have made certain arrangements at the police station close by on receipt of my card an experienced man in plain clothes will present himself at any address that i indicate and will take her quietly away the magistrate will hear the charge in his private room and will examine the evidence which i can produce showing that she is not accountable for her actions the proper medical officer will report officially on the case and the law will place her under the necessary restraint  lady janet and horace looked at each other in amazement julian was in their opinion the last man on earth to take the courseat once sensible and severewhich julian had actually adopted lady janet insisted on an explanation  why do i hear of this now for the first time she asked why did you not tell me you had taken these precautions before  julian answered frankly and sadly  because i hoped aunt that there would be no necessity for proceeding to extremities you now force me to acknowledge that the lawyer and the doctor both of whom i have seen this morning think as you do that she is not to be trusted it was at their suggestion entirely that i went to the magistrate they put it to me whether the result of my inquiries abroadunsatisfactory as it may have been in other respectsdid not strengthen the conclusion that the poor womans mind is deranged i felt compelled in common honesty to admit that it was so having owned this i was bound to take such precautions as the lawyer and the doctor thought necessary i have done my dutysorely against my own will it is weak of me i dare say but i can not bear the thought of treating this afflicted creature harshly her delusion is so hopeless her situation is such a pitiable one  his voice faltered he turned away abruptly and took up his hat lady janet followed him and spoke to him at the door horace smiled satirically and went to warm himself at the fire  are you going away julian  i am only going to the lodgekeeper i want to give him a word of warning in case of his seeing her again  you will come back here lady janet lowered her voice to a whisper there is really a reason julian for your not leaving the house now  i promise not to go away aunt until i have provided for your security if you or your adopted daughter are alarmed by another intrusion i give you my word of honor my card shall go to the police station however painfully i may feel it myself he too lowered his voice at the next words  in the meantime remember what i confessed to you while we were alone for my sake let me see as little of miss roseberry as possible shall i find you in this room when i come back  yes  alone  he laid a strong emphasis of look as well as of tone on that one word lady janet understood what the emphasis meant  are you really she whispered as much in love with grace as that  julian laid one hand on his aunts arm and pointed with the other to horacestanding with his back to them warming his feet on the fender  well said lady janet  well said julian with a smile on his lip and a tear in his eye i never envied any man as i envy him  with those words he left the room    chapter xv a womans remorse  having warmed his feet to his own entire satisfaction horace turned round from the fireplace and discovered that he and lady janet were alone  can i see grace he asked  the easy tone in which he put the questiona tone as it were of proprietorship in gracejarred on lady janet at the moment for the first time in her life she found herself comparing horace with julianto horaces disadvantage he was rich he was a gentleman of ancient lineage he bore an unblemished character but who had the strong brain who had the great heart which was the man of the two  nobody can see her answered lady janet not even you  the tone of the reply was sharp with a dash of irony in it but where is the modern young man possessed of health and an independent income who is capable of understanding that irony can be presumptuous enough to address itself to him horace with perfect politeness declined to consider himself answered  does your ladyship mean that miss roseberry is in bed he asked  i mean that miss roseberry is in her room i mean that i have twice tried to persuade miss roseberry to dress and come downstairs and tried in vain i mean that what miss roseberry refuses to do for me she is not likely to do for you  how many more meanings of her own lady janet might have gone on enumerating it is not easy to calculate at her third sentence a sound in the library caught her ear through the incompletely closed door and suspended the next words on her lips horace heard it also it was the rustling sound traveling nearer and nearer over the library carpet of a silken dress  in the interval while a coming event remains in a state of uncertainty what is it the inevitable tendency of every englishman under thirty to do his inevitable tendency is to ask somebody to bet on the event he can no more resist it than he can resist lifting his stick or his umbrella in the absence of a gun and pretending to shoot if a bird flies by him while he is out for a walk  what will your ladyship bet that this is not grace cried horace  her ladyship took no notice of the proposal her attention remained fixed on the library door the rustling sound stopped for a moment the door was softly pushed open the false grace roseberry entered the room  horace advanced to meet her opened his lips to speak and stoppedstruck dumb by the change in his affianced wife since he had seen her last some terrible oppression seemed to have crushed her it was as if she had actually shrunk in height as well as in substance she walked more slowly than usual she spoke more rarely than usual and in a lower tone to those who had seen her before the fatal visit of the stranger from mannheim it was the wreck of the woman that now appeared instead of the woman herself and yet there was the old charm still surviving through it all the grandeur of the head and eyes the delicate symmetry of the features the unsought grace of every movementin a word the unconquerable beauty which suffering cannot destroy and which time itself is powerless to wear out lady janet advanced and took her with hearty kindness by both hands  my dear child welcome among us again you have come down stairs to please me  she bent her head in silent acknowledgment that it was so lady janet pointed to horace here is somebody who has been longing to see you grace  she never looked up she stood submissive her eyes fixed on a little basket of colored wools which hung on her arm thank you lady janet she said faintly thank you horace  horace placed her arm in his and led her to the sofa she shivered as she took her seat and looked round her it was the first time she had seen the diningroom since the day when she had found herself face to face with the deadalive  why do you come here my love asked lady janet the drawingroom would have been a warmer and a pleasanter place for you  i saw a carriage at the front door i was afraid of meeting with visitors in the drawingroom  as she made that reply the servant came in and announced the visitors names lady janet sighed wearily i must go and get rid of them she said resigning herself to circumstances what will you do grace  i will stay here if you please  i will keep her company added horace  lady janet hesitated she had promised to see her nephew in the diningroom on his return to the houseand to see him alone would there be time enough to get rid of the visitors and to establish her adopted daughter in the empty drawingroom before julian appeared it was ten minutes walk to the lodge and he had to make the gatekeeper understand his instructions lady janet decided that she had time enough at her disposal she nodded kindly to mercy and left her alone with her lover  horace seated himself in the vacant place on the sofa so far as it was in his nature to devote himself to any one he was devoted to mercy i am grieved to see how you have suffered he said with honest distress in his face as he looked at her try to forget what has happened  i am trying to forget do you think of it much  my darling it is too contemptible to be thought of  she placed her workbasket on her lap her wasted fingers began absently sorting the wools inside  have you seen mr julian gray she asked suddenly  yes  what does he say about it she looked at horace for the first time steadily scrutinizing his face horace took refuge in prevarication  i really havent asked for julians opinion he said  she looked down again with a sigh at the basket on her lapconsidered a littleand tried him once more  why has mr julian gray not been here for a whole week she went on the servants say he has been abroad is that true  it was useless to deny it horace admitted that the servants were right  her fingers suddenly stopped at their restless work among the wools her breath quickened perceptibly what had julian gray been doing abroad had he been making inquiries did he alone of all the people who saw that terrible meeting suspect her yes his was the finer intelligence his was a clergymans a london clergymans experience of frauds and deceptions and of the women who were guilty of them not a doubt of it now julian suspected her  when does he come back she asked in tones so low that horace could barely hear her  he has come back already he returned last night  a faint shade of color stole slowly over the pallor of her face she suddenly put her basket away and clasped her hands together to quiet the trembling of them before she asked her next question  where is she paused to steady her voice where is the person she resumed who came here and frightened me  horace hastened to reassure her the person will not come again he said dont talk of her dont think of her  she shook her head there is something i want to know she persisted how did mr julian gray become acquainted with her  this was easily answered horace mentioned the consul at mannheim and the letter of introduction she listened eagerly and said her next words in a louder firmer tone  she was quite a stranger then to mr julian graybefore that  quite a stranger horace replied no more questionsnot another word about her grace i forbid the subject come my own love he said taking her hand and bending over her tenderly rally your spirits we are youngwe love each othernow is our time to be happy  her hand turned suddenly cold and trembled in his her head sank with a helpless weariness on her breast horace rose in alarm  you are coldyou are faint he said let me get you a glass of winelet me mend the fire  the decanters were still on the luncheontable horace insisted on her drinking some portwine she barely took half the contents of the wineglass even that little told on her sensitive organization it roused her sinking energies of body and mind after watching her anxiously without attracting her notice horace left her again to attend to the fire at the other end of the room her eyes followed him slowly with a hard and tearless despair rally your spirits she repeated to herself in a whisper my spirits o god she looked round her at the luxury and beauty of the room as those look who take their leave of familiar scenes the moment after her eyes sank and rested on the rich dress that she wore a gift from lady janet she thought of the past she thought of the future was the time near when she would be back again in the refuge or back again in the streetsshe who had been lady janets adopted daughter and horace holmcrofts betrothed wife a sudden frenzy of recklessness seized on her as she thought of the coming end horace was right why not rally her spirits why not make the most of her time the last hours of her life in that house were at hand why not enjoy her stolen position while she could adventuress whispered the mocking spirit within her be true to your character away with your remorse remorse is the luxury of an honest woman she caught up her basket of wools inspired by a new idea ring the bell she cried out to horace at the fireplace  he looked round in wonder the sound of her voice was so completely altered that he almost fancied there must have been another woman in the room  ring the bell she repeated i have left my work upstairs if you want me to be in good spirits i must have my work  still looking at her horace put his hand mechanically to the bell and rang one of the menservants came in  go upstairs and ask my maid for my work she said sharply even the man was taken by surprise it was her habit to speak to the servants with a gentleness and consideration which had long since won all their hearts do you hear me she asked impatiently the servant bowed and went out on his errand she turned to horace with flashing eyes and fevered cheeks  what a comfort it is she said to belong to the upper classes a poor woman has no maid to dress her and no footman to send upstairs is life worth having horace on less than five thousand a year  the servant returned with a strip of embroidery she took it with an insolent grace and told him to bring her a footstool the man obeyed she tossed the embroidery away from her on the sofa on second thoughts i dont care about my work she said take it upstairs again the perfectly trained servant marveling privately obeyed once more horace in silent astonishment advanced to the sofa to observe her more nearly how grave you look she exclaimed with an air of flippant unconcern you dont approve of my sitting idle perhaps anything to please you i havent got to go up and downstairs ring the bell again  my dear grace horace remonstrated gravely you are quite mistaken i never even thought of your work  never mind its inconsistent to send for my work and then send it away again ring the bell  horace looked at her without moving grace he said what has come to you  how should i know she retorted carelessly didnt you tell me to rally my spirits will you ring the bell or must i  horace submitted he frowned as he walked back to the bell he was one of the many people who instinctively resent anything that is new to them this strange outbreak was quite new to him for the first time in his life he felt sympathy for a servant when the muchenduring man appeared once more  bring my work back i have changed my mind with that brief explanation she reclined luxuriously on the soft sofacushions swinging one of her balls of wool to and fro above her head and looking at it lazily as she lay back i have a remark to make horace she went on when the door had closed on her messenger it is only people in our rank of life who get good servants did you notice nothing upsets that mans temper a servant in a poor family should have been impudent a maidofallwork would have wondered when i was going to know my own mind the man returned with the embroidery this time she received him graciously she dismissed him with her thanks have you seen your mother lately horace she asked suddenly sitting up and busying herself with her work  i saw her yesterday horace answered  she understands i hope that i am not well enough to call on her she is not offended with me  horace recovered his serenity the deference to his mother implied in mercys questions gently flattered his selfesteem he resumed his place on the sofa  offended with you he answered smiling my dear grace she sends you her love and more than that she has a wedding present for you  mercy became absorbed in her work she stooped close over the embroideryso close that horace could not see her face do you know what the present is she asked in lowered tones speaking absently  no i only know it is waiting for you shall i go and get it today  she neither accepted nor refused the proposalshe went on with her work more industriously than ever  there is plenty of time horace persisted i can go before dinner  still she took no notice still she never looked up your mother is very kind to me she said abruptly i was afraid at one time that she would think me hardly good enough to be your wife  horace laughed indulgently his selfesteem was more gently flattered than ever  absurd he exclaimed my darling you are connected with lady janet roy your family is almost as good as ours  almost she repeated only almost  the momentary levity of expression vanished from horaces face the family question was far too serious a question to be lightly treated a becoming shadow of solemnity stole over his manner he looked as if it was sunday and he was just stepping into church  in our family he said we trace backby my father to the saxons by my mother to the normans lady janets family is an old familyon her side only  mercy dropped her embroidery and looked horace full in the face she too attached no common importance to what she had next to say  if i had not been connected with lady janet she began would you ever have thought of marrying me  my love what is the use of asking you are connected with lady janet  she refused to let him escape answering her in that way  suppose i had not been connected with lady janet she persisted suppose i had only been a good girl with nothing but my own merits to speak for me what would your mother have said then  horace still parried the questiononly to find the point of it pressed home on him once more  why do you ask he said  i ask to be answered she rejoined would your mother have liked you to marry a poor girl of no familywith nothing but her own virtues to speak for her  horace was fairly pressed back to the wall  if you must know he replied my mother would have refused to sanction such a marriage as that  no matter how good the girl might have been  there was something defiantalmost threateningin her tone horace was annoyedand he showed it when he spoke  my mother would have respected the girl without ceasing to respect herself he said my mother would have remembered what was due to the family name  and she would have said no  she would have said no  ah  there was an undertone of angry contempt in the exclamation which made horace start what is the matter he asked  nothing she answered and took up her embroidery again there he sat at her side anxiously looking at herhis hope in the future centered in his marriage in a week more if she chose she might enter that ancient family of which he had spoken so proudly as his wife oh she thought if i didnt love him if i had only his merciless mother to think of  uneasily conscious of some estrangement between them horace spoke again surely i have not offended you he said  she turned toward him once more the work dropped unheeded on her lap her grand eyes softened into tenderness a smile trembled sadly on her delicate lips she laid one hand caressingly on his shoulder all the beauty of her voice lent its charm to the next words that she said to him the womans heart hungered in its misery for the comfort that could only come from his lips  you would have loved me horacewithout stopping to think of the family name  the family name again how strangely she persisted in coming back to that horace looked at her without answering trying vainly to fathom what was passing in her mind  she took his hand and wrung it hardas if she would wring the answer out of him in that way  you would have loved me she repeated  the double spell of her voice and her touch was on him he answered warmly under any circumstances under any name  she put one arm round his neck and fixed her eyes on his is that true she asked  true as t he heaven above us  she drank in those few commonplace words with a greedy delight she forced him to repeat them in a new form  no matter who i might have been for myself alone  for yourself alone  she threw both arms round him and laid her head passionately on his breast i love you i love you i love you her voice rose with hysterical vehemence at each repetition of the wordsthen suddenly sank to a low hoarse cry of rage and despair the sense of her true position toward him revealed itself in all its horror as the confession of her love escaped her lips her arms dropped from him she flung herself back on the sofacushions hiding her face in her hands oh leave me she moaned faintly go go  horace tried to wind his arm round her and raise her she started to her feet and waved him back from her with a wild action of her hands as if she was frightened of him the wedding present she cried seizing the first pretext that occurred to her you offered to bring me your mothers present i am dying to see what it is go and get it  horace tried to compose her he might as well have tried to compose the winds and the sea  go she repeated pressing one clinched hand on her bosom i am not well talking excites mei am hysterical i shall be better alone get me the present go  shall i send lady janet shall i ring for your maid  send for nobody ring for nobody if you love meleave me here by myself leave me instantly  i shall see you when i come back  yes yes  there was no alternative but to obey her unwillingly and forebodingly horace left the room  she drew a deep breath of relief and dropped into the nearest chair if horace had stayed a moment longershe felt it she knew ither head would have given way she would have burst out before him with the terrible truth oh she thought pressing her cold hands on her burning eyes if i could only cry now there is nobody to see me  the room was empty she had every reason for concluding that she was alone and yet at that very moment there were ears that listenedthere were eyes waiting to see her  little by little the door behind her which faced the library and led into the billiardroom was opened noiselessly from without by an inch at a time as the opening was enlarged a hand in a black glove an arm in a black sleeve appeared guiding the movement of the door an interval of a moment passed and the worn white face of grace roseberry showed itself stealthily looking into the diningroom  her eyes brightened with vindictive pleasure as they discovered mercy sitting alone at the further end of the room inch by inch she opened the door more widely took one step forward and checked herself a sound just audible at the far end of the conservatory had caught her ear  she listenedsatisfied herself that she was not mistakenand drawing back with a frown of displeasure softly closed the door again so as to hide herself from view the sound that had disturbed her was the distant murmur of mens voices apparently two in number talking together in lowered tones at the garden entrance to the conservatory  who were the men and what would they do next they might do one of two things they might enter the drawingroom or they might withdraw again by way of the garden kneeling behind the door with her ear at the keyhole grace roseberry waited the event    chapter xvi they meet again  absorbed in herself mercy failed to notice the opening door or to hear the murmur of voices in the conservatory  the one terrible necessity which had been present to her mind at intervals for a week past was confronting her at that moment she owed to grace roseberry the tardy justice of owning the truth the longer her confession was delayed the more cruelly she was injuring the woman whom she had robbed of her identitythe friendless woman who had neither witnesses nor papers to produce who was powerless to right her own wrong keenly as she felt this mercy failed nevertheless to conquer the horror that shook her when she thought of the impending avowal day followed day and still she shrank from the unendurable ordeal of confessionas she was shrinking from it now  was it fear for herself that closed her lips  she trembledas any human being in her place must have trembledat the bare idea of finding herself thrown back again on the world which had no place in it and no hope in it for her but she could have overcome that terrorshe could have resigned herself to that doom  no it was not the fear of the confession itself or the fear of the consequences which must follow it that still held her silent the horror that daunted her was the horror of owning to horace and to lady janet that she had cheated them out of their love  every day lady janet was kinder and kinder every day horace was fonder and fonder of her how could she confess to lady janet how could she own to horace that she had imposed upon him i cant do it they are so good to mei cant do it in that hopeless way it had ended during the seven days that had gone by in that hopeless way it ended again now    the murmur of the two voices at the further end of the conservatory ceased the billiardroom door opened again slowly by an inch at a time  mercy still kept her place unconscious of the events that were passing round her sinking under the hard stress laid on it her mind had drifted little by little into a new train of thought for the first time she found the courage to question the future in a new way supposing her confession to have been made or supposing the woman whom she had personated to have discovered the means of exposing the fraud what advantage she now asked herself would miss roseberry derive from mercy merricks disgrace  could lady janet transfer to the woman who was really her relative by marriage the affection which she had given to the woman who had pretended to be her relative no all the right in the world would not put the true grace into the false graces vacant place the qualities by which mercy had won lady janets love were the qualities which were mercys won lady janet could do rigid justicebut hers was not the heart to give itself to a stranger and to give itself unreservedly a second time grace roseberry would be formally acknowledgedand there it would end  was there hope in this new view  yes there was the false hope of making the inevitable atonement by some other means than by the confession of the fraud  what had grace roseberry actually lost by the wrong done to her she had lost the salary of lady janets companion and reader say that she wanted money mercy had her savings from the generous allowance made to her by lady janet mercy could offer money or say that she wanted employment mercys interest with lady janet could offer employment could offer anything grace might ask for if she would only come to terms  invigorated by the new hope mercy rose excitedly weary of inaction in the empty room she who but a few minutes since had shuddered at the thought of their meeting again was now eager to devise a means of finding her way privately to an interview with grace it should be done without loss of timeon that very day if possible by the next day at latest she looked round her mechanically pondering how to reach the end in view her eyes rested by chance on the door of the billiardroom  was it fancy or did she really see the door first open a little then suddenly and softly close again  was it fancy or did she really hear at the same moment a sound behind her as of persons speaking in the conservatory  she paused and looking back in that direction listened intently the soundif she had really heard itwas no longer audible she advanced toward the billiardroom to set her first doubt at rest she stretched out her hand to open the door when the voices recognizable now as the voices of two men caught her ear once more  this time she was able to distinguish the words that were spoken  any further orders sir inquired one of the men  nothing more replied the other  mercy started and faintly flushed as the second voice answered the first she stood irresolute close to the billiardroom hesitating what to do next  after an interval the second voice made itself heard again advancing nearer to the diningroom are you there aunt it asked cautiously there was a moments pause then the voice spoke for the third time sounding louder and nearer are you there it reiterated i have something to tell you mercy summoned her resolution and answered lady janet is not here she turned as she spoke toward the conservatory door and confronted on the threshold julian gray  they looked at one another without exchanging a word on either side the situationfor widely different reasonswas equally embarrassing to both of them  thereas julian saw herwas the woman forbidden to him the woman whom he loved  thereas mercy saw himwas the man whom she dreaded the man whose actions as she interpreted them proved that he suspected her  on the surface of it the incidents which had marked their first meeting were now exactly repeated with the one difference that the impulse to withdraw this time appeared to be on the mans side and not on the womans it was mercy who spoke first  did you expect to find lady janet here she asked constrainedly he answered on his part more constrainedly still  it doesnt matter he said another time will do  he drew back as he made the reply she advanced desperately with the deliberate intention of detaining him by speaking again  the attempt which he had made to withdraw the constraint in his manner when he had answered had instantly confirmed her in the false conviction that he and he alone had guessed the truth if she was rightif he had secretly made discoveries abroad which placed her entirely at his mercythe attempt to induce grace to consent to a compromise with her would be manifestly useless her first and foremost interest now was to find out how she really stood in the estimation of julian gray in a terror of suspense that turned her cold from head to foot she stopped him on his way out and spoke to him with the piteous counterfeit of a smile  lady janet is receiving some visitors she said if you will wait here she will be back directly  the effort of hiding her agitation from him had brought a passing color into her cheeks worn and wasted as she was the spell of her beauty was strong enough to hold him against his own will all he had to tell lady janet was that he had met one of the gardeners in the conservatory and had cautioned him as well as the lodgekeeper it would have been easy to write this and to send the note to his aunt on quitting the house for the sake of his own peace of mind for the sake of his duty to horace he was doubly bound to make the first polite excuse that occurred to him and to leave her as he had found her alone in the room he made the attempt and hesitated despising himself for doing it he allowed himself to look at her their eyes met julian stepped into the diningroom  if i am not in the way he said confusedly i will wait as you kindly propose  she noticed his embarrassment she saw that he was strongly restraining himself from looking at her again her own eyes dropped to the ground as she made the discovery her speech failed her her heart throbbed faster and faster  if i look at him again was the thought in her mind i shall fall at his feet and tell him all that i have done  if i look at her again was the thought in his mind i shall fall at her feet and own that i am in love with her  with downcast eyes he placed a chair for her with downcast eyes she bowed to him and took it a dead silence followed never was any human misunderstanding more intricately complete than the misunderstanding which had now established itself between those two  mercys workbasket was near her she took it and gained time for composing herself by pretending to arrange the colored wools he stood behind her chair looking at the graceful turn of her head looking at the rich masses of her hair he reviled himself as the weakest of men as the falsest of friends for still remaining near herand yet he remained  the silence continued the billiardroom door opened again noiselessly the face of the listening woman appeared stealthily behind it  at the same moment mercy roused herself and spoke wont you sit down she said softly still not looking round at him still busy with her basket of wools  he turned to get a chairturned so quickly that he saw the billiardroom door move as grace roseberry closed it again  is there any one in that room he asked addressing mercy  i dont know she answered i thought i saw the door open and shut again a little while ago  he advanced at once to look into the room as he did so mercy dropped one of her balls of wool he stopped to pick it up for herthen threw open the door and looked into the billiardroom it was empty  had some person been listening and had that person retreated in time to escape discovery the open door of the smokingroom showed that room also to be empty a third door was openthe door of the side hall leading into the grounds julian closed and locked it and returned to the diningroom  i can only suppose he said to mercy that the billiardroom door was not properly shut and that the draught of air from the hall must have moved it  she accepted the explanation in silence he was to all appearance not quite satisfied with it himself for a moment or two he looked about him uneasily then the old fascination fastened its hold on him again once more he looked at the graceful turn of her head at the rich masses of her hair the courage to put the critical question to him now that she had lured him into remaining in the room was still a courage that failed her she remained as busy as ever with her worktoo busy to look at him too busy to speak to him the silence became unendurable he broke it by making a commonplace inquiry after her health i am well enough to be ashamed of the anxiety i have caused and the trouble i have given she answered today i have got downstairs for the first time i am trying to do a little work she looked into the basket the various specimens of wool in it were partly in balls and partly in loose skeins the skeins were mixed and tangled here is sad confusion she exclaimed timidly with a faint smile how am i to set it right again  let me help you said julian  you  why not he asked with a momentary return of the quaint humor which she remembered so well you forget that i am a curate curates are privileged to make themselves useful to young ladies let me try  he took a stool at her feet and set himself to unravel one of the tangled skeins in a minute the wool was stretched on his hands and the loose end was ready for mercy to wind there was something in the trivial action and in the homely attention that it implied which in some degree quieted her fear of him she began to roll the wool off his hands into a ball thus occupied she said the daring words which were to lead him little by little into betraying his suspicions if he did indeed suspect the truth    chapter xvii the guardian angel  you were here when i fainted were you not mercy began you must think me a sad coward even for a woman  he shook his head i am far from thinking that he replied no courage could have sustained the shock which fell on you i dont wonder that you fainted i dont wonder that you have been ill  she paused in rolling up the ball of wool what did those words of unexpected sympathy mean was he laying a trap for her urged by that serious doubt she questioned him more boldly  horace tells me you have been abroad she said did you enjoy your holiday  it was no holiday i went abroad because i thought it right to make certain inquiries he stopped there unwilling to return to a subject that was painful to her  her voice sank her fingers trembled round the ball of wool but she managed to go on  did you arrive at any results she asked  at no results worth mentioning  the caution of that reply renewed her worst suspicions of him in sheer despair she spoke out plainly  i want to know your opinion she began  gently said julian you are entangling the wool again  i want to know your opinion of the person who so terribly frightened me do you think her  do i think herwhat  do you think her an adventuress  as she said those words the branches of a shrub in the conservatory were noiselessly parted by a hand in a black glove the face of grace roseberry appeared dimly behind the leaves undiscovered she had escaped from the billiardroom and had stolen her way into the conservatory as the safer hidingplace of the two behind the shrub she could see as well as listen behind the shrub she waited as patiently as ever  i take a more merciful view julian answered i believe she is acting under a delusion i dont blame her i pity her  you pity her as mercy repeated the words she tore off julians hands the last few lengths of wool left and threw the imperfectly wound skein back into the basket does that mean she resumed abruptly that you believe her  julian rose from his seat and looked at mercy in astonishment  good heavens miss roseberry what put such an idea as that into your head  i am little better than a stranger to you she rejoined with an effort to assume a jesting tone you met that person before you met with me it is not so very far from pitying her to believing her how could i feel sure that you might not suspect me  suspect you he exclaimed you dont know how you distress how you shock me suspect you the bare idea of it never entered my mind the man doesnt live who trusts you more implicitly who believes in you more devotedly than i do  his eyes his voice his manner all told her that those words came from the heart she contrasted his generous confidence in her the confidence of which she was unworthy with her ungracious distrust of him not only had she wronged grace roseberryshe had wronged julian gray could she deceive him as she had deceived the others could she meanly accept that implicit trust that devoted belief never had she felt the base submissions which her own imposture condemned her to undergo with a loathing of them so overwhelming as the loathing that she felt now in horror of herself she turned her head aside in silence and shrank from meeting his eye he noticed the movement placing his own interpretation on it advancing closer he asked anxiously if he had offended her  you dont know how your confidence touches me she said without looking up you little think how keenly i feel your kindness  she checked herself abruptly her fine tact warned her that she was speaking too warmlythat the expression of her gratitude might strike him as being strangely exaggerated she handed him her workbasket before he could speak again  will you put it away for me she asked in her quieter tones i dont feel able to work just now  his back was turned on her for a moment while he placed the basket on a sidetable in that moment her mind advanced at a bound from present to future accident might one day put the true grace in possession of the proofs that she needed and might reveal the false grace to him in the identity that was her own what would he think of her then could she make him tell her without betraying herself she determined to try  children are notoriously insatiable if you once answer their questions and women are nearly as bad she said when julian returned to her will your patience hold out if i go back for the third time to the person whom we have been speaking of  try me he answered with a smile  suppose you had not taken your merciful view of her  yes  suppose you believed that she was wickedly bent on deceiving others for a purpose of her ownwould you not shrink from such a woman in horror and disgust  god forbid that i should shrink from any human creature he answered earnestly who among us has a right to do that  she hardly dared trust herself to believe him you would still pity her she persisted and still feel for her  with all my heart  oh how good you are  he held up his hand in warning the tones of his voice deepened the luster of his eyes brightened she had stirred in the depths of that great heart the faith in which the man livedthe steady principle which guided his modest and noble life  no he cried dont say that say that i try to love my neighbor as myself who but a pharisee can believe that he is better than another the best among us today may but for the mercy of god be the worst among us tomorrow the true christian virtue is the virtue which never despairs of a fellowcreature the true christian faith believes in man as well as in god frail and fallen as we are we can rise on the wings of repentance from earth to heaven humanity is sacred humanity has its immortal destiny who shall dare say to man or woman there is no hope in you who shall dare say the work is all vile when that work bears on it the stamp of the creators hand  he turned away for a moment struggling with the emotion which she had roused in him  her eyes as they followed him lighted with a momentary enthusiasmthen sank wearily in the vain regret which comes too late ah if he could have been her friend and her adviser on the fatal day when she first turned her steps toward mablethorpe house she sighed bitterly as the hopeless aspiration wrung her heart he heard the sigh and turning again looked at her with a new interest in his face  miss roseberry he said  she was still absorbed in the bitter memories of the past she failed to hear him  miss roseberry he repeated approaching her  she looked up at him with a start  may i venture to ask you something he said gently  she shrank at the question  dont suppose i am speaking out of mere curiosity he went on and pray dont answer me unless you can answer without betraying any confidence which may have been placed in you  confidence she repeated what confidence do you mean  it has just struck me that you might have felt more than a common interest in the questions which you put to me a moment since he answered were you by any chance speaking of some unhappy womannot the person who frightened you of coursebut of some other woman whom you know  her head sank slowly on her bosom he had plainly no suspicion that she had been speaking of herself his tone and manner both answered for it that his belief in her was as strong as ever still those last words made her tremble she could not trust herself to reply to them  he accepted the bending of her head as a reply  are you interested in her he asked next  she faintly answered this time yes  have you encouraged her  i have not dared to encourage her  his face lighted up suddenly with enthusiasm go to her he said and let me go with you and help you  the answer came faintly and mournfully she has sunk too low for that  he interrupted her with a gesture of impatience  what has she done he asked  she has deceivedbasely deceivedinnocent people who trusted her she has wrongedcruelly wrongedanother woman  for the first time julian seated himself at her side the interest that was now roused in him was an interest above reproach he could speak to mercy without restraint he could look at mercy with a pure heart  you judge her very harshly he said do you know how she may have been tried and tempted  there was no answer  tell me he went on is the person whom she has injured still living  yes  if the person is still living she may atone for the wrong the time may come when this sinner too may win our pardon and deserve our respect  could you respect her mercy asked sadly can such a mind as yours understand what she has gone through  a smile kind and momentary brightened his attentive face  you forget my melancholy experience he answered young as i am i have seen more than most men of women who have sinned and suffered even after the little that you have told me i think i can put myself in her place i can well understand for instance that she may have been tempted beyond human resistance am i right  you are right  she may have had nobody near at the time to advise her to warn her to save her is that true  it is true  tempted and friendless selfabandoned to the evil impulse of the moment this woman may have committed herself headlong to the act which she now vainly repents she may long to make atonement and may not know how to begin all her energies may be crushed under the despair and horror of herself out of which the truest repentance grows is such a woman as this all wicked all vile i deny it she may have a noble nature and she may show it nobly yet give her the opportunity she needs and our poor fallen fellowcreature may take her place again among the best of ushonored blameless happy once more  mercys eyes resting eagerly on him while he was speaking dropped again despondingly when he had done  there is no such future as that she answered for the woman whom i am thinking of she has lost her opportunity she has done with hope  julian gravely considered with himself for a moment  let us understand each other he said she has committed an act of deception to the injury of another woman was that what you told me  yes  and she has gained something to her own advantage by the act  yes  is she threatened with discovery  she is safe from discoveryfor the present at least  safe as long as she closes her lips  as long as she closes her lips  there is her opportunity cried julian her future is before her she has not done with hope  with clasped hands in breathless suspense mercy looked at that inspiriting face and listened to those golden words  explain yourself she said tell her through me what she must do  let her own the truth answered julian without the base fear of discovery to drive her to it let her do justice to the woman whom she has wronged while that woman is still powerless to expose her let her sacrifice everything that she has gained by the fraud to the sacred duty of atonement if she can do thatfor conscience sake and for pitys saketo her own prejudice to her own shame to her own lossthen her repentance has nobly revealed the noble nature that is in her then she is a woman to be trusted respected beloved if i saw the pharisees and fanatics of this lower earth passing her by in contempt i would hold out my hand to her before them all i would say to her in her solitude and her affliction rise poor wounded heart beautiful purified soul gods angels rejoice over you take your place among the noblest of gods creatures  in those last sentences he unconsciously repeated the language in which he had spoken years since to his congregation in the chapel of the refuge with tenfold power and tenfold persuasion they now found their way again to mercys heart softly suddenly mysteriously a change passed over her her troubled face grew beautifully still the shifting light of terror and suspense vanished from her grand gray eyes and left in them the steady inner glow of a high and pure resolve  there was a moment of silence between them they both had need of silence julian was the first to speak again  have i satisfied you that her opportunity is still before her he asked do you feel as i feel that she has not done with hope  you have satisfied me that the world holds no truer friend to her than you mercy answered gently and gratefully she shall prove herself worthy of your generous confidence in her she shall show you yet that you have not spoken in vain  still inevitably failing to understand her he led the way to the door  dont waste the precious time he said dont leave her cruelly to herself if you cant go to her let me go as your messenger in your place  she stopped him by a gesture he took a step back into the room and paused observing with surprise that she made no attempt to move from the chair that she occupied  stay here she said to him in suddenly altered tones  pardon me he rejoined i dont understand you  you will understand me directly give me a little time  he still lingered near the door with his eyes fixed inquiringly on her a man of a lower nature than his or a man believing in mercy less devotedly than he believed would now have felt his first suspicion of her julian was as far as ever from suspecting her even yet do you wish to be alone he asked considerately shall i leave you for a while and return again  she looked up with a start of terror leave me she repeated and suddenly checked herself on the point of saying more nearly half the length of the room divided them from each other the words which she was longing to say were words that would never pass her lips unless she could see some encouragement in his face no she cried out to him on a sudden in her sore need dont leave me come back to me  he obeyed her in silence in silence on her side she pointed to the chair near her he took it she looked at him and checked herself again resolute to make her terrible confession yet still hesitating how to begin her womans instinct whispered to her find courage in his touch she said to him simply and artlessly said to him give me encouragement give me strength let me take your hand he neither answered nor moved his mind seemed to have become suddenly preoccupied his eyes rested on her vacantly he was on the brink of discovering her secret in another instant he would have found his way to the truth in that instant innocently as his sister might have taken it she took his hand the soft clasp of her fingers clinging round his roused his senses fired his passion for her swept out of his mind the pure aspirations which had filled it but the moment before paralyzed his perception when it was just penetrating the mystery of her disturbed manner and her strange words all the man in him trembled under the rapture of her touch but the thought of horace was still present to him his hand lay passive in hers his eyes looked uneasily away from her  she innocently strengthened her clasp of his hand she innocently said to him dont look away from me your eyes give me courage  his hand returned the pressure of hers he tasted to the full the delicious joy of looking at her she had broken down his last reserves of selfcontrol the thought of horace the sense of honor became obscured in him in a moment more he might have said the words which he would have deplored for the rest of his life if she had not stopped him by speaking first i have more to say to you she resumed abruptly feeling the animating resolution to lay her heart bare before him at last more far more than i have said yet generous merciful friend let me say it here  she attempted to throw herself on her knees at his feet he sprung from his seat and checked her holding her with both his hands raising her as he rose himself in the words which had just escaped her in the startling action which had accompanied them the truth burst on him the guilty woman she had spoken of was herself  while she was almost in his arms while her bosom was just touching his before a word more had passed his lips or hers the library door opened  lady janet roy entered the room    chapter xviii the search in the grounds  grace roseberry still listening in the conservatory saw the door open and recognized the mistress of the house she softly drew back and placed herself in safer hiding beyond the range of view from the diningroom  lady janet advanced no further than the threshold she stood there and looked at her nephew and her adopted daughter in stern silence  mercy dropped into the chair at her side julian kept his place by her his mind was still stunned by the discovery that had burst on it his eyes still rested on her in mute terror of inquiry he was as completely absorbed in the one act of looking at her as if they had been still alone together in the room  lady janet was the first of the three who spoke she addressed herself to her nephew  you were right mr julian gray she said with her bitterest emphasis of tone and manner you ought to have found nobody in this room on your return but me i detain you no longer you are free to leave my house  julian looked round at his aunt she was pointing to the door in the excited state of his sensibilities at that moment the action stung him to the quick he answered without his customary consideration for his aunts age and his aunts position toward him  you apparently forget lady janet that you are not speaking to one of your footmen he said there are serious reasons of which you know nothing for my remaining in your house a little longer you may rely upon my trespassing on your hospitality as short a time as possible  he turned again to mercy as he said those words and surprised her timidly looking up at him in the instant when their eyes met the tumult of emotions struggling in him became suddenly stilled sorrow for hercompassionating sorrowrose in the new calm and filled his heart now and now only he could read in the wasted and noble face how she had suffered the pity which he had felt for the unnamed woman grew to a tenfold pity for her the faith which he professedhonestly professedin the better nature of the unnamed woman strengthened into a tenfold faith in her he addressed himself again to his aunt in a gentler tone this lady he resumed has something to say to me in private which she has not said yet that is my reason and my apology for not immediately leaving the house  still under the impression of what she had seen on entering the room lady janet looked at him in angry amazement was julian actually ignoring horace holmcrofts claims in the presence of horace holmcrofts betrothed wife she appealed to her adopted daughter grace she exclaimed have you heard him have you nothing to say must i remind you  she stopped for the first time in lady janets experience of her young companion she found herself speaking to ears that were deaf to her mercy was incapable of listening julians eyes had told her that julian understood her at last  lady janet turned to her nephew once more and addressed him in the hardest words that she had ever spoken to her sisters son  if you have any sense of decency she saidi say nothing of a sense of honoryou will leave this house and your acquaintance with that lady will end here spare me your protests and excuses i can place but one interpretation on what i saw when i opened that door  you entirely misunderstand what you saw when you opened that door julian answered quietly  perhaps i misunderstand the confession which you made to me not an hour ago retorted lady janet  julian cast a look of alarm at mercy dont speak of it he said in a whisper she might hear you  do you mean to say she doesnt know you are in love with her  thank god she has not the faintest suspicion of it  there was no mistaking the earnestness with which he made that reply it proved his innocence as nothing else could have proved it lady janet drew back a steputterly bewildered completely at a loss what to say or what to do next  the silence that followed was broken by a knock at the library door the manservantwith news and bad news legibly written in his disturbed face and mannerentered the room in the nervous irritability of the moment lady janet resented the servants appearance as a positive offense on the part of the harmless man who sent for you she asked sharply what do you mean by interrupting us  the servant made his excuses in an oddly bewildered manner  i beg your ladyships pardon i wished to take the libertyi wanted to speak to mr julian gray  what is it asked julian  the man looked uneasily at lady janet hesitated and glanced at the door as if he wished himself well out of the room again  i hardly know if i can tell you sir before her ladyship he answered  lady janet instantly penetrated the secret of her servants hesitation  i know what has happened she said that abominable woman has found her way here again am i right  the mans eyes helplessly consulted julian  yes or no cried lady janet imperatively  yes my lady  julian at once assumed the duty of asking the necessary questions  where is she he began  somewhere in the grounds as we suppose sir  did you see her  no sir  who saw her  the lodgekeepers wife  this looked serious the lodgekeepers wife had been present while julian had given his instructions to her husband she was not likely to have mistaken the identity of the person whom she had discovered  how long since julian asked next  not very long sir  be more particular how long  i didnt hear sir  did the lodgekeepers wife speak to the person when she saw her  no sir she didnt get the chance as i understand it she is a stout woman if you remember the other was too quick for herdiscovered her sir and as the saying is gave her the slip  in what part of the grounds did this happen  the servant pointed in the direction of the side hall in that part sir either in the dutch garden or the shrubbery i am not sure which  it was plain by this time that the mans information was too imperfect to be practically of any use julian asked if the lodgekeepers wife was in the house  no sir her husband has gone out to search the grounds in her place and she is minding the gate they sent their boy with the message from what i can make out from the lad they would be thankful if they could get a word more of advice from you sir  julian reflected for a moment  so far as he could estimate them the probabilities were that the stranger from mannheim had already made her way into the house that she had been listening in the billiardroom that she had found time enough to escape him on his approaching to open the door and that she was now in the servants phrase somewhere in the grounds after eluding the pursuit of the lodgekeepers wife  the matter was serious any mistake in dealing with it might lead to very painful results  if julian had correctly anticipated the nature of the confession which mercy had been on the point of addressing to him the person whom he had been the means of introducing into the house waswhat she had vainly asserted herself to beno other than the true grace roseberry  taking this for granted it was of the utmost importance that he should speak to grace privately before she committed herself to any rashly renewed assertion of her claims and before she could gain access to lady janets adopted daughter the landlady at her lodgings had already warned him that the object which she held steadily in view was to find her way to miss roseberry when lady janet was not present to take her part and when no gentleman were at hand to protect her only let me meet her face to face she had said and i will make her confess herself the impostor that she is as matters now stood it was impossible to estimate too seriously the mischief which might ensue from such a meeting as this everything now depended on julians skillful management of an exasperated woman and nobody at that moment knew where the woman was  in this position of affairs as julian understood it there seemed to be no other alternative than to make his inquiries instantly at the lodge and then to direct the search in person  he looked toward mercys chair as he arrived at this resolution it was at a cruel sacrifice of his own anxieties and his own wishes that he deferred continuing the conversation with her from the critical point at which lady janets appearance had interrupted it  mercy had risen while he had been questioning the servant the attention which she had failed to accord to what had passed between his aunt and himself she had given to the imperfect statement which he had extracted from the man her face plainly showed that she had listened as eagerly as lady janet had listened with this remarkable difference between there that lady janet looked frightened and that lady janets companion showed no signs of alarm she appeared to be interested perhaps anxiousnothing more  julian spoke a parting word to his aunt  pray compose yourself he said i have little doubt when i can learn the particulars that we shall easily find this person in the grounds there is no reason to be uneasy i am going to superintend the search myself i will return to you as soon as possible  lady janet listened absently there was a certain expression in her eyes which suggested to julian that her mind was busy with some project of its own he stopped as he passed mercy on his way out by the billiardroom door it cost him a hard effort to control the contending emotions which the mere act of looking at her now awakened in him his heart beat fast his voice sank low as he spoke to her  you shall see me again he said i never was more in earnest in promising you my truest help and sympathy than i am now  she understood him her bosom heaved painfully her eyes fell to the groundshe made no reply the tears rose in julians eyes as he looked at her he hurriedly left the room  when he turned to close the billiardroom door he heard lady janet say i will be with you again in a moment grace dont go away  interpreting these words as meaning that his aunt had some business of her own to attend to in the library he shut the door he had just advanced into the smokingroom beyond when he thought he heard the door open again he turned round lady janet had followed him  do you wish to speak to me he asked  i want something of you lady janet answered before you go  what is it  your card  my card  you have just told me not to be uneasy said the old lady i am uneasy for all that i dont feel as sure as you do that this woman really is in the grounds she may be lurking somewhere in the house and she may appear when your back in turned remember what you told me  julian understood the allusion he made no reply  the people at the police station close by pursued lady janet have instructions to send an experienced man in plain clothes to any address indicated on your card the moment they receive it that is what you told me for graces protection i want your card before you leave us  it was impossible for julian to mention the reasons which now forbade him to make use of his own precautionsin the very face of the emergency which they had been especially intended to meet how could he declare the true grace roseberry to be mad how could he give the true grace roseberry into custody on the other hand he had personally pledged himself when the circumstances appeared to require it to place the means of legal protection from insult and annoyance at his aunts disposal and now there stood lady janet unaccustomed to have her wishes disregarded by anybody with her band extended waiting for the card  what was to be done the one way out of the difficulty appeared to be to submit for the moment if he succeeded in discovering the missing woman he could easily take care that she should be subjected to no needless indignity if she contrived to slip into the house in his absence he could provide against that contingency by sending a second card privately to the police station forbidding the officer to stir in the affair until he had received further orders julian made one stipulation only before he handed his card to his aunt  you will not use this i am sure without positive and pressing necessity he said but i must make one condition promise me to keep my plan for communicating with the police a strict secret  a strict secret from grace interposed lady janet julian bowed do you suppose i want to frighten her do you think i have not had anxiety enough about her already of course i shall keep it a secret from grace  reassured on this point julian hastened out into the grounds as soon as his back was turned lady janet lifted the gold pencilcase which hung at her watchchain and wrote on her nephews card for the information of the officer in plain clothes you are wanted at mablethorpe house this done she put the card into the oldfashioned pocket of her dress and returned to the diningroom    grace was waiting in obedience to the instructions which she had received  for the first moment or two not a word was spoken on either side now that she was alone with her adopted daughter a certain coldness and hardness began to show itself in lady janets manner the discovery that she had made on opening the drawingroom door still hung on her mind julian had certainly convinced her that she had misinterpreted what she had seen but he had convinced her against her will she had found mercy deeply agitated suspiciously silent julian might be innocent she admittedthere was no accounting for the vagaries of men but the case of mercy was altogether different women did not find themselves in the arms of men without knowing what they were about acquitting julian lady janet declined to acquit mercy there is some secret understanding between them thought the old lady and shes to blame the women always are  mercy still waited to be spoken to pale and quiet silent and submissive lady janetin a highly uncertain state of temperwas obliged to begin  my dear she called out sharply  yes lady janet  how much longer are you going to sit there with your mouth shut up and your eyes on the carpet have you no opinion to offer on this alarming state of things you heard what the man said to juliani saw you listening are you horribly frightened  no lady janet  not even nervous  no lady janet  ha i should hardly have given you credit for so much courage after my experience of you a week ago i congratulate you on your recovery  thank you lady janet  i am not so composed as you are we were an excitable set in my youthand i havent got the better of it yet i feel nervous do you hear i feel nervous  i am sorry lady janet  you are very good do you know what i am going to do  no lady janet  i am going to summon the household when i say the household i mean the men the women are no use i am afraid i fail to attract your attention  you have my best attention lady janet  you are very good again i said the women were of no use  yes lady janet  i mean to place a manservant on guard at every entrance to the house i am going to do it at once will you come with me  can i be of any use if i go with your ladyship  you cant be of the slightest use i give the orders in this housenot you i had quite another motive in asking you to come with me i am more considerate of you than you seem to thinki dont like leaving you here by yourself do you understand  i am much obliged to your ladyship i dont mind being left here by myself  you dont mind i never heard of such heroism in my lifeout of a novel suppose that crazy wretch should find her way in here  she would not frighten me this time as she frightened me before  not too fast my young lady supposegood heavens now i think of it there is the conservatory suppose she should be hidden in there julian is searching the grounds who is to search the conservatory  with your ladyships permission i will search the conservatory  you  with your ladyships permission  i can hardly believe my own ears well live and learn is an old proverb i thought i knew your character this is a change  you forget lady janet if i may venture to say so that the circumstances are changed she took me by surprise on the last occasion i am prepared for her now  do you really feel as coolly as you speak  yes lady janet  have your own way then i shall do one thing however in case of your having overestimated your own courage i shall place one of the men in the library you will only have to ring for him if anything happens he will give the alarmand i shall act accordingly i have my plan said her ladyship comfortably conscious of the card in her pocket dont look as if you wanted to know what it is i have no intention of saying anything about itexcept that it will do once more and for the last timedo you stay here or do you go with me  i stay here  she respectfully opened the library door for lady janets departure as she made that reply throughout the interview she had been carefully and coldly deferential she had not once lifted her eyes to lady janets face the conviction in her that a few hours more would in all probability see her dismissed from the house had of necessity fettered every word that she spokehad morally separated her already from the injured mistress whose love she had won in disguise utterly incapable of attributing the change in her young companion to the true motive lady janet left the room to summon her domestic garrison thoroughly puzzled and as a necessary consequence of that condition thoroughly displeased  still holding the library door in her hand mercy stood watching with a heavy heart the progress of her benefactress down the length of the room on the way to the front hall beyond she had honestly loved and respected the warmhearted quicktempered old lady a sharp pang of pain wrung her as she thought of the time when even the chance utterance of her name would become an unpardonable offense in lady janets house  but there was no shrinking in her now from the ordeal of the confession she was not only anxiousshe was impatient for julians return before she slept that night julians confidence in her should be a confidence that she had deserved  let her own the truth without the base fear of discovery to drive her to it let her do justice to the woman whom she has wronged while that woman is still powerless to expose her let her sacrifice everything that she has gained by the fraud to the sacred duty of atonement if she can do that then her repentance has nobly revealed the noble nature that is in her then she is a woman to be trusted respected beloved those words were as vividly present to her as if she still heard them falling from his lips those other words which had followed them rang as grandly as ever in her ears rise poor wounded heart beautiful purified soul gods angels rejoice over you take your place among the noblest of gods creatures did the woman live who could hear julian gray say that and who could hesitate at any sacrifice at any loss to justify his belief in her oh she thought longingly while her eyes followed lady janet to the end of the library if your worst fears could only be realized if i could only see grace roseberry in this room how fearlessly i could meet her now  she closed the library door while lady janet opened the other door which led into the hall  as she turned and looked back into the diningroom a cry of astonishment escaped her  thereas if in answer to the aspiration which was still in her mind there established in triumph on the chair that she had just leftsat grace roseberry in sinister silence waiting for her    chapter xix the evil genius  recovering from the first overpowering sensation of surprise mercy rapidly advanced eager to say her first penitent words grace stopped her by a warning gesture of the hand no nearer to me she said with a look of contemptuous command stay where you are  mercy paused graces reception had startled her she instinctively took the chair nearest to her to support herself grace raised a warning hand for the second time and issued another command i forbid you to be seated in my presence you have no right to be in this house at all remember if you please who you are and who i am  the tone in which those words were spoken was an insult in itself mercy suddenly lifted her head the angry answer was on her lips she checked it and submitted in silence i will be worthy of julian grays confidence in me she thought as she stood patiently by the chair i will bear anything from the woman whom i have wronged  in silence the two faced each other alone together for the first time since they had met in the french cottage the contrast between them was strange to see grace roseberry seated in her chair little and lean with her dull white complexion with her hard threatening face with her shrunken figure clad in its plain and poor black garments looked like a being of a lower sphere compared with mercy merrick standing erect in her rich silken dress her tall shapely figure towering over the little creature before her her grand head bent in graceful submission gentle patient beautiful a woman whom it was a privilege to look at and a distinction to admire if a stranger had been told that those two had played their parts in a romance of real lifethat one of them was really connected by the ties of relationship with lady janet roy and that the other had successfully attempted to personate herhe would inevitably if it had been left to him to guess which was which have picked out grace as the counterfeit and mercy as the true woman  grace broke the silence she had waited to open her lips until she had eyed her conquered victim all over with disdainfully minute attention from head to foot  stand there i like to look at you she said speaking with a spiteful relish of her own cruel words its no use fainting this time you have not got lady janet roy to bring you to there are no gentlemen here today to pity you and pick you up mercy merrick i have got you at last thank god my turn has come you cant escape me now  all the littleness of heart and mind which had first shown itself in grace at the meeting in the cottage when mercy told the sad story of her life now revealed itself once more the woman who in those past times had felt no impulse to take a suffering and a penitent fellowcreature by the hand was the same woman who could feel no pity who could spare no insolence of triumph now mercys sweet voice answered her patiently in low pleading tones  i have not avoided you she said i would have gone to you of my own accord if i had known that you were here it is my heartfelt wish to own that i have sinned against you and to make all the atonement that i can i am too anxious to deserve your forgiveness to have any fear of seeing you  conciliatory as the reply was it was spoken with a simple and modest dignity of manner which roused grace roseberry to fury  how dare you speak to me as if you were any equal she burst out you stand there and answer me as if you had your right and your place in this house you audacious woman i have my right and my place hereand what am i obliged to do i am obliged to hang about in the grounds and fly from the sight of the servants and hide like a thief and wait like a beggar and all for what for the chance of having a word with you yes you madam with the air of the refuge and the dirt of the streets on you  mercys head sank lower her hand trembled as it held by the back of the chair  it was hard to bear the reiterated insults heaped on her but julians influence still made itself felt she answered as patiently as ever  if it is your pleasure to use hard words to me she said i have no right to resent them  you have no right to anything grace retorted you have no right to the gown on your back look at yourself and look at me her eyes traveled with a tigerish stare over mercys costly silk dress who gave you that dress who gave you those jewels i know lady janet gave them to grace roseberry are you grace roseberry that dress is mine take off your bracelets and your brooch they were meant for me  you may soon have them miss roseberry they will not be in my possession many hours longer  what do you mean  however badly you may use me it is my duty to undo the harm that i have done i am bound to do you justicei am determined to confess the truth  grace smiled scornfully  you confess she said do you think i am fool enough to believe that you are one shameful brazen lie from head to foot are you the woman to give up your silks and your jewels and your position in this house and to go back to the refuge of your own accord not younot you  a first faint flush of color showed itself stealing slowly over mercys face but she still held resolutely by the good influence which julian had left behind him she could still say to herself anything rather than disappoint julian gray sustained by the courage which he had called to life in her she submitted to her martyrdom as bravely as ever but there was an ominous change in her now she could only submit in silence she could no longer trust herself to answer  the mute endurance in her face additionally exasperated grace roseberry  you wont confess she went on you have had a week to confess in and you have not done it yet no no you are of the sort that cheat and lie to the last i am glad of it i shall have the joy of exposing you myself before the whole house i shall be the blessed means of casting you back on the streets oh it will be almost worth all i have gone through to see you with a policemans hand on your arm and the mob pointing at you and mocking you on your way to jail  this time the sting struck deep the outrage was beyond endurance mercy gave the woman who had again and again deliberately insulted her a first warning  miss roseberry she said i have borne without a murmur the bitterest words you could say to me spare me any more insults indeed indeed i am eager to restore you to your just rights with my whole heart i say it to youi am resolved to confess everything  she spoke with trembling earnestness of tone grace listened with a hard smile of incredulity and a hard look of contempt  you are not far from the bell she said ring it  mercy looked at her in speechless surprise  you are a perfect picture of repentanceyou are dying to own the truth pursued the other satirically own it before everybody and own it at once call in lady janetcall in mr gray and mr holmcroftcall in the servants go down on your knees and acknowledge yourself an impostor before them all then i will believe younot before  dont dont turn me against you cried mercy entreatingly  what do i care whether you are against me or not  dontfor your own sake dont go on provoking me much longer  for my own sake you insolent creature do you mean to threaten me  with a last desperate effort her heart beating faster and faster the blood burning hotter and hotter in her cheeks mercy still controlled herself  have some compassion on me she pleaded badly as i have behaved to you i am still a woman like yourself i cant face the shame of acknowledging what i have done before the whole house lady janet treats me like a daughter mr holmcroft has engaged himself to marry me i cant tell lady janet and mr holmcroft to their faces that i have cheated them out of their love but they shall know it for all that i can and will before i rest tonight tell the whole truth to mr julian gray  grace burst out laughing aha she exclaimed with a cynical outburst of gayety now we have come to it at last  take care said mercy take care  mr julian gray i was behind the billiardroom doori saw you coax mr julian gray to come in confession loses all its horrors and becomes quite a luxury with mr julian gray  no more miss roseberry no more for gods sake dont put me beside myself you have tortured me enough already  you havent been on the streets for nothing you are a woman with resources you know the value of having two strings to your bow if mr holmcroft fails you you have got mr julian gray ah you sicken me ill see that mr holmcrofts eyes are opened he shall know what a woman he might have married but for me  she checked herself the next refinement of insult remained suspended on her lips  the woman whom she had outraged suddenly advanced on her her eyes staring helplessly upward saw mercy merricks face white with the terrible anger which drives the blood back on the heart bending threateningly over her  you will see that mr holmcrofts eyes are opened mercy slowly repeated he shall know what a woman he might have married but for you  she paused and followed those words by a question which struck a creeping terror through grace roseberry from the hair of her head to the soles of her feet  who are you  the suppressed fury of look and tone which accompanied that question told as no violence could have told it that the limits of mercys endurance had been found at last in the guardian angels absence the evil genius had done its evil work the better nature which julian gray had brought to life sank poisoned by the vile venom of a womanly spiteful tongue an easy and a terrible means of avenging the outrages heaped on her was within mercys reach if she chose to take it in the frenzy of her indignation she never hesitatedshe took it  who are you she asked for the second time  grace roused herself and attempted to speak mercy stopped her with a scornful gesture of her hand  i remember she went on with the same fiercely suppressed rage you are the madwoman from the german hospital who came here a week ago i am not afraid of you this time sit down and rest yourself mercy merrick  deliberately giving her that name to her face mercy turned from her and took the chair which grace had forbidden her to occupy when the interview began grace started to her feet  what does this mean she asked  it means answered mercy contemptuously that i recall every word i said to you just now it means that i am resolved to keep my place in this house  are you out of your senses  you are not far from the bell ring it do what you asked me to do call in the whole household and ask them which of us is madyou or i  mercy merrick you shall repent this to the last hour of your life  mercy rose again and fixed her flashing eyes on the woman who still defied her  i have had enough of you she said leave the house while you can leave it stay here and i will send for lady janet roy  you cant send for her you darent send for her  i can and i dare you have not a shadow of a proof against me i have got the papers i am in possession of the place i have established myself in lady janets confidence i mean to deserve your opinion of mei will keep my dresses and my jewels and my position in the house i deny that i have done wrong society has used me cruelly i owe nothing to society i have a right to take any advantage of it if i can i deny that i have injured you how was i to know that you would come to life again have i degraded your name and your character i have done honor to both i have won everybodys liking and everybodys respect do you think lady janet would have loved you as she loves me not she i tell you to your face i have filled the false position more creditably than you could have filled the true one and i mean to keep it i wont give up your name i wont restore your character do your worst i defy you  she poured out those reckless words in one headlong flow which defied interruption there was no answering her until she was too breathless to say more grace seized her opportunity the moment it was within her reach  you defy me she returned resolutely you wont defy me long i have written to canada my friends will speak for me  what of it if they do your friends are strangers here i am lady janets adopted daughter do you think she will believe your friends she will believe me she will burn their letters if they write she will forbid the house to them if they come i shall be mrs horace holmcroft in a weeks time who can shake my position who can injure me  wait a little you forget the matron at the refuge  find her if you can i never told you her name i never told you where the refuge was  i will advertise your name and find the matron in that way  advertise in every newspaper in london do you think i gave a stranger like you the name i really bore in the refuge i gave you the name i assumed when i left england no such person as mercy merrick is known to the matron no such person is known to mr holmcroft he saw me at the french cottage while you were senseless on the bed i had my gray cloak on neither he nor any of them saw me in my nurses dress inquiries have been made about me on the continentand i happen to know from the person who made them with no result i am safe in your place i am known by your name i am grace roseberry and you are mercy merrick disprove it if you can  summing up the unassailable security of her false position in those closing words mercy pointed significantly to the billiardroom door  you were hiding there by your own confession she said you know your way out by that door will you leave the room  i wont stir a step  mercy walked to a sidetable and struck the bell placed on it  at the same moment the billiardroom door opened julian gray appearedreturning from his unsuccessful search in the grounds  he had barely crossed the threshold before the library door was thrown open next by the servant posted in the room the man drew back respectfully and gave admission to lady janet roy she was followed by horace holmcroft with his mothers wedding present to mercy in his hand    chapter xx the policeman in plain clothes  julian looked round the room and stopped at the door which he had just opened  his eyes rested first on mercy next on grace  the disturbed faces of both the women told him but too plainly that the disaster which he had dreaded had actually happened they had met without any third person to interfere between them to what extremities the hostile interview might have led it was impossible for him to guess in his aunts presence he could only wait his opportunity of speaking to mercy and be ready to interpose if anything was ignorantly done which might give just cause of offense to grace  lady janets course of action on entering the diningroom was in perfect harmony with lady janets character  instantly discovering the intruder she looked sharply at mercy what did i tell you she asked are you frightened no not in the least frightened wonderful she turned to the servant wait in the library i may want you again she looked at julian leave it all to me i can manage it she made a sign to horace stay where you are and hold your tongue having now said all that was necessary to every one else she advanced to the part of the room in which grace was standing with lowering brows and firmly shut lips defiant of everybody  i have no desire to offend you or to act harshly toward you her ladyship began very quietly i only suggest that your visits to my house cannot possibly lead to any satisfactory result i hope you will not oblige me to say any harder words than thesei hope you will understand that i wish you to withdraw  the order of dismissal could hardly have been issued with more humane consideration for the supposed mental infirmity of the person to whom it was addressed grace instantly resisted it in the plainest possible terms  in justice to my fathers memory and in justice to myself she answered i insist on a hearing i refuse to withdraw she deliberately took a chair and seated herself in the presence of the mistress of the house  lady janet waited a momentsteadily controlling her temper in the interval of silence julian seized the opportunity of remonstrating with grace  is this what you promised me he asked gently you gave me your word that you would not return to mablethorpe house  before he could say more lady janet had got her temper under command she began her answer to grace by pointing with a peremptory forefinger to the library door  if you have not made up your mind to take my advice by the time i have walked back to that door she said i will put it out of your power to set me at defiance i am used to be obeyed and i will be obeyed you force me to use hard words i warn you before it is too late go  she returned slowly toward the library julian attempted to interfere with another word of remonstrance his aunt stopped him by a gesture which said plainly i insist on acting for myself he looked next at mercy would she remain passive yes she never lifted her head she never moved from the place in which she was standing apart from the rest horace himself tried to attract her attention and tried in vain  arrived at the library door lady janet looked over her shoulder at the little immovable black figure in the chair  will you go she asked for the last time  grace started up angrily from her seat and fixed her viperish eyes on mercy  i wont be turned out of your ladyships house in the presence of that impostor she said i may yield to force but i will yield to nothing else i insist on my right to the place that she has stolen from me its no use scolding me she added turning doggedly to julian as long as that woman is here under my name i cant and wont keep away from the house i warn her in your presence that i have written to my friends in canada i dare her before you all to deny that she is the outcast and adventuress mercy merrick  the challenge forced mercy to take part in the proceedings in her own defense she had pledged herself to meet and defy grace roseberry on her own ground she attempted to speakhorace stopped her  you degrade yourself if you answer her he said take my arm and let us leave the room  yes take her out cried grace she may well be ashamed to face an honest woman its her place to leave the roomnot mine  mercy drew her hand out of horaces arm i decline to leave the room she said quietly  horace still tried to persuade her to withdraw i cant bear to hear you insulted he rejoined the woman offends me though i know she is not responsible for what she says  nobodys endurance will be tried much longer said lady janet she glanced at julian and taking from her pocket the card which he had given to her opened the library door  go to the police station she said to the servant in an undertone and give that card to the inspector on duty tell him there is not a moment to lose  stop said julian before his aunt could close the door again  stop repeated lady janet sharply i have given the man his orders what do you mean  before you send the card i wish to say a word in private to this lady replied julian indicating grace when that is done he continued approaching mercy and pointedly addressing himself to her i shall have a request to makei shall ask you to give me an opportunity of speaking to you without interruption  his tone pointed the allusion mercy shrank from looking at him the signs of painful agitation began to show themselves in her shifting color and her uneasy silence roused by julians significantly distant reference to what had passed between them her better impulses were struggling already to recover their influence over her she might at that critical moment have yielded to the promptings of her own nobler natureshe might have risen superior to the galling remembrance of the insults that had been heaped upon herif graces malice had not seen in her hesitation a means of referring offensively once again to her interview with julian gray  pray dont think twice about trusting him alone with me she said with a sardonic affectation of politeness i am not interested in making a conquest of mr julian gray  the jealous distrust in horace already awakened by julians request now attempted to assert itself openly before he could speak mercys indignation had dictated mercys answer  i am much obliged to you mr gray she said addressing julian but still not raising her eyes to his i have nothing more to say there is no need for me to trouble you again  in those rash words she recalled the confession to which she stood pledged in those rash words she committed herself to keeping the position that she had usurped in the face of the woman whom she had deprived of it  horace was silenced but not satisfied he saw julians eyes fixed in sad and searching attention on mercys face while she was speaking he heard julian sigh to himself when she had done he observed julianafter a moments serious consideration and a moments glance backward at the stranger in the poor black clotheslift his head with the air of a man who had taken a sudden resolution  bring me that card directly he said to the servant his tone announced that he was not to be trifled with the man obeyed  without answering lady janetwho still peremptorily insisted on her right to act for herselfjulian took the pencil from his pocketbook and added his signature to the writing already inscribed on the card when he had handed it back to the servant he made his apologies to his aunt  pardon me for venturing to interfere he said there is a serious reason for what i have done which i will explain to you at a fitter time in the meanwhile i offer no further obstruction to the course which you propose taking on the contrary i have just assisted you in gaining the end that you have in view  as he said that he held up the pencil with which he had signed his name  lady janet naturally perplexed and with some reason perhaps offended as well made no answer she waved her hand to the servant and sent him away with the card  there was silence in the room the eyes of all the persons present turned more or less anxiously on julian mercy was vaguely surprised and alarmed horace like lady janet felt offended without clearly knowing why even grace roseberry herself was subdued by her own presentiment of some coming interference for which she was completely unprepared julians words and actions from the moment when he had written on the card were involved in a mystery to which not one of the persons round him held the clew    the motive which had animated his conduct may nevertheless be described in two words julian still held to his faith in the inbred nobility of mercys nature  he had inferred with little difficulty from the language which grace had used toward mercy in his presence that the injured woman must have taken pitiless advantage of her position at the interview which he had interrupted instead of appealing to mercys sympathies and mercys sense of rightinstead of accepting the expression of her sincere contrition and encouraging her to make the completest and the speediest atonementgrace had evidently outraged and insulted her as a necessary result her endurance had given wayunder her own sense of intolerable severity and intolerable wrong  the remedy for the mischief thus done was as julian had first seen it to speak privately with grace to soothe her by owning that his opinion of the justice of her claims had undergone a change in her favor and then to persuade her in her own interests to let him carry to mercy such expressions of apology and regret as might lead to a friendly understanding between them  with those motives he had made his request to be permitted to speak separately to the one and the other the scene that had followed the new insult offered by grace and the answer which it had wrung from mercy had convinced him that no such interference as he had contemplated would have the slightest prospect of success  the only remedy now left to try was the desperate remedy of letting things take their course and trusting implicitly to mercys better nature for the result  let her see the police officer in plain clothes enter the room let her understand clearly what the result of his interference would be let her confront the alternative of consigning grace roseberry to a madhouse or of confessing the truthand what would happen if julians confidence in her was a confidence soundly placed she would nobly pardon the outrages that had been heaped upon her and she would do justice to the woman whom she had wronged  if on the other hand his belief in her was nothing better than the blind belief of an infatuated manif she faced the alternative and persisted in asserting her assumed identitywhat then  julians faith in mercy refused to let that darker side of the question find a place in his thoughts it rested entirely with him to bring the officer into the house he had prevented lady janet from making any mischievous use of his card by sending to the police station and warning them to attend to no message which they might receive unless the card produced bore his signature knowing the responsibility that he was taking on himselfknowing that mercy had made no confession to him to which it was possible to appealhe had signed his name without an instants hesitation and there he stood now looking at the woman whose better nature he was determined to vindicate the only calm person in the room  horaces jealousy saw something suspiciously suggestive of a private understanding in julians earnest attention and in mercys downcast face having no excuse for open interference he made an effort to part them  you spoke just now he said to julian of wishing to say a word in private to that person he pointed to grace shall we retire or will you take her into the library  i refuse to have anything to say to him grace burst out before julian could answer i happen to know that he is the last person to do me justice he has been effectually hoodwinked if i speak to anybody privately it ought to be to you you have the greatest interest of any of them in finding out the truth  what do you mean  do you want to marry an outcast from the streets  horace took one step forward toward her there was a look in his face which plainly betrayed that he was capable of turning her out of the house with his own hands lady janet stopped him  you were right in suggesting just now that grace had better leave the room she said let us all three go julian will remain here and give the man his directions when he arrives come  no by a strange contradiction it was horace himself who now interfered to prevent mercy from leaving the room in the heat of his indignation he lost all sense of his own dignity he descended to the level of a woman whose intellect he believed to be deranged to the surprise of every one present he stepped back and took from the table a jewelcase which he had placed there when he came into the room it was the wedding present from his mother which he had brought to his betrothed wife his outraged selfesteem seized the opportunity of vindicating mercy by a public bestowal of the gift  wait he called out sternly that wretch shall have her answer she has sense enough to see and sense enough to hear let her see and hear  he opened the jewelcase and took from it a magnificent pearl necklace in an antique setting  grace he said with his highest distinction of manner my mother sends you her love and her congratulations on our approaching marriage she begs you to accept as part of your bridal dress these pearls she was married in them herself they have been in our family for centuries as one of the family honored and beloved my mother offers them to my wife  he lifted the necklace to clasp it round mercys neck  julian watched her in breathless suspense would she sustain the ordeal through which horace had innocently condemned her to pass  yes in the insolent presence of grace roseberry what was there now that she could not sustain her pride was in arms her lovely eyes lighted up as only a womans eyes can light up when they see jewelry her grand head bent gracefully to receive the necklace her face w armed into color her beauty rallied its charms her triumph over grace roseberry was complete julians head sank for one sad moment he secretly asked himself the question have i been mistaken in her  horace arrayed her in the pearls  your husband puts these pearls on your neck love he said proudly and paused to look at her now he added with a contemptuous backward glance at grace we may go into the library she has seen and she has heard  he believed that he had silenced her he had simply furnished her sharp tongue with a new sting  you will hear and you will see when my proofs come from canada she retorted you will hear that your wife has stolen my name and my character you will see your wife dismissed from this house  mercy turned on her with an uncontrollable outburst of passion  you are mad she cried  lady janet caught the electric infection of anger in the air of the room she too turned on grace she too said it  you are mad  horace followed lady janet he was beside himself he fixed his pitiless eyes on grace and echoed the contagious words  you are mad  she was silenced she was daunted at last the treble accusation revealed to her for the first time the frightful suspicion to which she had exposed herself she shrank back with a low cry of horror and struck against a chair she would have fallen if julian had not sprung forward and caught her  lady janet led the way into the library she opened the doorstartedand suddenly stepped aside so as to leave the entrance free  a man appeared in the open doorway  he was not a gentleman he was not a workman he was not a servant he was vilely dressed in glossy black broadcloth his frockcoat hung on him instead of fitting him his waistcoat was too short and too tight over the chest his trousers were a pair of shapeless black bags his gloves were too large for him his highlypolished boots creaked detestably whenever he moved he had odiously watchful eyeseyes that looked skilled in peeping through keyholes his large ears set forward like the ears of a monkey pleaded guilty to meanly listening behind other peoples doors his manner was quietly confidential when he spoke impenetrably selfpossessed when he was silent a lurking air of secret service enveloped the fellow like an atmosphere of his own from head to foot he looked all round the magnificent room without betraying either surprise or admiration he closely investigated every person in it with one glance of his cunningly watchful eyes making his bow to lady janet he silently showed her as his introduction the card that had summoned him and then he stood at ease selfrevealed in his own sinister identitya police officer in plain clothes  nobody spoke to him everybody shrank inwardly as if a reptile had crawled into the room  he looked backward and forward perfectly unembarrassed between julian and horace  is mr julian gray here he asked  julian led grace to a seat her eyes were fixed on the man she trembledshe whispered who is he julian spoke to the police officer without answering her  wait there he said pointing to a chair in the most distant corner of the room i will speak to you directly  the man advanced to the chair marching to the discord of his creaking boots he privately valued the carpet at so much a yard as he walked over it he privately valued the chair at so much the dozen as he sat down on it he was quite at his ease it was no matter to him whether he waited and did nothing or whether he pried into the private character of every one in the room as long as he was paid for it  even lady janets resolution to act for herself was not proof against the appearance of the policeman in plain clothes she left it to her nephew to take the lead julian glanced at mercy before he stirred further in the matter he alone knew that the end rested now not with him but with her  she felt his eye on her while her own eyes were looking at the man she turned her headhesitatedand suddenly approached julian like grace roseberry she was trembling like grace roseberry she whispered who is he  julian told her plainly who he was  why is he here  cant you guess  no  horace left lady janet and joined mercy and julianimpatient of the private colloquy between them  am i in the way he inquired  julian drew back a little understanding horace perfectly he looked round at grace nearly the whole length of the spacious room divided them from the place in which she was sitting she had never moved since he had placed her in a chair the direst of all terrors was in possession of herterror of the unknown there was no fear of her interfering and no fear of her hearing what they said so long as they were careful to speak in guarded tones julian set the example by lowering his voice  ask horace why the police officer is here he said to mercy  she put the question directly why is he here  horace looked across the room at grace and answered he is here to relieve us of that woman  do you mean that he will take her away  yes  where will he take her to  to the police station  mercy started and looked at julian he was still watching the slightest changes in her face she looked back again at horace  to the police station she repeated what for  how can you ask the question said horace irritably to be placed under restraint of course  do you mean prison  i mean an asylum  again mercy turned to julian there was horror now as well as surprise in her face oh she said to him horace is surely wrong it cant be  julian left it to horace to answer every facility in him seemed to be still absorbed in watching mercys face she was compelled to address herself to horace once more  what sort of asylum she asked you dont surely mean a madhouse  i do he rejoined the workhouse first perhapsand then the madhouse what is there to surprise you in that you yourself told her to her face she was mad good heavens how pale you are what is the matter  she turned to julian for the third time the terrible alternative that was offered to her had showed itself at last without reserve or disguise restore the identity that you have stolen or shut her up in a madhouseit rests with you to choose in that form the situation shaped itself in her mind she chose on the instant before she opened her lips the higher nature in her spoke to julian in her eyes the steady inner light that he had seen in them once already shone in them again brighter and purer than before the conscience that he had fortified the soul that he had saved looked at him and said doubt us no more  send that man out of the house  those were her first words she spoke pointing to the police officer in clear ringing resolute tones audible in the remotest corner of the room  julians hand stole unobserved to hers and told her in its momentary pressure to count on his brotherly sympathy and help all the other persons in the room looked at her in speechless surprise grace rose from her chair even the man in plain clothes started to his feet lady janet hurriedly joining horace and fully sharing his perplexity and alarm took mercy impulsively by the arm and shook it as if to rouse her to a sense of what she was doing mercy held firm mercy resolutely repeated what she had said send that man out of the house  lady janet lost all her patience with her what has come to you she asked sternly do you know what you are saying the man is here in your interest as well as in mine the man is here to spare you as well as me further annoyance and insult and you insistinsist in my presenceon his being sent away what does it mean  you shall know what it means lady janet in half an hour i dont insisti only reiterate my entreaty let the man be sent away  julian stepped aside with his aunts eyes angrily following him and spoke to the police officer go back to the station he said and wait there till you hear from me  the meanly vigilant eyes of the man in plain clothes traveled sidelong from julian to mercy and valued her beauty as they had valued the carpet and the chairs the old story he thought the nicelooking woman is always at the bottom of it and sooner or later the nicelooking woman has her way he marched back across the room to the discord of his own creaking boots bowed with a villainous smile which put the worst construction on everything and vanished through the library door  lady janets high breeding restrained her from saying anything until the police officer was out of hearing then and not till then she appealed to julian  i presume you are in the secret of this she said i suppose you have some reason for setting my authority at defiance in my own house  i have never yet failed to respect your ladyship julian answered before long you will know that i am not failing in respect toward you now  lady janet looked across the room grace was listening eagerly conscious that events had taken some mysterious turn in her favor within the last minute  is it part of your new arrangement of my affairs her ladyship continued that this person is to remain in the house  the terror that had daunted grace had not lost all hold of her yet she left it to julian to reply before he could speak mercy crossed the room and whispered to her give me time to confess it in writing i cant own it before themwith this round my neck she pointed to the necklace grace cast a threatening glance at her and suddenly looked away again in silence  mercy answered lady janets question i beg your ladyship to permit her to remain until the half hour is over she said my request will have explained itself by that time  lady janet raised no further obstacles for something in mercys face or in mercys tone seemed to have silenced her as it had silenced grace horace was the next who spoke in tones of suppressed rage and suspicion he addressed himself to mercy standing fronting him by julians side  am i included he asked in the arrangement which engages you to explain your extraordinary conduct in half an hour  his hand had placed his mothers wedding present round mercys neck a sharp pang wrung her as she looked at horace and saw how deeply she had already distressed and offended him the tears rose in her eyes she humbly and faintly answered him  if you please was all she could say before the cruel swelling at her heart rose and silenced her  horaces sense of injury refused to be soothed by such simple submission as this  i dislike mysteries and innuendoes he went on harshly in my family circle we are accustomed to meet each other frankly why am i to wait half an hour for an explanation which might be given now what am i to wait for  lady janet recovered herself as horace spoke  i entirely agree with you she said i ask too what are we to wait for  even julians selfpossession failed him when his aunt repeated that cruelly plain question how would mercy answer it would her courage still hold out  you have asked me what you are to wait for she said to horace quietly and firmly wait to hear something more of mercy merrick  lady janet listened with a look of weary disgust  dont return to that she said we know enough about mercy merrick already  pardon meyour ladyship does not know i am the only person who can inform you  you  she bent her head respectfully  i have begged you lady janet to give me half an hour she went on in half an hour i solemnly engage myself to produce mercy merrick in this room lady janet roy mr horace holmcroft you are to wait for that  steadily pledging herself in those terms to make her confession she unclasped the pearls from her neck put them away in their cases and placed it in horaces hand keep it she said with a momentary faltering in her voice until we meet again  horace took the case in silence he looked and acted like a man whose mind was paralyzed by surprise his hand moved mechanically his eyes followed mercy with a vacant questioning look lady janet seemed in her different way to share the strange oppression that had fallen on him a vague sense of dread and distress hung like a cloud over her mind at that memorable moment she felt her age she looked her age as she had never felt it or looked it yet  have i your ladyships leave said mercy respectfully to go to my room  lady janet mutely granted the request mercys last look before she went out was a look at grace are you satisfied now the grand gray eyes seemed to say mournfully grace turned her head aside with a quick petulant action even her narrow nature opened for a moment unwillingly and let pity in a little way in spite of itself  mercys parting words recommended grace to julians care  you will see that she is allowed a room to wait in you will warn her yourself when the half hour has expired  julian opened the library door for her  well done nobly done he whispered all my sympathy is with youall my help is yours  her eyes looked at him and thanked him through her gathering tears his own eyes were dimmed she passed quietly down the room and was lost to him before he had shut the door again    chapter xxi the footstep in the corridor  mercy was alone  she had secured one half hour of retirement in her own room designing to devote that interval to the writing of her confession in the form of a letter addressed to julian gray  no recent change in her position had as yet mitigated her horror of acknowledging to horace and to lady janet that she had won her way to their hearts in disguise through julian only could she say the words which were to establish grace roseberry in her right position in the house  how was her confession to be addressed to him in writing or by word of mouth  after all that had happened from the time when lady janets appearance had interrupted them she would have felt relief rather than embarrassment in personally opening her heart to the man who had so delicately understood her who had so faithfully befriended her in her sorest need but the repeated betrayals of horaces jealous suspicion of julian warned her that she would only be surrounding herself with new difficulties and be placing julian in a position of painful embarrassment if she admitted him to a private interview while horace was in the house  the one course left to take was the course that she had adopted determining to address the narrative of the fraud to julian in the form of a letter she arranged to add at the close certain instructions pointing out to him the line of conduct which she wished him to pursue  these instructions contemplated the communication of her letter to lady janet and to horace in the library while mercyselfconfessed as the missing woman whom she had pledged herself to produceawaited in the adjoining room whatever sentence it pleased them to pronounce on her her resolution not to screen herself behind julian from any consequences which might follow the confession had taken root in her mind from the moment when horace had harshly asked her and when lady janet had joined him in asking why she delayed her explanation and what she was keeping them waiting for out of the very pain which those questions inflicted the idea of waiting her sentence in her own person in one room while her letter to julian was speaking for her in another had sprung to life let them break my heart if they like she had thought to herself in the selfabasement of that bitter moment it will be no more than i have deserved    she locked her door and opened her writingdesk knowing what she had to do she tried to collect herself and do it  the effort was in vain those persons who study writing as an art are probably the only persons who can measure the vast distance which separates a conception as it exists in the mind from the reduction of that conception to form and shape in words the heavy stress of agitation that had been laid on mercy for hours together had utterly unfitted her for the delicate and difficult process of arranging the events of a narrative in their due sequence and their due proportion toward each other again and again she tried to begin her letter and again and again she was baffled by the same hopeless confusion of ideas she gave up the struggle in despair  a sense of sinking at her heart a weight of hysterical oppression on her bosom warned her not to leave herself unoccupied a prey to morbid selfinvestigation and imaginary alarms  she turned instinctively for a temporary employment of some kind to the consideration of her own future here there were no intricacies or entanglements the prospect began and ended with her return to the refuge if the matron would receive her she did no injustice to julian gray that great heart would feel for her that kind hand would be held out to her she knew but what would happen if she thoughtlessly accepted all that his sympathy might offer scandal would point to her beauty and to his youth and would place its own vile interpretation on the purest friendship that could exist between them and he would be the sufferer for he had a charactera clergymans characterto lose no for his sake out of gratitude to him the farewell to mablethorpe house must be also the farewell to julian gray  the precious minutes were passing she resolved to write to the matron and ask if she might hope to be forgiven and employed at the refuge again occupation over the letter that was easy to write might have its fortifying effect on her mind and might pave the way for resuming the letter that was hard to write she waited a moment at the window thinking of the past life to which she was soon to return before she took up the pen again  her window looked eastward the dusky glare of lighted london met her as her eyes rested on the sky it seemed to beckon her back to the horror of the cruel streetsto point her way mockingly to the bridges over the black riverto lure her to the top of the parapet and the dreadful leap into gods arms or into annihilationwho knew which  she turned shuddering from the window will it end in that way she asked herself if the matron says no  she began her letter  dear madamso long a time has passed since you heard from me that i almost shrink from writing to you i am afraid you have already given me up in your own mind as a hardhearted ungrateful woman  i have been leading a false life i have not been fit to write to you before today now when i am doing what i can to atone to those whom i have injurednow when i repent with my whole heartmay i ask leave to return to the friend who has borne with me and helped me through many miserable years oh madam do not cast me off i have no one to turn to but you  will you let me own everything to you will you forgive me when you know what i have done will you take me back into the refuge if you have any employment for me by which i may earn my shelter and my bread  before the night comes i must leave the house from which i am now writing i have nowhere to go to the little money the few valuable possessions i have must be left behind me they have been obtained under false pretenses they are not mine no more forlorn creature than i am lives at this moment you are a christian woman not for my sakefor christs sakepity me and take me back  i am a good nurse as you know and i am a quick worker with my needle in one way or the other can you not find occupation for me  i could also teach in a very unpretending way but that is useless who would trust their children to a woman without a character there is no hope for me in this direction and yet i am so fond of children i think i could be not happy again perhaps but content with my lot if i could be associated with them in some way are there not charitable societies which are trying to help and protect destitute children wandering about the streets i think of my own wretched childhoodand oh i should so like to be employed in saving other children from ending as i have ended i could work for such an object as that from morning to night and never feel weary all my heart would be in it and i should have this advantage over happy and prosperous womeni should have nothing else to think of surely they might trust me with the poor little starving wanderers of the streetsif you said a word for me if i am asking too much please forgive me i am so wretched madamso lonely and so weary of my life  there is only one thing more my time here is very short will you please reply to this letter to say yes or no by telegram  the name by which you know me is not the name by which i have been known here i must beg you to address the telegram to the reverend julian gray mablethorpe house kensington he is here and he will show it to me no words of mine can describe what i owe to him he has never despaired of mehe has saved me from myself god bless and reward the kindest truest best man i have ever known  i have no more to say except to ask you to excuse this long letter and to believe me your grateful servant     she signed and inclosed the letter and wrote the address then for the first time an obstacle which she ought to have seen before showed itself standing straight in her way  there was no time to forward her letter in the ordinary manner by post it must be taken to its destination by a private messenger lady janets servants had hitherto been one and all at her disposal could she presume to employ them on her own affairs when she might be dismissed from the house a disgraced woman in half an hours time of the two alternatives it seemed better to take her chance and present herself at the refuge without asking leave first  while she was still considering the question she was startled by a knock at her door on opening it she admitted lady janets maid with a morsel of folded notepaper in her hand  from my lady miss said the woman giving her the note there is no answer  mercy stopped her as she was about to leave the room the appearance of the maid suggested an inquiry to her she asked if any of the servants were likely to be going into town that afternoon  yes miss one of the grooms is going on horseback with a message to her ladyships coachmaker  the refuge was close by the coachmakers place of business under the circumstances mercy was emboldened to make use of the man it was a pardonable liberty to employ his services now  will you kindly give the groom that letter for me she said it will not take him out of his way he has only to deliver itnothing more  the woman willingly complied with the request left once more by herself mercy looked at the little note which had been placed in her hands  it was the first time that her benefactress had employed this formal method of communicating with her when they were both in the house what did such a departure from established habits mean had she received her notice of dismissal had lady janets quick intelligence found its way already to a suspicion of the truth mercys nerves were unstrung she trembled pitiably as she opened the folded note  it began without a form of address and it ended without a signature thus it ran    i must request you to delay for a little while the explanation which you have promised me at my age painful surprises are very trying things i must have time to compose myself before i can hear what you have to say you shall not be kept waiting longer than i can help in the meanwhile everything will go on as usual my nephew julian and horace holmcroft and the lady whom i found in the diningroom will by my desire remain in the house until i am able to meet them and to meet you again    there the note ended to what conclusion did it point  had lady janet really guessed the truth or had she only surmised that her adopted daughter was connected in some discreditable manner with the mystery of mercy merrick the line in which she referred to the intruder in the diningroom as the lady showed very remarkably that her opinions had undergone a change in that quarter but was the phrase enough of itself to justify the inference that she had actually anticipated the nature of mercys confession it was not easy to decide that doubt at the momentand it proved to be equally difficult to throw any light on it at an aftertime to the end of her life lady janet resolutely refused to communicate to any one the conclusions which she might have privately formed the griefs which she might have secretly stifled on that memorable day  amid much however which was beset with uncertainty one thing at least was clear the time at mercys disposal in her own room had been indefinitely prolonged by mercys benefactress hours might pass before the disclosure to which she stood committed would be expected from her in those hours she might surely compose her mind sufficiently to be able to write her letter of confession to julian gray  once more she placed the sheet of paper before her resting her head on her hand as she sat at the table she tried to trace her way through the labyrinth of the past beginning with the day when she had met grace roseberry in the french cottage and ending with the day which had brought them face to face for the second time in the diningroom at mablethorpe house  the chain of events began to unroll itself in her mind clearly link by link  she remarked as she pursued the retrospect how strangely chance or fate had paved the way for the act of personation in the first place  if they had met under ordinary circumstances neither mercy nor grace would have trusted each other with the confidences which had been exchanged between them as the event had happened they had come together under those extraordinary circumstances of common trial and common peril in a strange country which would especially predispose two women of the same nation to open their hearts to each other in no other way could mercy have obtained at a first interview that fatal knowledge of graces position and graces affairs which had placed temptation before her as the necessary consequence that followed the bursting of the german shell  advancing from this point through the succeeding series of events which had so naturally and yet so strangely favored the perpetration of the fraud mercy reached the later period when grace had followed her to england here again she remarked in the second place how chance or fate had once more paved the way for that second meeting which had confronted them with one another at mablethorpe house  she had as she well remembered attended at a certain assembly convened by a charitable society in the character of lady janets representative at lady janets own request for that reason she had been absent from the house when grace had entered it if her return had been delayed by a few minutes only julian would have had time to take grace out of the room and the terrible meeting which had stretched mercy senseless on the floor would never have taken place as the event had happened the period of her absence had been fatally shortened by what appeared at the time to be the commonest possible occurrence the persons assembled at the societys rooms had disagreed so seriously on the business which had brought them together as to render it necessary to take the ordinary course of adjourning the proceedings to a future day and chance or fate had so timed that adjournment as to bring mercy back into the diningroom exactly at the moment when grace roseberry insisted on being confronted with the woman who had taken her place  she had never yet seen the circumstances in this sinister light she was alone in her room at a crisis in her life she was worn and weakened by emotions which had shaken her to the soul  little by little she felt the enervating influences let loose on her in her lonely position by her new train of thought little by little her heart began to sink under the stealthy chill of superstitious dread vaguely horrible presentiments throbbed in her with her pulses flowed through her with her blood mystic oppressions of hidden disaster hovered over her in the atmosphere of the room the cheerful candlelight turned traitor to her and grew dim supernatural murmurs trembled round the house in the moaning of the winter wind she was afraid to look behind her on a sudden she felt her own cold hands covering her face without knowing when she had lifted them to it or why  still helpless under the horror that held her she suddenly heard footstepsa mans footstepsin the corridor outside at other times the sound would have startled her now it broke the spell the footsteps suggested life companionship human interpositionno matter of what sort she mechanically took up her pen she found herself beginning to remember her letter to julian gray  at the same moment the footsteps stopped outside her door the man knocked  she still felt shaken she was hardly mistress of herself yet a faint cry of alarm escaped her at the sound of the knock before it could be repeated she had rallied her courage and had opened the door  the man in the corridor was horace holmcroft  his ruddy complexion had turned pale his hair of which he was especially careful at other times was in disorder the superficial polish of his manner was gone the undisguised man sullen distrustful irritated to the last degree of endurance showed through he looked at her with a watchfully suspicious eye he spoke to her without preface or apology in a coldly angry voice  are you aware he asked of what is going on downstairs  i have not left my room she answered i know that lady janet has deferred the explanation which i had promised to give her and i know no more  has nobody told you what lady janet did after you left us has nobody told you that she politely placed her own boudoir at the disposal of the very woman whom she had ordered half an hour before to leave the house do you really not know that mr julian gray has himself conducted this suddenlyhonored guest to her place of retirement and that i am left alone in the midst of these changes contradictions and mysteriesthe only person who is kept out in the dark  it is surely needless to ask me these questions said mercy gently who could possibly have told me what was going on below stairs before you knocked at my door  he looked at her with an ironical affectation of surprise  you are strangely forgetful today he said surely your friend mr julian gray might have told you i am astonished to hear that he has not had his private interview yet  i dont understand you horace  i dont want you to understand me he retorted irritably the proper person to understand me is julian gray i look to him to account to me for the confidential relations which seem to have been established between you behind my back he has avoided me thus far but i shall find my way to him yet  his manner threatened more than his words expressed in mercys nervous condition at the moment it suggested to her that he might attempt to fasten a quarrel on julian gray  you are entirely mistaken she said warmly you are ungratefully doubting your best and truest friend i say nothing of myself you will soon discover why i patiently submit to suspicions which other women would resent as an insult  let me discover it at once now without wasting a moment more  there had hitherto been some little distance between them mercy had listened waiting on the threshold of her door horace had spoken standing against the opposite wall of the corridor when he said his last words he suddenly stepped forward and with something imperative in the gesture laid his hand on her arm the strong grasp of it almost hurt her she struggled to release herself  let me go she said what do you mean  he dropped her arm as suddenly as he had taken it  you shall know what i mean he replied a woman who has grossly outraged and insulted youwhose only excuse is that she is madis detained in the house at your desire i might almost say at your command when the police officer is waiting to take her away i have a right to know what this means i am engaged to marry you if you wont trust other people you are bound to explain yourself to me i refuse to wait for lady janets convenience i insist if you force me to say soi insist on knowing the real nature of your connection with this affair you have obliged me to follow you here it is my only opportunity of speaking to you you avoid me you shut yourself up from me in your own room i am not your husband yeti have no right to follow you in but there are other rooms open to us the library is at our disposal and i will take care that we are not interrupted i am now going there and i have a last question to ask you are to be my wife in a weeks time will you take me into your confidence or not  to hesitate was in this case literally to be lost mercys sense of justice told her that horace had claimed no more than his due she answered instantly  i will follow you to the library horace in five minutes  her prompt and frank compliance with his wishes surprised and touched him he took her hand  she had endured all that his angry sense of injury could say his gratitude wounded her to the quick the bitterest moment she had felt yet was the moment in which he raised her hand to his lips and murmured tenderly my own true grace she could only sign to him to leave her and hurry back into her own room  her first feeling when she found herself alone again was wonderwonder that it should never have occurred to her until he had himself suggested it that her betrothed husband had the foremost right to her confession her horror at owning to either of them that she had cheated them out of their love had hitherto placed horace and lady janet on the same level she now saw for the first time that there was no comparison between the claims which they respectively had on her she owned an allegiance to horace to which lady janet could assert no right cost her what it might to avow the truth to him with her own lips the cruel sacrifice must be made  without a moments hesitation she put away her writing materials it amazed her that she should ever have thought of using julian gray as an interpreter between the man to whom she was betrothed and herself julians sympathy she thought must have made a strong impression on her indeed to blind her to a duty which was beyond all compromise which admitted of no dispute  she had asked for five minutes of delay before she followed horace it was too long a time  her one chance of finding courage to crush him with the dreadful revelation of who she really was of what she had really done was to plunge headlong into the disclosure without giving herself time to think the shame of it would overpower her if she gave herself time to think  she turned to the door to follow him at once  even at that terrible moment the most ineradicable of all a womans instinctsthe instinct of personal selfrespectbrought her to a pause she had passed through more than one terrible trial since she had dressed to go downstairs remembering this she stopped mechanically retraced her steps and looked at herself in the glass  there was no motive of vanity in what she now did the action was as unconscious as if she had buttoned an unfastened glove or shaken out a crumpled dress not the faintest idea crossed her mind of looking to see if her beauty might still plead for her and of trying to set it off at its best  a momentary smile the most weary the most hopeless that ever saddened a womans face appeared in the reflection which her mirror gave her back haggard ghastly old before my time she said to herself well better so he will feel it lesshe will not regret me  with that thought she went downstairs to meet him in the library    chapter xxii the man in the diningroom  in the great emergencies of life we feel or we act as our dispositions incline us but we never think mercys mind was a blank as she descended the stairs on her way down she was conscious of nothing but the one headlong impulse to get to the library in the shortest possible space of time arrived at the door the impulse capriciously left her she stopped on the mat wondering why she had hurried herself with time to spare her heart sank the fever of her excitement changed suddenly to a chill as she faced the closed door and asked herself the question dare i go in  her own hand answered her she lifted it to turn the handle of the lock it dropped again helplessly at her side  the sense of her own irresolution wrung from her a low exclamation of despair faint as it was it had apparently not passed unheard the door was opened from withinand horace stood before her  he drew aside to let her pass into the room but he never followed her in he stood in the doorway and spoke to her keeping the door open with his hand  do you mind waiting here for me he asked  she looked at him in vacant surprise doubting whether she had heard him aright  it will not be for long he went on i am far too anxious to hear what you have to tell me to submit to any needless delays the truth is i have had a message from lady janet  from lady janet what could lady janet want with him at a time when she was bent on composing herself in the retirement of her own room  i ought to have said two messages horace proceeded the first was given to me on my way downstairs lady janet wished to see me immediately i sent an excuse a second message followed lady janet would accept no excuse if i refused to go to her i should be merely obliging her to come to me it is impossible to risk being interrupted in that way my only alternative is to get the thing over as soon as possible do you mind waiting  certainly not have you any idea of what lady janet wants with you  no whatever it is she shall not keep me long away from you you will be quite alone here i have warned the servants not to show any one in with those words he left her  mercys first sensation was a sensation of reliefsoon lost in a feeling of shame at the weakness which could welcome any temporary relief in such a position as hers the emotion thus roused merged in its turn into a sense of impatient regret but for lady janets message she thought to herself i might have known my fate by this time  the slow minutes followed each other drearily she paced to and fro in the library faster and faster under the intolerable irritation the maddening uncertainty of her own suspense ere long even the spacious room seemed to be too small for her the sober monotony of the long booklined shelves oppressed and offended her she threw open the door which led into the diningroom and dashed in eager for a change of objects athirst for more space and more air  at the first step she checked herself rooted to the spot under a sudden revulsion of feeling which quieted her in an instant  the room was only illuminated by the waning firelight a man was obscurely visible seated on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his head resting on his hands he looked up as the open door let in the light from the library lamps the mellow glow reached his face and revealed julian gray  mercy was standing with her back to the light her face being necessarily hidden in deep shadow he recognized her by her figure and by the attitude into which it unconsciously fell that unsought grace that lithe long beauty of line belonged to but one woman in the house he rose and approached her  i have been wishing to see you he said and hoping that accident might bring about some such meeting as this  he offered her a chair mercy hesitated before she took her seat this was their first meeting alone since lady janet had interrupted her at the moment when she was about to confide to julian the melancholy story of the past was he anxious to seize the opportunity of returning to her confession the terms in which he had addressed her seemed to imply it she put the question to him in plain words  i feel the deepest interest in hearing all that you have still to confide to me he answered but anxious as i may be i will not hurry you i will wait if you wish it  i am afraid i must own that i do wish it mercy rejoined not on my accountbut because my time is at the disposal of horace holmcroft i expect to see him in a few minutes  could you give me those few minutes julian asked i have something on my side to say to you which i think you ought to know before you see any onehorace himself included  he spoke with a certain depression of tone which was not associated with her previous experience of him his face looked prematurely old and careworn in the red light of the fire something had plainly happened to sadden and to disappoint him since they had last met  i willingly offer you all the time that i have at my own command mercy replied does what you have to tell me relate to lady janet  he gave her no direct reply what i have to tell you of lady janet he said gravely is soon told so far as she is concerned you have nothing more to dread lady janet knows all  even the heavy weight of oppression caused by the impending interview with horace failed to hold its place in mercys mind when julian answered her in those words  come into the lighted room she said faintly it is too terrible to hear you say that in the dark  julian followed her into the library her limbs trembled under her she dropped into a chair and shrank under his great bright eyes as he stood by her side looking sadly down on her  lady janet knows all she repeated with her head on her breast and the tears falling slowly over her cheeks have you told her  i have said nothing to lady janet or to any one your confidence is a sacred confidence to me until you have spoken first  has lady janet said anything to you  not a word she has looked at you with the vigilant eyes of love she has listened to you with the quick hearing of loveand she has found her own way to the truth she will not speak of it to meshe will not speak of it to any living creature i only know now how dearly she loved you in spite of herself she clings to you still her life poor soul has been a barren one unworthy miserably unworthy of such a nature as hers her marriage was loveless and childless she has had admirers but never in the higher sense of the word a friend all the best years of her life have been wasted in the unsatisfied longing for something to love at the end of her life you have filled the void her heart has found its youth again through you at her ageat any ageis such a tie as this to be rudely broken at the mere bidding of circumstances no she will suffer anything risk anything forgive anything rather than own even to herself that she has been deceived in you there is more than her happiness at stake there is pride a noble pride in such love as hers which will ignore the plainest discovery and deny the most unanswerable truth i am firmly convincedfrom my own knowledge of her character and from what i have observed in her todaythat she will find some excuse for refusing to hear your confession and more than that i believe if the exertion of her influence can do it that she will leave no means untried of preventing you from acknowledging your true position here to any living creature i take a serious responsibility on myself in telling you thisand i dont shrink from it you ought to know and you shall know what trials and what temptations may yet lie before you  he pausedleaving mercy time to compose herself if she wished to speak to him  she felt that there was a necessity for her speaking to him he was plainly not aware that lady janet had already written to her to defer her promised explanation this circumstance was in itself a confirmation of the opinion which he had expressed she ought to mention it to him she tried to mention it to him but she was not equal to the effort the few simple words in which he had touched on the tie that bound lady janet to her had wrung her heart her tears choked her she could only sign to him to go on  you may wonder at my speaking so positively he continued with nothing better than my own conviction to justify me i can only say that i have watched lady janet too closely to feel any doubt i saw the moment in which the truth flashed on her as plainly as i now see you it did not disclose itself graduallyit burst on her as it burst on me she suspected nothingshe was frankly indignant at your sudden interference and your strange languageuntil the time came in which you pledged yourself to produce mercy merrick then and then only the truth broke on her mind trebly revealed to her in your words your voice and your look then and then only i saw a marked change come over her and remain in her while she remained in the room i dread to think of what she may do in the first reckless despair of the discovery that she has made i distrustthough god knows i am not naturally a suspicious manthe most apparently trifling events that are now taking place about us you have held nobly to your resolution to own the truth prepare yourself before the evening is over to be tried and tempted again  mercy lifted her head fear took the place of grief in her eyes as they rested in startled inquiry on julians face  how is it possible that temptation can come to me now she asked  i will leave it to events to answer that question he said you will not have long to wait in the meantime i have put you on your guard he stooped and spoke his next words earnestly close at her ear hold fast by the admirable courage which you have shown thus far he went on suffer anything rather than suffer the degradation of yourself be the woman whom i once spoke ofthe woman i still have in my mindwho can nobly reveal the noble nature that is in her and never forget thismy faith in you is as firm as ever  she looked at him proudly and gratefully  i am pledged to justify your faith in me she said i have put it out of my own power to yield horace has my promise that i will explain everything to him in this room  julian started  has horace himself asked it of you he inquired he at least has no suspicion of the truth  horace has appealed to my duty to him as his betrothed wife she answered he has the first claim to my confidencehe resents my silence and he has a right to resent it terrible as it will be to open his eyes to the truth i must do it if he asks me  she was looking at julian while she spoke the old longing to associate with the hard trial of the confession the one man who had felt for her and believed in her revived under another form if she could only know while she was saying the fatal words to horace that julian was listening too she would be encouraged to meet the worst that could happen as the idea crossed her mind she observed that julian was looking toward the door through which they had lately passed in an instant she saw the means to her end hardly waiting to hear the few kind expressions of sympathy and approval which he addressed to her she hinted timidly at the proposal which she had now to make to him  are you going back into the next room she asked  not if you object to it he replied  i dont object i want you to be there  after horace has joined you  yes after horace has joined me  do you wish to see me when it is over  she summoned her resolution and told him frankly what she had in her mind  i want you to be near me while i am speaking to horace she said it will give me courage if i can feel that i am speaking to you as well as to him i can count on your sympathyand sympathy is so precious to me now am i asking too much if i ask you to leave the door unclosed when you go back to the diningroom think of the dreadful trialto him as well as to me i am only a woman i am afraid i may sink under it if i have no friend near me and i have no friend but you  in those simple words she tried her powers of persuasion on him for the first time  between perplexity and distress julian was for the moment at a loss how to answer her the love for mercy which he dared not acknowledge was as vital a feeling in him as the faith in her which he had been free to avow to refuse anything that she asked of him in her sore needand more even than that to refuse to hear the confession which it had been her first impulse to make to himthese were cruel sacrifices to his sense of what was due to horace and of what was due to himself but shrink as he might even from the appearance of deserting her it was impossible for him except under a reserve which was almost equivalent to a denial to grant her request  all that i can do i will do he said the doors shall be left unclosed and i will remain in the next room on this condition that horace knows of it as well as you i should be unworthy of your confidence in me if i consented to be a listener on any other terms you understand that i am sure as well as i do  she had never thought of her proposal to him in this light womanlike she had thought of nothing but the comfort of having him near her she understood him now a faint flush of shame rose on her pale cheeks as she thanked him he delicately relieved her from her embarrassment by putting a question which naturally occurred under the circumstances  where is horace all this time he asked why is he not here  he has been called away she answered by a message from lady janet  the reply more than astonished julian it seemed almost to alarm him he returned to mercys chair he said to her eagerly are you sure  horace himself told me that lady janet had insisted on seeing him  when  not long ago he asked me to wait for him here while he went upstairs  julians face darkened ominously  this confirms my worst fears he said have you had any communication with lady janet  mercy replied by showing him his aunts note he read it carefully through  did i not tell you he said that she would find some excuse for refusing to hear your confession she begins by delaying it simply to gain time for something else which she has it in her mind to do when did you receive this note soon after you went upstairs  about a quarter of an hour after as well as i can guess  do you know what happened down here after you left us  horace told me that lady janet had offered miss roseberry the use of her boudoir  any more  he said that you had shown her the way to the room  did he tell you what happened after that  no  then i must tell you if i can do nothing more in this serious state of things i can at least prevent your being taken by surprise in the first place it is right you should know that i had a motive for accompanying miss roseberry to the boudoir i was anxious for your sake to make some appeal to her better selfif she had any better self to address i own i had doubts of my successjudging by what i had already seen of her my doubts were confirmed in the ordinary intercourse of life i should merely have thought her a commonplace uninteresting woman seeing her as i saw her while we were alonein other words penetrating below the surfacei have never in all my sad experience met with such a hopelessly narrow mean and low nature as hers understanding as she could not fail to do what the sudden change in lady janets behavior toward her really meant her one idea was to take the cruelest possible advantage of it so far from feeling any consideration for you she was only additionally imbittered toward you she protested against your being permitted to claim the merit of placing her in her right position here by your own voluntary avowal of the truth she insisted on publicly denouncing you and on forcing lady janet to dismiss you unheard before the whole household now i can have my revenge at last lady janet is afraid of me those were her own wordsi am almost ashamed to repeat themthose on my honor were her own words every possible humiliation to be heaped on you no consideration to be shown for lady janets age and lady janets position nothing absolutely nothing to be allowed to interfere with miss roseberrys vengeance and miss roseberrys triumph there is this womans shameless view of what is due to her as stated by herself in the plainest terms i kept my temper i did all i could to bring her to a better frame of mind i might as well have pleadedi wont say with a savage savages are sometimes accessible to remonstrance if you know how to reach themi might as well have pleaded with a hungry animal to abstain from eating while food was within its reach i had just given up the hopeless effort in disgust when lady janets maid appeared with a message for miss roseberry from her mistress my ladys compliments maam and she will be glad to see you at your earliest convenience in her room  another surprise grace roseberry invited to an interview with lady janet it would have been impossible to believe it if julian had not heard the invitation given with his own ears  she instantly rose julian proceeded i wont keep her ladyship waiting a moment she said show me the way she signed to the maid to go out of the room first and then turned round and spoke to me from the door i despair of describing the insolent exultation of her manner i can only repeat her words this is exactly what i wanted i had intended to insist on seeing lady janet she saves me the trouble i am infinitely obliged to her with that she nodded to me and closed the door i have not seen her i have not heard of her since for all i know she may be still with my aunt and horace may have found her there when he entered the room  what can lady janet have to say to her mercy asked eagerly  it is impossible even to guess when you found me in the diningroom i was considering that very question i cannot imagine that any neutral ground can exist on which it is possible for lady janet and this woman to meet in her present frame of mind she will in all probability insult lady janet before she has been five minutes in the room i own i am completely puzzled the one conclusion i can arrive at is that the note which my aunt sent to you the private interview with miss roseberry which has followed and the summons to horace which has succeeded in its turn are all links in the same chain of events and are all tending to that renewed temptation against which i have already warned you  mercy held up her hand for silence she looked toward the door that opened on the hall had she heard a footstep outside no all was still not a sign yet of horaces return  oh she exclaimed what would i not give to know what is going on upstairs  you will soon know it now said julian it is impossible that our present uncertainty can last much longer  he turned away intending to go back to the room in which she had found him looking at her situation from a mans point of view he naturally assumed that the best service he could now render to mercy would be to leave her to prepare herself for the interview with horace before he had taken three steps away from her she showed him the difference between the womans point of view and the mans the idea of considering beforehand what she should say never entered her mind in her horror of being left by herself at that critical moment she forgot every other consideration even the warning remembrance of horaces jealous distrust of julian passed away from her for the moment as completely as if it never had a place in her memory dont leave me she cried i cant wait here alone come backcome back  she rose impulsively while she spoke as if to follow him into the diningroom if he persisted in leaving her  a momentary expression of doubt crossed julians face as he retraced his steps and signed to her to be seated a gain could she be depended on he asked himself to sustain the coming test of her resolution when she had not courage enough to wait for events in a room by herself julian had yet to learn that a womans courage rises with the greatness of the emergency ask her to accompany you through a field in which some harmless cattle happen to be grazing and it is doubtful in nine cases out of ten if she will do it ask her as one of the passengers in a ship on fire to help in setting an example of composure to the rest and it is certain in nine cases out of ten that she will do it as soon as julian had taken a chair near her mercy was calm again  are you sure of your resolution he asked  i am certain of it she answered as long as you dont leave me by myself  the talk between them dropped there they sat together in silence with their eyes fixed on the door waiting for horace to come in  after the lapse of a few minutes their attention was attracted by a sound outside in the grounds a carriage of some sort was plainly audible approaching the house  the carriage stopped the bell rang the front door was opened had a visitor arrived no voice could be heard making inquiries no footsteps but the servants footsteps crossed the hall along pause followed the carriage remaining at the door instead of bringing some one to the house it had apparently arrived to take some one away  the next event was the return of the servant to the front door they listened again again no second footstep was audible the door was closed the servant recrossed the hall the carriage was driven away judging by sounds alone no one had arrived at the house and no one had left the house  julian looked at mercy do you understand this he asked  she silently shook her head  if any person has gone away in the carriage julian went on that person can hardly have been a man or we must have heard him in the hall  the conclusion which her companion had just drawn from the noiseless departure of the supposed visitor raised a sudden doubt in mercys mind  go and inquire she said eagerly  julian left the room and returned again after a brief absence with signs of grave anxiety in his face and manner  i told you i dreaded the most trifling events that were passing about us he said an event which is far from being trifling has just happened the carriage which we heard approaching along the drive turns out to have been a cab sent for from the house the person who has gone away in it  is a woman as you supposed  yes  mercy rose excitedly from her chair  it cant be grace roseberry she exclaimed  it is grace roseberry  has she gone away alone  aloneafter an interview with lady janet  did she go willingly  she herself sent the servant for the cab  what does it mean  it is useless to inquire we shall soon know  they resumed their seats waiting as they had waited already with their eyes on the library door    chapter xxiii lady janet at bay  the narrative leaves julian and mercy for a while and ascending to the upper regions of the house follows the march of events in lady janets room  the maid had delivered her mistresss note to mercy and had gone away again on her second errand to grace roseberry in her boudoir lady janet was seated at her writingtable waiting for the appearance of the woman whom she had summoned to her presence a single lamp diffused its mild light over the books pictures and busts round her leaving the further end of the room in which the bed was placed almost lost in obscurity the works of art were all portraits the books were all presentation copies from the authors it was lady janets fancy to associate her bedroom with memorials of the various persons whom she had known in the long course of her lifeall of them more or less distinguished most of them by this time gathered with the dead  she sat near her writingtable lying back in her easychairthe living realization of the picture which julians description had drawn her eyes were fixed on a photographic likeness of mercy which was so raised upon a little gilt easel as to enable her to contemplate it under the full light of the lamp the bright mobile old face was strangely and sadly changed the brow was fixed the mouth was rigid the whole face would have been like a mask molded in the hardest forms of passive resistance and suppressed rage but for the light and life still thrown over it by the eyes there was something unutterably touching in the keen hungering tenderness of the look which they fixed on the portrait intensified by an underlying expression of fond and patient reproach the danger which julian so wisely dreaded was in the rest of the face the love which he had so truly described was in the eyes alone they still spoke of the cruelly profaned affection which had been the one immeasurable joy the one inexhaustible hope of lady janets closing life the brow expressed nothing but her obstinate determination to stand by the wreck of that joy to rekindle the dead ashes of that hope the lips were only eloquent of her unflinching resolution to ignore the hateful present and to save the sacred past my idol may be shattered but none of you shall know it i stop the march of discovery i extinguish the light of truth i am deaf to your words am blind to your proofs at seventy years old my idol is my life it shall be my idol still    the silence in the bedroom was broken by a murmuring of womens voices outside the door  lady janet instantly raised herself in the chair and snatched the photograph off the easel she laid the portrait face downward among some papers on the table then abruptly changed her mind and hid it among the thick folds of lace which clothed her neck and bosom there was a world of love in the action itself and in the sudden softening of the eyes which accompanied it the next moment lady janets mask was on any superficial observer who had seen her now would have said this is a hard woman  the door was opened by the maid grace roseberry entered the room  she advanced rapidly with a defiant assurance in her manner and a lofty carriage of her head she sat down in the chair to which lady janet silently pointed with a thump she returned lady janets grave bow with a nod and a smile every movement and every look of the little worn whitefaced shabbily dressed woman expressed insolent triumph and said as if in words my turn has come  i am glad to wait on your ladyship she began without giving lady janet an opportunity of speaking first indeed i should have felt it my duty to request an interview if you had not sent your maid to invite me up here  you would have felt it your duty to request an interview lady janet repeated very quietly why  the tone in which that one last word was spoken embarrassed grace at the outset it established as great a distance between lady janet and herself as if she had been lifted in her chair and conveyed bodily to the other end of the room  i am surprised that your ladyship should not understand me she said struggling to conceal her confusion especially after your kind offer of your own boudoir  lady janet remained perfectly unmoved i do not understand you she answered just as quietly as ever  graces temper came to her assistance she recovered the assurance which had marked her first appearance on the scene  in that case she resumed i must enter into particulars in justice to myself i can place but one interpretation on the extraordinary change in your ladyships behavior to me downstairs the conduct of that abominable woman has at last opened your eyes to the deception that has been practiced on you for some reason of your own however you have not yet chosen to recognize me openly in this painful position something is due to my own selfrespect i cannot and will not permit mercy merrick to claim the merit of restoring me to my proper place in this house after what i have suffered it is quite impossible for me to endure that i should have requested an interview if you had not sent for me for the express purpose of claiming this persons immediate expulsion from the house i claim it now as a proper concession to me whatever you or mr julian gray may do i will not tamely permit her to exhibit herself as an interesting penitent it is really a little too much to hear this brazen adventuress appoint her own time for explaining herself it is too deliberately insulting to see her sail out of the roomwith a clergyman of the church of england opening the door for heras if she was laying me under an obligation i can forgive much lady janetincluding the terms in which you thought it decent to order me out of your house i am quite willing to accept the offer of your boudoir as the expression on your part of a better frame of mind but even christian charity has its limits the continued presence of that wretch under your roof is you will permit me to remark not only a monument of your own weakness but a perfectly insufferable insult to me  there she stopped abruptlynot for want of words but for want of a listener  lady janet was not even pretending to attend to her lady janet with a deliberate rudeness entirely foreign to her usual habits was composedly busying herself in arranging the various papers scattered about the table some she tied together with little morsels of string some she placed under paperweights some she deposited in the fantastic pigeonholes of a little japanese cabinetworking with a placid enjoyment of her own orderly occupation and perfectly unaware to all outward appearance that any second person was in the room she looked up with her papers in both hands when grace stopped and said quietly  have you done  is your ladyships purpose in sending for me to treat me with studied rudeness grace retorted angrily  my purpose in sending for you is to say something as soon as you will allow me the opportunity  the impenetrable composure of that reply took grace completely by surprise she had no retort ready in sheer astonishment she waited silently with her eyes riveted on the mistress of the house  lady janet put down her papers and settled herself comfortably in the easychair preparatory to opening the interview on her side  the little that i have to say to you she began may be said in a question am i right in supposing that you have no present employment and that a little advance in money delicately offered would be very acceptable to you  do you mean to insult me lady janet  certainly not i mean to ask you a question  your question is an insult  my question is a kindness if you will only understand it as it is intended i dont complain of your not understanding it i dont even hold you responsible for any one of the many breaches of good manners which you have committed since you have been in this room i was honestly anxious to be of some service to you and you have repelled my advances i am sorry let us drop the subject  expressing herself in the most perfect temper in those terms lady janet resumed the arrangement of her papers and became unconscious once more of the presence of any second person in the room  grace opened her lips to reply with the utmost intemperance of an angry woman and thinking better of it controlled herself it was plainly useless to take the violent way with lady janet roy her age and her social position were enough of themselves to repel any violence she evidently knew that and trusted to it grace resolved to meet the enemy on the neutral ground of politeness as the most promising ground that she could occupy under present circumstances  if i have said anything hasty i beg to apologize to your ladyship she began may i ask if your only object in sending for me was to inquire into my pecuniary affairs with a view to assisting me  that said lady janet was my only object  you had nothing to say to me on the subject of mercy merrick  nothing whatever i am weary of hearing of mercy merrick have you any more questions to ask me  i have one more  yes  i wish to ask your ladyship whether you propose to recognize me in the presence of your household as the late colonel roseberrys daughter  i have already recognized you as a lady in embarrassed circumstances who has peculiar claims on my consideration and forbearance if you wish me to repeat those words in the presence of the servants absurd as it is i am ready to comply with your request  graces temper began to get the better of her prudent resolutions  lady janet she said this wont do i must request you to express yourself plainly you talk of my peculiar claims on your forbearance what claims do you mean  it will be painful to both of us if we enter into details replied lady janet pray dont let us enter into details  i insist on it madam  pray dont insist on it  grace was deaf to remonstrance  i ask you in plain words she went on do you acknowledge that you have been deceived by an adventuress who has personated me do you mean to restore me to my proper place in this house  lady janet returned to the arrangement of her papers  does your ladyship refuse to listen to me  lady janet looked up from her papers as blandly as ever  if you persist in returning to your delusion she said you will oblige me to persist in returning to my papers  what is my delusion if you please  your delusion is expressed in the questions you have just put to me your delusion constitutes your peculiar claim on my forbearance nothing you can say or do will shake my forbearance when i first found you in the diningroom i acted most improperly i lost my temper i did worse i was foolish enough and imprudent enough to send for a police officer i owe you every possible atonement afflicted as you are for treating you in that cruel manner i offered you the use of my boudoir as part of my atonement i sent for you in the hope that you would allow me to assist you as part of my atonement you may behave rudely to me you may speak in the most abusive terms of my adopted daughter i will submit to anything as part of my atonement so long as you abstain from speaking on one painful subject i will listen to you with the greatest pleasure whenever you return to that subject i shall return to my papers  grace looked at lady janet with an evil smile  i begin to understand your ladyship she said you are ashamed to acknowledge that you have been grossly imposed upon your only alternative of course is to ignore everything that has happened pray count on my forbearance i am not at all offendedi am merely amused it is not every day that a lady of high rank exhibits herself in such a position as yours to an obscure woman like me your humane consideration for me dates i presume from the time when your adopted daughter set you the example by ordering the police officer out of the room  lady janets composure was proof even against this assault on it she gravely accepted graces inquiry as a question addressed to her in perfect good faith  i am not at all surprised she replied to find that my adopted daughters interference has exposed her to misrepresentation she ought to have remonstrated with me privately before she interfered but she has one faultshe is too impulsive i have never in all my experience met with such a warmhearted person as she is always too considerate of others always too forgetful of herself the mere appearance of the police officer placed you in a situation to appeal to her compassion and her impulses carried her away as usual my fault all my fault  grace changed her tone once more she was quick enough to discern that lady janet was a match for her with her own weapons  we have had enough of this she said it is time to be serious your adopted daughter as you call her is mercy merrick and you know it  lady janet returned to her papers  i am grace roseberry whose name she has stolen and you know that  lady janet went on with her papers  grace got up from her chair  i accept your silence lady janet she said as an acknowledgment of your deliberate resolution to suppress the truth you are evidently determined to receive the adventuress as the true woman and you dont scruple to face the consequences of that proceeding by pretending to my face to believe that i am mad i will not allow myself to be impudently cheated out of my rights in this way you will hear from me again madam when the canadian mail arrives in england  she walked toward the door this time lady janet answered as readily and as explicitly as it was possible to desire  i shall refuse to receive your letters she said  grace returned a few steps threateningly  my letters shall be followed by my witnesses she proceeded  i shall refuse to receive your witnesses  refuse at your peril i will appeal to the law  lady janet smiled  i dont pretend to much knowledge of the subject she said but i should be surprised indeed if i discovered that you had any claim on me which the law could enforce however let us suppose that you can set the law in action you know as well as i do that the only motive power which can do that ismoney i am rich fees costs and all the rest of it are matters of no sort of consequence to me may i ask if you are in the same position  the question silenced grace so far as money was concerned she was literally at the end of her resources her only friends were friends in canada after what she had said to him in the boudoir it would be quite useless to appeal to the sympathies of julian gray in the pecuniary sense and in one word she was absolutely incapable of gratifying her own vindictive longings and there sat the mistress of mablethorpe house perfectly well aware of it  lady janet pointed to the empty chair  suppose you sit down again she suggested the course of our interview seems to have brought us back to the question that i asked you when you came into my room instead of threatening me with the law suppose you consider the propriety of permitting me to be of some use to you i am in the habit of assisting ladies in embarrassed circumstances and nobody knows of it but my stewardwho keeps the accountsand myself once more let me inquire if a little advance of the pecuniary sort delicately offered would be acceptable to you  grace returned slowly to the chair that she had left she stood by it with one hand grasping the top rail and with her eyes fixed in mocking scrutiny on lady janets face  at last your ladyship shows your hand she said hushmoney  you will send me back to my papers rejoined lady janet how obstinate you are  graces hand closed tighter and tighter round the rail of the chair without witnesses without means without so much as a refugethanks to her own coarse cruelties of language and conductin the sympathies of others the sense of her isolation and her helplessness was almost maddening at that final moment a woman of finer sensibilities would have instantly left the room graces impenetrably hard and narrow mind impelled her to meet the emergency in a very different way a last base vengeance to which lady janet had voluntarily exposed herself was still within her reach for the present she thought there is but one way of being even with your ladyship i can cost you as much as possible  pray make some allowances for me she said i am not obstinatei am only a little awkward at matching the audacity of a lady of high rank i shall improve with practice my own language is as i am painfully aware only plain english permit me to withdraw it and to substitute yours what advance is your ladyship delicately prepared to offer me  lady janet opened a drawer and took out her checkbook  the moment of relief had come at last the only question now left to discuss was evidently the question of amount lady janet considered a little the question of amount was to her mind in some sort a question of conscience as well her love for mercy and her loathing for grace her horror of seeing her darling degraded and her affection profaned by a public exposure had hurried herthere was no disputing itinto treating an injured woman harshly hateful as grace roseberry might be her father had left her in his last moments with lady janets full concurrence to lady janets care but for mercy she would have been received at mablethorpe house as lady janets companion with a salary of one hundred pounds a year on the other hand how long with such a temper as she had revealed would grace have remained in the service of her protectress she would probably have been dismissed in a few weeks with a years salary to compensate her and with a recommendation to some suitable employment what would be a fair compensation now lady janet decided that five years salary immediately given and future assistance rendered if necessary would represent a fit remembrance of the late colonel roseberrys claims and a liberal pecuniary acknowledgment of any harshness of treatment which grace might have sustained at her hands at the same time and for the further satisfying of her own conscience she determined to discover the sum which grace herself would consider sufficient by the simple process of making grace herself propose the terms  it is impossible for me to make you an offer she said for this reasonyour need of money will depend greatly on your future plans i am quite ignorant of your future plans  perhaps your ladyship will kindly advise me said grace satirically  i cannot altogether undertake to advise you lady janet replied i can only suppose that you will scarcely remain in england where you have no friends whether you go to law with me or not you will surely feel the necessity of communicating personally with your friends in canada am i right  grace was quite quick enough to understand this as it was meant properly interpreted the answer signifiedif you take your compensation in money it is understood as part of the bargain that you dont remain in england to annoy me  your ladyship is quite right she said i shall certainly not remain in england i shall consult my friendsand she added mentally go to law with you afterward if i possibly can with your own money  you will return to canada lady janet proceeded and your prospects there will be probably a little uncertain at first taking this into consideration at what amount do you estimate in your own mind the pecuniary assistance which you will require  may i count on your ladyships kindness to correct me if my own ignorant calculations turn out to be wrong grace asked innocently  here again the words properly interpreted had a special signification of their own it is stipulated on my part that i put myself up to auction and that my estimate shall be regulated by your ladyships highest bid thoroughly understanding the stipulation lady janet bowed and waited gravely  gravely on her side grace began  i am afraid i should want more than a hundred pounds she said  lady janet made her first bid i think so too  more perhaps than two hundred  lady janet made her second bid probably  more than three hundred four hundred five hundred  lady janet made her highest bid five hundred pounds will do she said  in spite of herself graces rising color betrayed her ungovernable excitement from her earliest childhood she had been accustomed to see shillings and sixpences carefully considered before they were parted with she had never known her father to possess so much as five golden sovereigns at his own disposal unencumbered by debt in all her experience of him the atmosphere in which she had lived and breathed was the allstifling one of genteel poverty there was something horrible in the greedy eagerness of her eyes as they watched lady janet to see if she was really sufficiently in earnest to give away five hundred pounds sterling with a stroke of her pen  lady janet wrote t he check in a few seconds and pushed it across the table  graces hungry eyes devoured the golden line pay to myself or bearer five hundred pounds and verified the signature beneath janet roy once sure of the money whenever she chose to take it the native meanness of her nature instantly asserted itself she tossed her head and let the check lie on the table with an overacted appearance of caring very little whether she took it or not  your ladyship is not to suppose that i snap at your check she said  lady janet leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes the very sight of grace roseberry sickened her her mind filled suddenly with the image of mercy she longed to feast her eyes again on that grand beauty to fill her ears again with the melody of that gentle voice  i require time to considerin justice to my own selfrespect grace went on  lady janet wearily made a sign granting time to consider  your ladyships boudoir is i presume still at my disposal  lady janet silently granted the boudoir  and your ladyships servants are at my orders if i have occasion to employ them  lady janet suddenly opened her eyes the whole household is at your orders she cried furiously leave me  grace was far from being offended if anything she was gratifiedthere was a certain triumph in having stung lady janet into an open outbreak of temper she insisted forthwith on another condition  in the event of my deciding to receive the check she said i cannot consistently with my own selfrespect permit it to be delivered to me otherwise than inclosed your ladyship will if necessary be so kind as to inclose it goodevening  she sauntered to the door looking from side to side with an air of supreme disparagement at the priceless treasures of art which adorned the walls her eyes dropped superciliously on the carpet the design of a famous french painter as if her feet condescended in walking over it the audacity with which she had entered the room had been marked enough it shrank to nothing before the infinitely superior proportions of the insolence with which she left it  the instant the door was closed lady janet rose from her chair reckless of the wintry chill in the outer air she threw open one of the windows pah she exclaimed with a shudder of disgust the very air of the room is tainted by her  she returned to her chair her mood changed as she sat down againher heart was with mercy once more oh my love she murmured how low i have stooped how miserably i have degraded myselfand all for you the bitterness of the retrospect was unendurable the inbred force of the womans nature took refuge from it in an outburst of defiance and despair whatever she has done that wretch deserves it not a living creature in this house shall say she has deceived me she has not deceived meshe loves me what do i care whether she has given me her true name or not she has given me her true heart what right had julian to play upon her feelings and pry into her secrets my poor tempted tortured child i wont hear her confession not another word shall she say to any living creature i am mistressi will forbid it at once she snatched a sheet of notepaper from the case hesitated and threw it from her on the table why not send for my darling she thought why write she hesitated once more and resigned the idea no i cant trust myself i darent see her yet  she took up the sheet of paper again and wrote her second message to mercy this time the note began fondly with a familiar form of address  my dear childi have had time to think and compose myself a little since i last wrote requesting you to defer the explanation which you had promised me i already understand and appreciate the motives which led you to interfere as you did downstairs and i now ask you to entirely abandon the explanation it will i am sure be painful to you for reasons of your own into which i have no wish to inquire to produce the person of whom you spoke and as you know already i myself am weary of hearing of her besides there is really no need now for you to explain anything the stranger whose visits here have caused us so much pain and anxiety will trouble us no more she leaves england of her own free will after a conversation with me which has perfectly succeeded in composing and satisfying her not a word more my dear to me or to my nephew or to any other human creature of what has happened in the diningroom today when we next meet let it be understood between us that the past is henceforth and forever buried to oblivion this is not only the earnest requestit is if necessary the positive command of your mother and friend  janet roy  psi shall find opportunities before you leave your room of speaking separately to my nephew and to horace holmcroft you need dread no embarrassment when you next meet them i will not ask you to answer my note in writing say yes to the maid who will bring it to you and i shall know we understand each other   after sealing the envelope which inclosed these lines lady janet addressed it as usual to miss grace roseberry she was just rising to ring the bell when the maid appeared with a message from the boudoir the womans tones and looks showed plainly that she had been made the object of graces insolent selfassertion as well as her mistress  if you please my lady the person downstairs wishes  lady janet frowning contemptuously interrupted the message at the outset i know what the person downstairs wishes she has sent you for a letter from me  yes my lady  anything more  she has sent one of the menservants my lady for a cab if your ladyship had only heard how she spoke to him  lady janet intimated by a sign that she would rather not hear she at once inclosed the check in an undirected envelope  take that to her she said and then come back to me  dismissing grace roseberry from all further consideration lady janet sat with her letter to mercy in her hand reflecting on her position and on the efforts which it might still demand from her pursuing this train of thought it now occurred to her that accident might bring horace and mercy together at any moment and that in horaces present frame of mind he would certainly insist on the very explanation which it was the foremost interest of her life to suppress the dread of this disaster was in full possession of her when the maid returned  where is mr holmcroft she asked the moment the woman entered the room  i saw him open the library door my lady just now on my way upstairs  was he alone  yes my lady  go to him and say i want to see him here immediately  the maid withdrew on her second errand lady janet rose restlessly and closed the open window her impatient desire to make sure of horace so completely mastered her that she left her room and met the woman in the corridor on her return receiving horaces message of excuse she instantly sent back the peremptory rejoinder say that he will oblige me to go to him if he persists in refusing to come to me and stay she added remembering the undelivered letter send miss roseberrys maid here i want her  left alone again lady janet paced once or twice up and down the corridorthen grew suddenly weary of the sight of it and went back to her room the two maids returned together one of them having announced horaces submission was dismissed the other was sent to mercys room with lady janets letter in a minute or two the messenger appeared again with the news that she had found the room empty  have you any idea where miss roseberry is  no my lady  lady janet reflected for a moment if horace presented himself without any needless delay the plain inference would he that she had succeeded in separating him from mercy if his appearance was suspiciously deferred she decided on personally searching for mercy in the reception rooms on the lower floor of the house  what have you done with the letter she asked  i left it on miss roseberrys table my lady  very well keep within hearing of the bell in case i want you again  another minute brought lady janets suspense to an end she heard the welcome sound of a knock at her door from a mans hand horace hurriedly entered the room  what is it you want with me lady janet he inquired not very graciously  sit down horace and you shall hear  horace did not accept the invitation excuse me he said if i mention that i am rather in a hurry  why are you in a hurry  i have reasons for wishing to see grace as soon as possible  and i have reasons lady janet rejoined for wishing to speak to you about grace before you see her serious reasons sit down  horace started serious reasons he repeated you surprise me  i shall surprise you still more before i have done  their eyes met as lady janet answered in those terms horace observed signs of agitation in her which he now noticed for the first time his face darkened with an expression of sullen distrustand he took the chair in silence    chapter xxiv lady janets letter  the narrative leaves lady janet and horace holmcroft together and returns to julian and mercy in the library  an interval passeda long interval measured by the impatient reckoning of suspenseafter the cab which had taken grace roseberry away had left the house the minutes followed each other and still the warning sound of horaces footsteps was not heard on the marble pavement of the hall by common though unexpressed consent julian and mercy avoided touching upon the one subject on which they were now both interested alike with their thoughts fixed secretly in vain speculation on the nature of the interview which was then taking place in lady janets room they tried to speak on topics indifferent to both of themtried and failed and tried again in a last and longest pause of silence between them the next event happened the door from the hall was softly and suddenly opened  was it horace nonot even yet the person who had opened the door was only mercys maid  my ladys love miss and will you please to read this directly  giving her message in those terms the woman produced from the pocket of her apron lady janets second letter to mercy with a strip of paper oddly pinned round the envelope mercy detached the paper and found on the inner side some lines in pencil hurriedly written in lady janets hand they ran thus  dont lose a moment in reading my letter and mind this when h returns to youmeet him firmly say nothing  enlightened by the warning words which julian had spoken to her mercy was at no loss to place the right interpretation on those strange lines instead of immediately opening the letter she stopped the maid at the library door julians suspicion of the most trifling events that were taking place in the house had found its way from his mind to hers wait she said i dont understand what is going on upstairs i want to ask you something  the woman came backnot very willingly  how did you know i was here mercy inquired  if you please miss her ladyship ordered me to take the letter to you some little time since you were not in your room and i left it on your table  i understand that but how came you to bring the letter here  my lady rang for me miss before i could knock at her door she came out into the corridor with that morsel of paper in her hand  so as to keep you from entering her room  yes miss her ladyship wrote on the paper in a great hurry and told me to pin it round the letter that i had left in your room i was to take them both together to you and to let nobody see me you will find miss roseberry in the library her ladyship says and run run run there isnt a moment to lose those were her own words miss  did you hear anything in the room before lady janet came out and met you  the woman hesitated and looked at julian  i hardly know whether i ought to tell you miss  julian turned away to leave the library mercy stopped him by a motion of her hand  you know that i shall not get you into any trouble she said to the maid and you may speak quite safely before mr julian gray  thus reassured the maid spoke  to own the truth miss i heard mr holmcroft in my ladys room his voice sounded as if he was angry i may say they were both angrymr holmcroft and my lady she turned to julian and just before her ladyship came out sir i heard your name as if it was you they were having words about i cant say exactly what it was i hadnt time to hear and i didnt listen miss the door was ajar and the voices were so loud nobody could help hearing them  it was useless to detain the woman any longer having given her leave to withdraw mercy turned to julian  why were they quarreling about you she asked  julian pointed to the unopened letter in her hand  the answer to your question may be there he said read the letter while you have the chance and if i can advise you say so at once  with a strange reluctance she opened the envelope with a sinking heart she read the lines in which lady janet as mother and friend commanded her absolutely to suppress the confession which she had pledged herself to make in the sacred interests of justice and truth a low cry of despair escaped her as the cruel complication in her position revealed itself in all its unmerited hardship oh lady janet lady janet she thought there was but one trial more left in my hard lotand it comes to me from you  she handed the letter to julian he took it from her in silence his pale complexion turned paler still as he read it his eyes rested on her compassionately as he handed it back  to my mind he said lady janet herself sets all further doubt at rest her letter tells me what she wanted when she sent for horace and why my name was mentioned between them  tell me cried mercy eagerly  he did not immediately answer her he sat down again in the chair by her side and pointed to the letter  has lady janet shaken your resolution he asked  she has strengthened my resolution mercy answered she has added a new bitterness to my remorse  she did not mean it harshly but the reply sounded harshly in julians ears it stirred the generous impulses which were the strongest impulses in his nature he who had once pleaded with mercy for compassionate consideration for herself now pleaded with her for compassionate consideration for lady janet with persuasive gentleness he drew a little nearer and laid his hand on her arm  dont judge her harshly he said she is wrong miserably wrong she has recklessly degraded herself she has recklessly tempted you still is it generousis it even justto hold her responsible for deliberate sin she is at the close of her days she can feel no new affection she can never replace you view her position in that light and you will see as i see that it is no base motive which has led her astray think of her wounded heart and her wasted lifeand say to yourself forgivingly she loves me  mercys eyes filled with tears  i do say it she answered not forgivinglyit is i who have need of forgiveness i say it gratefully when i think of heri say it with shame and sorrow when i think of myself  he took her hand for the first time he looked guiltlessly looked at her downcast face he spoke as he had spoken at the memorable interview between them which had made a new woman of her  i can imagine no crueler trial he said than the trial that is now before you the benefactress to whom you owe everything asks nothing from you but your silence the person whom you have wronged is no longer present to stimulate your resolution to speak horace himself unless i am entirely mistaken will not hold you to the explanation that you have promised the temptation to keep your false position in this house is i do not scruple to say all but irresistible sister and friend can you still justify my faith in you will you still own the truth without the base fear of discovery to drive you to it  she lifted her head with the steady light of resolution shining again in her grand gray eyes her low sweet voice answered him without a faltering note in it  i will  you will do justice to the woman whom you have wrongedunworthy as she is powerless as she is to expose you  i will  you will sacrifice everything you have gained by the fraud to the sacred duty of atonement you will suffer anythingeven though you offend the second mother who has loved you and sinned for yourather than suffer the degradation of yourself  her hand closed firmly on his again and for the last time she answered  i will  his voice had not trembled yet it failed him now his next words were spoken in faint whispering tonesto himself not to her  thank god for this day he said i have been of some service to one of the noblest of gods creatures  some subtle influence as he spoke passed from his hand to hers it trembled through her nerves it entwined itself mysteriously with the finest sensibilities in her nature it softly opened her heart to a first vague surmising of the devotion that she had inspired in him a faint glow of color lovely in its faintness stole over her face and neck her breathing quickened tremblingly she drew her hand away from him and sighed when she had released it  he rose suddenly to his feet and left her without a word or a look walking slowly down the length of the room when he turned and came back to her his face was composed he was master of himself again    mercy was the first to speak she turned the conversation from herself by reverting to the proceedings in lady janets room  you spoke of horace just now she said in terms which surprised me you appeared to think that he would not hold me to my explanation is that one of the conclusions which you draw from lady janets letter  most assuredly julian answered you will see the conclusion as i see it if we return for a moment to grace roseberrys departure from the house  mercy interrupted him there can you guess she asked how lady janet prevailed upon her to go  i hardly like to own it said julian there is an expression in the letter which suggests to me that lady janet has offered her money and that she has taken the bribe  oh i cant think that  let us return to horace miss roseberry once out of the house but one serious obstacle is left in lady janets way that obstacle is horace holmcroft  how is horace an obstacle  he is an obstacle in this sense he is under an engagement to marry you in a weeks time and lady janet is determined to keep him as she is determined to keep every one else in ignorance of the truth she will do that without scruple but the inbred sense of honor in her is not utterly silenced yet she cannot she dare not let horace make you his wife under the false impression that you are colonel roseberrys daughter you see the situation on the one hand she wont enlighten him on the other hand she cannot allow him to marry you blindfold in this emergency what is she to do there is but one alternative that i can discover she must persuade horace or she must irritate horace into acting for himself and breaking off the engagement on his own responsibility  mercy stopped him impossible she cried warmly impossible  look again at her letter julian rejoined it tells you plainly that you need fear no embarrassment when you next meet horace if words mean anything those words mean that he will not claim from you the confidence which you have promised to repose in him on what condition is it possible for him to abstain from doing that on the one condition that you have ceased to represent the first and foremost interest of his life  mercy still held firm you are wronging lady janet she said  julian smiled sadly  try to look at it he answered from lady janets point of view do you suppose she sees anything derogatory to her in attempting to break off the marriage i will answer for it she believes she is doing you a kindness in one sense it would be a kindness to spare you the shame of a humiliating confession and to save you possibly from being rejected to your face by the man you love in my opinion the thing is done already i have reasons of my own for believing that my aunt will succeed far more easily than she could anticipate horaces temper will help her  mercys mind began to yield to him in spite of herself  what do you mean by horaces temper she inquired  must you ask me that he said drawing back a little from her  i must  i mean by horaces temper horaces unworthy distrust of the interest that i feel in you  she instantly understood him and more than that she secretly admired him for the scrupulous delicacy with which he had expressed himself another man would not have thought of sparing her in that way another man would have said plainly horace is jealous of me  julian did not wait for her to answer him he considerately went on  for the reason that i have just mentioned he said horace will be easily irritated into taking a course which in his calmer moments nothing would induce him to adopt until i heard what your maid said to you i had thought for your sake of retiring before he joined you here now i know that my name has been introduced and has made mischief upstairs i feel the necessity for your sake again of meeting horace and his temper face to face before you see him let me if i can prepare him to hear you without any angry feeling in his mind toward you do you object to retire to the next room for a few minutes in the event of his coming back to the library  mercys courage instantly rose with the emergency she refused to leave the two men together  dont think me insensible to your kindness she said if i leave you with horace i may expose you to insult i refuse to do that what makes you doubt his coming back  his prolonged absence makes me doubt it julian replied in my belief the marriage is broken off he may go as grace roseberry has gone you may never see him again  the instant the opinion was uttered it was practically contradicted by the man himself horace opened the library door    chapter xxv the confession  he stopped just inside the door his first look was for mercy his is second look was for julian  i knew it he said with an assumption of sardonic composure if i could only have persuaded lady janet to bet i should have won a hundred pounds he advanced to julian with a sudden change from irony to anger would you like to hear what the bet was he asked  i should prefer seeing you able to control yourself in the presence of this lady julian answered quietly  i offered to lay lady janet two hundred pounds to one horace proceeded that i should find you here making love to miss roseberry behind my back  mercy interfered before julian could reply  if you cannot speak without insulting one of us she said permit me to request that you will not address yourself to mr julian gray  horace bowed to her with a mockery of respect  pray dont alarm yourselfi am pledged to be scrupulously civil to both of you he said lady janet only allowed me to leave her on condition of my promising to behave with perfect politeness what else can i do i have two privileged people to deal witha parson and a woman the parsons profession protects him and the womans sex protects her you have got me at a disadvantage and you both of you know it i beg to apologize if i have forgotten the clergymans profession and the ladys sex  you have forgotten more than that said julian you have forgotten that you were born a gentleman and bred a man of honor so far as i am concerned i dont ask you to remember that i am a clergymani obtrude my profession on nobodyi only ask you to remember your birth and your breeding it is quite bad enough to cruelly and unjustly suspect an old friend who has never forgotten what he owes to you and to himself but it is still more unworthy of you to acknowledge those suspicions in the hearing of a woman whom your own choice has doubly bound you to respect  he stopped the two eyed each other for a moment in silence  it was impossible for mercy to look at them as she was looking now without drawing the inevitable comparison between the manly force and dignity of julian and the womanish malice and irritability of horace a last faithful impulse of loyalty toward the man to whom she had been betrothed impelled her to part them before horace had hopelessly degraded himself in her estimation by contrast with julian  you had better wait to speak to me she said to him until we are alone  certainly horace answered with a sneer if mr julian gray will permit it  mercy turned to julian with a look which said plainly pity us both and leave us  do you wish me to go he asked  add to all your other kindnesses to me she answered wait for me in that room  she pointed to the door that led into the diningroom julian hesitated  you promise to let me know it if i can be of the smallest service to you he said  yes yes she followed him as he withdrew and added rapidly in a whisper leave the door ajar  he made no answer as she returned to horace he entered the diningroom the one concession he could make to her he did make he closed the door so noiselessly that not even her quick hearing could detect that he had shut it  mercy spoke to horace without waiting to let him speak first  i have promised you an explanation of my conduct she said in accents that trembled a little in spite of herself i am ready to perform my promise  i have a question to ask you before you do that he rejoined can you speak the truth  i am waiting to speak the truth  i will give you an opportunity are you or are you not in love with julian gray  you ought to be ashamed to ask the question  is that your only answer  i have never been unfaithful to you horace even in thought if i had not been true to you should i feel my position as you see i feel it now  he smiled bitterly i have my own opinion of your fidelity and of his honor he said you couldnt even send him into the next room without whispering to him first never mind that now at least you know that julian gray is in love with you  mr julian gray has never breathed a word of it to me  a man can show a woman that he loves her without saying it in words  mercys power of endurance began to fail her not even grace roseberry had spoken more insultingly to her of julian than horace was speaking now whoever says that of mr julian gray lies she answered warmly  then lady janet lies horace retorted  lady janet never said it lady janet is incapable of saying it  she may not have said it in so many words but she never denied it when i said it i reminded her of the time when julian gray first heard from me that i was going to marry you he was so overwhelmed that he was barely capable of being civil to me lady janet was present and could not deny it i asked her if she had observed since then signs of a confidential understanding between you two she could not deny the signs i asked if she had ever found you two together she could not deny that she had found you together this very day under circumstances which justified suspicion yes yes look as angry as you like you dont know what has been going on upstairs lady janet is bent on breaking off our engagementand julian gray is at the bottom of it  as to julian horace was utterly wrong but as to lady janet he echoed the warning words which julian himself had spoken to mercy she was staggered but she still held to her own opinion i dont believe it she said firmly  he advanced a step and fixed his angry eyes on her searchingly  do you know why lady janet sent for me he asked  no  then i will tell you lady janet is a stanch friend of yours there is no denying that she wished to inform me that she had altered her mind about your promised explanation of your conduct she said reflection has convinced me that no explanation is required i have laid my positive commands on my adopted daughter that no explanation shall take place has she done that  yes  now observe i waited till she had finished and then i said what have i to do with this lady janet has one meritshe speaks out you are to do as i do she answered you are to consider that no explanation is required and you are to consign the whole matter to oblivion from this time forth are you serious i asked quite serious in that case i have to inform your ladyship that you insist on more than you may suppose you insist on my breaking my engagement to miss roseberry either i am to have the explanation that she has promised me or i refuse to marry her how do you think lady janet took that she shut up her lips and she spread out her hands and she looked at me as much as to say just as you please refuse if you like its nothing to me  he paused for a moment mercy remained silent on her side she foresaw what was coming mistaken in supposing that horace had left the house julian had beyond all doubt been equally in error in concluding that he had been entrapped into breaking off the engagement upstairs  do you understand me so far horace asked  i understand you perfectly  i will not trouble you much longer he resumed i said to lady janet be so good as to answer me in plain words do you still insist on closing miss roseberrys lips i still insist she answered no explanation is required if you are base enough to suspect your betrothed wife i am just enough to believe in my adopted daughter i repliedand i beg you will give your best attention to what i am now going to sayi replied to that it is not fair to charge me with suspecting her i dont understand her confidential relations with julian gray and i dont understand her language and conduct in the presence of the police officer i claim it as my right to be satisfied on both those pointsin the character of the man who is to marry her there was my answer i spare you all that followed i only repeat what i said to lady janet she has commanded you to be silent if you obey her commands i owe it to myself and i owe it to my family to release you from your engagement choose between your duty to lady janet and your duty to me  he had mastered his temper at last he spoke with dignity and he spoke to the point his position was unassailable he claimed nothing but his right  my choice was made mercy answered when i gave you my promise upstairs  she waited a little struggling to control herself on the brink of the terrible revelation that was coming her eyes dropped before his her heart beat faster and faster but she struggled bravely with a desperate courage she faced the position if you are ready to listen she went on i am ready to tell you why i insisted on having the police officer sent out of the house  horace held up his hand warningly  stop he said that is not all  his infatuated jealousy of julian fatally misinterpreting her agitation distrusted her at the very outset she had limited herself to clearing up the one question of her interference with the officer of justice the other question of her relations with julian she had deliberately passed over horace instantly drew his own ungenerous conclusion  let us not misunderstand one another he said the explanation of your conduct in the other room is only one of the explanations which you owe me you have something else to account for let us begin with that if you please  she looked at him in unaffected surprise  what else have i to account for she asked  he again repeated his reply to lady janet  i have told you already he said i dont understand your confidential relations with julian gray  mercys color rose mercys eyes began to brighten  dont return to that she cried with an irrepressible outbreak of disgust dont for gods sake make me despise you at such a moment as this  his obstinacy only gathered fresh encouragement from that appeal to his better sense  i insist on returning to it  she had resolved to bear anything from himas her fit punishment for the deception of which she had been guilty but it was not in womanhood at the moment when the first words of her confession were trembling on her lips to endure horaces unworthy suspicion of her she rose from her seat and met his eye firmly  i refuse to degrade myself and to degrade mr julian gray by answering you she said  consider what you are doing he rejoined change your mind before it is too late  you have had my reply  those resolute words that steady resistance seemed to infuriate him he caught her roughly by the arm  you are as false as hell he cried its all over between you and me  the loud threatening tone in which he had spoken penetrated through the closed door of the diningroom the door instantly opened julian returned to the library  he had just set foot in the room when there was a knock at the other doorthe door that opened on the hall one of the menservants appeared with a telegraphic message in his hand mercy was the first to see it it was the matrons answer to the letter which she had sent to the refuge  for mr julian gray she asked  yes miss  give it to me  she signed to the man to withdraw and herself gave the telegram to julian it is addressed to you at my request she said you will recognize the name of the person who sends it and you will find a message in it for me  horace interfered before julian could open the telegram  another private understanding between you he said give me that telegram  julian looked at him with quiet contempt  it is directed to me he answeredand opened the envelope  the message inside was expressed in these terms i am as deeply interested in her as you are say that i have received her letter and that i welcome her back to the refuge with all my heart i have business this evening in the neighborhood i will call for her myself at mablethorpe house  the message explained itself of her own freewill she had made the expiation complete of her own freewill she was going back to the martyrdom of her old life bound as he knew himself to be to let no compromising word or action escape him in the presence of horace the irrepressible expression of julians admiration glowed in his eyes as they rested on mercy horace detected the look he sprang forward and tried to snatch the telegram out of julians hand  give it to me he said i will have it  julian silently put him back at armslength  maddened with rage he lifted his hand threateningly give it to me he repeated between his set teeth or it will be the worse for you  give it to me said mercy suddenly placing herself between them  julian gave it she turned and offered it to horace looking at him with a steady eye holding it out to him with a steady hand  read it she said  julians generous nature pitied the man who had insulted him julians great heart only remembered the friend of former times  spare him he said to mercy remember he is unprepared  she neither answered nor moved nothing stirred the horrible torpor of her resignation to her fate she knew that the time had come  julian appealed to horace  dont read it he cried hear what she has to say to you first  horaces hand answered him with a contemptuous gesture horaces eyes devoured word by word the matrons message  he looked up when he had read it through there was a ghastly change in his face as he turned it on mercy  she stood between the two men like a statue the life in her seemed to have died out except in her eyes her eyes rested on horace with a steady glittering calmness  the silence was only broken by the low murmuring of julians voice his face was hidden in his handshe was praying for them  horace spoke laying his finger on the telegram his voice had changed with the change in his face the tone was low and trembling no one would have recognized it as the tone of horaces voice  what does this mean he said to mercy it cant be for you  it is for me  what have you to do with a refuge  without a change in her face without a movement in her limbs she spoke the fatal words  i have come from a refuge and i am going back to a refuge mr horace holmcroft i am mercy merrick    chapter xxvi great heart and little heart  there was a pause  the moments passedand not one of the three moved the moments passedand not one of the three spoke insensibly the words of supplication died away on julians lips even his energy failed to sustain him tried as it now was by the crushing oppression of suspense the first trifling movement which suggested the idea of change and which so brought with it the first vague sense of relief came from mercy incapable of sustaining the prolonged effort of standing she drew back a little and took a chair no outward manifestation of emotion escaped her there she satwith the deathlike torpor of resignation in her facewaiting her sentence in silence from the man at whom she had hurled the whole terrible confession of the truth in one sentence  julian lifted his head as she moved he looked at horace and advancing a few steps looked again there was fear in his face as he suddenly turned it toward mercy  speak to him he said in a whisper rouse him before its too late  she moved mechanically in her chair she looked mechanically at julian  what more have i to say to him she asked in faint weary tones did i not tell him everything when i told him my name  the natural sound of her voice might have failed to affect horace the altered sound of it roused him he approached mercys chair with a dull surprise in his face and put his hand in a weak wavering way on her shoulder in that position he stood for a while looking down at her in silence  the one idea in him that found its way outward to expression was the idea of julian without moving his hand without looking up from mercy he spoke for the first time since the shock had fallen on him  where is julian he asked very quietly  i am here horaceclose by you  will you do me a service  certainly how can i help you  he considered a little before he replied his hand left mercys shoulder and went up to his headthen dropped at his side his next words were spoken in a sadly helpless bewildered way  i have an idea julian that i have been somehow to blame i said some hard words to you it was a little while since i dont clearly remember what it was all about my temper has been a good deal tried in this house i have never been used to the sort of thing that goes on heresecrets and mysteries and hateful lowlived quarrels we have no secrets and mysteries at home and as for quarrelsridiculous my mother and my sisters are highly bred women you know them gentlewomen in the best sense of the word when i am with them i have no anxieties i am not harassed at home by doubts of who people are and confusion about names and so on i suspect the contrast weighs a little on my mind and upsets it they make me oversuspicious among them here and it ends in my feeling doubts and fears that i cant get over doubts about you and fears about myself i have got a fear about myself now i want you to help me shall i make an apology first  dont say a word tell me what i can do  he turned his face toward julian for the first time  just look at me he said does it strike you that i am at all wrong in my mind tell me the truth old fellow  your nerves are a little shaken horace nothing more  he considered again after that reply his eyes remaining anxiously fixed on julians face  my nerves are a little shaken he repeated that is true i feel they are shaken i should like if you dont mind to make sure that its no worse will you help me to try if my memory is all right  i will do anything you like  ah you are a good fellow julianand a clearheaded fellow too which is very important just now look here i say its about a week since the troubles began in this house do you say so too  yes  the troubles came in with the coming of a woman from germany a stranger to us who behaved very violently in the diningroom there am i right so far  quite right  the woman carried matters with a high hand she claimed colonel roseberryi wish to be strictly accurateshe claimed the late colonel roseberry as her father she told a tiresome story about her having been robbed of her papers and her name by an impostor who had personated her she said the name of the impostor was mercy merrick and she afterward put the climax to it all she pointed to the lady who is engaged to be my wife and declared that she was mercy merrick tell me again is that right or wrong  julian answered him as before he went on speaking more confidently and more excitedly than he had spoken yet  now attend to this julian i am going to pass from my memory of what happened a week ago to my memory of what happened five minutes since you were present i want to know if you heard it too he paused and without taking his eyes off julian pointed backward to mercy there is the lady who is engaged to marry me he resumed did i or did i not hear her say that she had come out of a refuge and that she was going back to a refuge did i or did i not hear her own to my face that her name was mercy merrick answer me julian my good friend answer me for the sake of old times  his voice faltered as he spoke those imploring words under the dull blank of his face there appeared the first signs of emotion slowly forcing its way outward the stunned mind was reviving faintly julian saw his opportunity of aiding the recovery and seized it he took horace gently by the arm and pointed to mercy  there is your answer he said lookand pity her  she had not once interrupted them while they had been speaking she had changed her position again and that was all there was a writingtable at the side of her chair her outstretched arms rested on it her head had dropped on her arms and her face was hidden julians judgment had not misled him the utter selfabandonment of her attitude answered horace as no human language could have answered him he looked at her a quick spasm of pain passed across his face he turned once more to the faithful friend who had forgiven him his head fell on julians shoulder and he burst into tears  mercy started wildly to her feet and looked at the two men  o god she cried what have i done  julian quieted her by a motion of his hand  you have helped me to save him he said let his tears have their way wait  he put one arm round horace to support him the manly tenderness of the action the complete and noble pardon of past injuries which it implied touched mercy to the heart she went back to her chair again shame and sorrow overpowered her and again she hid her face from view  julian led horace to a seat and silently waited by him until he had recovered his selfcontrol he gratefully took the kind hand that had sustained him he said simply almost boyishly thank you julian i am better now  are you composed enough to listen to what is said to you julian asked  yes do you wish to speak to me  julian left him without immediately replying and returned to mercy  the time has come he said tell him alltruly unreservedly as you would tell it to me  she shuddered as he spoke have i not told him enough she asked do you want me to break his heart look at him look what i have done already  horace shrank from the ordeal as mercy shrank from it  no no i cant listen to it i darent listen to it he cried and rose to leave the room  julian had taken the good work in hand he never faltered over it for an instant horace had loved herhow dearly julian now knew for the first time the bare possibility that she might earn her pardon if she was allowed to plead her own cause was a possibility still left to let her win on horace to forgive her was death to the love that still filled his heart in secret but he never hesitated with a resolution which the weaker man was powerless to resist he took him by the arm and led him back to his place  for her sake and for your sake you shall not condemn her unheard he said to horace firmly one temptation to deceive you after another has tried her and she has resisted them all with no discovery to fear with a letter from the benefactress who loves her commanding her to be silent with everything that a woman values in this world to lose if she owns what she has donethis woman for the truths sake has spoken the truth does she deserve nothing at your hands in return for that respect her horaceand hear her  horace yielded julian turned to mercy  you have allowed me to guide you so far he said will you allow me to guide you still  her eyes sank before his her bosom rose and fell rapidly his influence over her maintained its sway she bowed her head in speechless submission  tell him julian proceeded in accents of entreaty not of commandtell him what your life has been tell him how you were tried and tempted with no friend near to speak the words which might have saved you and then he added raising her from the chair let him judge youif he can  he attempted to lead her across the room to the place which horace occupied but her submission had its limits halfway to the place she stopped and refused to go further julian offered her a chair she declined to take it standing with one hand on the back of the chair she waited for the word from horace which would permit her to speak she was resigned to the ordeal her face was calm her mind was clear the hardest of all humiliations to endurethe humiliation of acknowledging her nameshe had passed through nothing remained but to show her gratitude to julian by acceding to his wishes and to ask pardon of horace before they parted forever in a little while the matron would arrive at the houseand then it would be over  unwillingly horace looked at her their eyes met he broke out suddenly with something of his former violence  i cant realize it even now he cried is it true that you are not grace roseberry dont look at me say in one wordyes or no  she answered him humbly and sadly yes  you have done what that woman accused you of doing am i to believe that  you are to believe it sir  all the weakness of horaces character disclosed itself when she made that reply  infamous he exclaimed what excuse can you make for the cruel deception you have practiced on me too bad too bad there can be no excuse for you  she accepted his reproaches with unshaken resignation i have deserved it was all she said to herself i have deserved it  julian interposed once more in mercys defense  wait till you are sure there is no excuse for her horace he said quietly grant her justice if you can grant no more i leave you together  he advanced toward the door of the diningroom horaces weakness disclosed itself once more  dont leave me alone with her he burst out the misery of it is more than i can bear  julian looked at mercy her face brightened faintly that momentary expression of relief told him how truly he would be befriending her if he consented to remain in the room a position of retirement was offered to him by a recess formed by the central baywindow of the library if he occupied this place they could see or not see that he was present as their own inclinations might decide them  i will stay with you horace as long as you wish me to be here having answered in those terms he stopped as he passed mercy on his way to the window his quick and kindly insight told him that he might still be of some service to her a hint from him might show her the shortest and the easiest way of making her confession delicately and briefly he gave her the hint the first time i met you he said i saw that your life had had its troubles let us hear how those troubles began  he withdrew to his place in the recess for the first time since the fatal evening when she and grace roseberry had met in the french cottage mercy merrick looked back into the purgatory on earth of her past life and told her sad story simply and truly in these words    chapter xxvii magdalens apprenticeship  mr julian gray has asked me to tell him and to tell you mr holmcroft how my troubles began they began before my recollection they began with my birth  my mother as i have heard her say ruined her prospects when she was quite a young girl by a marriage with one of her fathers servantsthe groom who rode out with her she suffered poor creature the usual penalty of such conduct as hers after a short time she and her husband were separatedon the condition of her sacrificing to the man whom she had married the whole of the little fortune that she possessed in her right  gaining her freedom my mother had to gain her daily bread next her family refused to take her back she attached herself to a company of strolling players  she was earning a bare living in this way when my father accidentally met with her he was a man of high rank proud of his position and well known in the society of that time for his many accomplishments and his refined tastes my mothers beauty fascinated him he took her from the strolling players and surrounded her with every luxury that a woman could desire in a house of her own  i dont know how long they lived together i only know that my father at the time of my first recollections had abandoned her she had excited his suspicions of her fidelitysuspicions which cruelly wronged her as she declared to her dying day i believed her because she was my mother but i cannot expect others to do as i didi can only repeat what she said my father left her absolutely penniless he never saw her again and he refused to go to her when she sent to him in her last moments on earth  she was back again among the strolling players when i first remember her it was not an unhappy time for me i was the favorite pet and plaything of the poor actors they taught me to sing and to dance at an age when other children are just beginning to learn to read at five years old i was in what is called the profession and had made my poor little reputation in booths at country fairs as early as that mr holmcroft i had begun to live under an assumed namethe prettiest name they could invent for me to look well in the bills it was sometimes a hard struggle for us in bad seasons to keep body and soul together learning to sing and dance in public often meant learning to bear hunger and cold in private when i was apprenticed to the stage and yet i have lived to look back on my days with the strolling players as the happiest days of my life  i was ten years old when the first serious misfortune that i can remember fell upon me my mother died worn out in the prime of her life and not long afterward the strolling company brought to the end of its resources by a succession of bad seasons was broken up  i was left on the world a nameless penniless outcast with one fatal inheritancegod knows i can speak of it without vanity after what i have gone throughthe inheritance of my mothers beauty  my only friends were the poor starvedout players two of them husband and wife obtained engagements in another company and i was included in the bargain the new manager by whom i was employed was a drunkard and a brute one night i made a trifling mistake in the course of the performancesand i was savagely beaten for it perhaps i had inherited some of my fathers spiritwithout i hope also inheriting my fathers pitiless nature however that may be i resolved no matter what became of me never again to serve the man who had beaten me i unlocked the door of our miserable lodging at daybreak the next morning and at ten years old with my little bundle in my hand i faced the world alone  my mother had confided to me in her last moments my fathers name and the address of his house in london he may feel some compassion for you she said though he feels none for me try him i had a few shillings the last pitiful remains of my wages in my pocket and i was not far from london but i never went near my father child as i was i would have starved and died rather than go to him i had loved my mother dearly and i hated the man who had turned his back on her when she lay on her deathbed it made no difference to me that he happened to be my father  does this confession revolt you you look at me mr holmcroft as if it did  think a little sir does what i have just said condemn me as a heartless creature even in my earliest years what is a father to a childwhen the child has never sat on his knee and never had a kiss or a present from him if we had met in the street we should not have known each other perhaps in afterdays when i was starving in london i may have begged of my father without knowing it and he may have thrown his daughter a penny to get rid of her without knowing it either what is there sacred in the relations between father and child when they are such relations as these even the flowers of the field cannot grow without light and air to help them how is a childs love to grow with nothing to help it  my small savings would have been soon exhausted even if i had been old enough and strong enough to protect them myself as things were my few shillings were taken from me by gypsies i had no reason to complain they gave me food and the shelter of their tents and they made me of use to them in various ways after a while hard times came to the gypsies as they had come to the strolling players some of them were imprisoned the rest were dispersed it was the season for hopgathering at the time i got employment among the hoppickers next and that done i went to london with my new friends  i have no wish to weary and pain you by dwelling on this part of my childhood in detail it will be enough if i tell you that i sank lower and lower until i ended in selling matches in the street my mothers legacy got me many a sixpence which my matches would never have charmed out of the pockets of strangers if i had been an ugly child my face which was destined to be my greatest misfortune in afteryears was my best friend in those days  is there anything mr holmcroft in the life i am now trying to describe which reminds you of a day when we were out walking together not long since  i surprised and offended you i remember and it was not possible for me to explain my conduct at the time do you recollect the little wandering girl with the miserable faded nosegay in her hand who ran after us and begged for a halfpenny i shocked you by bursting out crying when the child asked us to buy her a bit of bread now you know why i was so sorry for her now you know why i offended you the next day by breaking an engagement with your mother and sisters and going to see that child in her wretched home after what i have confessed you will admit that my poor little sister in adversity had the first claim on me  let me go on i am sorry if i have distressed you let me go on  the forlorn wanderers of the streets have as i found it one way always open to them of presenting their sufferings to the notice of their rich and charitable fellowcreatures they have only to break the lawand they make a public appearance in a court of justice if the circumstances connected with their offense are of an interesting kind they gain a second advantage they are advertised all over england by a report in the newspapers  yes even i have my knowledge of the law i know that it completely overlooked me as long as i respected it but on two different occasions it became my best friend when i set it at defiance my first fortunate offense was committed when i was just twelve years old  it was evening time i was half dead with starvation the rain was falling the night was coming on i beggedopenly loudly as only a hungry child can beg an old lady in a carriage at a shop door complained of my importunity the policeman did his duty the law gave me a supper and shelter at the stationhouse that night i appeared at the police court and questioned by the magistrate i told my story truly it was the everyday story of thousands of children like me but it had one element of interest in it i confessed to having had a father he was then dead who had been a man of rank and i owned just as openly as i owned everything else that i had never applied to him for help in resentment of his treatment of my mother this incident was new i suppose it led to the appearance of my case in the newspapers the reporters further served my interests by describing me as pretty and interesting subscriptions were sent to the court a benevolent married couple in a respectable sphere of life visited the workhouse to see me i produced a favorable impression on themespecially on the wife i was literally friendless i had no unwelcome relatives to follow me and claim me the wife was childless the husband was a goodnatured man it ended in their taking me away with them to try me in service  i have always felt the aspiration no matter how low i may have fallen to struggle upward to a position above me to rise in spite of fortune superior to my lot in life perhaps some of my fathers pride may be at the root of this restless feeling in me it seems to be a part of my nature it brought me into this houseand it will go with me out of this house is it my curse or my blessing i am not able to decide  on the first night when i slept in my new home i said to myself they have taken me to be their servant i will be something more than thatthey shall end in taking me for their child before i had been a week in the house i was the wifes favorite companion in the absence of her husband at his place of business she was a highly accomplished woman greatly her husbands superior in cultivation and unfortunately for herself also his superior in years the love was all on her side excepting certain occasions on which he roused her jealousy they lived together on sufficiently friendly terms she was one of the many wives who resign themselves to be disappointed in their husbandsand he was one of the many husbands who never know what their wives really think of them her one great happiness was in teaching me i was eager to learn i made rapid progress at my pliant age i soon acquired the refinements of language and manner which characterized my mistress it is only the truth to say that the cultivation which has made me capable of personating a lady was her work  for three happy years i lived under that friendly roof i was between fifteen and sixteen years of age when the fatal inheritance from my mother cast its first shadow on my life one miserable day the wifes motherly love for me changed in an instant to the jealous hatred that never forgives can you guess the reason the husband fell in love with me  i was innocent i was blameless he owned it himself to the clergyman who was with him at his death by that time years had passed it was too late to justify me  he was at an age when i was under his care when men are usually supposed to regard women with tranquillity if not with indifference it had been the habit of years with me to look on him as my second father in my innocent ignorance of the feeling which really inspired him i permitted him to indulge in little paternal familiarities with me which inflamed his guilty passion his wife discovered himnot i no words can describe my astonishment and my horror when the first outbreak of her indignation forced on me the knowledge of the truth on my knees i declared myself guiltless on my knees i implored her to do justice to my purity and my youth at other times the sweetest and the most considerate of women jealousy had now transformed her to a perfect fury she accused me of deliberately encouraging him she declared she would turn me out of the house with her own hands like other easytempered men her husband had reserves of anger in him which it was dangerous to provoke when his wife lifted her hand against me he lost all selfcontrol on his side he openly told her that life was worth nothing to him without me he openly avowed his resolution to go with me when i left the house the maddened woman seized him by the armi saw that and saw no more i ran out into the street panicstricken a cab was passing i got into it before he could open the house door and drove to the only place of refuge i could think ofa small shop kept by the widowed sister of one of our servants here i obtained shelter for the night the next day he discovered me he made his vile proposals he offered me the whole of his fortune he declared his resolution say what i might to return the next day that night by help of the good woman who had taken care of meunder cover of the darkness as if i had been to blamei was secretly removed to the east end of london and placed under the charge of a trustworthy person who lived in a very humble way by letting lodgings  here in a little back garret at the top of the house i was thrown again on the worldan age when it was doubly perilous for me to be left to my own resources to earn the bread i ate and the roof that covered me  i claim no credit to myselfyoung as i was placed as i was between the easy life of vice and the hard life of virtuefor acting as i did the man simply horrified me my natural impulse was to escape from him but let it be remembered before i approach the saddest part of my sad story that i was an innocent girl and that i was at least not to blame  forgive me for dwelling as i have done on my early years i shrink from speaking of the events that are still to come  in losing the esteem of my first benefactress i had in my friendless position lost all hold on an honest lifeexcept the one frail hold of needlework the only reference of which i could now dispose was the recommendation of me by my landlady to a place of business which largely employed expert needlewomen it is needless for me to tell you how miserably work of that sort is remunerated you have read about it in the newspapers as long as my health lasted i contrived to live and to keep out of debt few girls could have resisted as long as i did the slowlypoisoning influences of crowded workroom insufficient nourishment and almost total privation of exercise my life as a child had been a life in the open air it had helped to strengthen a constitution naturally hardy naturally free from all taint of hereditary disease but my time came at last under the cruel stress laid on it my health gave way i was struck down by low fever and sentence was pronounced on me by my fellowlodgers ah poor thing her troubles will soon be at an end  the prediction might have proved truei might never have committed the errors and endured the sufferings of after yearsif i had fallen ill in another house  but it was my good or my evil fortunei dare not say whichto have interested in myself and my sorrows an actress at a suburban theatre who occupied the room under mine except when her stage duties took her away for two or three hours in the evening this noble creature never left my bedside ill as she could afford it her purse paid my inevitable expenses while i lay helpless the landlady moved by her example accepted half the weekly rent of my room the doctor with the christian kindness of his profession would take no fees all that the tenderest care could accomplish was lavished on me my youth and my constitution did the rest i struggled back to lifeand then i took up my needle again  it may surprise you that i should have failed having an actress for my dearest friend to use the means of introduction thus offered to me to try the stageespecially as my childish training had given me in some small degree a familiarity with the art  i had only one motive for shrinking from an appearance at the theatrebut it was strong enough to induce me to submit to any alternative that remained no matter how hopeless it might be if i showed myself on the public stage my discovery by the man from whom i had escaped would be only a question of time i knew him to be habitually a playgoer and a subscriber to a theatrical newspaper i had even heard him speak of the theatre to which my friend was attached and compare it advantageously with places of amusement of far higher pretensions sooner or later if i joined the company he would be certain to go and see the new actress the bare thought of it reconciled me to returning to my needle before i was strong enough to endure the atmosphere of the crowded workroom i obtained permission as a favor to resume my occupation at home  surely my choice was the choice of a virtuous girl and yet the day when i returned to my needle was the fatal day of my life  i had now not only to provide for the wants of the passing houri had my debts to pay it was only to be done by toiling harder than ever and by living more poorly than ever i soon paid the penalty in my weakened state of leading such a life as this one evening my head turned suddenly giddy my heart throbbed frightfully i managed to open the window and to let the fresh air into the room and i felt better but i was not sufficiently recovered to be able to thread my needle i thought to myself if i go out for half an hour a little exercise may put me right again i had not as i suppose been out more than ten minutes when the attack from which i had suffered in my room was renewed there was no shop near in which i could take refuge i tried to ring the bell of the nearest house door before i could reach it i fainted in the street  how long hunger and weakness left me at the mercy of the first stranger who might pass by it is impossible for me to say  when i partially recovered my senses i was conscious of being under shelter somewhere and of having a wineglass containing some cordial drink held to my lips by a man i managed to swallowi dont know how little or how much the stimulant had a very strange effect on me reviving me at first it ended in stupefying me i lost my senses once more  when i next recovered myself the day was breaking i was in a bed in a strange room a nameless terror seized me i called out three or four women came in whose faces betrayed even to my inexperienced eyes the shameless infamy of their lives i started up in the bed i implored them to tell me where i was and what had happened  spare me i can say no more not long since you heard miss roseberry call me an outcast from the streets now you knowas god is my judge i am speaking the truthnow you know what made me an outcast and in what measure i deserved my disgrace    her voice faltered her resolution failed her for the first time  give me a few minutes she said in low pleading tones if i try to go on now i am afraid i shall cry  she took the chair which julian had placed for her turning her face aside so that neither of the men could see it one of her hands was pressed over her bosom the other hung listlessly at her side  julian rose from the place that he had occupied horace neither moved nor spoke his head was on his breast the traces of tears on his cheeks owned mutely that she had touched his heart would he forgive her julian passed on and approached mercys chair  in silence he took the hand which hung at her side in silence he lifted it to his lips and kissed it as her brother might have kissed it she started but she never looked up some strange fear of discovery seemed to possess her horace she whispered timidly julian made no reply he went back to his place and allowed her to think it was horace  the sacrifice was immense enoughfeeling toward her as he feltto be worthy of the man who made it  a few minutes had been all she asked for in a few minutes she turned toward them again her sweet voice was steady once more her eyes rested softly on horace as she went on  what was it possible for a friendless girl in my position to do when the full knowledge of the outrage had been revealed to me  if i had possessed near and dear relatives to protect and advise me the wretches into whose hands i had fallen might have felt the penalty of the law i knew no more of the formalities which set the law in motion than a child but i had another alternative you will say charitable societies would have received me and helped me if i had stated my case to them i knew no more of the charitable societies than i knew of the law at least then i might have gone back to the honest people among whom i had lived when i received my freedom after the interval of some days i was ashamed to go back to the honest people helplessly and hopelessly without sin or choice of mine i drifted as thousands of other women have drifted into the life which set a mark on me for the rest of my days  are you surprised at the ignorance which this confession reveals  you who have your solicitors to inform you of legal remedies and your newspapers circulars and active friends to sound the praises of charitable institutions continually in your earsyou who possess these advantages have no idea of the outer world of ignorance in which your lost fellowcreatures live they know nothing unless they are rogues accustomed to prey on society of your benevolent schemes to help them the purpose of public charities and the way to discover and apply to them ought to be posted at the corner of every street what do we know of public dinners and eloquent sermons and neatly printed circulars every now and then the ease of some forlorn creature generally of a woman who has committed suicide within five minutes walk perhaps of an institution which would have opened its doors to her appears in the newspapers shocks you dreadfully and is then forgotten again take as much pains to make charities and asylums known among the people without money as are taken to make a new play a new journal or a new medicine known among the people with money and you will save many a lost creature who is perishing now  you will forgive and understand me if i say no more of this period of my life let me pass to the new incident in my career which brought me for the second time before the public notice in a court of law  sad as my experience has been it has not taught me to think ill of human nature i had found kind hearts to feel for me in my former troubles and i had friendsfaithful selfdenying generous friendsamong my sisters in adversity now one of these poor women she has gone i am glad to think from the world that used her so hardly especially attracted my sympathies she was the gentlest the most unselfish creature i have ever met with we lived together like sisters more than once in the dark hours when the thought of selfdestruction comes to a desperate woman the image of my poor devoted friend left to suffer alone rose in my mind and restrained me you will hardly understand it but even we had our happy days when she or i had a few shillings to spare we used to offer one another little presents and enjoy our simple pleasure in giving and receiving as keenly as if we had been the most reputable women living  one day i took my friend into a shop to buy her a ribbononly a bow for her dress she was to choose it and i was to pay for it and it was to be the prettiest ribbon that money could buy  the shop was full we had to wait a little before we could be served  next to me as i stood at the counter with my companion was a gaudilydressed woman looking at some handkerchiefs the handkerchiefs were finely embroidered but the smart lady was hard to please she tumbled them up disdainfully in a heap and asked for other specimens from the stock in the shop the man in clearing the handkerchiefs out of the way suddenly missed one he was quite sure of it from a peculiarity in the embroidery which made the handkerchief especially noticeable i was poorly dressed and i was close to the handkerchiefs after one look at me he shouted to the superintendent shut the door there is a thief in the shop  the door was closed the lost handkerchief was vainly sought for on the counter and on the floor a robbery had been committed and i was accused of being the thief  i will say nothing of what i felti will only tell you what happened  i was searched and the handkerchief was discovered on me the woman who had stood next to me on finding herself threatened with discovery had no doubt contrived to slip the stolen handkerchief into my pocket only an accomplished thief could have escaped detection in that way without my knowledge it was useless in the face of the facts to declare my innocence i had no character to appeal to my friend tried to speak for me but what was she only a lost woman like myself my landladys evidence in favor of my honesty produced no effect it was against her that she let lodgings to people in my position i was prosecuted and found guilty the tale of my disgrace is now complete mr holmcroft no matter whether i was innocent or not the shame of it remainsi have been imprisoned for theft  the matron of the prison was the next person who took an interest in me she reported favorably of my behavior to the authorities and when i had served my time as the phrase was among us she gave me a letter to the kind friend and guardian of my later yearsto the lady who is coming here to take me back with her to the refuge  from this time the story of my life is little more than the story of a womans vain efforts to recover her lost place in the world  the matron on receiving me into the refuge frankly acknowledged that there were terrible obstacles in my way but she saw that i was sincere and she felt a good womans sympathy and compassion for me on my side i did not shrink from beginning the slow and weary journey back again to a reputable life from the humblest startingpointfrom domestic service after first earning my new character in the refuge i obtained a trial in a respectable house i worked hard and worked uncomplainingly but my mothers fatal legacy was against me from the first my personal appearance excited remark my manners and habits were not the manners and habits of the women among whom my lot was cast i tried one place after anotheralways with the same results suspicion and jealousy i could endure but i was defenseless when curiosity assailed me in its turn sooner or later inquiry led to discovery sometimes the servants threatened to give warning in a bodyand i was obliged to go sometimes where there was a young man in the family scandal pointed at me and at himand again i was obliged to go if you care to know it miss roseberry can tell you the story of those sad days i confided it to her on the memorable night when we met in the french cottage i have no heart repeat it now after a while i wearied of the hopeless struggle despair laid its hold on mei lost all hope in the mercy of god more than once i walked to one or other of the bridges and looked over the parapet at the river and said to myself other women have done it why shouldnt i  you saved me at that time mr grayas you have saved me since i was one of your congregation when you preached in the chapel of the refuge you reconciled others besides me to our hard pilgrimage in their name and in mine sir i thank you  i forget how long it was after the bright day when you comforted and sustained us that the war broke out between france and germany but i can never forget the evening when the matron sent for me into her own room and said my dear your life here is a wasted life if you have courage enough left to try it i can give you another chance  i passed through a month of probation in a london hospital a week after that i wore the red cross of the geneva conventioni was appointed nurse in a french ambulance when you first saw me mr holmcroft i still had my nurses dress on hidden from you and from everybody under a gray cloak  you know what the next event was you know how i entered this house  i have not tried to make the worst of my trials and troubles in telling you what my life has been i have honestly described it for what it was when i met with miss roseberrya life without hope may you never know the temptation that tried me when the shell struck its victim in the french cottage there she laydead her name was untainted her future promised me the reward which had been denied to the honest efforts of a penitent woman my lost place in the world was offered back to me on the one condition that i stooped to win it by a fraud i had no prospect to look forward to i had no friend near to advise me and to save me the fairest years of my womanhood had been wasted in the vain struggle to recover my good name such was my position when the possibility of personating miss roseberry first forced itself on my mind impulsively recklesslywickedly if you likei seized the opportunity and let you pass me through the german lines under miss roseberrys name arrived in england having had time to reflect i made my first and last effort to draw back before it was too late i went to the refuge and stopped on the opposite side of the street looking at it the old hopeless life of irretrievable disgrace confronted me as i fixed my eyes on the familiar door the horror of returning to that life was more than i could force myself to endure an empty cab passed me at the moment the driver held up his hand in sheer despair i stopped him and when he said where to in sheer despair again i answered mablethorpe house  of what i have suffered in secret since my own successful deception established me under lady janets care i shall say nothing many things which must have surprised you in my conduct are made plain to you by this time you must have noticed long since that i was not a happy woman now you know why  my confession is made my conscience has spoken at last you are released from your promise to meyou are free thank mr julian gray if i stand here selfaccused of the offense that i have committed before the man whom i have wronged    chapter xxviii sentence is pronounced on her  it was done the last tones of her voice died away in silence  her eyes still rested on horace after hearing what he had heard could he resist that gentle pleading look would he forgive her a while since julian had seen tears on his cheeks and had believed that he felt for her why was he now silent was it possible that he only felt for himself  for the last timeat the crisis of her lifejulian spoke for her he had never loved her as he loved her at that moment it tried even his generous nature to plead her cause with horace against himself but he had promised her without reserve all the help that her truest friend could offer faithfully and manfully he redeemed his promise  horace he said  horace slowly looked up julian rose and approached him  she has told you to thank me if her conscience has spoken thank the noble nature which answered when i called upon it own the priceless value of a woman who can speak the truth her heartfelt repentance is a joy in heaven shall it not plead for her on earth honor her if you are a christian feel for her if you are a man  he waited horace never answered him  mercys eyes turned tearfully on julian his heart was the heart that felt for her his words were the words which comforted and pardoned her when she looked back again at horace it was with an effort his last hold on her was lost in her inmost mind a thought rose unbiddena thought which was not to be repressed can i ever have loved this man  she advanced a step toward him it was not possible even yet to completely forgot the past she held out her hand  he rose on his sidewithout looking at her  before we part forever she said to him will you take my hand as a token that you forgive me  he hesitated he half lifted his hand the next moment the generous impulse died away in him in its place came the mean fear of what might happen if he trusted himself to the dangerous fascination of her touch his hand dropped again at his side he turned away quickly  i cant forgive her he said  with that horrible confessionwithout even a last look at herhe left the room  at the moment when he opened the door julians contempt for him burst its way through all restraints  horace he said i pity you  as the words escaped him he looked back at mercy she had turned aside from both of themshe had retired to a distant part of the library the first bitter foretaste of what was in store for her when she faced the world again had come to her from horace the energy which had sustained her thus far quailed before the dreadful prospectdoubly dreadful to a womanof obloquy and contempt she sank on her knees before a little couch in the darkest corner of the room o christ have mercy on me that was her prayerno more  julian followed her he waited a little then his kind hand touched her his friendly voice fell consolingly on her ear  rise poor wounded heart beautiful purified soul gods angels rejoice over you take your place among the noblest of gods creatures  he raised her as he spoke all her heart went out to him she caught his handshe pressed it to her bosom she pressed it to her lipsthen dropped it suddenly and stood before him trembling like a frightened child  forgive me was all she could say i was so lost and lonelyand you are so good to me  she tried to leave him it was uselessher strength was gone she caught at the head of the couch to support herself he looked at her the confession of his love was just rising to his lipshe looked again and checked it no not at that moment not when she was helpless and ashamed not when her weakness might make her yield only to regret it at a later time the great heart which had spared her and felt for her from the first spared her and felt for her now  he too left herbut not without a word at parting  dont think of your future life just yet he said gently i have something to propose when rest and quiet have restored you he opened the nearest doorthe door of the diningroomand went out  the servants engaged in completing the decoration of the dinnertable noticed when mr julian entered the room that his eyes were brighter than ever he looked they remarked like a man who expected good news they were inclined to suspectthough he was certainly rather young for itthat her ladyships nephew was in a fair way of preferment in the church    mercy seated herself on the couch  there are limits in the physical organization of man to the action of pain when suffering has reached a given point of intensity the nervous sensibility becomes incapable of feeling more the rule of nature in this respect applies not only to sufferers in the body but to sufferers in the mind as well grief rage terror have also their appointed limits the moral sensibility like the nervous sensibility reaches its period of absolute exhaustion and feels no more  the capacity for suffering in mercy had attained its term alone in the library she could feel the physical relief of repose she could vaguely recall julians parting words to her and sadly wonder what they meantshe could do no more  an interval passed a brief interval of perfect rest  she recovered herself sufficiently to be able to look at her watch and to estimate the lapse of time that might yet pass before julian returned to her as he had promised while her mind was still languidly following this train of thought she was disturbed by the ringing of a bell in the hall used to summon the servant whose duties were connected with that part of the house in leaving the library horace had gone out by the door which led into the hall and had failed to close it she plainly heard the belland a moment later more plainly still she heard lady janets voice  she started to her feet lady janets letter was still in the pocket of her apronthe letter which imperatively commanded her to abstain from making the very confession that had just passed her lips it was near the dinner hour and the library was the favorite place in which the mistress of the house and her guests assembled at that time it was no matter of doubt it was an absolute certainty that lady janet had only stopped in the hall on her way into the room  the alternative for mercy lay between instantly leaving the library by the diningroom dooror remaining where she was at the risk of being sooner or later compelled to own that she had deliberately disobeyed her benefactress exhausted by what she had already suffered she stood trembling and irresolute incapable of deciding which alternative she should choose  lady janets voice clear and resolute penetrated into the room she was reprimanding the servant who had answered the bell  is it your duty in my house to look after the lamps  yes my lady  and is it my duty to pay you your wages  if you please my lady  why do i find the light in the hall dim and the wick of that lamp smoking i have not failed in my duty to you dont let me find you failing again in your duty to me  never had lady janets voice sounded so sternly in mercys ear as it sounded now if she spoke with that tone of severity to a servant who had neglected a lamp what had her adopted daughter to expect when she discovered that her entreaties and her commands had been alike set at defiance  having administered her reprimand lady janet had not done with the servant yet she had a question to put to him next  where is miss roseberry  in the library my lady  mercy returned to the couch she could stand no longer she had not even resolution enough left to lift her eyes to the door  lady janet came in more rapidly than usual she advanced to the couch and tapped mercy playfully on the cheek with two of her fingers  you lazy child not dressed for dinner oh fie fie  her tone was as playfully affectionate as the action which had accompanied her words in speechless astonishment mercy looked up at her  always remarkable for the taste and splendor of her dress lady janet had on this occasion surpassed herself there she stood revealed in her grandest velvet her richest jewelry her finest lacewith no one to entertain at the dinnertable but the ordinary members of the circle at mablethorpe house noticing this as strange to begin with mercy further observed for the first time in her experience that lady janets eyes avoided meeting hers the old lady took her place companionably on the couch she ridiculed her lazy childs plain dress without an ornament of any sort on it with her best grace she affectionately put her arm round mercys waist and rearranged with her own hand the disordered locks of mercys hairbut the instant mercy herself looked at her lady janets eyes discovered something supremely interesting in the familiar objects that surrounded her on the library walls  how were these changes to be interpreted to what possible conclusion did they point  julians profounder knowledge of human nature if julian had been present might have found a clew to the mystery he might have surmised incredible as it was that mercys timidity before lady janet was fully reciprocated by lady janets timidity before mercy it was even so the woman whose immovable composure had conquered grace roseberrys utmost insolence in the hour of her triumphthe woman who without once flinching had faced every other consequence of her resolution to ignore mercys true position in the housequailed for the first time when she found herself face to face with the very person for who m she had suffered and sacrificed so much she had shrunk from the meeting with mercy as mercy had shrunk from the meeting with her the splendor of her dress meant simply that when other excuses for delaying the meeting downstairs had all been exhausted the excuse of a long and elaborate toilet had been tried next even the moments occupied in reprimanding the servant had been moments seized on as the pretext for another delay the hasty entrance into the room the nervous assumption of playfulness in language and manner the evasive and wandering eyes were all referable to the same cause in the presence of others lady janet had successfully silenced the protest of her own inbred delicacy and inbred sense of honor in the presence of mercy whom she loved with a mothers lovein the presence of mercy for whom she had stooped to deliberate concealment of the truthall that was high and noble in the womans nature rose in her and rebuked her what will the daughter of my adoption the child of my first and last experience of maternal love think of me now that i have made myself an accomplice in the fraud of which she is ashamed how can i look her in the face when i have not hesitated out of selfish consideration for my own tranquillity to forbid that frank avowal of the truth which her finer sense of duty had spontaneously bound her to make those were the torturing questions in lady janets mind while her arm was wound affectionately round mercys waist while her fingers were busying themselves familiarly with the arrangement of mercys hair thence and thence only sprang the impulse which set her talking with an uneasy affectation of frivolity of any topic within the range of conversation so long as it related to the future and completely ignored the present and the past  the winter here is unendurable lady janet began i have been thinking grace about what we had better do next  mercy started lady janet had called her grace lady janet was still deliberately assuming to be innocent of the faintest suspicion of the truth  no resumed her ladyship affecting to misunderstand mercys movement you are not to go up now and dress there is no time and i am quite ready to excuse you you are a foil to me my dear you have reached the perfection of shabbiness ah i remember when i had my whims and fancies too and when i looked well in anything i wore just as you do no more of that as i was saying i have been thinking and planning what we are to do we really cant stay here cold one day and hot the nextwhat a climate as for society what do we lose if we go away there is no such thing as society now assemblies of welldressed mobs meet at each others houses tear each others clothes tread on each others toes if you are particularly lucky you sit on the staircase you get a tepid ice and you hear vapid talk in slang phrases all round you there is modern society if we had a good opera it would be something to stay in london for look at the programme for the season on that tablepromising as much as possible on paper and performing as little as possible on the stage the same works sung by the same singers year after year to the same stupid peoplein short the dullest musical evenings in europe no the more i think of it the more plainly i perceive that there is but one sensible choice before us we must go abroad set that pretty head to work choose north or south east or west its all the same to me where shall we go  mercy looked at her quickly as she put the question  lady janet more quickly yet looked away at the programme of the operahouse still the same melancholy false pretenses still the same useless and cruel delay incapable of enduring the position now forced upon her mercy put her hand into the pocket of her apron and drew from it lady janets letter  will your ladyship forgive me she began in faint faltering tones if i venture on a painful subject i hardly dare acknowledge in spite of her resolution to speak out plainly the memory of past love and past kindness prevailed with her the next words died away on her lips she could only hold up the letter  lady janet declined to see the letter lady janet suddenly became absorbed in the arrangement of her bracelets  i know what you darent acknowledge you foolish child she exclaimed you darent acknowledge that you are tired of this dull house my dear i am entirely of your opinioni am weary of my own magnificence i long to be living in one snug little room with one servant to wait on me ill tell you what we will do we will go to paris in the first place my excellent migliore prince of couriers shall be the only person in attendance he shall take a lodging for us in one of the unfashionable quarters of paris we will rough it grace to use the slang phrase merely for a change we will lead what they call a bohemian life i know plenty of writers and painters and actors in paristhe liveliest society in the world my dear until one gets tired of them we will dine at the restaurant and go to the play and drive about in shabby little hired carriages and when it begins to get monotonous which it is only too sure to do we will spread our wings and fly to italy and cheat the winter in that way there is a plan for you migliore is in town i will send to him this evening and we will start tomorrow  mercy made another effort  i entreat your ladyship to pardon me she resumed i have something serious to say i am afraid  i understand you are afraid of crossing the channel and you dont like to acknowledge it pooh the passage barely lasts two hours we will shut ourselves up in a private cabin i will send at oncethe courier may be engaged ring the bell  lady janet i must submit to my hard lot i cannot hope to associate myself again with any future plans of yours  what you are afraid of our bohemian life in paris observe this grace if there is one thing i hate more than another it is an old head on young shoulders i say no more ring the bell  this cannot go on lady janet no words can say how unworthy i feel of your kindness how ashamed i am  upon my honor my dear i agree with you you ought to be ashamed at your age of making me get up to ring the bell  her obstinacy was immovable she attempted to rise from the couch but one choice was left to mercy she anticipated lady janet and rang the bell  the manservant came in he had his little lettertray in his hand with a card on it and a sheet of paper beside the card which looked like an open letter  you know where my courier lives when he is in london asked lady janet  yes my lady  send one of the grooms to him on horseback i am in a hurry the courier is to come here without fail tomorrow morningin time for the tidal train to paris you understand  yes my lady  what have you got there anything for me  for miss roseberry my lady  as he answered the man handed the card and the open letter to mercy  the lady is waiting in the morningroom miss she wished me to say she has time to spare and she will wait for you if you are not ready yet  having delivered his message in those terms he withdrew  mercy read the name on the card the matron had arrived she looked at the letter next it appeared to be a printed circular with some lines in pencil added on the empty page printed lines and written lines swam before her eyes she felt rather than saw lady janets attention steadily and suspiciously fixed on her with the matrons arrival the foredoomed end of the flimsy false pretenses and the cruel delays had come  a friend of yours my dear  yes lady janet  am i acquainted with her  i think not lady janet  you appear to be agitated does your visitor bring bad news is there anything that i can do for you  you can addimmeasurably add madamto all your past kindness if you will only bear with me and forgive me  bear with you and forgive you i dont understand  i will try to explain whatever else you may think of me lady janet for gods sake dont think me ungrateful  lady janet held up her hand for silence  i dislike explanations she said sharply nobody ought to know that better than you perhaps the ladys letter will explain for you why have you not looked at it yet  i am in great trouble madam as you noticed just now  have you any objection to my knowing who your visitor is  no lady janet  let me look at her card then  mercy gave the matrons card to lady janet as she had given the matrons telegram to horace  lady janet read the name on the cardconsidereddecided that it was a name quite unknown to herand looked next at the address western district refuge milburn road  a lady connected with a refuge she said speaking to herself and calling here by appointmentif i remember the servants message a strange time to choose if she has come for a subscription  she paused her brow contracted her face hardened a word from her would now have brought the interview to its inevitable end and she refused to speak the word to the last moment she persisted in ignoring the truth placing the card on the couch at her side she pointed with her long yellowwhite forefinger to the printed letter lying side by side with her own letter on mercys lap  do you mean to read it or not she asked  mercy lifted her eyes fast filling with tears to lady janets face  may i beg that your ladyship will read it for me she saidand placed the matrons letter in lady janets hand  it was a printed circular announcing a new development in the charitable work of the refuge subscribers were informed that it had been decided to extend the shelter and the training of the institution thus far devoted to fallen women alone so as to include destitute and helpless children found wandering in the streets the question of the number of children to be thus rescued and protected was left dependent as a matter of course on the bounty of the friends of the refuge the cost of the maintenance of each child being stated at the lowest possible rate a list of influential persons who had increased their subscriptions so as to cover the cost and a brief statement of the progress already made with the new work completed the appeal and brought the circular to its end  the lines traced in pencil in the matrons handwriting followed on the blank page  your letter tells me my dear that you would likeremembering your own childhoodto be employed when you return among us in saving other poor children left helpless on the world our circular will inform you that i am able to meet your wishes my first errand this evening in your neighborhood was to take charge of a poor childa little girlwho stands sadly in need of our care i have ventured to bring her with me thinking she might help to reconcile you to the coming change in your life you will find us both waiting to go back with you to the old home i write this instead of saying it hearing from the servant that you are not alone and being unwilling to intrude myself as a stranger on the lady of the house  lady janet read the penciled lines as she had read the printed sentences aloud without a word of comment she laid the letter where she had laid the card and rising from her seat stood for a moment in stern silence looking at mercy the sudden change in her which the letter had producedquietly as it had taken placewas terrible to see on the frowning brow in the flashing eyes on the hardened lips outraged love and outraged pride looked down on the lost woman and said as if in words you have roused us at last  if that letter means anything she said it means you are about to leave my house there can be but one reason for your taking such a step as that  it is the only atonement i can make madam  i see another letter on your lap is it my letter  yes  have you read it  i have read it  have you seen horace holmcroft  yes  have you told horace holmcroft  oh lady janet  dont interrupt me have you told horace holmcroft what my letter positively forbade you to communicate either to him or to any living creature i want no protestations and excuses answer me instantly and answer in one wordyes or no  not even that haughty language not even those pitiless tones could extinguish in mercys heart the sacred memories of past kindness and past love she fell on her kneesher outstretched hands touched lady janets dress lady janet sharply drew her dress away and sternly repeated her last words  yes or no  yes  she had owned it at last to this end lady janet had submitted to grace roseberry had offended horace holmcroft had stooped for the first time in her life to concealments and compromises that degraded her after all that she had sacrificed and suffered there mercy knelt at her feet selfconvicted of violating her commands trampling on her feelings deserting her house and who was the woman who had done this the same woman who had perpetrated the fraud and who had persisted in the fraud until her benefactress had descended to become her accomplice then and then only she had suddenly discovered that it was her sacred duty to tell the truth  in proud silence the great lady met the blow that had fallen on her in proud silence she turned her back on her adopted daughter and walked to the door  mercy made her last appeal to the kind friend whom she had offendedto the second mother whom she had loved  lady janet lady janet dont leave me without a word oh madam try to feel for me a little i am returning to a life of humiliationthe shadow of my old disgrace is falling on me once more we shall never meet again even though i have not deserved it let my repentance plead with you say you forgive me  lady janet turned round on the threshold of the door  i never forgive ingratitude she said go back to the refuge  the door opened and closed on her mercy was alone again in the room  unforgiven by horace unforgiven by lady janet she put her hands to her burning head and tried to think oh for the cool air of the night oh for the friendly shelter of the refuge she could feel those sad longings in her it was impossible to think  she rang the belland shrank back the instant she had done it had she any right to take that liberty she ought to have thought of it before she rang habitall habit how many hundreds of times she had rung the bell at mablethorpe house  the servant came in she amazed the manshe spoke to him so timidly she even apologized for troubling him  i am sorry to disturb you will you be so kind as to say to the lady that i am ready for her  wait to give that message said a voice behind them until you hear the bell rung again  mercy looked round in amazement julian had returned to the library by the diningroom door    chapter xxix the last trial  the servant left them together mercy spoke first  mr gray she exclaimed why have you delayed my message if you knew all you would know that it is far from being a kindness to me to keep me in this house  he advanced closer to hersurprised by her words alarmed by her looks  has any one been here in my absence he asked  lady janet has been here in your absence i cant speak of itmy heart feels crushedi can bear no more let me go  briefly as she had replied she had said enough julians knowledge of lady janets character told him what had happened his face showed plainly that he was disappointed as well as distressed  i had hoped to have been with you when you and my aunt met and to have prevented this he said believe me she will atone for all that she may have harshly and hastily done when she has had time to think try not to regret it if she has made your hard sacrifice harder still she has only raised you the highershe has additionally ennobled you and endeared you in my estimation forgive me if i own this in plain words i cannot control myselfi feel too strongly  at other times mercy might have heard the coming avowal in his tones might have discovered it in his eyes as it was her delicate insight was dulled her fine perception was blunted she held out her hand to him feeling a vague conviction that he was kinder to her than everand feeling no more  i must thank you for the last time she said as long as life is left my gratitude will be a part of my life let me go while i can still control myself let me go  she tried to leave him and ring the bell he held her hand firmly and drew her closer to him  to the refuge he asked  yes she said home again  dont say that he exclaimed i cant bear to hear it dont call the refuge your home  what else is it where else can i go  i have come here to tell you i said if you remember i had something to propose  she felt the fervent pressure of his hand she saw the mounting enthusiasm flashing in his eyes her weary mind roused itself a little she began to tremble under the electric influence of his touch  something to propose she repeated what is there to propose  let me ask you a question on my side what have you done today  you know what i have done it is your work she answered humbly why return to it now  i return to it for the last time i return to it with a purpose which you will soon understand you have abandoned your marriage engagement you have forfeited lady janets love you have ruined all your worldly prospects you are now returning selfdevoted to a life which you have yourself described as a life without hope and all this you have done of your own freewillat a time when you are absolutely secure of your position in the housefor the sake of speaking the truth now tell me is a woman who can make that sacrifice a woman who will prove unworthy of the trust if a man places in her keeping his honor and his name  she understood him at last she broke away from him with a cry she stood with her hands clasped trembling and looking at him  he gave her no time to think the words poured from his lips without conscious will or conscious effort of his own  mercy from the first moment when i saw you i loved you you are free i may own it i may ask you to be my wife  she drew back from him further and further with a wild imploring gesture of her hand  no no she cried think of what you are saying think of what you would sacrifice it cannot must not be  his face darkened with a sudden dread his head fell on his breast his voice sank so low that she could barely hear it  i had forgotten something he said youve reminded me of it  she ventured back a little nearer to him have i offended you  he smiled sadly you have enlightened me i had forgotten that it doesnt follow because i love you that you should love me in return say that it is so mercy and i leave you  a faint tinge of color rose on her facethen left it again paler than ever her eyes looked downward timidly under the eager gaze that he fastened on her  how can i say so she answered simply where is the woman in my place whose heart could resist you  he eagerly advanced he held out his arms to her in breathless speechless joy she drew back from him once more with a look that horrified hima look of blank despair  am i fit to be your wife she asked must i remind you of what you owe to your high position your spotless integrity your famous name think of all that you have done for me and then think of the black ingratitude of it if i ruin you for life by consenting to our marriageif i selfishly cruelly wickedly drag you down to the level of a woman like me  i raise you to my level when i make you my wife he answered for heavens sake do me justice dont refer me to the world and its opinions it rests with you and you alone to make the misery or the happiness of my life the world good god what can the world give me in exchange for you  she clasped her hands imploringly the tears flowed fast over her cheeks  oh have pity on my weakness she cried kindest best of men help me to do my hard duty toward you it is so hard after all that i have sufferedwhen my heart is yearning for peace and happiness and love she checked herself shuddering at the words that had escaped her remember how mr holmcroft has used me remember how lady janet has left me remember what i have told you of my life the scorn of every creature you know would strike at you through me no no no not a word more spare me pity me leave me  her voice failed her sobs choked her utterance he sprang to her and took her in his arms she was incapable of resisting him but there was no yielding in her her head lay on his bosom passivehorribly passive like the head of a corpse  mercy my darling we will go awaywe will leave englandwe will take refuge among new people in a new worldi will change my namei will break with relatives friends everybody anything anything rather than lose you  she lifted her head slowly and looked at him  he suddenly released her he reeled back like a man staggered by a blow and dropped into a chair before she had uttered a word he saw the terrible resolution in her facedeath rather than yield to her own weakness and disgrace him  she stood with her hands lightly clasped in front of her her grand head was raised her soft gray eyes shone again undimmed by tears the storm of emotion had swept over her and had passed away a sad tranquillity was in her face a gentle resignation was in her voice the calm of a martyr was the calm that confronted him as she spoke her last words  a woman who has lived my life a woman who has suffered what i have suffered may love youas i love youbut she must not be your wife that place is too high above her any other place is too far below her and below you she paused and advancing to the bell gave the signal for her departure that done she slowly retraced her steps until she stood at julians side  tenderly she lifted his head and laid it for a moment on her bosom silently she stooped and touched his forehead with her lips all the gratitude that filled her heart and all the sacrifice that rent it were in those two actionsso modestly so tenderly performed as the last lingering pressure of her fingers left him julian burst into tears  the servant answered the bell at the moment he opened the door a womans voice was audible in the hall speaking to him  let the child go in the voice said i will wait here  the child appearedthe same forlorn little creature who had reminded mercy of her own early years on the day when she and horace holmcroft had been out for their walk  there was no beauty in this child no halo of romance brightened the commonplace horror of her story she came cringing into the room staring stupidly at the magnificence all round herthe daughter of the london streets the pet creation of the laws of political economy the savage and terrible product of a wornout system of government and of a civilization rotten to its core cleaned for the first time in her life fed sufficiently for the first time in her life dressed in clothes instead of rags for the first time in her life mercys sister in adversity crept fearfully over the beautiful carpet and stopped wonderstruck before the marbles of an inlaid tablea blot of mud on the splendor of the room  mercy turned from julian to meet the child the womans heart hungering in its horrible isolation for something that it might harmlessly love welcomed the rescued waif of the streets as a consolation sent from god she caught the stupefied little creature up in her arms kiss me she whispered in the reckless agony of the moment call me sister the child stared vacantly sister meant nothing to her mind but an older girl who was strong enough to beat her  she put the child down again and turned for a last look at the man whose happiness she had wreckedin pity to him  he had never moved his head was down his face was hidden she went back to hi m a few steps  the others have gone from me without one kind word can you forgive me  he held out his hand to her without looking up sorely as she had wounded him his generous nature understood her true to her from the first he was true to her still  god bless and comfort you he said in broken tones the earth holds no nobler woman than you  she knelt and kissed the kind hand that pressed hers for the last time it doesnt end with this world she whispered there is a better world to come then she rose and went back to the child hand in hand the two citizens of the government of godoutcasts of the government of manpassed slowly down the length of the room then out into the hall then out into the night the heavy clang of the closing door tolled the knell of their departure they were gone  but the orderly routine of the houseinexorable as deathpursued its appointed course as the clock struck the hour the dinnerbell rang an interval of a minute passed and marked the limit of delay the butler appeared at the diningroom door  dinner is served sir  julian looked up the empty room met his eyes something white lay on the carpet close by him it was her handkerchiefwet with her tears he took it up and pressed it to his lips was that to be the last of her had she left him forever  the native energy of the man arming itself with all the might of his love kindled in him again no while life was in him while time was before him there was the hope of winning her yet  he turned to the servant reckless of what his face might betray  where is lady janet  in the diningroom sir  he reflected for a moment his own influence had failed through what other influence could he now hope to reach her as the question crossed his mind the light broke on him he saw the way back to herthrough the influence of lady janet  her ladyship is waiting sir  julian entered the diningroom     epilogue  containing selections from the correspondence of miss grace roseberry and mr horace holmcroft to which are added extracts from the diary of the reverend julian gray  i  from mr horace holmcroft to miss grace roseberry  i hasten to thank you dear miss roseberry for your last kind letter received by yesterdays mail from canada believe me i appreciate your generous readiness to pardon and forget what i so rudely said to you at a time when the arts of an adventuress had blinded me to the truth in the grace which has forgiven me i recognize the inbred sense of justice of a true lady birth and breeding can never fail to assert themselves i believe in them thank god more firmly than ever  you ask me to keep you informed of the progress of julian grays infatuation and of the course of conduct pursued toward him by mercy merrick  if you had not favored me by explaining your object i might have felt some surprise at receiving from a lady in your position such a request as this but the motives by which you describe yourself as being actuated are beyond dispute the existence of society as you truly say is threatened by the present lamentable prevalence of liberal ideas throughout the length and breadth of the land we can only hope to protect ourselves against impostors interested in gaining a position among persons of our rank by becoming in some sort unpleasant as it may be familiar with the arts by which imposture too frequently succeeds if we wish to know to what daring lengths cunning can go to what pitiable selfdelusion credulity can consent we must watch the proceedingseven while we shrink from themof a mercy merrick and a julian gray  in taking up my narrative again where my last letter left off i must venture to set you right on one point  certain expressions which have escaped your pen suggest to me that you blame julian gray as the cause of lady janets regrettable visit to the refuge the day after mercy merrick had left her house this is not quite correct julian as you will presently see has enough to answer for without being held responsible for errors of judgment in which he has had no share lady janet as she herself told me went to the refuge of her own freewill to ask mercy merricks pardon for the language which she had used on the previous day i passed a night of such misery as no words can describethis i assure you is what her ladyship really said to methinking over what my vile pride and selfishness and obstinacy had made me say and do i would have gone down on my knees to beg her pardon if she would have let me my first happy moment was when i won her consent to come and visit me sometimes at mablethorpe house  you will i am sure agree with me that such extravagance as this is to be pitied rather than blamed how sad to see the decay of the faculties with advancing age it is a matter of grave anxiety to consider how much longer poor lady janet can be trusted to manage her own affairs i shall take an opportunity of touching on the matter delicately when i next see her lawyer  i am straying from my subject andis it not strangei am writing to you as confidentially as if we were old friends  to return to julian gray innocent of instigating his aunts first visit to the refuge he is guilty of having induced her to go there for the second time the day after i had dispatched my last letter to you lady janets object on this occasion was neither more nor less than to plead her nephews cause as humble suitor for the hand of mercy merrick imagine the descent of one of the oldest families in england inviting an adventuress in a refuge to honor a clergyman of the church of england by becoming his wife in what times do we live my dear mother shed tears of shame when she heard of it how you would love and admire my mother  i dined at mablethorpe house by previous appointment on the day when lady janet returned from her degrading errand  well i said waiting of course until the servant was out of the room  well lady janet answered julian was quite right  quite right in what  in saying that the earth holds no nobler woman than mercy merrick  has she refused him again  she has refused him again  thank god i felt it fervently and i said it fervently lady janet laid down her knife and fork and fixed one of her fierce looks on me  it may not be your fault horace she said if your nature is incapable of comprehending what is great and generous in other natures higher than yours but the least you can do is to distrust your own capacity of appreciation for the future keep your opinions on questions which you dont understand modestly to yourself i have a tenderness for you for your fathers sake and i take the most favorable view of your conduct toward mercy merrick i humanely consider it the conduct of a fool her own words miss roseberry i assure you once more her own words but dont trespass too far on my indulgencedont insinuate again that a woman who is good enough if she died this night to go to heaven is not good enough to be my nephews wife  i expressed to you my conviction a little way back that it was doubtful whether poor lady janet would be much longer competent to manage her own affairs perhaps you thought me hasty then what do you think now  it was of course useless to reply seriously to the extraordinary reprimand that i had received besides i was really shocked by a decay of principle which proceeded but too plainly from decay of the mental powers i made a soothing and respectful reply and i was favored in return with some account of what had really happened at the refuge my mother and my sisters were disgusted when i repeated the particulars to them you will be disgusted too  the interesting penitent expecting lady janets visit was of course discovered in a touching domestic position she had a foundling baby asleep on her lap and she was teaching the alphabet to an ugly little vagabond girl whose acquaintance she had first made in the street just the sort of artful tableau vivant to impose on an old ladywas it not  you will understand what followed when lady janet opened her matrimonial negotiation having perfected herself in her part mercy merrick to do her justice was not the woman to play it badly the most magnanimous sentiments flowed from her lips she declared that her future life was devoted to acts of charity typified of course by the foundling infant and the ugly little girl however she might personally suffer whatever might be the sacrifice of her own feelingsobserve how artfully this was put to insinuate that she was herself in love with himshe could not accept from mr julian gray an honor of which she was unworthy her gratitude to him and her interest in him alike forbade her to compromise his brilliant future by consenting to a marriage which would degrade him in the estimation of all his friends she thanked him with tears she thanked lady janet with more tears but she dare not in the interests of his honor and his happiness accept the hand that he offered to her god bless and comfort him and god help her to bear with her hard lot  the object of this contemptible comedy is plain enough to my mind she is simply holding off julian as you know is a poor man until the influence of lady janets persuasion is backed by the opening of lady janets purse in one wordsettlements but for the profanity of the womans language and the really lamentable credulity of the poor old lady the whole thing would make a fit subject for a burlesque  but the saddest part of the story is still to come  in due course of time the ladys decision was communicated to julian gray he took leave of his senses on the spot can you believe ithe has resigned his curacy at a time when the church is thronged every sunday to hear him preach this madman shuts the door and walks out of the pulpit even lady janet was not far enough gone in folly to abet him in this she remonstrated like the rest of his friends perfectly useless he had but one answer to everything they could say my career is closed what stuff  you will ask naturally enough what this perverse man is going to do next i dont scruple to say that he is bent on committing suicide pray do not be alarmed there is no fear of the pistol the rope or the river julian is simply courting deathwithin the limits of the law  this is strong language i know you shall hear what the facts are and judge for yourself  having resigned his curacy his next proceeding was to offer his services as volunteer to a new missionary enterprise on the west coast of africa the persons at the head of the mission proved most fortunately to have a proper sense of their duty expressing their conviction of the value of julians assistance in the most handsome terms they made it nevertheless a condition of entertaining his proposal that he should submit to examination by a competent medical man after some hesitation he consented to this the doctors report was conclusive in julians present state of health the climate of west africa would in all probability kill him in three months time  foiled in his first attempt he addressed himself next to a london mission here it was impossible to raise the question of climate and here i grieve to say he has succeeded  he is now workingin other words he is now deliberately risking his lifein the mission to green anchor fields the district known by this name is situated in a remote part of london near the thames it is notoriously infested by the most desperate and degraded set of wretches in the whole metropolitan population and it is so thickly inhabited that it is hardly ever completely free from epidemic disease in this horrible place and among these dangerous people julian is now employing himself from morning to night none of his old friends ever see him since he joined the mission he has not even called on lady janet roy  my pledge is redeemedthe facts are before you am i wrong in taking my gloomy view of the prospect i cannot forget that this unhappy man was once my friend and i really see no hope for him in the future deliberately selfexposed to the violence of ruffians and the outbreak of disease who is to extricate him from his shocking position the one person who can do it is the person whose association with him would be his ruinmercy merrick heaven only knows what disasters it may be my painful duty to communicate to you in my next letter  you are so kind as to ask me to tell you something about myself and my plans  i have very little to say on either head after what i have sufferedmy feelings trampled on my confidence betrayedi am as yet hardly capable of deciding what i shall do returning to my old professionto the armyis out of the question in these leveling days when any obscure person who can pass an examination may call himself my brother officer and may one day perhaps command me as my superior in rank if i think of any career it is the career of diplomacy birth and breeding have not quite disappeared as essential qualifications in that branch of the public service but i have decided nothing as yet  my mother and sisters in the event of your returning to england desire me to say that it will afford them the greatest pleasure to make your acquaintance sympathizing with me they do not forget what you too have suffered a warm welcome awaits you when you pay your first visit at our house most truly yours  horace holmcroft   ii  from miss grace roseberry to mr horace holmcroft  dear mr holmcrofti snatch a few moments from my other avocations to thank you for your most interesting and delightful letter how well you describe how accurately you judge if literature stood a little higher as a profession i should almost advise youbut no if you entered literature how could you associate with the people whom you would be likely to meet  between ourselves i always thought mr julian gray an overrated man i will not say he has justified my opinion i will only say i pity him but dear mr holmcroft how can you with your sound judgment place the sad alternatives now before him on the same level to die in green anchor fields or to fall into the clutches of that vile wretchis there any comparison between the two better a thousand times die at the post of duty than marry mercy merrick  as i have written the creatures name i may addso as to have all the sooner done with the subjectthat i shall look with anxiety for your next letter do not suppose that i feel the smallest curiosity about this degraded and designing woman my interest in her is purely religious to persons of my devout turn of mind she is an awful warning when i feel satan near meit will be such a means of grace to think of mercy merrick  poor lady janet i noticed those signs of mental decay to which you so feelingly allude at the last interview i had with her in mablethorpe house if you can find an opportunity will you say that i wish her well here and hereafter and will you please add that i do not omit to remember her in my prayers  there is just a chance of my visiting england toward the close of the autumn my fortunes have changed since i wrote last i have been received as reader and companion by a lady who is the wife of one of our high judicial functionaries in this part of the world i do not take much interest in him he is what they call a selfmade man his wife is charming besides being a person of highly intellectual tastes she is greatly her husbands superioras you will understand when i tell you that she is related to the gommerys of pommery not the pommerys of gommery who as your knowledge of our old families will inform you only claim kindred with the younger branch of that ancient race  in the elegant and improving companionship which i now enjoy i should feel quite happy but for one drawback the climate of canada is not favorable to my kind patroness and her medical advisers recommend her to winter in london in this event i am to have t he privilege of accompanying her is it necessary to add that my first visit will be paid at your house i feel already united by sympathy to your mother and your sisters there is a sort of freemasonry among gentlewomen is there not with best thanks and remembrances and many delightful anticipations of your next letter believe me dear mr holmcroft  truly yours  grace roseberry   iii  from mr horace holmcroft to miss grace roseberry  my dear miss roseberrypray excuse my long silence i have waited for mail after mail in the hope of being able to send you some good news at last it is useless to wait longer my worst forebodings have been realized my painful duty compels me to write a letter which will surprise and shock you  let me describe events in their order as they happened in this way i may hope to gradually prepare your mind for what is to come  about three weeks after i wrote to you last julian gray paid the penalty of his headlong rashness i do not mean that he suffered any actual violence at the hands of the people among whom he had cast his lot on the contrary he succeeded incredible as it may appear in producing a favorable impression on the ruffians about him as i understand it they began by respecting his courage in venturing among them alone and they ended in discovering that he was really interested in promoting their welfare it is to the other peril indicated in my last letter that he has fallen a victimthe peril of disease not long after he began his labors in the district fever broke out we only heard that julian had been struck down by the epidemic when it was too late to remove him from the lodging that he occupied in the neighborhood i made inquiries personally the moment the news reached us the doctor in attendance refused to answer for his life  in this alarming state of things poor lady janet impulsive and unreasonable as usual insisted on leaving mablethorpe house and taking up her residence near her nephew  finding it impossible to persuade her of the folly of removing from home and its comforts at her age i felt it my duty to accompany her we found accommodation such as it was in a riverside inn used by shipcaptains and commercial travelers i took it on myself to provide the best medical assistance lady janets insane prejudices against doctors impelling her to leave this important part of the arrangements entirely in my hands  it is needless to weary you by entering into details on the subject of julians illness  the fever pursued the ordinary course and was characterized by the usual intervals of delirium and exhaustion succeeding each other subsequent events which it is unfortunately necessary to relate to you leave me no choice but to dwell as briefly as possible on the painful subject of the delirium in other cases the wanderings of feverstricken people present i am told a certain variety of range in julians case they were limited to one topic he talked incessantly of mercy merrick his invariable petition to his medical attendants entreated them to send for her to nurse him day and night that one idea was in his mind and that one name on his lips  the doctors naturally made inquiries as to this absent person i was obliged in confidence to state the circumstances to them plainly  the eminent physician whom i had called in to superintend the treatment behaved admirably though he has risen from the lower order of the people he has strange to say the instincts of a gentleman he thoroughly understood our trying position and felt all the importance of preventing such a person as mercy merrick from seizing the opportunity of intruding herself at the bedside a soothing prescription i have his own authority for saying it was all that was required to meet the patients case the local doctor on the other hand a young man and evidently a redhot radical proved to be obstinate and considering his position insolent as well i have nothing to do with the ladys character and with your opinion of it he said to me i have only to the best of my judgment to point out to you the likeliest means of saving the patients life our art is at the end of its resources send for mercy merrick no matter who she is or what she is there is just a chanceespecially if she proves to be a sensible person and a good nursethat he may astonish you all by recognizing her in that case only his recovery is probable if you persist in disregarding his entreaties if you let the delirium go on for fourandtwenty hours more he is a dead man  lady janet was most unluckily present when this impudent opinion was delivered at the bedside  need i tell you the sequel called upon to choose between the course indicated by a physician who is making his five thousand a year and who is certain of the next medical baronetcy and the advice volunteered by an obscure general practitioner at the east end of london who is not making his five hundred a yearneed i stop to inform you of her ladyships decision you know her and you will only too well understand that her next proceeding was to pay a third visit to the refuge  two hours lateri give you my word of honor i am not exaggeratingmercy merrick was established at julians bedside  the excuse of course was that it was her duty not to let any private scruples of her own stand in the way when a medical authority had declared that she might save the patients life you will not be surprised to hear that i withdrew from the scene the physician followed my exampleafter having written his soothing prescription and having been grossly insulted by the local practitioners refusing to make use of it i went back in the doctors carriage he spoke most feelingly and properly without giving any positive opinion i could see that he had abandoned all hope of julians recovery we are in the hands of providence mr holmcroft those were his last words as he set me down at my mothers door  i have hardly the heart to go on if i studied my own wishes i should feel inclined to stop here  let me at least hasten to the end in two or three days time i received my first intelligence of the patient and his nurse lady janet informed me that he had recognized her when i heard this i felt prepared for what was to come the next report announced that he was gaining strength and the next that he was out of danger upon this lady janet returned to mablethorpe house i called there a week agoand heard that he had been removed to the seaside i called yesterdayand received the latest information from her ladyships own lips my pen almost refuses to write it mercy merrick has consented to marry him  an outrage on societythat is how my mother and my sisters view it that is how you will view it too my mother has herself struck julians name off her invitationlist the servants have their orders if he presumes to call not at home  i am unhappily only too certain that i am correct in writing to you of this disgraceful marriage as of a settled thing lady janet went the length of showing me the lettersone from julian the other from the woman herself fancy mercy merrick in correspondence with lady janet roy addressing her as my dear lady janet and signing yours affectionately  i had not the patience to read either of the letters through julians tone is the tone of a socialist in my opinion his bishop ought to be informed of it as for her she plays her part just as cleverly with her pen as she played it with her tongue i cannot disguise from myself that i am wrong in yielding sad forebodings fill my mind when i think of the future i feel as if the first contemptuous look that is cast at my husband will destroy my happiness though it may not disturb him as long as i was parted from him i could control my own weakness i could accept my hard lot but how can i resist him after having watched for weeks at his bedside after having seen his first smile and heard his first grateful words t o me while i was slowly helping him back to life  there is the tone which she takes through four closely written pages of nauseous humility and claptrap sentiment it is enough to make one despise women thank god there is the contrast at hand to remind me of what is due to the better few among the sex i feel that my mother and my sisters are doubly precious to me now may i add on the side of consolation that i prize with hardly inferior gratitude the privilege of corresponding with you  farewell for the present i am too rudely shaken in my most cherished convictions i am too depressed and disheartened to write more all good wishes go with you dear miss roseberry until we meet  most truly yours  horace holmcroft   iv  extracts from the diary of the reverend julian gray  first extract  a month today since we were married i have only one thing to say i would cheerfully go through all that i have suffered to live this one month over again i never knew what happiness was until now and better still i have persuaded mercy that it is all her doing i have scattered her misgivings to the winds she is obliged to submit to evidence and to own that she can make the happiness of my life  we go back to london tomorrow she regrets leaving the tranquil retirement of this remote seaside placeshe dreads change i care nothing for it it is all one to me where i go so long as my wife is with me  second extract  the first cloud has risen i entered the room unexpectedly just now and found her in tears  with considerable difficulty i persuaded her to tell me what had happened are there any limits to the mischief that can be done by the tongue of a foolish woman the landlady at my lodgings is the woman in this case having no decided plans for the future as yet we returned most unfortunately as the event has proved to the rooms in london which i inhabited in my bachelor days they are still mine for six weeks to come and mercy was unwilling to let me incur the expense of taking her to a hotel at breakfast this morning i rashly congratulated myself in my wifes hearing on finding that a much smaller collection than usual of letters and cards had accumulated in my absence breakfast over i was obliged to go out painfully sensitive poor thing to any change in my experience of the little world around me which it is possible to connect with the event of my marriage mercy questioned the landlady in my absence about the diminished number of my visitors and my correspondents the woman seized the opportunity of gossiping about me and my affairs and my wifes quick perception drew the right conclusion unerringly my marriage has decided certain wise heads of families on discontinuing their social relations with me the facts unfortunately speak for themselves people who in former years habitually called upon me and invited meor who in the event of my absence habitually wrote to me at this seasonhave abstained with a remarkable unanimity from calling inviting or writing now  it would have been sheer waste of timeto say nothing of its also implying a want of confidence in my wifeif i had attempted to set things right by disputing mercys conclusion i could only satisfy her that not so much as the shadow of disappointment or mortification rested on my mind in this way i have to some extent succeeded in composing my poor darling but the wound has been inflicted and the wound is felt there is no disguising that result i must face it boldly  trifling as this incident is in my estimation it has decided me on one point already in shaping my future course i am now resolved to act on my own convictionsin preference to taking the wellmeant advice of such friends as are still left to me  all my little success in life has been gained in the pulpit i am what is termed a popular preacherbut i have never in my secret self felt any exultation in my own notoriety or any extraordinary respect for the means by which it has been won in the first place i have a very low idea of the importance of oratory as an intellectual accomplishment there is no other art in which the conditions of success are so easy of attainment there is no other art in the practice of which so much that is purely superficial passes itself off habitually for something that claims to be profound then again how poor it is in the results which it achieves take my own case how often for example have i thundered with all my heart and soul against the wicked extravagance of dress among womenagainst their filthy false hair and their nauseous powders and paints how often to take another example have i denounced the mercenary and material spirit of the agethe habitual corruptions and dishonesties of commerce in high places and in low what good have i done i have delighted the very people whom it was my object to rebuke what a charming sermon more eloquent than ever i used to dread the sermon at the other churchdo you know i quite look forward to it now that is the effect i produce on sunday on monday the women are off to the milliners to spend more money than ever the city men are off to business to make more money than everwhile my grocer loud in my praises in his sunday coat turns up his weekday sleeves and adulterates his favorite preachers sugar as cheerfully as usual  i have often in past years felt the objections to pursuing my career which are here indicated they were bitterly present to my mind when i resigned my curacy and they strongly influence me now  i am weary of my cheaply won success in the pulpit i am weary of society as i find it in my time i felt some respect for myself and some heart and hope in my works among the miserable wretches in green anchor fields but i can not and must not return among them i have no right now to trifle with my health and my life i must go back to my preaching or i must leave england among a primitive people away from the citiesin the far and fertile west of the great american continenti might live happily with my wife and do good among my neighbors secure of providing for our wants out of the modest little income which is almost useless to me here in the life which i thus picture to myself i see love peace health and duties and occupations that are worthy of a christian man what prospect is before me if i take the advice of my friends and stay here work of which i am weary because i have long since ceased to respect it petty malice that strikes at me through my wife and mortifies and humiliates her turn where she may if i had only myself to think of i might defy the worst that malice can do but i have mercy to think ofmercy whom i love better than my own life women live poor things in the opinions of others i have had one warning already of what my wife is likely to suffer at the hands of my friendsheaven forgive me for misusing the word shall i deliberately expose her to fresh mortificationsand this for the sake of returning to a career the rewards of which i no longer prize no we will both be happywe will both be free god is merciful nature is kind love is true in the new world as well as the old to the new world we will go  third extract  i hardly know whether i have done right or wrong i mentioned yesterday to lady janet the cold reception of me on my return to london and the painful sense of it felt by my wife  my aunt looks at the matter from her own peculiar point of view and makes light of it accordingly you never did and never will understand society julian said her ladyship these poor stupid people simply dont know what to do they are waiting to be told by a person of distinction whether they are or are not to recognize your marriage in plain english they are waiting to be led by me consider it done i will lead them  i thought my aunt was joking the event of today has shown me that she is terribly in earnest lady janet has issued invitations for one of her grand balls at mablethorpe house and sh e has caused the report to be circulated everywhere that the object of the festival is to celebrate the marriage of mr and mrs julian gray  i at first refused to be present to my amazement however mercy sides with my aunt she reminds me of all that we both owe to lady janet and she has persuaded me to alter my mind we are to go to the ballat my wife express request  the meaning of this as i interpret it is that my poor love is still pursued in secret by the dread that my marriage has injured me in the general estimation she will suffer anything risk anything believe anything to be freed from that one haunting doubt lady janet predicts a social triumph and my wifes despairnot my wifes convictionaccepts the prophecy as for me i am prepared for the result it will end in our going to the new world and trying society in its infancy among the forests and the plains i shall quietly prepare for our departure and own what i have done at the right timethat is to say when the ball is over  fourth extract  i have met with the man for my purposean old college friend of mine now partner in a firm of shipowners largely concerned in emigration  one of their vessels sails for america from the port of london in a fortnight touching at plymouth by a fortunate coincidence lady janets ball takes place in a fortnight i see my way  helped by the kindness of my friend i have arranged to have a cabin kept in reserve on payment of a small deposit if the ball ends as i believe it will in new mortifications for mercydo what they may i defy them to mortify mei have only to say the word by telegraph and we shall catch the ship at plymouth  i know the effect it will have when i break the news to her but i am prepared with my remedy the pages of my diary written in past years will show plainly enough that it is not she who is driving me away from england she will see the longing in me for other work and other scenes expressing itself over and over again long before the time when we first met  fifth extract  mercys ball dressa present from kind lady janetis finished i was allowed to see the first trial or preliminary rehearsal of this work of art i dont in the least understand the merits of silk and lace but one thing i knowmy wife will be the most beautiful woman at the ball  the same day i called on lady janet to thank her and encountered a new revelation of the wayward and original character of my dear old aunt  she was on the point of tearing up a letter when i went into her room seeing me she suspended her purpose and handed me the letter it was in mercys handwriting lady janet pointed to a passage on the last page tell your wife with my love she said that i am the most obstinate woman of the two i positively refuse to read her as i positively refuse to listen to her whenever she attempts to return to that one subject now give me the letter back i gave it back and saw it torn up before my face the one subject prohibited to mercy as sternly as ever is still the subject of the personation of grace roseberry nothing could have been more naturally introduced or more delicately managed than my wifes brief reference to the subject no matter the reading of the first line was enough lady janet shut her eyes and destroyed the letterlady janet is determined to live and die absolutely ignorant of the true story of mercy merrick what unanswerable riddles we are is it wonderful if we perpetually fail to understand one another  sixth extract  the morning after the ball  it is done and over society has beaten lady janet i have neither patience nor time to write at length of it we leave for plymouth by the afternoon express  we were rather late in arriving at the ball the magnificent rooms were filling fast walking through them with my wife she drew my attention to a circumstance which i had not noticed at the time julian she said look round among the lades and tell me if you see anything strange as i looked round the band began playing a waltz i observed that a few people only passed by us to the dancingroom i noticed next that of those few fewer still were young at last it burst upon me with certain exceptions so rare as to prove the rule there were no young girls at lady janets ball i took mercy at once back to the receptionroom lady janets face showed that she too was aware of what had happened the guests were still arriving we received the men and their wives the men and their mothers the men and their grandmothersbut in place of their unmarried daughters elaborate excuses offered with a shameless politeness wonderful to see yes this was how the matrons in high life had got over the difficulty of meeting mrs julian gray at lady janets house  let me do strict justice to every one the ladies who were present showed the needful respect for their hostess they did their dutyno overdid it is perhaps the better phrase  i really had no adequate idea of the coarseness and rudeness which have filtered their way through society in these later times until i saw the reception accorded to my wife the days of prudery and prejudice are days gone by excessive amiability and excessive liberality are the two favorite assumptions of the modern generation to see the women expressing their liberal forgetfulness of my wifely misfortunes and the men their amiable anxiety to encourage her husband to hear the same set phrases repeated in every roomso charmed to make your acquaintance mrs gray so much obliged to dear lady janet for giving us this opportunityjulian old man what a beautiful creature i envy you upon my honor i envy youto receive this sort of welcome emphasized by obtrusive handshakings sometimes actually by downright kissings of my wife and then to look round and see that not one in thirty of these very people had brought their unmarried daughters to the ball was i honestly believe to see civilized human nature in its basest conceivable aspect the new world may have its disappointments in store for us but it cannot possibly show us any spectacle so abject as the spectacle which we witnessed last night at my aunts ball  lady janet marked her sense of the proceeding adopted by her guests by leaving them to themselves her guests remained and supped heartily notwithstanding they all knew by experience that there were no stale dishes and no cheap wines at mablethorpe house they drank to the end of the bottle and they ate to the last truffle in the dish  mercy and i had an interview with my aunt upstairs before we left i felt it necessary to state plainly my resolution to leave england the scene that followed was so painful that i cannot prevail on myself to return to it in these pages my wife is reconciled to our departure and lady janet accompanies us as far as plymouththese are the results no words can express my sense of relief now that it is all settled the one sorrow i shall carry away with me from the shores of england will be the sorrow of parting with dear warmhearted lady janet at her age it is a parting for life  so closes my connection with my own country while i have mercy by my side i face the unknown future certain of carrying my happiness with me go where i may we shall find five hundred adventurers like ourselves when we join the emigrant ship for whom their native land has no occupation and no home gentlemen of the statistical department add two more to the number of social failures produced by england in the year of our lord eighteen hundred and seventyonejulian gray and
