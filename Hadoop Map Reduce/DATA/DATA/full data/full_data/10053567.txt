10053567	the man of destiny  bernard shaw  1898    the twelfth of may 1796 in north italy at tavazzano on the road from lodi to milan the afternoon sun is blazing serenely over the plains of lombardy treating the alps with respect and the anthills with indulgence not incommoded by the basking of the swine and oxen in the villages nor hurt by its cool reception in the churches but fiercely disdainful of two hordes of mischievous insects which are the french and austrian armies two days before at lodi the austrians tried to prevent the french from crossing the river by the narrow bridge there but the french commanded by a general aged 27 napoleon bonaparte who does not understand the art of war rushed the fireswept bridge supported by a tremendous cannonade in which the young general assisted with his own hands cannonading is his technical specialty he has been trained in the artillery under the old regime and made perfect in the military arts of shirking his duties swindling the paymaster over travelling expenses and dignifying war with the noise and smoke of cannon as depicted in all military portraits he is however an original observer and has perceived for the first time since the invention of gunpowder that a cannon ball if it strikes a man will kill him to a thorough grasp of this remarkable discovery he adds a highly evolved faculty for physical geography and for the calculation of times and distances he has prodigious powers of work and a clear realistic knowledge of human nature in public affairs having seen it exhaustively tested in that department during the french revolution he is imaginative without illusions and creative without religion loyalty patriotism or any of the common ideals not that he is incapable of these ideals on the contrary he has swallowed them all in his boyhood and now having a keen dramatic faculty is extremely clever at playing upon them by the arts of the actor and stage manager withal he is no spoiled child poverty illluck the shifts of impecunious shabbygentility repeated failure as a wouldbe author humiliation as a rebuffed time server reproof and punishment as an incompetent and dishonest officer an escape from dismissal from the service so narrow that if the emigration of the nobles had not raised the value of even the most rascally lieutenant to the famine price of a general he would have been swept contemptuously from the army these trials have ground the conceit out of him and forced him to be selfsufficient and to understand that to such men as he is the world will give nothing that he cannot take from it by force in this the world is not free from cowardice and folly for napoleon as a merciless cannonader of political rubbish is making himself useful indeed it is even now impossible to live in england without sometimes feeling how much that country lost in not being conquered by him as well as by julius caesar  however on this may afternoon in 1796 it is early days with him he is only 26 and has but recently become a general partly by using his wife to seduce the directory then governing france partly by the scarcity of officers caused by the emigration as aforesaid partly by his faculty of knowing a country with all its roads rivers hills and valleys as he knows the palm of his hand and largely by that new faith of his in the efficacy of firing cannons at people his army is as to discipline in a state which has so greatly shocked some modern writers before whom the following story has been enacted that they impressed with the later glory of lempereur have altogether refused to credit it but napoleon is not lempereur yet he has only just been dubbed le petit caporal and is in the stage of gaining influence over his men by displays of pluck he is not in a position to force his will on them in orthodox military fashion by the cat o nine tails the french revolution which has escaped suppression solely through the monarchys habit of being at least four years in arrear with its soldiers in the matter of pay has substituted for that habit as far as possible the habit of not paying at all except in promises and patriotic flatteries which are not compatible with martial law of the prussian type napoleon has therefore approached the alps in command of men without money in rags and consequently indisposed to stand much discipline especially from upstart generals this circumstance which would have embarrassed an idealist soldier has been worth a thousand cannon to napoleon he has said to his army you have patriotism and courage but you have no money no clothes and deplorably indifferent food in italy there are all these things and glory as well to be gained by a devoted army led by a general who regards loot as the natural right of the soldier i am such a general en avant mes enfants the result has entirely justified him the army conquers italy as the locusts conquered cyprus they fight all day and march all night covering impossible distances and appearing in incredible places not because every soldier carries a field marshals baton in his knapsack but because he hopes to carry at least half a dozen silver forks there next day  it must be understood by the way that the french army does not make war on the italians it is there to rescue them from the tyranny of their austrian conquerors and confer republican institutions on them so that in incidentally looting them it merely makes free with the property of its friends who ought to be grateful to it and perhaps would be if ingratitude were not the proverbial failing of their country the austrians whom it fights are a thoroughly respectable regular army well disciplined commanded by gentlemen trained and versed in the art of war at the head of them beaulieu practising the classic art of war under orders from vienna and getting horribly beaten by napoleon who acts on his own responsibility in defiance of professional precedents or orders from paris even when the austrians win a battle all that is necessary is to wait until their routine obliges them to return to their quarters for afternoon tea so to speak and win it back again from them a course pursued later on with brilliant success at marengo on the whole with his foe handicapped by austrian statesmanship classic generalship and the exigencies of the aristocratic social structure of viennese society napoleon finds it possible to be irresistible without working heroic miracles the world however likes miracles and heroes and is quite incapable of conceiving the action of such forces as academic militarism or viennese drawingroomism hence it has already begun to manufacture lempereur and thus to make it difficult for the romanticists of a hundred years later to credit the little scene now in question at tavazzano as aforesaid  the best quarters at tavazzano are at a little inn the first house reached by travellers passing through the place from milan to lodi it stands in a vineyard and its principal room a pleasant refuge from the summer heat is open so widely at the back to this vineyard that it is almost a large veranda the bolder children much excited by the alarums and excursions of the past few days and by an irruption of french troops at six oclock know that the french commander has quartered himself in this room and are divided between a craving to peep in at the front windows and a mortal terror of the sentinel a young gentlemansoldier who having no natural moustache has had a most ferocious one painted on his face with boot blacking by his sergeant as his heavy uniform like all the uniforms of that day is designed for parade without the least reference to his health or comfort he perspires profusely in the sun and his painted moustache has run in little streaks down his chin and round his neck except where it has dried in stiff japanned flakes and had its sweeping outline chipped off in grotesque little bays and headlands making him unspeakably ridiculous in the eye of history a hundred years later but monstrous and horrible to the contemporary north italian infant to whom nothing would seem more natural than that he should relieve the monotony of his guard by pitchforking a stray child up on his bayonet and eating it uncooked nevertheless one girl of bad character in whom an instinct of privilege with soldiers is already dawning does peep in at the safest window for a moment before a glance and a clink from the sentinel sends her flying most of what she sees she has seen before the vineyard at the back with the old winepress and a cart among the vines the door close down on her right leading to the inn entry the landlords best sideboard now in full action for dinner further back on the same side the fireplace on the other side with a couch near it and another door leading to the inner rooms between it and the vineyard and the table in the middle with its repast of milanese risotto cheese grapes bread olives and a big wickered flask of red wine  the landlord giuseppe grandi is also no novelty he is a swarthy vivacious shrewdly cheerful blackcurled bullet headed grinning little man of 40 naturally an excellent host he is in quite special spirits this evening at his good fortune in having the french commander as his guest to protect him against the license of the troops and actually sports a pair of gold earrings which he would otherwise have hidden carefully under the winepress with his little equipment of silver plate  napoleon sitting facing her on the further side of the table and napoleons hat sword and riding whip lying on the couch she sees for the first time he is working hard partly at his meal which he has discovered how to dispatch by attacking all the courses simultaneously in ten minutes this practice is the beginning of his downfall and partly at a map which he is correcting from memory occasionally marking the position of the forces by taking a grapeskin from his mouth and planting it on the map with his thumb like a wafer he has a supply of writing materials before him mixed up in disorder with the dishes and cruets and his long hair gets sometimes into the risotto gravy and sometimes into the ink  giuseppe will your excellency  napoleon intent on his map but cramming himself mechanically with his left hand dont talk im busy  giuseppe with perfect goodhumor excellency i obey  napoleon some red ink  giuseppe alas excellency there is none  napoleon with corsican facetiousness kill something and bring me its blood  giuseppe grinning there is nothing but your excellencys horse the sentinel the lady upstairs and my wife  napoleon kill your wife  giuseppe willingly your excellency but unhappily i am not strong enough she would kill me  napoleon that will do equally well  giuseppe your excellency does me too much honor stretching his hand toward the flask perhaps some wine will answer your excellencys purpose  napoleon hastily protecting the flask and becoming quite serious wine no that would be waste you are all the same waste waste waste he marks the map with gravy using his fork as a pen clear away he finishes his wine pushes back his chair and uses his napkin stretching his legs and leaning back but still frowning and thinking  giuseppe clearing the table and removing the things to a tray on the sideboard every man to his trade excellency we innkeepers have plenty of cheap wine we think nothing of spilling it you great generals have plenty of cheap blood you think nothing of spilling it is it not so excellency  napoleon blood costs nothing wine costs money he rises and goes to the fireplace   giuseppe they say you are careful of everything except human life excellency  napoleon human life my friend is the only thing that takes care of itself he throws himself at his ease on the couch  giuseppe admiring him ah excellency what fools we all are beside you if i could only find out the secret of your success  napoleon you would make yourself emperor of italy eh  giuseppe too troublesome excellency i leave all that to you besides what would become of my inn if i were emperor see how you enjoy looking on at me whilst i keep the inn for you and wait on you well i shall enjoy looking on at you whilst you become emperor of europe and govern the country for me whilst he chatters he takes the cloth off without removing the map and inkstand and takes the corners in his hands and the middle of the edge in his mouth to fold it up  napoleon emperor of europe eh why only europe  giuseppe why indeed emperor of the world excellency why not he folds and rolls up the cloth emphasizing his phrases by the steps of the process one man is like another fold one country is like another fold one battle is like another at the last fold he slaps the cloth on the table and deftly rolls it up adding by way of peroration conquer one conquer all he takes the cloth to the sideboard and puts it in a drawer  napoleon and govern for all fight for all be everybodys servant under cover of being everybodys master giuseppe  giuseppe at the sideboard excellency  napoleon i forbid you to talk to me about myself  giuseppe coming to the foot of the couch pardon your excellency is so unlike other great men it is the subject they like best  napoleon well talk to me about the subject they like next best whatever that may be  giuseppe unabashed willingly your excellency has your excellency by any chance caught a glimpse of the lady upstairs  napoleon promptly sits up and looks at him with an interest which entirely justifies the implied epigram  napoleon how old is she  giuseppe the right age excellency  napoleon do you mean seventeen or thirty  giuseppe thirty excellency  napoleon goodlooking  giuseppe i cannot see with your excellencys eyes every man must judge that for himself in my opinion excellency a fine figure of a lady slyly shall i lay the table for her collation here  napoleon brusquely rising no lay nothing here until the officer for whom i am waiting comes back he looks at his watch and takes to walking to and fro between the fireplace and the vineyard  giuseppe with conviction excellency believe me he has been captured by the accursed austrians he dare not keep you waiting if he were at liberty  napoleon turning at the edge of the shadow of the veranda giuseppe if that turns out to be true it will put me into such a temper that nothing short of hanging you and your whole household including the lady upstairs will satisfy me  giuseppe we are all cheerfully at your excellencys disposal except the lady i cannot answer for her but no lady could resist you general  napoleon sourly resuming his march hm you will never be hanged there is no satisfaction in hanging a man who does not object to it  giuseppe sympathetically not the least in the world excellency is there napoleon again looks at his watch evidently growing anxious ah one can see that you are a great man general you know how to wait if it were a corporal now or a sublieutenant at the end of three minutes he would be swearing fuming threatening pulling the house about our ears  napoleon giuseppe your flatteries are insufferable go and talk outside he sits down again at the table with his jaws in his hands and his elbows propped on the map poring over it with a troubled expression  giuseppe willingly your excellency you shall not be disturbed he takes up the tray and prepares to withdraw  napoleon the moment he comes back send him to me  giuseppe instantaneously your excellency  a ladys voice calling from some distant part of the inn giuseppe the voice is very musical and the two final notes make an ascending interval  napoleon startled whats that whats that  giuseppe resting the end of his tray on the table and leaning over to speak the more confidentially the lady excellency  napoleon absently yes what lady whose lady  giuseppe the strange lady excellency  napoleon what strange lady  giuseppe with a shrug who knows she arrived here half an hour before you in a hired carriage belonging to the golden eagle at borghetto actually by herself excellency no servants a dressing bag and a trunk that is all the postillion says she left a horsea charger with military trappings at the golden eagle  napoleon a woman with a charger thats extraordinary  the ladys voice the two final notes now making a peremptory descending interval giuseppe  napoleon rising to listen thats an interesting voice  giuseppe she is an interesting lady excellency calling coming lady coming he makes for the inner door  napoleon arresting him with a strong hand on his shoulder stop let her come  voice giuseppe impatiently  giuseppe pleadingly let me go excellency it is my point of honor as an innkeeper to come when i am called i appeal to you as a soldier  a mans voice outside at the inn door shouting here someone hello landlord where are you somebody raps vigorously with a whip handle on a bench in the passage  napoleon suddenly becoming the commanding officer again and throwing giuseppe off there he is at last pointing to the inner door go attend to your business the lady is calling you he goes to the fireplace and stands with his back to it with a determined military air  giuseppe with bated breath snatching up his tray certainly excellency he hurries out by the inner door  the mans voice impatiently are you all asleep here the door opposite the fireplace is kicked rudely open and a dusty sublieutenant bursts into the room he is a chuckleheaded young man of 24 with the fair delicate clear skin of a man of rank and a selfassurance on that ground which the french revolution has failed to shake in the smallest degree he has a thick silly lip an eager credulous eye an obstinate nose and a loud confident voice a young man without fear without reverence without imagination without sense hopelessly insusceptible to the napoleonic or any other idea stupendously egotistical eminently qualified to rush in where angels fear to tread yet of a vigorous babbling vitality which bustles him into the thick of things he is just now boiling with vexation attributable by a superficial observer to his impatience at not being promptly attended to by the staff of the inn but in which a more discerning eye can perceive a certain moral depth indicating a more permanent and momentous grievance on seeing napoleon he is sufficiently taken aback to check himself and salute but he does not betray by his manner any of that prophetic consciousness of marengo and austerlitz waterloo and st helena or the napoleonic pictures of delaroche and meissonier which modern culture will instinctively expect from him  napoleon sharply well sir here you are at last your instructions were that i should arrive here at six and that i was to find you waiting for me with my mail from paris and with despatches it is now twenty minutes to eight you were sent on this service as a hard rider with the fastest horse in the camp you arrive a hundred minutes late on foot where is your horse  the lieutenant moodily pulling off his gloves and dashing them with his cap and whip on the table ah where indeed thats just what i should like to know general with emotion you dont know how fond i was of that horse  napoleon angrily sarcastic indeed with sudden misgiving where are the letters and despatches  the lieutenant importantly rather pleased than otherwise at having some remarkable news i dont know  napoleon unable to believe his ears you dont know  lieutenant no more than you do general now i suppose i shall be courtmartialled well i dont mind being courtmartialled but with solemn determination i tell you general if ever i catch that innocent looking youth ill spoil his beauty the slimy little liar ill make a picture of him ill  napoleon advancing from the hearth to the table what innocent looking youth pull yourself together sir will you and give an account of yourself  lieutenant facing him at the opposite side of the table leaning on it with his fists oh im all right general im perfectly ready to give an account of myself i shall make the courtmartial thoroughly understand that the fault was not mine advantage has been taken of the better side of my nature and im not ashamed of it but with all respect to you as my commanding officer general i say again that if ever i set eyes on that son of satan ill  napoleon angrily so you said before  lieutenant drawing himself upright i say it again just wait until i catch him just wait thats all he folds his arms resolutely and breathes hard with compressed lips  napoleon i am waiting sirfor your explanation  lieutenant confidently youll change your tone general when you hear what has happened to me  napoleon nothing has happened to you sir you are alive and not disabled where are the papers entrusted to you  lieutenant nothing nothing oho well well see posing himself to overwhelm napoleon with his news he swore eternal brotherhood with me was that nothing he said my eyes reminded him of his sisters eyes was that nothing he criedactually criedover the story of my separation from angelica was that nothing he paid for both bottles of wine though he only ate bread and grapes himself perhaps you call that nothing he gave me his pistols and his horse and his despatchesmost important despatchesand let me go away with them triumphantly seeing that he has reduced napoleon to blank stupefaction was that nothing  napoleon enfeebled by astonishment what did he do that for  lieutenant as if the reason were obvious to show his confidence in me napoleons jaw does not exactly drop but its hinges become nerveless the lieutenant proceeds with honest indignation and i was worthy of his confidence i brought them all back honorably but would you believe itwhen i trusted him with my pistols and my horse and my despatches  napoleon enraged what the devil did you do that for  lieutenant why to show my confidence in him of course and he betrayed itabused itnever came back the thief the swindler the heartless treacherous little blackguard you call that nothing i suppose but look here general again resorting to the table with his fist for greater emphasis you may put up with this outrage from the austrians if you like but speaking for myself personally i tell you that if ever i catch  napoleon turning on his heel in disgust and irritably resuming his march to and fro yes you have said that more than once already  lieutenant excitedly more than once ill say it fifty times and whats more ill do it youll see general ill show my confidence in him so i will ill  napoleon yes yes sir no doubt you will what kind of man was he  lieutenant well i should think you ought to be able to tell from his conduct the sort of man he was  napoleon psh what was he like  lieutenant like hes likewell you ought to have just seen the fellow that will give you a notion of what he was like he wont be like it five minutes after i catch him for i tell you that if ever  napoleon shouting furiously for the innkeeper giuseppe to the lieutenant out of all patience hold your tongue sir if you can  lieutenant i warn you its no use to try to put the blame on me plaintively how was i to know the sort of fellow he was he takes a chair from between the sideboard and the outer door places it near the table and sits down if you only knew how hungry and tired i am youd have more consideration  giuseppe returning what is it excellency  napoleon struggling with his temper take thisthis officer feed him and put him to bed if necessary when he is in his right mind again find out what has happened to him and bring me word to the lieutenant consider yourself under arrest sir  lieutenant with sulky stiffness i was prepared for that it takes a gentleman to understand a gentleman he throws his sword on the table giuseppe takes it up and politely offers it to napoleon who throws it violently on the couch  giuseppe with sympathetic concern have you been attacked by the austrians lieutenant dear dear dear  lieutenant contemptuously attacked i could have broken his back between my finger and thumb i wish i had now no it was by appealing to the better side of my nature thats what i cant get over he said hed never met a man he liked so much as me he put his handkerchief round my neck because a gnat bit me and my stock was chafing it look he pulls a handkerchief from his stock giuseppe takes it and examines it  giuseppe to napoleon a ladys handkerchief excellency he smells it perfumed  napoleon eh he takes it and looks at it attentively hm he smells it ha he walks thoughtfully across the room looking at the handkerchief which he finally sticks in the breast of his coat  lieutenant good enough for him anyhow i noticed that he had a womans hands when he touched my neck with his coaxing fawning ways the mean effeminate little hound lowering his voice with thrilling intensity but mark my words general if ever  the ladys voice outside as before giuseppe  lieutenant petrified what was that  giuseppe only a lady upstairs lieutenant calling me  lieutenant lady  voice giuseppe giuseppe where are you  lieutenant murderously give me that sword he strides to the couch snatches the sword and draws it  giuseppe rushing forward and seizing his right arm what are you thinking of lieutenant its a lady dont you hear that its a womans voice  lieutenant its his voice i tell you let me go he breaks away and rushes to the inner door it opens in his face and the strange lady steps in she is a very attractive lady tall and extraordinarily graceful with a delicately intelligent apprehensive questioning faceperception in the brow sensitiveness in the nostrils character in the chin all keen refined and original she is very feminine but by no means weak the lithe tender figure is hung on a strong frame the hands and feet neck and shoulders are no fragile ornaments but of full size in proportion to her stature which considerably exceeds that of napoleon and the innkeeper and leaves her at no disadvantage with the lieutenant only her elegance and radiant charm keep the secret of her size and strength she is not judging by her dress an admirer of the latest fashions of the directory or perhaps she uses up her old dresses for travelling at all events she wears no jacket with extravagant lappels no grecotallien sham chiton nothing indeed that the princesse de lamballe might not have worn her dress of flowered silk is long waisted with a watteau pleat behind but with the paniers reduced to mere rudiments as she is too tall for them it is cut low in the neck where it is eked out by a creamy fichu she is fair with golden brown hair and grey eyes  she enters with the selfpossession of a woman accustomed to the privileges of rank and beauty the innkeeper who has excellent natural manners is highly appreciative of her napoleon on whom her eyes first fall is instantly smitten selfconscious his color deepens he becomes stiffer and less at ease than before she perceives this instantly and not to embarrass him turns in an infinitely well bred manner to pay the respect of a glance to the other gentleman who is staring at her dress as at the earths final masterpiece of treacherous dissimulation with feelings altogether inexpressible and indescribable as she looks at him she becomes deadly pale there is no mistaking her expression a revelation of some fatal error utterly unexpected has suddenly appalled her in the midst of tranquillity security and victory the next moment a wave of color rushes up from beneath the creamy fichu and drowns her whole face one can see that she is blushing all over her body even the lieutenant ordinarily incapable of observation and just now lost in the tumult of his wrath can see a thing when it is painted red for him interpreting the blush as the involuntary confession of black deceit confronted with its victim he points to it with a loud crow of retributive triumph and then seizing her by the wrist pulls her past him into the room as he claps the door to and plants himself with his back to it  lieutenant so ive got you my lad so youve disguised yourself have you in a voice of thunder take off that skirt  giuseppe remonstrating oh lieutenant  lady affrighted but highly indignant at his having dared to touch her gentlemen i appeal to you giuseppe making a movement as if to run to giuseppe  lieutenant interposing sword in hand no you dont  lady taking refuge with napoleon ah sir you are an officera general you will protect me will you not  lieutenant never you mind him general leave me to deal with him  napoleon with him with whom sir why do you treat this lady in such a fashion  lieutenant lady hes a man the man i showed my confidence in advancing threateningly here you  lady running behind napoleon and in her agitation embracing the arm which he instinctively extends before her as a fortification oh thank you general keep him away  napoleon nonsense sir this is certainly a lady she suddenly drops his arm and blushes again and you are under arrest put down your sword sir instantly  lieutenant general i tell you hes an austrian spy he passed himself off on me as one of general massenas staff this afternoon and now hes passing himself off on you as a woman am i to believe my own eyes or not  lady general it must be my brother he is on general massenas staff he is very like me  lieutenant his mind giving way do you mean to say that youre not your brother but your sisterthe sister who was so like mewho had my beautiful blue eyes it was a lie your eyes are not like mine theyre exactly like your own what perfidy  napoleon lieutenant will you obey my orders and leave the room since you are convinced at last that this is no gentleman  lieutenant gentleman i should think not no gentleman would have abused my confi  napoleon out of all patience enough sir enough will you leave the room i order you to leave the room  lady oh pray let me go instead  napoleon drily excuse me madame with all respect to your brother i do not yet understand what an officer on general massenas staff wants with my letters i have some questions to put to you  giuseppe discreetly come lieutenant he opens the door  lieutenant im off general take warning by me be on your guard against the better side of your nature to the lady madame my apologies i thought you were the same person only of the opposite sex and that naturally misled me  lady sweetly it was not your fault was it im so glad youre not angry with me any longer lieutenant she offers her hand  lieutenant bending gallantly to kiss it oh madam not the lea checking himself and looking at it you have your brothers hand and the same sort of ring  lady sweetly we are twins  lieutenant that accounts for it he kisses her hand a thousand pardons i didnt mind about the despatches at all thats more the generals affair than mine it was the abuse of my confidence through the better side of my nature taking his cap gloves and whip from the table and going youll excuse my leaving you general i hope very sorry im sure he talks himself out of the room giuseppe follows him and shuts the door  napoleon looking after them with concentrated irritation idiot the strange lady smiles sympathetically he comes frowning down the room between the table and the fireplace all his awkwardness gone now that he is alone with her  lady how can i thank you general for your protection  napoleon turning on her suddenly my despatches come he puts out his hand for them  lady general she involuntarily puts her hands on her fichu as if to protect something there  napoleon you tricked that blockhead out of them you disguised yourself as a man i want my despatches they are there in the bosom of your dress under your hands  lady quickly removing her hands oh how unkindly you are speaking to me she takes her handkerchief from her fichu you frighten me she touches her eyes as if to wipe away a tear  napoleon i see you dont know me madam or you would save yourself the trouble of pretending to cry  lady producing an effect of smiling through her tears yes i do know you you are the famous general buonaparte she gives the name a marked italian pronunciation bwawnaparrte  napoleon angrily with the french pronunciation bonaparte madame bonaparte the papers if you please  lady but i assure you he snatches the handkerchief rudely from her general indignantly  napoleon taking the other handkerchief from his breast you were good enough to lend one of your handkerchiefs to my lieutenant when you robbed him he looks at the two handkerchiefs they match one another he smells them the same scent he flings them down on the table i am waiting for the despatches i shall take them if necessary with as little ceremony as the handkerchief this historical incident was used eighty years later by m victorien sardou in his drama entitled dora  lady in dignified reproof general do you threaten women  napoleon bluntly yes  lady disconcerted trying to gain time but i dont understand i  napoleon you understand perfectly you came here because your austrian employers calculated that i was six leagues away i am always to be found where my enemies dont expect me you have walked into the lions den come you are a brave woman be a sensible one i have no time to waste the papers he advances a step ominously  lady breaking down in the childish rage of impotence and throwing herself in tears on the chair left beside the table by the lieutenant i brave how little you know i have spent the day in an agony of fear i have a pain here from the tightening of my heart at every suspicious look every threatening movement do you think every one is as brave as you oh why will not you brave people do the brave things why do you leave them to us who have no courage at all im not brave i shrink from violence danger makes me miserable  napoleon interested then why have you thrust yourself into danger  lady because there is no other way i can trust nobody else and now it is all uselessall because of you who have no fear because you have no heart no feeling no she breaks off and throws herself on her knees ah general let me go let me go without asking any questions you shall have your despatches and letters i swear it  napoleon holding out his hand yes i am waiting for them she gasps daunted by his ruthless promptitude into despair of moving him by cajolery but as she looks up perplexedly at him it is plain that she is racking her brains for some device to outwit him he meets her regard inflexibly  lady rising at last with a quiet little sigh i will get them for you they are in my room she turns to the door  napoleon i shall accompany you madame  lady drawing herself up with a noble air of offended delicacyi cannot permit you general to enter my chamber  napoleon then you shall stay here madame whilst i have your chamber searched for my papers  lady spitefully openly giving up her plan you may save yourself the trouble they are not there  napoleon no i have already told you where they are pointing to her breast  lady with pretty piteousness general i only want to keep one little private letter only one let me have it  napoleon cold and stern is that a reasonable demand madam  lady encouraged by his not refusing point blank no but that is why you must grant it are your own demands reasonable thousands of lives for the sake of your victories your ambitions your destiny and what i ask is such a little thing and i am only a weak woman and you a brave man she looks at him with her eyes full of tender pleading and is about to kneel to him again  napoleon brusquely get up get up he turns moodily away and takes a turn across the room pausing for a moment to say over his shoulder youre talking nonsense and you know it she gets up and sits down in almost listless despair on the couch when he turns and sees her there he feels that his victory is complete and that he may now indulge in a little play with his victim he comes back and sits beside her she looks alarmed and moves a little away from him but a ray of rallying hope beams from her eye he begins like a man enjoying some secret joke how do you know i am a brave man  lady amazed you general buonaparte italian pronunciation  napoleon yes i general bonaparte emphasizing the french pronunciation  lady oh how can you ask such a question you who stood only two days ago at the bridge at lodi with the air full of death fighting a duel with cannons across the river shuddering oh you do brave things  napoleon so do you  lady i with a sudden odd thought oh are you a coward  napoleon laughing grimly and pinching her cheek that is the one question you must never ask a soldier the sergeant asks after the recruits height his age his wind his limb but never after his courage he gets up and walks about with his hands behind him and his head bowed chuckling to himself  lady as if she had found it no laughing matter ah you can laugh at fear then you dont know what fear is  napoleon coming behind the couch tell me this suppose you could have got that letter by coming to me over the bridge at lodi the day before yesterday suppose there had been no other way and that this was a sure wayif only you escaped the cannon she shudders and covers her eyes for a moment with her hands would you have been afraid  lady oh horribly afraid agonizingly afraid she presses her hands on her heart it hurts only to imagine it  napoleon inflexibly would you have come for the despatches  lady overcome by the imagined horror dont ask me i must have come  napoleon why  lady because i must because there would have been no other way  napoleon with conviction because you would have wanted my letter enough to bear your fear there is only one universal passion fear of all the thousand qualities a man may have the only one you will find as certainly in the youngest drummer boy in my army as in me is fear it is fear that makes men fight it is indifference that makes them run away fear is the mainspring of war fear i know fear well better than you better than any woman i once saw a regiment of good swiss soldiers massacred by a mob in paris because i was afraid to interfere i felt myself a coward to the tips of my toes as i looked on at it seven months ago i revenged my shame by pounding that mob to death with cannon balls well what of that has fear ever held a man back from anything he really wantedor a woman either never come with me and i will show you twenty thousand cowards who will risk death every day for the price of a glass of brandy and do you think there are no women in the army braver than the men because their lives are worth less psha i think nothing of your fear or your bravery if you had had to come across to me at lodi you would not have been afraid once on the bridge every other feeling would have gone down before the necessitythe necessityfor making your way to my side and getting what you wanted  and now suppose you had done all thissuppose you had come safely out with that letter in your hand knowing that when the hour came your fear had tightened not your heart but your grip of your own purposethat it had ceased to be fear and had become strength penetration vigilance iron resolutionhow would you answer then if you were asked whether you were a coward  lady rising ah you are a hero a real hero  napoleon pooh theres no such thing as a real hero he strolls down the room making light of her enthusiasm but by no means displeased with himself for having evoked it  lady ah yes there is there is a difference between what you call my bravery and yours you wanted to win the battle of lodi for yourself and not for anyone else didnt you  napoleon of course suddenly recollecting himself stop no he pulls himself piously together and says like a man conducting a religious service i am only the servant of the french republic following humbly in the footsteps of the heroes of classical antiquity i win battles for humanityfor my country not for myself  lady disappointed oh then you are only a womanish hero after all she sits down again all her enthusiasm gone her elbow on the end of the couch and her cheek propped on her hand  napoleon greatly astonished womanish  lady listlessly yes like me with deep melancholy do you think that if i only wanted those despatches for myself i dare venture into a battle for them no if that were all i should not have the courage to ask to see you at your hotel even my courage is mere slavishness it is of no use to me for my own purposes it is only through love through pity through the instinct to save and protect someone else that i can do the things that terrify me  napoleon contemptuously pshaw he turns slightingly away from her  lady aha now you see that im not really brave relapsing into petulant listlessness but what right have you to despise me if you only win your battles for others for your country through patriotism that is what i call womanish it is so like a frenchman  napoleon furiously i am no frenchman  lady innocently i thought you said you won the battle of lodi for your country general bu shall i pronounce it in italian or french  napoleon you are presuming on my patience madam i was born a french subject but not in france  lady folding her arms on the end of the couch and leaning on them with a marked access of interest in him you were not born a subject at all i think  napoleon greatly pleased starting on a fresh march eh eh you think not  lady i am sure of it  napoleon well well perhaps not the selfcomplacency of his assent catches his own ear he stops short reddening then composing himself into a solemn attitude modelled on the heroes of classical antiquity he takes a high moral tone but we must not live for ourselves alone little one never forget that we should always think of others and work for others and lead and govern them for their own good selfsacrifice is the foundation of all true nobility of character  lady again relaxing her attitude with a sigh ah it is easy to see that you have never tried it general  napoleon indignantly forgetting all about brutus and scipio what do you mean by that speech madam  lady havent you noticed that people always exaggerate the value of the things they havent got the poor think they only need riches to be quite happy and good everybody worships truth purity unselfishness for the same reasonbecause they have no experience of them oh if they only knew  napoleon with angry derision if they only knew pray do you know  lady with her arms stretched down and her hands clasped on her knees looking straight before her yes i had the misfortune to be born good glancing up at him for a moment and it is a misfortune i can tell you general i really am truthful and unselfish and all the rest of it and its nothing but cowardice want of character want of being really strongly positively oneself  napoleon ha turning to her quickly with a flash of strong interest  lady earnestly with rising enthusiasm what is the secret of your power only that you believe in yourself you can fight and conquer for yourself and for nobody else you are not afraid of your own destiny you teach us what we all might be if we had the will and courage and that suddenly sinking on her knees before him is why we all begin to worship you she kisses his hands  napoleon embarrassed tut tut pray rise madam  lady do not refuse my homage it is your right you will be emperor of france  napoleon hurriedly take care treason  lady insisting yes emperor of france then of europe perhaps of the world i am only the first subject to swear allegiance again kissing his hand my emperor  napoleon overcome raising her pray pray no no little one this is folly come be calm be calm petting her there there my girl  lady struggling with happy tears yes i know it is an impertinence in me to tell you what you must know far better than i do but you are not angry with me are you  napoleon angry no no not a bit not a bit come you are a very clever and sensible and interesting little woman he pats her on the cheek shall we be friends  lady enraptured your friend you will let me be your friend oh she offers him both her hands with a radiant smile you see i show my confidence in you  napoleon with a yell of rage his eyes flashing what  lady whats the matter  napoleon show your confidence in me so that i may show my confidence in you in return by letting you give me the slip with the despatches eh ah dalila dalila you have been trying your tricks on me and i have been as great a gull as my jackass of a lieutenant he advances threateningly on her come the despatches quick i am not to be trifled with now  lady flying round the couch general  napoleon quick i tell you he passes swiftly up the middle of the room and intercepts her as she makes for the vineyard  lady at bay confronting him you dare address me in that tone  napoleon dare  lady yes dare who are you that you should presume to speak to me in that coarse way oh the vile vulgar corsican adventurer comes out in you very easily  napoleon beside himself you she devil savagely once more and only once will you give me those papers or shall i tear them from youby force  lady letting her hands fall  tear them from meby force as he glares at her like a tiger about to spring she crosses her arms on her breast in the attitude of a martyr the gesture and pose instantly awaken his theatrical instinct he forgets his rage in the desire to show her that in acting too she has met her match he keeps her a moment in suspense then suddenly clears up his countenance puts his hands behind him with provoking coolness looks at her up and down a couple of times takes a pinch of snuff wipes his fingers carefully and puts up his handkerchief her heroic pose becoming more and more ridiculous all the time  napoleon at last well  lady disconcerted but with her arms still crossed devotedly well what are you going to do  napoleon spoil your attitude  lady you brute abandoning the attitude she comes to the end of the couch where she turns with her back to it leaning against it and facing him with her hands behind her  napoleon ah thats better  now listen to me i like you whats more i value your respect  lady you value what you have not got then  napoleon i shall have it presently now attend to me suppose i were to allow myself to be abashed by the respect due to your sex your beauty your heroism and all the rest of it suppose i with nothing but such sentimental stuff to stand between these muscles of mine and those papers which you have about you and which i want and mean to have suppose i with the prize within my grasp were to falter and sneak away with my hands empty or what would be worse cover up my weakness by playing the magnanimous hero and sparing you the violence i dared not use would you not despise me from the depths of your womans soul would any woman be such a fool well bonaparte can rise to the situation and act like a woman when it is necessary do you understand  the lady without speaking stands upright and takes a packet of papers from her bosom for a moment she has an intense impulse to dash them in his face but her good breeding cuts her off from any vulgar method of relief she hands them to him politely only averting her head the moment he takes them she hurries across to the other side of the room covers her face with her hands and sits down with her body turned away to the back of the chair  napoleon gloating over the papers aha thats right thats right before opening them he looks at her and says excuse me he sees that she is hiding her face very angry with me eh he unties the packet the seal of which is already broken and puts it on the table to examine its contents  lady quietly taking down her hands and showing that she is not crying but only thinking no you were right but i am sorry for you  napoleon pausing in the act of taking the uppermost paper from the packet sorry for me why  lady i am going to see you lose your honor  napoleon hm nothing worse than that he takes up the paper  lady and your happiness  napoleon happiness little woman is the most tedious thing in the world to me should i be what i am if i cared for happiness anything else  lady nothing he interrupts her with an exclamation of satisfaction she proceeds quietly except that you will cut a very foolish figure in the eyes of france  napoleon quickly what the hand holding the paper involuntarily drops the lady looks at him enigmatically in tranquil silence he throws the letter down and breaks out into a torrent of scolding what do you mean eh are you at your tricks again do you think i dont know what these papers contain ill tell you first my information as to beaulieus retreat there are only two things he can doleatherbrained idiot that he isshut himself up in mantua or violate the neutrality of venice by taking peschiera you are one of old leatherbrains spies he has discovered that he has been betrayed and has sent you to intercept the information at all hazardsas if that could save him from me the old fool the other papers are only my usual correspondence from paris of which you know nothing  lady prompt and businesslike general let us make a fair division take the information your spies have sent you about the austrian army and give me the paris correspondence that will content me  napoleon his breath taken away by the coolness of the proposal a fair di he gasps it seems to me madame that you have come to regard my letters as your own property of which i am trying to rob you  lady earnestly no on my honor i ask for no letter of yoursnot a word that has been written by you or to you that packet contains a stolen letter a letter written by a woman to a mana man not her husbanda letter that means disgrace infamy  napoleon a love letter  lady bittersweetly what else but a love letter could stir up so much hate  napoleon why is it sent to me to put the husband in my power eh  lady no no it can be of no use to you i swear that it will cost you nothing to give it to me it has been sent to you out of sheer malicesolely to injure the woman who wrote it  napoleon then why not send it to her husband instead of to me  lady completely taken aback oh sinking back into the chair ii dont know she breaks down  napoleon aha i thought so a little romance to get the papers back he throws the packet on the table and confronts her with cynical goodhumor per bacco little woman i cant help admiring you if i could lie like that it would save me a great deal of trouble  lady wringing her hands oh how i wish i really had told you some lie you would have believed me then the truth is the one thing that nobody will believe  napoleon with coarse familiarity treating her as if she were a vivandiere capital capital he puts his hands behind him on the table and lifts himself on to it sitting with his arms akimbo and his legs wide apart come i am a true corsican in my love for stories but i could tell them better than you if i set my mind to it next time you are asked why a letter compromising a wife should not be sent to her husband answer simply that the husband would not read it do you suppose little innocent that a man wants to be compelled by public opinion to make a scene to fight a duel to break up his household to injure his career by a scandal when he can avoid it all by taking care not to know  lady revolted suppose that packet contained a letter about your own wife  napoleon offended coming off the table you are impertinent madame  lady humbly i beg your above suspicion  napoleon with a deliberate assumption of superiority you have committed an indiscretion i pardon you in future do not permit yourself to introduce real persons in your romances  lady politely ignoring a speech which is to her only a breach of good manners and rising to move towards the table general there really is a womans letter there pointing to the packet give it to me  napoleon with brute conciseness moving so as to prevent her getting too near the letters why  lady she is an old friend we were at school together she has written to me imploring me to prevent the letter falling into your hands  napoleon why has it been sent to me  lady because it compromises the director barras  napoleon frowning evidently startled barras haughtily take care madame the director barras is my attached personal friend  lady nodding placidly yes you became friends through your wife  napoleon again have i not forbidden you to speak of my wife she keeps looking curiously at him taking no account of the rebuke more and more irritated he drops his haughty manner of which he is himself somewhat impatient and says suspiciously lowering his voice who is this woman with whom you sympathize so deeply  lady oh general how could i tell you that  napoleon illhumoredly beginning to walk about again in angry perplexity ay ay stand by one another you are all the same you women  lady indignantly we are not all the same any more than you are do you think that if i loved another man i should pretend to go on loving my husband or be afraid to tell him or all the world but this woman is not made that way she governs men by cheating them and with disdain they like it and let her govern them she sits down again with her back to him  napoleon not attending to her barras barras i turning very threateningly to her his face darkening take care take care do you hear you may go too far  lady innocently turning her face to him whats the matter  napoleon what are you hinting at who is this woman  lady meeting his angry searching gaze with tranquil indifference as she sits looking up at him with her right arm resting lightly along the back of her chair and one knee crossed over the other a vain silly extravagant creature with a very able and ambitious husband who knows her through and throughknows that she has lied to him about her age her income her social position about everything that silly women lie aboutknows that she is incapable of fidelity to any principle or any person and yet could not help loving hercould not help his mans instinct to make use of her for his own advancement with barras  napoleon in a stealthy coldly furious whisper this is your revenge you she cat for having had to give me the letters  lady nonsense or do you mean that you are that sort of man  napoleon exasperated clasps his hands behind him his fingers twitching and says as he walks irritably away from her to the fireplace this woman will drive me out of my senses to her begone  lady seated immovably not without that letter  napoleon begone i tell you walking from the fireplace to the vineyard and back to the table you shall have no letter i dont like you youre a detestable woman and as ugly as satan i dont choose to be pestered by strange women be off he turns his back on her in quiet amusement she leans her cheek on her hand and laughs at him he turns again angrily mocking her ha ha ha what are you laughing at  lady at you general i have often seen persons of your sex getting into a pet and behaving like children but i never saw a really great man do it before  napoleon brutally flinging the words in her face pooh flattery flattery coarse impudent flattery  lady springing up with a bright flush in her cheeks oh you are too bad keep your letters read the story of your own dishonor in them and much good may they do you goodbye she goes indignantly towards the inner door  napoleon my own stop come back come back i order you she proudly disregards his savagely peremptory tone and continues on her way to the door he rushes at her seizes her by the wrist and drags her back now what do you mean explain explain i tell you orthreatening her she looks at him with unflinching defiance rrrr you obstinate devil you why cant you answer a civil question  lady deeply offended by his violence why do you ask me you have the explanation  napoleon where  lady pointing to the letters on the table there you have only to read it he snatches the packet up hesitates looks at her suspiciously and throws it down again  napoleon you seem to have forgotten your solicitude for the honor of your old friend  lady she runs no risk now she does not quite understand her husband  napoleon i am to read the letter then he stretches out his hand as if to take up the packet again with his eye on her  lady i do not see how you can very well avoid doing so now he instantly withdraws his hand oh dont be afraid you will find many interesting things in it  napoleon for instance  lady for instance a duelwith barras a domestic scene a broken household a public scandal a checked career all sorts of things  napoleon hm he looks at her takes up the packet and looks at it pursing his lips and balancing it in his hand looks at her again passes the packet into his left hand and puts it behind his back raising his right to scratch the back of his head as he turns and goes up to the edge of the vineyard where he stands for a moment looking out into the vines deep in thought the lady watches him in silence somewhat slightingly suddenly he turns and comes back again full of force and decision i grant your request madame your courage and resolution deserve to succeed take the letters for which you have fought so well and remember henceforth that you found the vile vulgar corsican adventurer as generous to the vanquished after the battle as he was resolute in the face of the enemy before it he offers her the packet  lady without taking it looking hard at him what are you at now i wonder he dashes the packet furiously to the floor aha ive spoiled that attitude i think she makes him a pretty mocking curtsey  napoleon snatching it up again will you take the letters and begone advancing and thrusting them upon her  lady escaping round the table no i dont want letters  napoleon ten minutes ago nothing else would satisfy you  lady keeping the table carefully between them ten minutes ago you had not insulted me past all bearing  napoleon i swallowing his spleen i apologize  lady coolly thanks with forced politeness he offers her the packet across the table she retreats a step out of its reach and says but dont you want to know whether the austrians are at mantua or peschiera  napoleon i have already told you that i can conquer my enemies without the aid of spies madame  lady and the letter dont you want to read that  napoleon you have said that it is not addressed to me i am not in the habit of reading other peoples letters he again offers the packet  lady in that case there can be no objection to your keeping it all i wanted was to prevent your reading it cheerfully good afternoon general she turns coolly  towards the inner door  napoleon furiously flinging the packet on the couch heaven grant me patience he goes up determinedly and places himself before the door have you any sense of personal danger or are you one of those women who like to be beaten black and blue  lady thank you general i have no doubt the sensation is very voluptuous but i had rather not i simply want to go home thats all i was wicked enough to steal your despatches but you have got them back and you have forgiven me because delicately reproducing his rhetorical cadence you are as generous to the vanquished after the battle as you are resolute in the face of the enemy before it wont you say goodbye to me she offers her hand sweetly  napoleon repulsing the advance with a gesture of concentrated rage and opening the door to call fiercely giuseppe louder giuseppe he bangs the door to and comes to the middle of the room the lady goes a little way into the vineyard to avoid him  giuseppe appearing at the door excellency  napoleon where is that fool  giuseppe he has had a good dinner according to your instructions excellency and is now doing me the honor to gamble with me to pass the time  napoleon send him here bring him here come with him giuseppe with unruffled readiness hurries off napoleon turns curtly to the lady saying i must trouble you to remain some moments longer madame he comes to the couch she comes from the vineyard down the opposite side of the room to the sideboard and posts herself there leaning against it watching him he takes the packet from the couch and deliberately buttons it carefully into his breast pocket looking at her meanwhile with an expression which suggests that she will soon find out the meaning of his proceedings and will not like it nothing more is said until the lieutenant arrives followed by giuseppe who stands modestly in attendance at the table the lieutenant without cap sword or gloves and much improved in temper and spirits by his meal chooses the ladys side of the room and waits much at his ease for napoleon to begin  napoleon lieutenant  lieutenant encouragingly general  napoleon i cannot persuade this lady to give me much information but there can be no doubt that the man who tricked you out of your charge was as she admitted to you her brother  lieutenant triumphantly what did i tell you general what did i tell you  napoleon you must find that man your honor is at stake and the fate of the campaign the destiny of france of europe of humanity perhaps may depend on the information those despatches contain  lieutenant yes i suppose they really are rather serious as if this had hardly occurred to him before  napoleon energetically they are so serious sir that if you do not recover them you will be degraded in the presence of your regiment  lieutenant whew the regiment wont like that i can tell you  napoleon personally i am sorry for you i would willingly conceal the affair if it were possible but i shall be called to account for not acting on the despatches i shall have to prove to all the world that i never received them no matter what the consequences may be to you i am sorry but you see that i cannot help myself  lieutenant goodnaturedly oh dont take it to heart general its really very good of you never mind what happens to me i shall scrape through somehow and well beat the austrians for you despatches or no despatches i hope you wont insist on my starting off on a wild goose chase after the fellow now i havent a notion where to look for him  giuseppe deferentially you forget lieutenant he has your horse  lieutenant starting i forgot that resolutely ill go after him general ill find that horse if its alive anywhere in italy and i shant forget the despatches never fear giuseppe go and saddle one of those mangy old posthorses of yours while i get my cap and sword and things quick march off with you bustling him  giuseppe instantly lieutenant instantly he disappears in the vineyard where the light is now reddening with the sunset  lieutenant looking about him on his way to the inner door by the way general did i give you my sword or did i not oh i remember now fretfully its all that nonsense about putting a man under arrest one never knows where to find talks himself out of the room  lady still at the sideboard what does all this mean general  napoleon he will not find your brother  lady of course not theres no such person  napoleon the despatches will be irrecoverably lost  lady nonsense they are inside your coat  napoleon you will find it hard i think to prove that wild statement the lady starts he adds with clinching emphasis those papers are lost  lady anxiously advancing to the corner of the table and that unfortunate young mans career will be sacrificed  napoleon his career the fellow is not worth the gunpowder it would cost to have him shot he turns contemptuously and goes to the hearth where he stands with his back to her  lady wistfully you are very hard men and women are nothing to you but things to be used even if they are broken in the use  napoleon turning on her which of us has broken this fellowi or you who tricked him out of the despatches did you think of his career then  lady naively concerned about him oh i never thought of that it was brutal of me but i couldnt help it could i how else could i have got the papers supplicating general you will save him from disgrace  napoleon laughing sourly save him yourself since you are so clever it was you who ruined him with savage intensity i hate a bad soldier  he goes out determinedly through the vineyard she follows him a few steps with an appealing gesture but is interrupted by the return of the lieutenant gloved and capped with his sword on ready for the road he is crossing to the outer door when she intercepts him  lady lieutenant  lieutenant importantly you mustnt delay me you know duty madame duty  lady imploringly oh sir what are you going to do to my poor brother  lieutenant are you very fond of him  lady i should die if anything happened to him you must spare him the lieutenant shakes his head gloomily yes yes you must you shall he is not fit to die listen to me if i tell you where to find himif i undertake to place him in your hands a prisoner to be delivered up by you to general bonapartewill you promise me on your honor as an officer and a gentleman not to fight with him or treat him unkindly in any way  lieutenant but suppose he attacks me he has my pistols  lady he is too great a coward  lieutenant i dont feel so sure about that hes capable of anything  lady if he attacks you or resists you in any way i release you from your promise  lieutenant my promise i didnt mean to promise look here youre as bad as he is youve taken an advantage of me through the better side of my nature what about my horse  lady it is part of the bargain that you are to have your horse and pistols back  lieutenant honor bright  lady honor bright she offers her hand  lieutenant taking it and holding it all right ill be as gentle as a lamb with him his sisters a very pretty woman he attempts to kiss her  lady slipping away from him oh lieutenant you forget your career is at stakethe destiny of europeof humanity  lieutenant oh bother the destiny of humanity making for her only a kiss  lady retreating round the table not until you have regained your honor as an officer remember you have not captured my brother yet  lieutenant seductively youll tell me where he is wont you  lady i have only to send him a certain signal and he will be here in quarter of an hour  lieutenant hes not far off then  lady no quite close wait here for him when he gets my message he will come here at once and surrender himself to you you understand  lieutenant intellectually overtaxed well its a little complicated but i daresay it will be all right  lady and now whilst youre waiting dont you think you had better make terms with the general  lieutenant oh look here this is getting frightfully complicated what terms  lady make him promise that if you catch my brother he will consider that you have cleared your character as a soldier he will promise anything you ask on that condition  lieutenant thats not a bad idea thank you i think ill try it  lady do and mind above all things dont let him see how clever you are  lieutenant i understand hed be jealous  lady dont tell him anything except that you are resolved to capture my brother or perish in the attempt he wont believe you then you will produce my brother  lieutenant interrupting as he masters the plot and have the laugh at him i say what a clever little woman you are shouting giuseppe  lady sh not a word to giuseppe about me she puts her finger on her lips he does the same they look at one another warningly then with a ravishing smile she changes the gesture into wafting him a kiss and runs out through the inner door electrified he bursts into a volley of chuckles giuseppe comes back by the outer door  giuseppe the horse is ready lieutenant  lieutenant im not going just yet go and find the general and tell him i want to speak to him  giuseppe shaking his head that will never do lieutenant  lieutenant why not  giuseppe in this wicked world a general may send for a lieutenant but a lieutenant must not send for a general  lieutenant oh you think he wouldnt like it well perhaps youre right one has to be awfully particular about that sort of thing now weve got a republic  napoleon reappears advancing from the vineyard buttoning the breast of his coat pale and full of gnawing thoughts  giuseppe unconscious of napoleons approach quite true lieutenant quite true you are all like innkeepers now in france you have to be polite to everybody  napoleon putting his hand on giuseppes shoulder and that destroys the whole value of politeness eh  lieutenant the very man i wanted see here general suppose i catch that fellow for you  napoleon with ironical gravity you will not catch him my friend  lieutenant aha you think so but youll see just wait only if i do catch him and hand him over to you will you cry quits will you drop all this about degrading me in the presence of my regiment not that i mind you know but still no regiment likes to have all the other regiments laughing at it  napoleon a cold ray of humor striking pallidly across his gloom what shall we do with this officer giuseppe everything he says is wrong  giuseppe promptly make him a general excellency and then everything he says will be right  lieutenant crowing hawaw he throws himself ecstatically on the couch to enjoy the joke  napoleon laughing and pinching giuseppes ear you are thrown away in this inn giuseppe he sits down and places giuseppe before him like a schoolmaster with a pupil shall i take you away with me and make a man of you  giuseppe shaking his head rapidly and repeatedly no thank you general all my life long people have wanted to make a man of me when i was a boy our good priest wanted to make a man of me by teaching me to read and write then the organist at melegnano wanted to make a man of me by teaching me to read music the recruiting sergeant would have made a man of me if i had been a few inches taller but it always meant making me work and i am too lazy for that thank heaven so i taught myself to cook and became an innkeeper and now i keep servants to do the work and have nothing to do myself except talk which suits me perfectly  napoleon looking at him thoughtfully you are satisfied  giuseppe with cheerful conviction quite excellency  napoleon and you have no devouring devil inside you who must be fed with action and victorygorged with them night and daywho makes you pay with the sweat of your brain and body weeks of herculean toil for ten minutes of enjoymentwho is at once your slave and your tyrant your genius and your doomwho brings you a crown in one hand and the oar of a galley slave in the otherwho shows you all the kingdoms of the earth and offers to make you their master on condition that you become their servanthave you nothing of that in you  giuseppe nothing of it oh i assure you excellency my devouring devil is far worse than that he offers me no crowns and kingdoms he expects to get everything for nothingsausages omelettes grapes cheese polenta winethree times a day excellency nothing less will content him  lieutenant come drop it giuseppe youre making me feel hungry again  giuseppe with an apologetic shrug retires from the conversation and busies himself at the table dusting it setting the map straight and replacing napoleons chair which the lady has pushed back  napoleon turning to the lieutenant with sardonic ceremony i hope i have not been making you feel ambitious  lieutenant not at all i dont fly so high besides im better as i am men like me are wanted in the army just now the fact is the revolution was all very well for civilians but it wont work in the army you know what soldiers are general they will have men of family for their officers a subaltern must be a gentleman because hes so much in contact with the men but a general or even a colonel may be any sort of riffraff if he understands the shop well enough a lieutenant is a gentleman all the rest is chance why who do you suppose won the battle of lodi ill tell you my horse did  napoleon rising your folly is carrying you too far sir take care  lieutenant not a bit of it you remember all that redhot cannonade across the river the austrians blazing away at you to keep you from crossing and you blazing away at them to keep them from setting the bridge on fire did you notice where i was then  napoleon with menacing politeness i am sorry i am afraid i was rather occupied at the moment  giuseppe with eager admiration they say you jumped off your horse and worked the big guns with your own hands general  lieutenant that was a mistake an officer should never let himself down to the level of his men napoleon looks at him dangerously and begins to walk tigerishly to and fro but you might have been firing away at the austrians still if we cavalry fellows hadnt found the ford and got across and turned old beaulieus flank for you you know you darent have given the order to charge the bridge if you hadnt seen us on the other side consequently i say that whoever found that ford won the battle of lodi well who found it i was the first man to cross and i know it was my horse that found it with conviction as he rises from the couch that horse is the true conqueror of the austrians  napoleon passionately you idiot ill have you shot for losing those despatches ill have you blown from the mouth of a cannon nothing less could make any impression on you baying at him do you hear do you understand  a french officer enters unobserved carrying his sheathed sabre in his hand  lieutenant unabashed if i dont capture him general remember the if  napoleon if if ass there is no such man  the officer suddenly stepping between them and speaking in the unmistakable voice of the strange lady lieutenant i am your prisoner she offers him her sabre they are amazed napoleon gazes at her for a moment thunderstruck then seizes her by the wrist and drags her roughly to him looking closely and fiercely at her to satisfy himself as to her identity for it now begins to darken rapidly into night the red glow over the vineyard giving way to clear starlight  napoleon pah he flings her hand away with an exclamation of disgust and turns his back on her with his hand in his breast and his brow lowering  lieutenant triumphantly taking the sabre no such man eh general to the lady i say wheres my horse  lady safe at borghetto waiting for you lieutenant  napoleon turning on them where are the despatches  lady you would never guess they are in the most unlikely place in the world did you meet my sister here any of you  lieutenant yes very nice woman shes wonderfully like you but of course shes better looking  lady mysteriously well do you know that she is a witch  giuseppe running down to them in terror crossing himself oh no no no it is not safe to jest about such things i cannot have it in my house excellency  lieutenant yes drop it youre my prisoner you know of course i dont believe in any such rubbish but still its not a proper subject for joking  lady but this is very serious my sister has bewitched the general giuseppe and the lieutenant recoil from napoleon general open your coat you will find the despatches in the breast of it she puts her hand quickly on his breast yes there they are i can feel them eh she looks up into his face half coaxingly half mockingly will you allow me general she takes a button as if to unbutton his coat and pauses for permission  napoleon inscrutably if you dare  lady thank you she opens his coat and takes out the despatches there to giuseppe showing him the despatches see  giuseppe flying to the outer door no in heavens name theyre bewitched  lady turning to the lieutenant here lieutenant youre not afraid of them  lieutenant retreating keep off seizing the hilt of the sabre keep off i tell you  lady to napoleon they belong to you general take them  giuseppe dont touch them excellency have nothing to do with them  lieutenant be careful general be careful  giuseppe burn them and burn the witch too  lady to napoleon shall i burn them  napoleon thoughtfully yes burn them giuseppe go and fetch a light  giuseppe trembling and stammering do you mean go alonein the darkwith a witch in the house  napoleon psha youre a poltroon to the lieutenant oblige me by going lieutenant  lieutenant remonstrating oh i say general no look here you know nobody can say im a coward after lodi but to ask me to go into the dark by myself without a candle after such an awful conversation is a little too much how would you like to do it yourself  napoleon irritably you refuse to obey my order  lieutenant resolutely yes i do its not reasonable but ill tell you what ill do if giuseppe goes ill go with him and protect him  napoleon to giuseppe there will that satisfy you be off both of you  giuseppe humbly his lips trembling wwillingly your excellency he goes reluctantly towards the inner door heaven protect me to the lieutenant after you lieutenant  lieutenant youd better go first i dont know the way  giuseppe you cant miss it besides imploringly laying his hand on his sleeve i am only a poor innkeeper and you are a man of family  lieutenant theres something in that here you neednt be in such a fright take my arm giuseppe does so thats the waythey go out arm in arm it is now starry night the lady throws the packet on the table and seats herself at her ease on the couch enjoying the sensation of freedom from petticoats  lady well general ive beaten you  napoleon walking about you have been guilty of indelicacyof unwomanliness do you consider that costume a proper one to wear  lady it seems to me much the same as yours  napoleon psha i blush for you  lady naively yes soldiers blush so easily he growls and turns away she looks mischievously at him balancing the despatches in her hand wouldnt you like to read these before theyre burnt general you must be dying with curiosity take a peep she throws the packet on the table and turns her face away from it i wont look  napoleon i have no curiosity whatever madame but since you are evidently burning to read them i give you leave to do so  lady oh ive read them already  napoleon starting what  lady i read them the first thing after i rode away on that poor lieutenants horse so you see i know whats in them and you dont  napoleon excuse me i read them there in the vineyard ten minutes ago  lady oh jumping up oh general ive not beaten you i do admire you so he laughs and pats her cheek this time really and truly without shamming i do you homage kissing his hand  napoleon quickly withdrawing it brr dont do that no more witchcraft  lady i want to say something to youonly you would misunderstand it  napoleon need that stop you  lady well it is this i adore a man who is not afraid to be mean and selfish  napoleon indignantly i am neither mean nor selfish  lady oh you dont appreciate yourself besides i dont really mean meanness and selfishness  napoleon thank you i thought perhaps you did  lady well of course i do but what i mean is a certain strong simplicity about you  napoleon thats better  lady you didnt want to read the letters but you were curious about what was in them so you went into the garden and read them when no one was looking and then came back and pretended you hadnt thats the meanest thing i ever knew any man do but it exactly fulfilled your purpose and so you werent a bit afraid or ashamed to do it  napoleon abruptly where did you pick up all these vulgar scruplesthis with contemptuous emphasis conscience of yours i took you for a ladyan aristocrat was your grandfather a shopkeeper pray  lady no he was an englishman  napoleon that accounts for it the english are a nation of shopkeepers now i understand why youve beaten me  lady oh i havent beaten you and im not english  napoleon yes you areenglish to the backbone listen to me i will explain the english to you  lady eagerly do with a lively air of anticipating an intellectual treat she sits down on the couch and composes herself to listen to him secure of his audience he at once nerves himself for a performance he considers a little before he begins so as to fix her attention by a moment of suspense his style is at first modelled on talmas in corneilles cinna but it is somewhat lost in the darkness and talma presently gives way to napoleon the voice coming through the gloom with startling intensity  napoleon there are three sorts of people in the world the low people the middle people and the high people the low people and the high people are alike in one thing they have no scruples no morality the low are beneath morality the high above it i am not afraid of either of them for the low are unscrupulous without knowledge so that they make an idol of me whilst the high are unscrupulous without purpose so that they go down before my will look you i shall go over all the mobs and all the courts of europe as a plough goes over a field it is the middle people who are dangerous they have both knowledge and purpose but they too have their weak point they are full of scrupleschained hand and foot by their morality and respectability  lady then you will beat the english for all shopkeepers are middle people  napoleon no because the english are a race apart no englishman is too low to have scruples no englishman is high enough to be free from their tyranny but every englishman is born with a certain miraculous power that makes him master of the world when he wants a thing he never tells himself that he wants it he waits patiently until there comes into his mind no one knows how a burning conviction that it is his moral and religious duty to conquer those who have got the thing he wants then he becomes irresistible like the aristocrat he does what pleases him and grabs what he wants like the shopkeeper he pursues his purpose with the industry and steadfastness that come from strong religious conviction and deep sense of moral responsibility he is never at a loss for an effective moral attitude as the great champion of freedom and national independence he conquers and annexes half the world and calls it colonization when he wants a new market for his adulterated manchester goods he sends a missionary to teach the natives the gospel of peace the natives kill the missionary he flies to arms in defence of christianity fights for it conquers for it and takes the market as a reward from heaven in defence of his island shores he puts a chaplain on board his ship nails a flag with a cross on it to his topgallant mast and sails to the ends of the earth sinking burning and destroying all who dispute the empire of the seas with him he boasts that a slave is free the moment his foot touches british soil and he sells the children of his poor at six years of age to work under the lash in his factories for sixteen hours a day he makes two revolutions and then declares war on our one in the name of law and order there is nothing so bad or so good that you will not find englishmen doing it but you will never find an englishman in the wrong he does everything on principle he fights you on patriotic principles he robs you on business principles he enslaves you on imperial principles he bullies you on manly principles he supports his king on loyal principles and cuts off his kings head on republican principles his watchword is always duty and he never forgets that the nation which lets its duty get on the opposite side to its interest is lost he  lady wwwwwwh do stop a moment i want to know how you make me out to be english at this rate  napoleon dropping his rhetorical style its plain enough you wanted some letters that belonged to me you have spent the morning in stealing themyes stealing them by highway robbery and you have spent the afternoon in putting me in the wrong about themin assuming that it was i who wanted to steal your lettersin explaining that it all came about through my meanness and selfishness and your goodness your devotion your selfsacrifice thats english  lady nonsense i am sure i am not a bit english the english are a very stupid people  napoleon yes too stupid sometimes to know when theyre beaten but i grant that your brains are not english you see though your grandfather was an englishman your grandmother waswhat a frenchwoman  lady oh no an irishwoman  napoleon quickly irish thoughtfully yes i forgot the irish an english army led by an irish general that might be a match for a french army led by an italian general he pauses and adds half jestingly half moodily at all events you have beaten me and what beats a man first will beat him last he goes meditatively into the moonlit vineyard and looks up she steals out after him she ventures to rest her hand on his shoulder overcome by the beauty of the night and emboldened by its obscurity  lady softly what are you looking at  napoleon pointing up my star  lady you believe in that  napoleon i do they look at it for a moment she leaning a little on his shoulder  lady do you know that the english say that a mans star is not complete without a womans garter  napoleon scandalizedabruptly shaking her off and coming back into the room pah the hypocrites if the french said that how they would hold up their hands in pious horror he goes to the inner door and holds it open shouting hallo giuseppe wheres that light man he comes between the table and the sideboard and moves the chair to the table beside his own we have still to burn the letter he takes up the packet giuseppe comes back pale and still trembling carrying a branched candlestick with a couple of candles alight in one hand and a broad snuffers tray in the other  giuseppe piteously as he places the light on the table excellency what were you looking up at just nowout there he points across his shoulder to the vineyard but is afraid to look round  napoleon unfolding the packet what is that to you  giuseppe stammering because the witch is gonevanished and no one saw her go out  lady coming behind him from the vineyard we were watching her riding up to the moon on your broomstick giuseppe you will never see her again  giuseppe gesu maria he crosses himself and hurries out  napoleon throwing down the letters in a heap on the table now he sits down at the table in the chair which he has just placed  lady yes but you know you have the letter in your pocket he smiles takes a letter from his pocket and tosses it on the top of the heap she holds it up and looks at him saying about caesars wife  napoleon caesars wife is above suspicion burn it  lady taking up the snuffers and holding the letter to the candle flame with it i wonder would caesars wife be above suspicion if she saw us here together  napoleon echoing her with his elbows on the table and his cheeks on his hands looking at the letter i wonder the strange lady puts the letter down alight on the snuffers tray and sits down beside napoleon in the same attitude elbows on table cheeks on hands watching it burn when it is burnt they simultaneously turn their eyes and look at one another the curtain steals down and hides them
