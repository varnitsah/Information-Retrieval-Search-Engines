replying  mr wilks watched it from the quay  master hardy on the beach enacting the part of david  mr wilks replied that he was biding his time  a particularly hard nut to crack  a stool in the local bank  a diversion was created by the entrance of a new arrival  he stepped across the road to his emporium  most comfortable shoulder in sunwich she murmured  the most astounding and gratifying instance of the wonders effected by time was that of miss nugent  mr swann with growing astonishment slowly mastered the contents  fullalove alley  she caught sight of hardy  undiluted wisdom and advice flowed from his lips  what do you want inquired miss kybird  he regarded the wife of his bosom with a calculating glance  he even obtained work down at the harbor  miss kybird standing in the doorway of the shop  me or imwhich is it to be  i wonder what the governorll say  a spirit of quiet despair  a return visit  he set off towards the life and bustle of the two schooners  for the second time he left the court without a stain on his character  the proprietor eyed him with furtive glee as he passed  miss nugents consternation was difficult of concealment  he found his remaining guest holding his aching head beneath the tap  mr nathan smith  it was not until he had consumed a pint or two of the strongest brew that he began to regain some of his old selfesteem  the man on the other side fell on all fours into the room  he pushed open the small lattice window and peered out into the alley  tapping the steward on the chest with a confidential finger he backed him into a corner  he finished up the evening at the chequers  the meagre figure of mrs silk  in search of mr smith  i ave heard of em exploding  he stepped to the side and looked over  you keep on nugent dont you mind im

much gravity  youre a deceiver she gasped  it was teddy done it said mr kybird humbly  pausing occasionally to answer anxious inquiries  she placed her other arm in that of hardy     chapter i  the ancient port of sunwich was basking in the sunshine of a july afternoon a rattle of cranes and winches sounded from the shipping in the harbour but the town itself was half asleep somnolent shopkeepers in dim back parlours coyly veiled their faces in red handkerchiefs from the too ardent flies while small boys left in charge noticed listlessly the slow passing of time as recorded by the church clock  it is a fine church and sunwich is proud of it the tall grey tower is a landmark at sea but from the narrow streets of the little town itself it has a disquieting appearance of rising suddenly above the roofs huddled beneath it for the purpose of displaying a blackfaced clock with gilt numerals whose mellow chimes have recorded the passing hours for many generations of sunwich men  regardless of the heat which indeed was mild compared with that which raged in his own bosom captain nugent fresh from the inquiry of the collision of his ship conqueror with the german barque hans muller strode rapidly up the high street in the direction of home an honest seafaring smell compounded of tar rope and fish known to the educated of sunwich as ozone set his thoughts upon the sea he longed to be aboard ship again with the court of inquiry to form part of his crew in all his fifty years of life he had never met such a collection of fools his hard blue eyes blazed as he thought of them and the mouth hidden by his wellkept beard was set with anger  mr samson wilks his steward who had been with him to london to give evidence had had a time upon which he looked back in later years with much satisfaction at his powers of endurance he was with the captain and yet not with him when they got out of the train at sunwich he hesitated as to whether he should follow the captain or leave him his excuse for following was the bag his reason for leaving the volcanic condition of its owners temper coupled with the fact that he appeared to be sublimely ignorant that the most devoted steward in the world was tagging faithfully along a yard or two in the rear  the few passersby glanced at the couple with interest mr wilks had what is called an expressive face and he had worked his sandy eyebrows his weak blue eyes and large tremulous mouth into such an expression of surprise at the finding of the court that he had all the appearance of a beholder of visions he changed the bag to his other hand as they left the town behind them and regarded with gratitude the approaching end of his labours  at the gardengate of a fairsized house some halfmile along the road the captain stopped and after an impatient fumbling at the latch strode up the path followed by mr wilks and knocked at the door as he paused on the step he half turned and for the first time noticed the facial expression of his faithful follower  what the dickens are you looking like that for he demanded  ive been surprised sir conceded mr wilks surprised and astonished  wrath blazed again in the captains eyes and set lines in his forehead he was being pitied by a steward  youve been drinking he said crisply put that bag down  arsking your pardon sir said the steward twisting his unusually dry lips into a smile but ive ad no opportunity sirive been follerin you all day sir  a servant opened the door youve been soaking in it for a month declared the captain as he entered the hall why the blazes dont you bring that bag in are you so drunk you dont know what you are doing  mr wilks picked the bag up and followed humbly into the house then he lost his head altogether and gave some colour to his superior officers charges by first cannoning into the servant and then wedging the captain firmly in the doorway of the sittingroom with the bag  steward rasped the captain  yessir said the unhappy mr wilks  go and sit down in the kitchen and dont leave this house till youre sober  mr wilks disappeared he was not in his first lustre but he was an ardent admirer of the sex and in an absentminded way he passed his arm round the handmaidens waist and sustained a buffet which made his head ring  a man o your age and drunk too explained the damsel  mr wilks denied both charges it appeared that he was much younger than he looked while as for drink he had forgotten the taste of it a question as to the reception ann would have accorded a boyish teetotaler remained unanswered  in the sittingroom mrs kingdom the captains widowed sister put down her crochetwork as her brother entered and turned to him expectantly there was an expression of loving sympathy on her mild and rather foolish face and the captain stiffened at once  i was in the wrong he said harshly as he dropped into a chair my certificate has been suspended for six months and my first officer has been commended  suspended gasped mrs kingdom pushing back the white streamer to the cap which she wore in memory of the late mr kingdom and sitting upright you  i think thats what i said replied her brother  mrs kingdom gazed at him mournfully and putting her hand behind her began a wriggling search in her pocket for a handkerchief with the idea of paying a wholesome tribute of tears she was a pastmaster in the art of grief and pending its extraction a docile tear hung on her eyelid and waited the captain eyed her preparations with silent anger  i am not surprised said mrs kingdom dabbing her eyes i expected it somehow i seemed to have a warning of it something seemed to tell me i couldnt explain but i seemed to know  she sniffed gently and wiping one eye at a time kept the disengaged one charged with sisterly solicitude upon her brother the captain with steadily rising anger endured this game of oneeyed bopeep for five minutes then he rose and muttering strange things in his beard stalked upstairs to his room  mrs kingdom thus forsaken dried her eyes and resumed her work the remainder of the family were in the kitchen ministering to the wants of a misunderstood steward and in return extracting information which should render them independent of the captains version  was it very solemn sam inquired miss nugent aged nine who was sitting on the kitchen table  mr wilks used his hands and eyebrows to indicate the solemnity of the occasion  they even made the capn leave off speaking he said in an awed voice  i should have liked to have been there said master nugent dutifully  ann said miss nugent go and draw sam a jug of beer  beer miss said ann  a jug of beer repeated miss nugent peremptorily  ann took a jug from the dresser and mr wilks who was watching her coughed helplessly his perturbation attracted the attention of his hostess and looking round for the cause she was just in time to see ann disappearing into the larder with a cream jug  the big jug ann she said impatiently you ought to know sam would like a big one  ann changed the jugs and ignoring a mild triumph in mr wilkss eye returned to the larder whence ensued a musical trickling then miss nugent raising the jug with some difficulty poured out a tumbler for the steward with her own fair hands  sam likes beer she said speaking generally  i knew that the first time i see him miss remarked the vindictive ann  mr wilks drained his glass and set it down on the table again making a feeble gesture of repulse as miss nugent refilled it  go on sam she said with kindly encouragement how much does this jug hold jack  quart replied her brother  how many quarts are there in a gallon  four  miss nugent looked troubled i heard father say he drinks gallons a day she remarked youd better fill all the jugs ann  it was only is way o speaking said mr wilks hurriedly the capn is like that sometimes  i knew a man once miss said ann as used to prefer to ave it in a washhand basin odd uglylooking man e was like mr wilks in the face only betterlooking  mr wilks sat upright and in the mental struggle involved in taking in this insult in all its ramifications did not notice until too late that miss nugent had filled his glass again  it must ha been nice for the captain to ave you with im today remarked ann carelessly  it was said mr wilks pausing with the glass at his lips and eyeing her sternly eighteen years ive bin with imever since e ad a ship e took a fancy to me the fust time e set eyes on me  were you betterlooking then sam inquired miss nugent shuffling closer to him on the table and regarding him affectionately  much as i am now miss replied mr wilks setting down his glass and regarding anns giggles with a cold eye  miss nugent sighed i love you sam she said simply will you have some more beer  mr wilks declined gracefully eighteen years ive bin with the capn he remarked softly through calms and storms fair weather and foul samson wilks as been by is side always ready in a quiet and umble way to do is best for im and nownow that e is on his beamends and lost is ship samson wilksll sit down and starve ashore till he gets another  at these touching words miss nugent was undisguisedly affected and wiping her bright eyes with her pinafore gave her small wellshaped nose a slight touch en passant with the same useful garment and squeezed his arm affectionately  its a lively lookout for me if father is going to be at home for long remarked master nugent wholl get his ship sam  shouldnt wonder if the fust officer mr hardy got it replied the steward he was going deadslow in the fog afore he sent down to rouse your father and as soon as your father came on deck e went at arfspeed mr hardy was commended and your fathers certifikit was suspended for six months  master nugent whistled thoughtfully and quitting the kitchen proceeded upstairs to his room and first washing himself with unusual care for a boy of thirteen put on a clean collar and brushed his hair he was not going to provide a suspended mastermariner with any obvious reasons for faultfinding while he was thus occupied the sittingroom bell rang and ann answering it left mr wilks in the kitchen listening with some trepidation to the conversation  is that steward of mine still in the kitchen demanded the captain gruffly  yessir said ann  whats he doing  mr wilkss ears quivered anxiously and he eyed with unwonted disfavour the evidences of his late debauch  sitting down sir replied ann  give him a glass of ale and send him off commanded the captain and if that was miss kate i heard talking send her in to me  ann took the message back to the kitchen and with the air of a martyr engaged upon an unpleasant task drew mr wilks another glass of ale and stood over him with wellaffected wonder while he drank it miss nugent walked into the sittingroom and listening in a perfunctory fashion to a shipmasters platitude on kitchencompany took a seat on his knee and kissed his ear     chapter ii  the downfall of captain nugent was for some time a welcome subject of conversation in marine circles at sunwich at the goblets a rambling old inn with paved courtyard and wooden galleries which almost backed on to the churchyard brothercaptains attributed it to an error of judgment at the two schooners on the quay the profanest of sailormen readily attributed it to an allseeing providence with a dislike of overbearing shipmasters  the captains cup was filled to the brim by the promotion of his first officer to the command of the conqueror it was by far the largest craft which sailed from the port of sunwich and its master held a corresponding dignity amongst the captains of lesser vessels their allegiance was now transferred to captain hardy and the master of a brig which was in the last stages of senile decay meeting nugent in the goblets actually showed him by means of two lucifer matches how the collision might have been avoided  a touching feature in the business and a source of much gratification to mr wilks by the sentimental applause evoked by it was his renunciation of the post of steward on the ss conqueror sunwich buzzed with the tidings that after eighteen years service with captain nugent he preferred starvation ashore to serving under another master although comfortable in pocket and known to be living with his mother who kept a small general shop he was regarded as a man on the brink of starvation pints were thrust upon him and the tale of his nobility increased with much narration it was considered that the whole race of stewards had acquired fresh lustre from his action  his only unfavourable critic was the erring captain himself he sent a peremptory summons to mr wilks to attend at equator lodge and the moment he set eyes upon that piece of probity embarked upon such a vilification of his personal defects and character as mr wilks had never even dreamt of he wound up by ordering him to rejoin the ship forthwith  arsking your pardon sir said mr wilks with tender reproach but i couldnt  are you going to live on your mother you hulking rascal quoth the incensed captain  no sir said mr wilks ive got a little money sir enough for my few wants till we sail again  when i sail again you wont come with me said the captain grimly i suppose you want an excuse for a soak ashore for six months  mr wilks twiddled his cap in his hands and smiled weakly  i thought praps as youd like me to come round and wait at table and help with the knives and boots and suchlike he said softly ann is agreeable  get out of the house said the captain in quiet measured tones  mr wilks went but on his way to the gate he picked up three pieces of paper which had blown into the garden weeded two pieces of grass from the path and carefully removed a dead branch from a laurel facing the window he would have done more but for an imperative knocking on the glass and he left the premises sadly putting his collection of rubbish over the next garden fence as he passed it  but the next day the captains boots bore such a polish that he was able to view his own startled face in them and at dinnertime the brightness of the knives was so conspicuous that mrs kingdom called ann in for the purpose of asking her why she didnt always do them like that her brother ate his meal in silence and going to his room afterwards discovered every pair of boots he possessed headed by the tall seaboots standing in a nicely graduated line by the wall and all shining their hardest  for two days did mr wilks do good by stealth leaving ann to blush to find it fame but on the third day at dinner as the captain took up his knife and fork to carve he became aware of a shadow standing behind his chair a shadow in a blue coat with metal buttons which whipping up the first plate carved carried it to mrs kingdom and then leaned against her with the vegetable dishes  the dishes clattered a little on his arm as he helped the captain but the latter after an impressive pause and a vain attempt to catch the eye of mr wilks which was intent upon things afar off took up the spoon and helped himself from the unwonted silence of miss nugent in the presence of anything unusual it was clear to him that the whole thing had been carefully arranged he ate in silence and a resolution to kick mr wilks off the premises vanished before the comfort to say nothing of the dignity afforded by his presence mr wilks somewhat reassured favoured miss nugent with a wink to which although she had devoted much time in trying to acquire the art she endeavoured in vain to respond  it was on the day following this that jack nugent at his sisters instigation made an attempt to avenge the family honour miss nugent although she treated him with scant courtesy herself had a touching faith in his prowess a faith partly due to her brother occasionally showing her his bicep muscles in moments of exaltation  theres that horrid jem hardy she said suddenly as they walked along the road  so it is said master nugent but without any display of enthusiasm  halloa jack shouted master hardy across the road  the suspense became painful  halloa responded the other  hes going to fight you shrilled miss nugent who thought these amenities illtimed he said so  master hardy crossed the road what for he demanded with surprise  because youre a nasty horrid boy replied miss nugent drawing herself up  oh said master hardy blankly  the two gentlemen stood regarding each other with uneasy grins the lady stood by in breathless expectation the suspense became painful  who are you staring at demanded master nugent at last  you replied the other who are you staring at  you said master nugent defiantly  there was a long interval both gentlemen experiencing some difficulty in working up sufficient heat for the engagement  you hit me and see what youll get said master hardy at length  you hit me said the other  cowardy cowardy custard chanted the wellbred miss nugent ate his mothers mustard cowardy cowardy cus  why dont you send that kid home demanded master hardy eyeing the fair songstress with strong disfavour  you leave my sister alone said the other giving him a light tap on the shoulder theres your cowards blow  master hardy made a ceremonious return theres yours he said lets go behind the church  his foe assented and they proceeded in grave silence to a piece of grass screened by trees which stood between the church and the beach here they removed their coats and rolled up their shirtsleeves things look different out of doors and to miss nugent the arms of both gentlemen seemed somewhat sticklike in their proportions  the preliminaries were awful both combatants prancing round each other with their faces just peering above their bent right arms while their trusty lefts dealt vicious blows at the air miss nugent turned pale and caught her breath at each blow then she suddenly reddened with wrath as james philip hardy having paid his tribute to science began to hammer john augustus nugent about the face in a most painful and workmanlike fashion  she hid her face for a moment and when she looked again jack was on the ground and master hardy just rising from his prostrate body then jack rose slowly and crossing over to her borrowed her handkerchief and applied it with great tenderness to his nose  does it hurt jack she inquired anxiously no growled her brother  he threw down the handkerchief and turned to his opponent again miss nugent who was careful about her property stooped to recover it and immediately found herself involved in a twisting tangle of legs from which she escaped by a miracle to see master hardy cuddling her brother round the neck with one hand and punching him as hard and as fast as he could with the other the unfairness of it maddened her and the next moment master hardys head was drawn forcibly backwards by the hair the pain was so excruciating that he released his victim at once and miss nugent emitting a series of terrified yelps dashed off in the direction of home her hair bobbing up and down on her shoulders and her small black legs in an ecstasy of motion  master hardy with no very welldefined ideas of what he was going to do if he caught her started in pursuit his scalp was still smarting and his eyes watering with the pain as he pounded behind her panting wildly she heard him coming closer and closer and she was just about to give up when to her joy she saw her father coming towards them  master hardy intent on his quarry saw him just in time and swerving into the road passed in safety as miss nugent flung herself with some violence at her fathers waistcoat and clinging to him convulsively fought for breath it was some time before she could furnish the astonished captain with full details and she was pleased to find that his indignation led him to ignore the hairgrabbing episode on which to do her justice she touched but lightly  that evening for the first time in his life captain nugent after some deliberation called upon his late mate the old servant who since mrs hardys death the year before had looked after the house was out and hardy unaware of the honour intended him was scandalized by the manner in which his son received the visitor the door opened there was an involuntary grunt from master hardy and the next moment he sped along the narrow passage and darted upstairs his father after waiting in vain for his return went to the door himself  good evening capn he said in surprise  nugent responded gruffly and followed him into the sittingroom to an invitation to sit he responded more gruffly still that he preferred to stand he then demanded instant and sufficient punishment of master hardy for frightening his daughter  even as he spoke he noticed with strong disfavour the change which had taken place in his late first officer the change which takes place when a man is promoted from that rank to that of master is subtle but unmistakablesometimes as in the present instance more unmistakable than subtle captain hardy coiled his long sinewy form in an armchair and eyeing him calmly lit his pipe before replying  boys will fight he said briefly  im speaking of his running after my daughter said nugent sternly  hardys eyes twinkled young dog he said genially at his age too  captain nugents face was suffused with wrath at the pleasantry and he regarded him with a fixed stare on board the conqueror there was a witchery in that glance more potent than the spoken word but in his own parlour the new captain met it calmly  i didnt come here to listen to your foolery said nugent i came to tell you to punish that boy of yours  and i shant do it replied the other i have got something better to do than interfere in childrens quarrels i havent got your spare time you know  captain nugent turned purple such language from his late first officer was a revelation to him  i also came to warn you he said furiously that i shall take the law into my own hands if you refuse  aye aye said hardy with careless contempt ill tell him to keep out of your way but i should advise you to wait until i have sailed  captain nugent who was moving towards the door swung round and confronted him savagely  what do you mean he demanded  what i say retorted captain hardy i dont want to indulge sunwich with the spectacle of two middleaged shipmasters at fisticuffs but thats whatll happen if you touch my boy it would probably please the spectators more than it would us  ill cane him the first time i lay hands on him roared captain nugent  captain hardys stock of patience was at an end and there was moreover a long and undischarged account between himself and his late skipper he rose and crossed to the door  jem he cried come downstairs and show captain nugent out  there was a breathless pause captain nugent ground his teeth with fury as he saw the challenge and realized the ridiculous position into which his temper had led him and the other who was also careful of appearances repented the order the moment he had given it matters had now however passed out of their hands and both men cast appraising glances at each others form the only one who kept his head was master hardy and it was a source of considerable relief to both of them when from the top of the stairs the voice of that youthful solomon was heard declining in the most positive terms to do anything of the kind  captain hardy repeated his command the only reply was the violent closing of a door at the top of the house and after waiting a short time he led the way to the front door himself  you will regret your insolence before i have done with you said his visitor as he paused on the step its the old story of a beggar on horseback  its a good story said captain hardy but to my mind it doesnt come up to the one about humptydumpty goodnight     chapter iii  if anything was wanted to convince captain nugent that his action had been foolish and his language intemperate it was borne in upon him by the subsequent behaviour of master hardy generosity is seldom an attribute of youth while egotism on the other hand is seldom absent so far from realizing that the captain would have scorned such lowly game master hardy believed that he lived for little else and his jackinthebox ubiquity was a constant marvel and discomfort to that irritable mariner did he approach a seat on the beach it was master hardy who rose at the last moment to make room for him did he stroll down to the harbour it was in the wake of a small boy looking coyly at him over his shoulder every small alley as he passed seemed to contain a jem hardy who whizzed out like a human firework in front of him and then followed dancing on his toes a pace or two in his rear  this was on weekdays on the sabbath master hardys daring ingenuity led him to still further flights all the seats at the parish church were free but captain nugent whose admirable practice it was to take his entire family to church never thoroughly realized how free they were until master hardy squeezed his way in and taking a seat next to him prayed with unwonted fervour into the interior of a new hat and then sitting back watched with polite composure the efforts of miss nugents family to restrain her growing excitement  charmed with the experiment he repeated it the following sunday this time he boarded the seat from the other end and seeing no place by the captain took one or more correctly speaking made one between miss nugent and jack and despite the formers elbow began to feel almost like one of the family hostile feelings vanished and with an amiable smile at the halffrantic miss nugent he placed a bullseye of great strength in his cheek and leaning forward for a hymnbook left one on the ledge in front of jack a doubledistilled perfume at once assailed the atmosphere  miss nugent sat dazed at his impudence and for the first time in her life doubts as to her fathers capacity stirred within her she attempted the poor consolation of an acid tablet and it was at once impounded by the watchful mrs kingdom meantime the reek of bullseyes was insufferable  the service seemed interminable and all that time the indignant damsel wedged in between her aunt and the openly exultant enemy of her house was compelled to endure in silence she did indeed attempt one remark and master hardy with a horrified expression of outraged piety said hsh and shook his head at her it was almost more than flesh and blood could bear and when the unobservant mrs kingdom asked her for the text on the way home her reply nearly cost her the loss of her dinner  the conqueror under its new commander sailed on the day following mr wilks watched it from the quay and the new steward observing him came to the side and holding aloft an old pantrycloth between his finger and thumb until he had attracted his attention dropped it overboard with every circumstance of exaggerated horror by the time a suitable retort had occurred to the exsteward the steamer was half a mile distant and the extraordinary and unnatural pantomime in which he indulged on the edge of the quay was grievously misinterpreted by a nervous man in a sailing boat  master hardy had also seen the ship out and perched on the extreme end of the breakwater he remained watching until she was hull down on the horizon then he made his way back to the town and the nearest confectioner and started for home just as miss nugent who was about to pay a call with her aunt waited beautifully dressed in the front garden while that lady completed her preparations  feeling very spic and span and still a trifle uncomfortable from the vigorous attentions of ann who cleansed her as though she had been a doorstep she paced slowly up and down the path upon these occasions of high dress a spirit of sabbath calm was wont to descend upon her and save her from escapades to which in a less severe garb she was somewhat prone  she stopped at the gate and looked up the road then her face flushed and she cast her eyes behind her to make sure that the halldoor stood open the hated scion of the house of hardy was coming down the road and in view of that fact she forgot all elseeven her manners  the boy still fresh from the loss of his natural protector kept a wary eye on the house as he approached then all expression died out of his face and he passed the gate blankly ignoring the small girl who was leaning over it and apparently suffering from elephantiasis of the tongue he went by quietly and miss nugent raging inwardly that she had misbehaved to no purpose withdrew her tongue for more legitimate uses  boo she cried who had his hair pulled  master hardy pursued the even tenor of his way  whos afraid to answer me for fear my father will thrash him cried the disappointed lady raising her voice  this was too much the enemy retraced his steps and came up to the gate  youre a rude little girl he said with an insufferably grownup air  who had his hair pulled demanded miss nugent capering wildly who had his hair pulled  dont be silly said master hardy here he put his hand in his pocket and producing some nuts offered them over the gate at this miss nugent ceased her capering and wrath possessed her that the enemy should thus misunderstand the gravity of the situation  well give em to jack then pursued the boy he wont say no  this was a distinct reflection on jacks loyalty and her indignation was not lessened by the fact that she knew it was true  go away from our gate she stormed if my father catches you youll suffer  pooh said the daredevil he looked up at the house and then opening the gate strode boldly into the front garden before this intrusion miss nugent retreated in alarm and gaining the doorstep gazed at him in dismay then her face cleared suddenly and master hardy looking over his shoulder saw that his retreat was cut off by mr wilks  dont let him hurt me sam entreated miss nugent piteously  mr wilks came into the garden and closed the gate behind him  i wasnt going to hurt her cried master hardy anxiously as if i should hurt a girl  wot are you doing in our front garden then demanded mr wilks  he sprang forward suddenly and catching the boy by the collar with one huge hand dragged him struggling violently down the sideentrance into the back garden miss nugent following close behind sought to improve the occasion  see what you get by coming into our garden she said  the victim made no reply he was writhing strenuously in order to frustrate mr wilkss evident desire to arrange him comfortably for the administration of the stick he was carrying satisfied at last the exsteward raised his weapon and for some seconds plied it briskly miss nugent trembled but sternly repressing sympathy for the sufferer was pleased that the long arm of justice had at last overtaken him  let him go now sam she said hes crying  im not yelled master hardy frantically  i can see the tears declared miss nugent bending  mr wilks plied the rod again until his victim with a sudden turn fetched him a violent kick on the shin and broke loose the exsteward set off in pursuit somewhat handicapped by the fact that he dare not go over flowerbeds whilst master hardy was singularly free from such prejudices miss nugent ran to the sideentrance to cut off his retreat she was willing for him to be released but not to escape and so it fell out that the boy dodging beneath mr wilkss outspread arms charged blindly up the sideentrance and bowled the young lady over  there was a shrill squeal a flutter of white and a neat pair of button boots waving in the air then miss nugent sobbing piteously rose from the puddle into which she had fallen and surveyed her garments mr wilks surveyed them too and a very cursory glance was sufficient to show him that the case was beyond his powers he took the outraged damsel by the hand and led her howling lustily in to the horrified ann  my word said she gasping look at your gloves look at your frock  but miss nugent was looking at her knees there was only a slight redness about the left but from the right a piece of skin was indubitably missing this knee she gave ann instructions to foment with fair water of a comfortable temperature indulging in satisfied prognostications as to the fate of master hardy when her father should see the damage  the news when the captain came home was broken to him by degrees he was first shown the flowerbeds by ann then mrs kingdom brought in various soiled garments and at the psychological moment his daughter bared her knees  what will you do to him father she inquired  the captain ignored the question in favour of a few remarks on the subject of his daughters behaviour coupled with stern inquiries as to where she learnt such tricks in reply miss nugent sheltered herself behind a list which contained the names of all the young gentlemen who attended her kindergarten class and many of the young ladies and again inquired as to the fate of her assailant  jack came in soon after and the indefatigable miss nugent produced her knees again she had to describe the injury to the left but the right spoke for itself jack gazed at it with indignation and then without waiting for his tea put on his cap and sallied out again  he returned an hour later and instead of entering the sittingroom went straight upstairs to bed from whence he sent down word by the sympathetic ann that he was suffering from a bad headache which he proposed to treat with raw meat applied to the left eye his nose which was apparently suffering from sympathetic inflammation he left to take care of itself that organ bitterly resenting any treatment whatsoever  he described the battle to kate and ann the next day darkly ascribing his defeat to a mysterious compound which jem hardy was believed to rub into his arms to a foolish error of judgment at the beginning of the fray and to the sun which shone persistently in his eyes all the time his audience received the explanations in chilly silence  and he said it was an accident he knocked you down he concluded he said he hoped you werent hurt and he gave me some toffee for you  what did you do with it demanded miss nugent  i knew you wouldnt have it replied her brother inconsequently and there wasnt much of it  his sister regarded him sharply  you dont mean to say you ate it she screamed  why not demanded her brother i wanted comforting i can tell you  i wonder you were not tootoo proud said miss nugent bitterly  im never too proud to eat toffee retorted jack simply  he stalked off in dudgeon at the lack of sympathy displayed by his audience and being still in need of comforting sought it amid the raspberrycanes  his father noted his sons honourable scars but made no comment as to any action on his own part he realized to the full the impotence of a lawabiding and dignified citizen when confronted by lawless youth but master hardy came to church no more indeed the following sunday he was fully occupied on the beach enacting the part of david after first impressing the raving mr wilks into that of goliath     chapter iv  for the next month or two master hardys existence was brightened by the efforts of an elderly steward who made no secret of his intentions of putting an end to it mr wilks at first placed great reliance on the saw that it is the early bird that catches the worm but lost faith in it when he found that it made no provision for cases in which the worm leaning from its bedroom window addressed spirited remonstrances to the bird on the subject of its personal appearance  to the anxious inquiries of miss nugent mr wilks replied that he was biding his time every delay he hinted made it worse for master hardy when the day of retribution should dawn and although she pleaded earnestly for a little on account he was unable to meet her wishes before that day came however captain nugent heard of the proceedings and after a painful interview with the steward during which the latters failings by no means escaped attention confined him to the house  an excellent reason for absenting himself from school was thus denied to master hardy but it has been well said that when one door closes another opens and to his great satisfaction the old servant who had been in poor health for some time suddenly took to her bed and required his undivided attention  he treated her at first with patent medicines purchased at the chemists a doctor being regarded by both of them as a piece of unnecessary extravagance but in spite of four infallible remedies she got steadily worse then a doctor was called in and by the time captain hardy returned home she had made a partial recovery but was clearly incapable of further work she left in a cab to accept a home with a niece leaving the captain confronted with a problem which he had seen growing for some time past  i cant make up my mind what to do with you he observed regarding his son  im very comfortable was the reply  youre too comfortable said his father  youre running wild its just as well poor old martha has gone it has brought things to a head  we could have somebody else suggested his son  the captain shook his head ill give up the house and send you to london to your aunt mary he said slowly she doesnt know you and once im at sea and the house given up she wont be able to send you back  master hardy who was much averse to leaving sunwich and had heard accounts of the lady in question which referred principally to her strength of mind made tender inquiries concerning his fathers comfort while ashore  ill take rooms was the reply and i shall spend as much time as i can with you in london you want looking after my son ive heard all about you  his son without inquiring as to the nature of the information denied it at once upon principle he also alluded darkly to his education and shook his head over the effects of a change at such a critical period of his existence  and you talk too much for your age was his fathers comment when he had finished a year or two with your aunt ought to make a nice boy of you theres plenty of room for improvement  he put his plans in hand at once and a week before he sailed again had disposed of the house some of the furniture he kept for himself but the bulk of it went to his sister as consciencemoney  master hardy in very low spirits watched it taken away big men in hobnailed boots ran noisily up the bare stairs and came down slowly steering large pieces of furniture through narrow passages and using much vain repetition when they found their hands acting as fenders the wardrobe a piece of furniture which had been built for larger premises was a particularly hard nut to crack but they succeeded at lastin three places  a few of his intimates came down to see the last of him and miss nugent who in some feminine fashion regarded the move as a triumph for her family passed by several times it might have been chance it might have been design but the boy could not help noticing that when the piano the wardrobe and other fine pieces were being placed in the van she was at the other end of the road a position from which such curios as a broken washstand or a twolegged chair never failed to entice her  it was over at last the second van had disappeared and nothing was left but a litter of straw and paper the front door stood open and revealed desolation miss nugent came to the gate and stared in superciliously  im glad youre going she said frankly  master hardy scarcely noticed her one of his friends who concealed strong business instincts beneath a sentimental exterior had suggested souvenirs and given him a spectacleglass said to have belonged to henry viii and he was busy searching his pockets for an adequate return then captain hardy came up and first going over the empty house came out and bade his son accompany him to the station a minute or two later and they were out of sight the sentimentalist stood on the curb gloating over a newly acquired penknife and miss nugent after being strongly reproved by him for curiosity paced slowly home with her head in the air  sunwich made no stir over the departure of one of its youthful citizens indeed it lacked not those who would have cheerfully parted with two or three hundred more the boy was quite chilled by the tameness of his exit and for years afterwards the desolate appearance of the platform as the train steamed out occurred to him with an odd sense of discomfort in all sunwich there was only one person who grieved over his departure and he after keeping his memory green for two years wrote off fivepence as a bad debt and dismissed him from his thoughts  two months after the conqueror had sailed again captain nugent obtained command of a steamer sailing between london and the chinese ports from the gratified lips of mr wilks sunwich heard of this new craft the particular glory of which appeared to be the luxurious appointments of the stewards quarters language indeed failed mr wilks in describing it and pressed for details he could only murmur disjointedly of satinwood polished brass and crimson velvet  jack nugent hailed his fathers departure with joy they had seen a great deal of each other during the latters prolonged stay ashore and neither had risen in the others estimation in consequence he became enthusiastic over the sea as a profession for fathers and gave himself some airs over acquaintances less fortunately placed in the first flush of liberty he took to staying away from school the education thus lost being only partially atoned for by a grownup style of composition engendered by dictating excuses to the easygoing mrs kingdom  at seventeen he learnt somewhat to his surprise that his education was finished his father provided the information and simply as a matter of form consulted him as to his views for the future it was an important thing to decide upon at short notice but he was equal to it and having suggested golddigging as the only profession he cared for was promptly provided by the incensed captain with a stool in the local bank  he occupied it for three weeks a period of time which coincided to a day with his fathers leave ashore he left behind him his initials cut deeply in the lid of his desk a miscellaneous collection of cheap fiction and a few experiments in bookkeeping which the manager ultimately solved with red ink and a ruler  a slight uneasiness as to the wisdom of his proceedings occurred to him just before his fathers return but he comforted himself and kate with the undeniable truth that after all the captain couldnt eat him he was afraid however that the latter would be displeased and with a constitutional objection to unpleasantness he contrived to be out when he returned leaving to mrs kingdom the task of breaking the news  the captains reply was brief and to the point he asked his son whether he would like to go to sea and upon receiving a decided answer in the negative at once took steps to send him there in two days he had procured him an outfit and within a week jack nugent greatly to his own surprise was on the way to melbourne as apprentice on the barque silver stream  he liked it even less than the bank the monotony of the sea was appalling to a youth of his tastes and the fact that the skipper a man who never spoke except to find fault was almost loquacious with him failed to afford him any satisfaction he liked the mates no better than the skipper and having said as much one day to the second officer had no reason afterwards to modify his opinions he lived a life apart and except for the cook another martyr to faultfinding had no society  in these uncongenial circumstances the new apprentice worked for four months as he had never believed it possible he could work he was annoyed both at the extent and the variety of his tasks the work of an ab being gratuitously included in his curriculum the end of the voyage found him desperate and after a hasty consultation with the cook they deserted together and went upcountry  letters dealing mainly with the ideas and adventures of the cook reached sunwich at irregular intervals and were eagerly perused by mrs kingdom and kate but the captain forbade all mention of him then they ceased altogether and after a year or two of unbroken silence mrs kingdom asserted herself and a photograph in her possession the only one extant exposing the missing jack in petticoats and sash suddenly appeared on the drawingroom mantelpiece  the captain stared but made no comment disappointed in his son he turned for consolation to his daughter noting with some concern the unaccountable changes which that young lady underwent during his absences he noticed a difference after every voyage he left behind him on one occasion a nice trim little girl and returned to find a creature all legs and arms he returned again and found the arms less obnoxious and the legs hidden by a long skirt and as he complained in secret astonishment to his sister she had developed a motherly manner in her dealings with him which was almost unbearable  shell grow out of it soon said mrs kingdom you wait and see  the captain growled and waited and found his sisters prognostications partly fulfilled the exuberance of miss nugents manner was certainly modified by time but she developed instead a quiet unassuming habit of authority which he liked as little  she gets made such a fuss of its no wonder said mrs kingdom with a satisfied smile i never heard of a girl getting as much attention as she does its a wonder her head isnt turned  eh said the startled captain shed better not let me see anything of it  just so said mrs kingdom  the captain dwelt on these words and kept his eyes open and owing to his daughters benevolent efforts on his behalf had them fully occupied he went to sea firmly convinced that she would do something foolish in the matrimonial line the glowing terms in which he had overheard her describing the charms of the new postman to mrs kingdom filling him with the direst forebodings  it was his last voyage an unexpected windfall from an almost forgotten uncle and his own investments had placed him in a position of modest comfort and just before miss nugent reached her twentieth birthday he resolved to spend his declining days ashore and give her those advantages of parental attention from which she had been so long debarred  mr wilks to the inconsolable grief of his shipmates left with him he had been for nearly a couple of years in receipt of an annuity purchased for him under the will of his mother and his defection left a gap never to be filled among comrades who had for some time regarded him in the light of an improved drinking fountain     chapter v  on a fine afternoon some two months after his release from the toils of the sea captain nugent sat in the special parlour of the goblets the old inn offers hospitality to all but one parlour has by ancient tradition and the exercise of selfrestraint and proper feeling been from time immemorial reserved for the elite of the town  the captain confident in the security of these unwritten regulations conversed freely with his peers he had been moved to speech by the utter absence of discipline ashore and from that had wandered to the growing evil of revolutionary ideas at sea his remarks were much applauded and two brothercaptains listened with grave respect to a disquisition on the wrongs of shipmasters ensuing on the fancied rights of sailor men the only discordant note being struck by the harbourmaster a man whose ideas had probably been insidiously sapped by a long residence ashore  a man before the mast said the latter fortifying his moral courage with whisky is a human being  nobody denies it said captain nugent looking round  one captain agreed with him  why dont they act like it then demanded the other  nugent and the first captain struck by the remark thought they had perhaps been too hasty in their admission and waited for number two to continue they eyed him with silent encouragement  why dont they act like it then repeated number two who being a man of few ideas was not disposed to waste them  captain nugent and his friend turned to the harbourmaster to see how he would meet this poser  they mostly do he replied sturdily treat a seaman well and hell treat you well  this was rank heresy and moreover seemed to imply something captain nugent wondered dismally whether life ashore would infect him with the same opinions  what about that man of mine who threw a belayingpin at me  the harbourmaster quailed at the challenge the obvious retort was offensive  i shall carry the mark with me to my grave added the captain as a further inducement to him to reply  i hope that youll carry it a long time said the harbourmaster gracefully  here look here hall expostulated captain number two starting up  its all right cooper said nugent  its all right said captain number one and in a rash moment undertook to explain in five minutes he had clouded captain coopers intellect for the afternoon  he was still busy with his selfimposed task when a diversion was created by the entrance of a new arrival a short stout man stood for a moment with the handle of the door in his hand and then came in carefully bearing before him a glass of gin and water it was the first time that he had set foot there and all understood that by this intrusion mr daniel kybird sought to place seacaptains and other dignitaries on a footing with the keepers of slopshops and dealers in old clothes in the midst of an impressive silence he set his glass upon the table and taking a chair drew a small clay pipe from his pocket  aghast at the intrusion the quartette conferred with their eyes a language which is perhaps only successful in love captain cooper who was usually moved to speech by externals was the first to speak  youve got a sty coming on your eye hall he remarked  i daresay  if anybodys got a needle said the captain who loved minor operations  nobody heeded him except the harbourmaster and he muttered something about beams and motes which the captain failed to understand the others were glaring darkly at mr kybird who had taken up a newspaper and was busy perusing it  are you looking for anybody demanded captain nugent at last  no said mr kybird looking at him over the top of his paper  what have you come here for then inquired the captain  i come ere to drink two o gin cold returned mr kybird with a dignity befitting the occupation  well suppose you drink it somewhere else suggested the captain  mr kybird had another supposition to offer suppose i dont he remarked im a respectable british tradesman and my money is as good as yours ive as much right to be here as you ave ive never done anything im ashamed of  and you never will said captain coopers friend grimly not if you live to be a hundred  mr kybird looked surprised at the tribute thankee he said gratefully  well we dont want you here said captain nugent we prefer your room to your company  mr kybird leaned back in his chair and twisted his blunt features into an expression of withering contempt then he took up a glass and drank and discovered too late that in the excitement of the moment he had made free with the speakers whisky  dont apologize interrupted the captain its soon remedied  he took the glass up gingerly and flung it with a crash into the fireplace then he rang the bell  ive smashed a dirty glass he said as the barman entered how much  the man told him and the captain after a few stern remarks about privacy and harpies left the room with his friends leaving the speechless mr kybird gazing at the broken glass and returning evasive replies to the inquiries of the curious charles  he finished his gin and water slowly for months he had been screwing up his courage to carry that room by assault and this was the result he had been insulted almost in the very face of charles a youth whose reputation as a gossip was second to none in sunwich  do you know what i should do if i was you said that worthy as he entered the room again and swept up the broken glass  i do not said mr kybird with lofty indifference  i shouldnt come ere again thats what i should do said charles frankly next time hell throw you in the fireplace  ho said the heated mr kybird ho will he id like to see im ill make im sorry for this afore ive done with im ill learn im to insult a respectable british tradesman ill show him whos who  whatll you do inquired the other  never you mind said mr kybird who was not in a position to satisfy his curiositynever you mind you go and get on with your work charles and praps by the time your moustache as grown big enough to be seen youll ear something  i eard something the other day said the barman musingly about you it was but i wouldnt believe it  wot was it demanded the other  nothing much replied charles standing with his hand on the doorknob but i wouldnt believe it of you i said i couldnt  wotwasit insisted mr kybird  why they said you once gave a man a fair price for a pair of trousers said the barman indignantly  he closed the door behind him softly and mr kybird after a brief pause opened it again and more softly still quitted the precincts of the goblets and stepped across the road to his emporium  captain nugent in happy ignorance of the dark designs of the wardrobe dealer had also gone home he was only just beginning to realize the comparative unimportance of a retired shipmaster and the knowledge was a source of considerable annoyance to him no deferential mates listened respectfully to his instructions no sturdy seaman ran to execute his commands or trembled mutinously at his wrath the only person in the wide world who stood in awe of him was the general servant bella and she made no attempt to conceal her satisfaction at the attention excited by her shortcomings  he paused a moment at the gate and then walking slowly up to the door gave it the knock of a master a full minute passing he knocked again remembering with some misgivings his stern instructions of the day before that the door was to be attended by the servant and by nobody else he had seen miss nugent sitting at the window as he passed it but in the circumstances the fact gave him no comfort a third knock was followed by a fourth and then a distressed voice upstairs was heard calling wildly upon the name of bella  at the fifth knock the house shook and a redfaced maid with her shoulders veiled in a large damp towel passed hastily down the staircase and slipping the catch passed more hastily still upstairs again affording the indignant captain a glimpse of a short striped skirt as it turned the landing  is there any management at all in this house he inquired as he entered the room  bella was dressing said miss nugent calmly and you gave orders yesterday that nobody else was to open the door  nobody else when shes available qualified her father eyeing her sharply when i give orders i expect people to use their common sense why isnt my tea ready its five oclock  the clocks twenty minutes fast said kate whos been meddling with it demanded her father verifying the fact by his watch  miss nugent shook her head its gained that since you regulated it last night she said with a smile  the captain threw himself into an easychair and with one eye on the clock waited until at five minutes to the hour by the right time a clatter of crockery sounded from the kitchen and bella still damp came in with the tray her eye was also on the clock and she smirked weakly in the captains direction as she saw that she was at least two minutes ahead of time at a minute to the hour the teapot itself was on the tray and the heavy breathing of the handmaiden in the kitchen was audible to all  punctual to the minute john said mrs kingdom as she took her seat at the tray its wonderful how that girl has improved since youve been at home she isnt like the same girl  she raised the teapot and after pouring out a little of the contents put it down again and gave it another two minutes at the end of that time the colour being of the same unsatisfactory paleness she set the pot down and was about to raise the lid when an avalanche burst into the room and emptying some tea into the pot from a canisterlid beat a hasty retreat  good tea and welltrained servants muttered the captain to his plate what more can a man want  mrs kingdom coughed and passed his cup miss nugent who possessed a healthy appetite serenely attacked her bread and butter conversation languished  i suppose youve heard the news john said his sister  i daresay i have was the reply  strange he should come back after all these years said mrs kingdom though to be sure i dont know why he shouldnt its his native place and his father lives here  who are you talking about inquired the captain  why james hardy replied his sister i thought you said you had heard hes coming back to sunwich and going into partnership with old swann the shipbroker a very good thing for him i should think  im not interested in the doings of the hardys said the captain gruffly  im sure im not said his sister defensively  captain nugent proceeded with his meal in silence his hatred of hardy had not been lessened by the success which had attended that gentlemans career and was not likely to be improved by the wellbeing of hardy junior he passed his cup for some more tea and with a furtive glance at the photograph on the mantelpiece wondered what had happened to his own son  i dont suppose i should know him if i saw him continued mrs kingdom addressing a respectable old armchair london is sure to have changed him  is this watercress inquired the captain looking up from his plate  yes why said mrs kingdom  i only wanted information said her brother as he deposited the salad in question in the slopbasin  mrs kingdom with a resigned expression tried to catch her nieces eye and caught the captains instead miss nugent happening to glance up saw her fascinated by the basilisk glare of the master of the house  some more tea please she said  her aunt took her cup and in gratitude for the diversion picked out the largest lumps of sugar in the basin  london changes so many people mused the persevering lady stirring her tea ive noticed it before why it is i cant say but the fact remains it seems to improve them altogether i dare say that young hardy  will you understand that i wont have the hardys mentiond in my house said the captain looking up im not interested in their business and i will not have it discussed here  as you please john said his sister drawing herself up its your house and you are master here im sure i dont want to discuss them nothing was farther from my thoughts you understand what your father says kate  perfectly said miss nugent when the desire to talk about the hardys becomes irresistible we must go for a walk  the captain turned in his chair and regarded his daughter steadily she met his gaze with calm affection  i wish you were a boy he growled  youre the only man in sunwich who wishes that said miss nugent complacently and i dont believe you mean it if youll come a little closer ill put my head on your shoulder and convert you  kate said mrs kingdom reprovingly  and talking about heads said miss nugent briskly reminds me that i want a new hat you neednt look like that goodlooking daughters always come expensive  she moved her chair a couple of inches in his direction and smiled alluringly the captain shifted uneasily prudence counselled flight but dignity forbade it he stared hard at mrs kingdom and a smile of rare appreciation on that ladys face endeavoured to fade slowly and naturally into another expression the chair came nearer  dont be foolish said the captain gruffly  the chair came still nearer until at last it touched his and then miss nugent with a sigh of exaggerated content allowed her head to sink gracefully on his shoulder  most comfortable shoulder in sunwich she murmured come and try the other aunt and perhaps youll get a new bonnet  mrs kingdom hastened to reassure her brother she would almost as soon have thought of putting her head on the block at the same time it was quite evident that she was taking a mild joy in his discomfiture and eagerly awaiting further developments  when you are tired of this childish behaviour miss said the captain stiffly  there was a pause kate said mrs kingdom in tones of mild reproof how can you  very good said the captain well see who gets tired of it first im in no hurry  a delicate but unmistakable snore rose from his shoulder in reply     chapter vi  for the first few days after his return sunwich was full of surprises to jem hardy the town itself had changed but little and the older inhabitants were for the most part easily recognisable but time had wrought wonders among the younger members of the population small boys had attained to whiskered manhood and small girls passing into wellgrown young women had in some cases even changed their names  the most astounding and gratifying instance of the wonders effected by time was that of miss nugent he saw her first at the window and with a ready recognition of the enchantment lent by distance took the first possible opportunity of a closer observation he then realized the enchantment afforded by proximity the second opportunity led him impetuously into a drapers shop where a magnificent shopwalker after first ceremoniously handing him a high cane chair passed on his order for pins in a deep and thrilling baritone and retired in good order  by the end of a week his observations were completed and kate nugent securely enthroned in his mind as the incarnation of feminine grace and beauty left but little room for other matters on his second sunday at home to his fathers great surprise he attended church and after contemplating miss nugents back hair for an hour and a half came home and spoke eloquently and nobly on burying hatchets healing old sores letting bygones be bygones and kindred topics  i never take much notice of sermons myself said the captain misunderstanding  sermon said his son i wasnt thinking of the sermon but i saw captain nugent there and i remembered the stupid quarrel between you its absurd that it should go on indefinitely  why what does it matter inquired the other staring why shouldnt it perhaps its the music thats affected you some of those old hymns  it wasnt the sermon and it wasnt the hymns said his son disdainfully its just common sense it seems to me that the enmity between you has lasted long enough  i dont see that it matters said the captain it doesnt hurt me nugent goes his way and i go mine but if i ever get a chance at the old man hed better look out he wants a little of the starch taken out of him  mere mannerism said his son  hes as proud as lucifer and his girl takes after him said the innocent captain by the way shes grown up a very goodlooking girl you take a look at her the next time you see her  his son stared at him  shell get married soon i should think continued the other young murchison the new doctor here seems to be the favourite nugent is backing him so they say i wish him joy of his fatherinlaw  jem hardy took his pipe into the garden and pacing slowly up and down the narrow paths determined at any costs to save dr murchison from such a fatherinlaw and kate nugent from any husband except of his choosing he took a seat under an old apple tree and musing in the twilight tried in vain to think of ways and means of making her acquaintance  meantime they passed each other as strangers and the difficulty of approaching her only made the task more alluring in the second week he reckoned up that he had seen her nine times it was a satisfactory total but at the same time he could not shut his eyes to the fact that five times out of that number he had seen dr murchison as well and neither of them appeared to have seen him  he sat thinking it over in the office one hot afternoon mr adolphus swann his partner had just returned from lunch and for about the fifth time that day was arranging his white hair and short neatly pointed beard in a small lookingglass over the top of it he glanced at hardy who leaning back in his chair bit his pen and stared hard at a paper before him  is that the manifest of the north star he inquired  no was the reply  mr swann put his lookingglass away and watched the other as he crossed over to the window and gazed through the small dirty panes at the bustling life of the harbour below for a short time hardy stood gazing in silence and then suddenly crossing the room took his hat from a peg and went out  restless said the senior partner wiping his folders with great care and putting them on wonder where hes put that manifest  he went over to the others desk and opened a drawer to search for it just inside was a sheet of foolscap and mr swann with growing astonishment slowly mastered the contents  see her as often as possible  get to know some of her friends  try and get hold of the old lady  find out her tastes and ideas  show my hand before murchison has it all his own way  it seems to me said the bewildered shipbroker carefully replacing the paper that my young friend is looking out for another partner he hasnt lost much time  he went back to his seat and resumed his work it occurred to him that he ought to let his partner know what he had seen and when hardy returned he had barely seated himself before mr swann with a mysterious smile crossed over to him bearing a sheet of foolscap  try and dress as well as my partner read the astonished hardy whats the matter with my clothes what do you mean  mr swann in place of answering returned to his desk and taking up another sheet of foolscap began to write again holding up his hand for silence as hardy repeated his question when he had finished his task he brought it over and placed it in the others hand  take her little brother out for walks  hardy crumpled the paper up and flung it aside then with his face crimson he stared wrathfully at the benevolent swann  its the safest card in the pack said the latter you please everybody especially the little brother you should always hold his handit looks well for one thing and if you shut your eyes  i dont want any of your nonsense said the maddened jem what do you mean by reading my private papers  i came over to look for the manifest said mr swann and i read it before i could make out what it was you must admit its a bit cryptic i thought it was a new game at first getting hold of the old lady sounds like a sort of blindmans buff but why not get hold of the young one why waste time over  go to the devil said the junior partner  any more suggestions i can give you you are heartily welcome to said mr swann going back to his seat all my vast experience is at your service and the best and sweetest and prettiest girls in sunwich regard me as a sort of second father  whats a second father inquired jim looking upa grandfather  go your own way said the other i wash my hands of you youre not in earnest or youd clutch at any straw but let me give you one word of advice be careful how you get hold of the old lady let her understand from the commencement that it isnt her  mr hardy went on with his work there was a pile of it in front of him and an accumulation in his drawers for some time he wrote assiduously but work was dry after the subject they had been discussing he looked over at his partner and seeing that that gentleman was gravely busy reopened the matter with a jeer  old maids always know most about rearing children he remarked so i suppose old bachelors looking down on life from the top shelf think they know most about marriage  i wash my hands of you repeated the senior placidly i am not to be taunted into rendering first aid to the wounded  the consciencestricken junior lost his presence of mind whos trying to taunt you he demanded hotly why youd do more harm than good  put a bandage round the head instead of the heart i expect assented the chuckling swann top shelf i think you said well i climbed there for safety  you must have been much run after said his partner  i was said the other i suppose thats why it is i am always so interested in these affairs i have helped to marry so many people in this place that im almost afraid to stir out after dark  hardys reply was interrupted by the entrance of mr edward silk a young man of forlorn aspect who combined in his person the offices of messenger cleaner and officeboy to the firm he brought in some letters and placing them on mr swanns desk retired  theres another said the latter as the door closed his complaint is amelia kybird and hes got it badly shes big enough to eat him but i believe that they are engaged perseverance has done it in his case he used to go about like a blighted flower  i am rather busy his partner reminded him  mr swann sighed and resumed his own labours for some time both men wrote in silence then the elder suddenly put his pen down and hit his desk a noisy thump with his fist  ive got it he said briskly apologize humbly for all your candour and i will give you a piece of information which shall brighten your dull eyes raise the corners of your drooping mouth and renew once more the pink and cream in your youthful cheeks  look here said the overwrought hardy  samson wilks interrupted mr swann number three fullalove alley at home fridays seven to nine to the daughter of his late skipper who always visits him on that day dont thank me hardy in case you break down shes a very nice girl and if she had been born twenty years earlier or i had been born twenty years later or you hadnt been born at all theres no saying what might not have happened  when i want you to interfere in my business said hardy working sedulously ill let you know  very good replied swann still remember thursdays seven to nine  thursdays said hardy incautiously why you said fridays just now  mr swann made no reply his nose was immersed in the folds of a large handkerchief and his eyes watered profusely behind his glasses it was some minutes before he had regained his normal composure and even then the sensitive nerves of his partner were offended by an occasional belated chuckle  although by dint of casual and cautious inquiries mr hardy found that his partners information was correct he was by no means guilty of any feelings of gratitude towards him and he only glared scornfully when that excellent but frivolous man mounted a chair on friday afternoon and putting the clock on a couple of hours or so urged him to be in time  the evening however found him starting slowly in the direction of fullalove alley his father had gone to sea again and the house was very dull moreover he felt a mild curiosity to see the changes wrought by time in mr wilks he walked along by the sea and as the church clock struck the threequarters turned into the alley and looked eagerly round for the old steward  the labours of the day were over and the inhabitants were for the most part out of doors taking the air shirtsleeved householders leaning against their doorposts smoking exchanged ideas across the narrow space paved with cobblestones which separated their small and ancient houses while the matrons more gregariously inclined bunched in little groups and discussed subjects which in higher circles would have inundated the land with libel actions up and down the alley a tiny boy all ready for bed with the exception of his nightgown mechanically avoided friendly palms as he sought anxiously for his mother  the object of mr hardys search sat at the door of his front room which opened on to the alley smoking an evening pipe and noting with an interested eye the doings of his neighbours he was just preparing to draw himself up in his chair as the intruder passed when to his utter astonishment that gentleman stopped in front of him and taking possession of his hand shook it fervently  how do you do he said smiling  mr wilks eyed him stupidly and releasing his hand coyly placed it in his trouserpocket and breathed hard  i meant to come before said hardy but ive been so busy how are you  mr wilks still dazed muttered that he was very well then he sat bolt upright in his chair and eyed his visitor suspiciously  ive been longing for a chat with you about old times said hardy of all my old friends you seem to have changed the least you dont look a day older  im getting on said mr wilks trying to speak coldly but observing with some gratification the effect produced upon his neighbours by the appearance of this welldressed acquaintance  i wanted to ask your advice said the unscrupulous hardy speaking in low tones i daresay you know ive just gone into partnership in sunwich and im told theres no man knows more about the business and the ins and outs of this town than you do  mr wilks thawed despite himself his face glistened and his huge mouth broke into tremulous smiles for a moment he hesitated and then noticing that a little group near them had suspended their conversation to listen to his he drew his chair back and in a kind voice invited the searcher after wisdom to step inside  hardy thanked him and following him in took a chair behind the door and with an air of youthful deference bent his ear to catch the pearls which fell from the lips of his host since he was a babe on his mothers knee sixty years before mr wilks had never had such an attentive and admiring listener hardy sat as though glued to his chair one eye on mr wilks and the other on the clock and it was not until that ancient timepiece struck the hour that the exsteward suddenly realized the awkward state of affairs  any more elp i can give you i shall always be pleased to he said looking at the clock  hardy thanked him at great length wondering as he spoke whether miss nugent was of punctual habits he leaned back in his chair and folding his arms gazed thoughtfully at the perturbed mr wilks  you must come round and smoke a pipe with me sometimes he said casually  mr wilks flushed with gratified pride he had a vision of himself walking up to the front door of the hardys smoking a pipe in a wellappointed room and telling an incredulous and envious fullalove alley about it afterwards  i shall be very pleased sir he said impressively  come round on tuesday said his visitor i shall be at home then  mr wilks thanked him and spurred on to hospitality murmured something about a glass of ale and retired to the back to draw it he came back with a jug and a couple of glasses and draining his own at a draught hoped that the example would not be lost upon his visitor that astute person however after a modest draught sat still anchored to the halfempty glass  im expecting somebody tonight said the exsteward at last  no doubt you have a lot of visitors said the other admiringly  mr wilks did not deny it he eyed his guests glass and fidgeted  miss nugent is coming he said  instead of any signs of disorder and preparations for rapid flight mr wilks saw that the other was quite composed he began to entertain a poor idea of mr hardys memory  she generally comes for a little quiet chat he said  indeed  just between the two of us said the other  his visitor said indeed and as though some chord of memory had been touched sat gazing dreamily at mr wilkss horticultural collection in the window then he changed colour a little as a smart hat and a pretty face crossed the tiny panes mr wilks changed colour too and in an awkward fashion rose to receive miss nugent  late as usual sam said the girl sinking into a chair then she caught sight of hardy who was standing by the door  its a long time since you and i met miss nugent he said bowing  mr hardy said the girl doubtfully  yes miss interposed mr wilks anxious to explain his position he called in to see me quite a surprise to me it was i ardly knowed him  the last time we three met said hardy who to his hosts discomfort had resumed his chair wilks was thrashing me and you were urging him on  kate nugent eyed him carefully it was preposterous that this young man should take advantage of a boy and girl acquaintance of eleven years beforeand such an acquaintancein this manner her eyes expressed a little surprise not unmixed with hauteur but hardy was too pleased to have them turned in his direction at all to quarrel with their expression  you were a bit of a trial in them days said mr wilks shaking his head if i live to be ninety i shall never forget seeing miss kate capsized the way she was the way she  how is your cold inquired miss nugent hastily  better miss thankee said mr wilks  miss nugent has forgotten and forgiven all that long ago said hardy  quite assented the girl coldly one cannot remember all the boys and girls one knew as a child  certainly not said hardy i find that many have slipped from my own memory but i have a most vivid recollection of you  miss nugent looked at him again and an idea strange and incredible dawned slowly upon her childish impressions are lasting and jem hardy had remained in her mind as a sort of youthful ogre he sat before her now a frank determinedlooking young englishman in whose honest eyes admiration of herself could not be concealed indignation and surprise struggled for supremacy  its odd remarked mr wilks who had a happy knack at times of saying the wrong thing its odd you should ave appened to come just at the same time as miss kate did  its my good fortune said hardy with a slight bow then he cocked a malignant eye at the innocent mr wilks and wondered at what age men discarded the useless habit of blushing opposite him sat miss nugent calmly observant the slightest suggestion of disdain in her expression framed in the queer highbacked old chair which had belonged to mr wilkss grandfather she made a picture at which jem hardy continued to gaze with respectful ardour a hopeless sense of selfdepreciation possessed him but the idea that murchison should aspire to so much goodness and beauty made him almost despair of his sex his reverie was broken by the voice of mr wilks  a quarter to eight said that gentleman incredulously it cant be  i thought it was later than that said hardy simply  mr wilks gasped and with a faint shake of his head at the floor abandoned the thankless task of giving hints to a young man who was too obtuse to see them and it was not until some time later that mr hardy sorely against his inclinations gave his host a hearty handshake and with a respectful bow to miss nugent took his departure  fine young man hes growed said mr wilks deferentially turning to his remaining visitor greatly improved i think  miss nugent looked him over critically before replying he seems to have taken a great fancy to you she remarked  mr wilks smiled a satisfied smile he came to ask my advice about business he said softly hes eard two or three speak o me as knowing a thing or two and being young and just starting e came to talk it over with me i never see a young man so pleased and ready to take advice as wot he is  he is coming again for more i suppose said miss nugent carelessly  mr wilks acquiesced and he asked me to go over to his ouse to smoke a pipe with im on tuesday he added in the casual manner in which men allude to their aristocratic connections hes a bit lonely all by himself  miss nugent said indeed and then lapsing into silence gave little occasional sideglances at mr wilks as though in search of any hidden charms about him which might hitherto have escaped her  at the same time mr james hardy walking slowly home by the edge of the sea pondered on further ways and means of ensnaring the affection of the exsteward     chapter vii  the anticipations of mr wilks were more than realized on the following tuesday from the time a trim maid showed him into the smokingroom until late at night when he left a feted and honoured guest with one of his hosts best cigars between his teeth nothing that could yield him any comfort was left undone in the easiest of easy chairs he sat in the garden beneath the leafy branches of apple trees and undiluted wisdom and advice flowed from his lips in a stream as he beamed delightedly upon his entertainer  their talk was mainly of sunwich and sunwich people and it was an easy step from these to equator lodge on that subject most people would have found the exsteward somewhat garrulous but jem hardy listened with great content and even brought him back to it when he showed signs of wandering altogether mr wilks spent one of the pleasantest evenings of his life and returning home in a slight state of mental exhilaration severely exercised the tongues of fullalove alley by a bearing considered incompatible with his station  jem hardy paid a return call on the following friday and had no cause to complain of any lack of warmth in his reception the exsteward was delighted to see him and after showing him various curios picked up during his voyages took him to the small yard in the rear festooned with scarletrunner beans and gave him a chair in full view of the neighbours  im the only visitor tonight said hardy after an hours patient listening and waiting  mr wilks nodded casually miss kate came last night he said friday is her night but she came yesterday instead  mr hardy said oh indeed and fell straightway into a dismal reverie from which the most spirited efforts of his host only partially aroused him  without giving way to undue egotism it was pretty clear that miss nugent had changed her plans on his account and a long vista of pleasant friday evenings suddenly vanished he too resolved to vary his visits and starting with a basis of two a week sat trying to solve the mathematical chances of selecting the same as kate nugent calculations which were not facilitated by a longwinded account from mr wilks of certain interesting amours of his youthful prime  before he saw kate nugent again however another old acquaintance turned up safe and sound in sunwich captain nugent walking into the town saw him first a tall wellknit young man in shabby clothing whose bearing even in the distance was oddly familiar as he came closer the captains misgivings were confirmed and in the sunburnt fellow in tattered clothes who advanced upon him with outstretched hand he reluctantly recognized his son  what have you come home for he inquired ignoring the hand and eyeing him from head to foot  change said jack nugent laconically as the smile left his face  the captain shrugged his shoulders and stood silent his son looked first up the road and then down  all well at home he inquired  yes  jack nugent looked up the road again  not much change in the town he said at length  no said his father  well im glad to have seen you said his son goodbye  goodbye said the captain  his son nodded and turning on his heel walked back towards the town despite his forlorn appearance his step was jaunty and he carried his head high the captain watched him until he was hidden by a bend in the road and then ashamed of himself for displaying so much emotion turned his own steps in the direction of home  well he didnt whine he said slowly hes got a bit of pride left  meantime the prodigal had reached the town again and stood ruefully considering his position  he looked up the street and then the wellknown shop of mr kybird catching his eye walked over and inspected the contents of the window sheathknives belts tobaccoboxes and watches were displayed alluringly behind the glass sheltered from the sun by a row of cheap clothing dangling from short poles over the shop front all the goods were marked in plain figures in reduced circumstances mr kybird giving a soaring imagination play in the first marking and a good business faculty in the second  at these valuables jack nugent with a view of obtaining some idea of prices gazed for some time then passing between two suits of oilskins which stood as sentinels in the doorway he entered the shop and smiled affably at miss kybird who was in charge at his entrance she put down a piece of fancywork which mr kybird called his sock and with a casual glance at his clothes regarded him with a prejudiced eye  beautiful day said the customer makes one feel quite young again  what do you want inquired miss kybird  mr nugent turned to a broken canechair which stood by the counter and after applying severe tests regardless of the ladys feelings sat down upon it and gave a sigh of relief  ive walked from london he said in explanation i could sit here for hours  look here began the indignant miss kybird  only people would be sure to couple our names together continued mr nugent mournfully  when a handsome young man and a goodlooking girl  do you want to buy anything or not demanded miss kybird with an impatient toss of her head  no said jack i want to sell  youve come to the wrong shop then said miss kybird the warehouse is full of rubbish now  the other turned in his chair and looked hard at the window so it is he assented its a good job ive brought you something decent to put there  he felt in his pockets and producing a silvermounted briarpipe a battered watch a knife and a few other small articles deposited them with reverent care upon the counter  no use to us declared miss kybird anxious to hit back we burn coal here  thesell burn better than the coal you buy said the unmoved customer  well we dont want them retorted miss kybird raising her voice and i dont want any of your impudence get up out of our chair  her heightened tones penetrated to the small and untidy room behind the shop the door opened and mr kybird in his shirtsleeves appeared at the opening  wots the row he demanded his little black eyes glancing from one to the other  only a lovers quarrel replied jack you go away we dont want you  look ere we dont want none o your nonsense said the shopkeeper sharply and wots more we wont ave it who put that rubbish on my counter  he bustled forward and taking the articles in his hands examined them closely  three shillings for the lotcash he remarked done said the other  did i say three inquired mr kybird startled at this ready acceptance  five you said replied mr nugent but ill take three if you throw in a smile  mr kybird much against his inclinations threw in a faint grin and opening a drawer produced three shillings and flung them separately on the counter miss kybird thawed somewhat and glancing from the customers clothes to his face saw that he had a pleasant eye and a good moustache together with a general air of recklessness much appreciated by the sex  dont spend it on drink she remarked not unkindly  i wont said the other solemnly im going to buy house property with it  why darn my eyes said mr kybird who had been regarding him closely darn my old eyes if it aint young nugent well well  thats me said young nugent cheerfully i should have known you anywhere kybird same old face same old voice same old shirtsleeves  ere come now objected the shopkeeper shortening his arm and squinting along it  i should have known you anywhere continued the other mournfully and here ive thrown up a splendid berth and come all the way from australia just for one glimpse of miss kybird and she doesnt know me when i die kybird you will find the word calais engraven upon my heart  mr kybird said oh indeed his daughter tossed her head and bade mr nugent take his nonsense to people who might like it  last time i see you said mr kybird pursing up his lips and gazing at the counter in an effort of memory last time i see you was one fifth o november when you an another bright young party was going about in two suits o oilskins wot id been unting for igh and low all day long  jack nugent sighed they were happy times kybird  might ha been for you retorted the other his temper rising a little at the remembrance of his wrongs  have you come home for good inquired miss kybird curiously have you seen your father he passed here a little while ago  i saw him said jack with a brevity which was not lost upon the astute mr kybird i may stay in sunwich and i may notit all depends  youre not going ome said mr kybird  no  the shopkeeper stood considering he had a small room to let at the top of his house and he stood divided between the fear of not getting his rent and the joy to a man fond of simple pleasures to be obtained by dunning the arrogant captain nugent for his sons debts before he could arrive at a decision his meditations were interrupted by the entrance of a stout sandyhaired lady from the back parlour who having conquered his scruples against matrimony some thirty years before had kept a particularly wideawake eye upon him ever since  your teas agettin cold she remarked severely  her husband received the news with calmness he was by no means an enthusiast where that liquid was concerned the admiration evoked by its noninebriating qualities having been always something in the nature of a mystery to him  im coming he retorted im just aving a word with mr nugent ere  well i never did said the stout lady coming farther into the shop and regarding the visitor i shouldnt ave knowed im if youd asked me who e was i couldnt ha told youi shouldnt ave knowed im from adam  jack shook his head its hard to be forgotten like this he said sadly even miss kybird had forgotten me after all that had passed between us  eh said mr kybird  oh dont take any notice of him said his daughter id like to see myself  mr kybird paid no heed he was still thinking of the son of captain nugent being indebted to him for lodging and the more he thought of the idea the better he liked it  well now youre ere he said with a great assumption of cordiality why not come in and ave a cup o tea  the other hesitated a moment and then with a light laugh accepted the offer he followed them into the small and untidy back parlour and being requested by his hostess to squeeze in next to melia at the small round table complied so literally with the order that that young lady complained bitterly of his encroachments  and where do you think of sleeping tonight inquired mr kybird after his daughter had to use her own expressive phrase shown the guest his place  mr nugent shook his head i shall get a lodging somewhere he said airily  theres a room upstairs as you might ave if you liked said mr kybird slowly its been let to a very respectable clean young man for half a crown a week really it ought to be three shillings but if you like to ave it at the old price you can  done with you said the other  no doubt youll soon get something to do continued mr kybird more in answer to his wifes inquiring glances than anything else half a crown every saturday and the rooms yours  mr nugent thanked him and after making a tea which caused mr kybird to congratulate himself upon the fact that he hadnt offered to board him sat regaling mrs kybird and daughter with a recital of his adventures in australia receiving in return a full and true account of sunwich and its people up to date  theres no pride about im thats what i like said mrs kybird to her lord and master as they sat alone after closing time over a glass of gin and water hes a nice young feller but bisness is bisness and spose you dont get your rent  i shall get it sooner or later said mr kybird that stuckup father of is ll be in a fine way at im living here thats wot im thinking of  i dont see why said mrs kybird bridling whos captain nugent i should like to know were as good as what e is if not better and as for the gell if shed got all amelias looks shed do  melias a finelooking gal assented mr kybird i wonder  he laid his pipe down on the table and stared at the mantelpiece he seems very struck with er he concluded i see that directly  not afore i did said his wife sharply  see it afore you come into the shop said mr kybird triumphantly it ud be a strange thing to marry into that family emma  shes keeping company with young teddy silk his wife reminded him coldly and if she wasnt she could do better than a young man without a penny in is pocket prides a fine thing danl but you cant live on it  i know what im talking about said mr kybird impatiently i know shes keeping company with teddy as well as wot you do still as far as money goes young nugent ll be all right  ow inquired his wife  mr kybird hesitated and took a sip of his gin and water then he regarded the wife of his bosom with a calculating glance which at once excited that ladys easily kindled wrath  you know i never tell secrets she cried  not often corrected mr kybird but then i dont often tell you any wot would you say to young nugent coming into five undred pounds is mother left im when hes twentyfive he dont know it but i do  five undred repeated his wife sure  no said the other im not sure but i know i ad it from young roberts when e was at stone and dartnells five undred pounds i shall get my money all right some time and if e wants a little bit to go on with e can have it hes honest enough i can see that by his manner  upstairs in the tiny room under the tiles mr jack nugent in blissful ignorance of his landlords generous sentiments towards him slept the sound dreamless sleep of the man free from monetary cares in the sanctity of her chamber miss kybird gazing approvingly at the reflection of her yellow hair and fine eyes in the little cracked lookingglass was already comparing him very favourably with the somewhat pessimistic mr silk     chapter viii  mr nugents return caused a sensation in several quarters the feeling at equator lodge bordering close upon open mutiny even mrs kingdom plucked up spirit and read the astonished captain a homily upon the first duties of a parenta homily which she backed up by reading the story of the prodigal son through to the bitter end at the conclusion she broke down entirely and was led up to bed by kate and bella the sympathy of the latter taking an acute form and consisting mainly of innuendoes which could only refer to one person in the house  kate nugent who was not prone to tears took a different line but with no better success the captain declined to discuss the subject and after listening to a description of himself in which nero and other celebrities figured for the purpose of having their characters whitewashed took up his hat and went out  jem hardy heard of the new arrival from his partner and ignoring that gentlemans urgent advice to make hay while the sun shone and take master nugent for a walk forthwith sat thoughtfully considering how to turn the affair to the best advantage a slight outbreak of diphtheria at fullalove alley had for a time closed that thoroughfare to miss nugent and he was inclined to regard the opportune arrival of her brother as an effort of providence on his behalf  for some days however he looked for jack nugent in vain that gentleman either being out of doors engaged in an earnest search for work or snugly seated in the back parlour of the kybirds indulging in the somewhat perilous pastime of paying compliments to amelia kybird remittances which had reached him from his sister and aunt had been promptly returned and he was indebted to the amiable mr kybird for the bare necessaries of life in these circumstances a warm feeling of gratitude towards the family closed his eyes to their obvious shortcomings  he even obtained work down at the harbour through a friend of mr kybirds it was not of a very exalted nature and caused more strain upon the back than the intellect but seven years of roughing it had left him singularly free from caste prejudices a freedom which he soon discovered was not shared by his old acquaintances at sunwich the discovery made him somewhat bitter and when hardy stopped him one afternoon as he was on his way home from work he tried to ignore his outstretched hand and continued on his way  it is a long time since we met said hardy placing himself in front of him  good heavens said jack regarding him closely its jemmy hardy grown up spick and span like the industrious little boys in the schoolbooks i heard you were back here  i came back just before you did said hardy brass band playing you in and all that sort of thing i suppose said the other alas how the wicked prosperand you were wicked do you remember how you used to knock me about  come round to my place and have a chat said hardy  jack shook his head theyre expecting me in to tea he said with a nod in the direction of mr kybirds and honest waterside labourers who earn their bread by the sweat of their browwhen the foreman is looking do not frequent the society of the upper classes  dont be a fool said hardy politely  well im not very tidy retorted mr nugent glancing at his clothes i dont mind it myself im a philosopher and nothing hurts me so long as i have enough to eat and drink but i dont inflict myself on my friends and i must say most of them meet me more than halfway  imagination said hardy  all except kate and my aunt said jack firmly poor kate i tried to cut her the other day  cut her echoed hardy  nugent nodded to save her feelings he replied but she wouldnt be cut bless her and on the distinct understanding that it wasnt to form a precedent i let her kiss me behind a waggon do you know i fancy shes grown up rather goodlooking jem  you are observant said mr hardy admiringly  of course it may be my partiality said mr nugent with judicial fairness i was always a bit fond of kate i dont suppose anybody else would see anything in her where are you living now  fort road said hardy come round any evening you can if you wont come now  nugent promised and catching sight of miss kybird standing in the doorway of the shop bade him goodbye and crossed the road it was becoming quite a regular thing for her to wait and have her tea with him now an arrangement which was provocative of many sly remarks on the part of mrs kybird  thought you were never coming said miss kybird tartly as she led the way to the back room and took her seat at the untidy teatray  and youve been crying your eyes out i suppose remarked mr nugent as he groped in the depths of a tall jar for blackcurrant jam well youre not the first and i dont suppose youll be the last hows teddy  get your tea retorted miss kybird and dont make that scraping noise on the bottom of the jar with your knife it puts my teeth on edge  so it does mine said mr nugent but theres a black currant down there and i mean to have it waste not want not  make him put that knife down said miss kybird as her mother entered the room mrs kybird shook her head at him you two are always quarrelling she said archly just like a couple ofcouple of  lovebirds suggested mr nugent  mrs kybird in great glee squeezed round to him and smote him playfully with her large fat hand and then being somewhat out of breath with the exertion sat down to enjoy the jest in comfort  thats how you encourage him said her daughter no wonder he doesnt behave no wonder he acts as if the whole place belongs to him  the remark was certainly descriptive of mr nugents behaviour his easy assurance and affability had already made him a prime favourite with mrs kybird and had not been without its effect upon her daughter the constrained and severe company manners of mr edward silk showed up but poorly beside those of the paying guest and miss kybird had on several occasions drawn comparisons which would have rendered both gentlemen uneasy if they had known of them  mr nugent carried the same easy goodfellowship with him the following week when neatly attired in a secondhand suit from mr kybirds extensive stock he paid a visit to jem hardy to talk over old times and discuss the future  you ought to make friends with your father said the latter it only wants a little common sense and mutual forbearance  thats all said nugent sounds easy enough doesnt it no all he wants is for me to clear out of sunwich and im not going tountil it pleases me at any rate its poison to him for me to be living at the kybirds and pushing a trolley down on the quay talk about love sweetening toil that does  hardy changed the subject and nugent nothing loath discoursed on his wanderings and took him on a personally conducted tour through the continent of australia and ive come back to lay my bones in sunwich churchyard he concluded pathetically that is when ive done with em  a lot of thingsll happen before then said hardy  i hope so rejoined mr nugent piously my desire is to be buried by my weeping greatgrandchildren in fact ive left instructions to that effect in my willall i have left by the way  youre not going to keep on at this waterside work i suppose said hardy making another effort to give the conversation a serious turn  the foreman doesnt think so replied the other as he helped himself to some whisky he has made several remarks to that effect lately  he leaned back in his chair and smoked thoughtfully by no means insensible to the comfort of his surroundings he had not been in such comfortable quarters since he left home seven years before he thought of the untidy litter of the kybirds back parlour with the forlorn view of the yard in the rear something of his reflections he confided to hardy as he rose to leave  but my market value is about a pound a week he concluded ruefully so i must cut my coat to suit my cloth goodnight  he walked home somewhat soberly at first but the air was cool and fresh and a glorious moon was riding in the sky he whistled cheerfully and his spirits rose as various chimerical plans of making money occurred to him by the time he reached the high street the shops of which were all closed for the night he was earning five hundred a year and spending a thousand he turned the handle of the door and walking in discovered miss kybird entertaining company in the person of mr edward silk  halloa he said airily as he took a seat dont mind me young people go on just as you would if i were not here  mr edward silk grumbled something under his breath miss kybird turning to the intruder with a smile of welcome remarked that she had just thought of going to sleep  going to sleep repeated mr silk thunderstruck  yes said miss kybird yawning  mr silk gazed at her openmouthed what with me ere he inquired in trembling tones  youre not very lively company said miss kybird bending over her sewing i dont think youve spoken a word for the last quarter of an hour and before that you were talking of deathwarnings made my flesh creep you did  shame said mr nugent  you didnt say anything to me about your flesh creeping muttered mr silk  you ought to have seen it creep interposed mr nugent severely  im not talking to you said mr silk turning on him when i want the favour of remarks from you ill let you know  dont you talk to my gentlemen friends like that teddy said miss kybird sharply because i wont have it why dont you try and be bright and cheerful like mr nugent  mr silk turned and regarded that gentleman steadfastly mr nugent meeting his gaze with a pleasant smile and a lowvoiced offer to give him lessons at half a crown an hour  i wouldnt be like im for worlds said mr silk with a scornful laugh id sooner be like anybody  what have you been saying to him inquired nugent  nothing replied miss kybird hes often like that hes got a nasty miserable jealous disposition not that i mind what he thinks  mr silk breathed hard and looked from one to the other  perhaps hell grow out of it said nugent hopefully cheer up teddy youre young yet  might i arsk said the solemnly enraged mr silk might i arsk you not to be so free with my christian name  he doesnt like his name now said nugent drawing his chair closer to miss kybirds and i dont wonder at it what shall we call him job whats that work youre doing why dont you get on with that fancy waistcoat you are doing for me  before miss kybird could deny all knowledge of the article in question her sorely tried swain created a diversion by rising to that simple act he imparted an emphasis which commanded the attention of both beholders and drawing over to miss kybird he stood over her in an attitude at once terrifying and reproachful  take your choice amelia he said in a thrilling voice me or im which is it to be  here steady old man cried the startled nugent go easy  me or im repeated mr silk in stern but broken accents  miss kybird giggled and avoiding his gaze looked pensively at the faded hearthrug  youre making her blush said mr nugent sternly sit down teddy im ashamed of you were both ashamed of you youre confusing us dreadfully proposing to us both in this way  mr silk regarded him with a scornful eye but miss kybird bidding him not to be foolish punctuated her remarks with the needle and a struggle which mr silk regarded as unseemly in the highest degree took place between them for its possession  mr nugent secured it at last and brandishing it fiercely extorted feminine screams from miss kybird by threatening her with it nor was her mind relieved until mr nugent remarking that he would put it back in the pincushion placed it in the leg of mr edward silk  mr kybird and his wife entering through the shop were just in time to witness a spirited performance on the part of mr silk the cherished purpose of which was to deprive them of a lodger he drew back as they entered and raising his voice above miss kybirds began to explain his action  teddy im ashamed of you said mr kybird shaking his head a little joke like that a little innercent joke  if it ad been a darningneedle now began mrs kybird  all right said the desperate mr silk ave it your own way let melia marry imi dont carei give er up  teddy said mr kybird in a shocked voice teddy  mr silk thrust him fiercely to one side and passed raging through the shop the sound of articles falling in all directions attested to his blind haste and the force with which he slammed the shopdoor was sufficient evidence of his state of mind  well upon my word said the staring mr kybird of all the outrageyous  never mind im said his wife who was sitting in the easy chair distributing affectionate smiles between her daughter and the startled mr nugent make er happy jack thats all i arsk shes been a good gal and shell make a good wife ive seen how it was between you for some time  so ave i said mr kybird he shook hands warmly with mr nugent and patting that perturbed man on the back surveyed him with eyes glistening with approval  its a bit rough on teddy isnt it inquired mr nugent anxiously besides  dont you worry about im said mr kybird affectionately he aint worth it  i wasnt said mr nugent truthfully the situation had developed so rapidly that it had caught him at a disadvantage he had a dim feeling that having been the cause of miss kybirds losing one young man the most elementary notions of chivalry demanded that he should furnish her with another and this idea was clearly uppermost in the minds of her parents he looked over at amelia and with characteristic philosophy accepted the position  we shall be the handsomest couple in sunwich he said simply  bar none said mr kybird emphatically  the stout lady in the chair gazed ax the couple fondly it reminds me of our wedding she said softly what was it tom fletcher said father can you remember  arry smith you mean corrected mr kybird  tom fletcher said something im sure persisted his wife  he did said mr kybird grimly and i pretty near broke is ead for it arry smith is the one youre thinking of  mrs kybird after a moments reflection admitted that he was right and the chain of memory being touched waxed discursive about her own wedding and the somewhat exciting details which accompanied it after which she produced a bottle labelled port wine from the cupboard and filling four glasses celebrated the occasion in a befitting but sober fashion  this said mr nugent as he sat on his bed that night to take his boots off this is what comes of trying to make everybody happy and comfortable with a little fun i wonder what the governorll say     chapter ix  the news of his only sons engagement took captain nugents breath away which all things considered was perhaps the best thing it could have done he sat at home in silent rage only exploding when the wellmeaning mrs kingdom sought to minimize his troubles by comparing them with those of job her reminder that to the best of her remembrance he had never had a boil in his life put the finishing touch to his patience and despairing of drawingroom synonyms for the words which trembled on his lips he beat a precipitate retreat to the garden  his son bore his new honours bravely to an appealing and indignant letter from his sister he wrote gravely reminding her of the difference in their years and also that he had never interfered in her flirtations however sorely his brotherly heart might have been wrung by them he urged her to forsake such diversions for the future and to look for an alliance with some noble openhanded man with a large banking account and a fondness for his wifes relatives  to jem hardy who ventured on a delicate remonstrance one evening he was less patient and displayed a newly acquired dignity which was a source of considerable embarrassment to that wellmeaning gentleman he even got up to search for his hat and was only induced to resume his seat by the physical exertions of his host  i didnt mean to be offensive said the latter but you were said the aggrieved man hardy apologized  talk of that kind is a slight to my future wife said nugent firmly besides what business is it of yours  hardy regarded him thoughtfully it was some time since he had seen miss nugent and he felt that he was losing valuable time he had hoped great things from the advent of her brother and now his intimacy seemed worse than useless he resolved to take him into his confidence  i spoke from selfish motives he said at last i wanted you to make friends with your father again  what for inquired the other staring  to pave the way for me said hardy raising his voice as he thought of his wrongs and now owing to your confounded matrimonial business thats all knocked on the head i wouldnt care whom you married if it didnt interfere with my affairs so  do you mean inquired the astonished mr nugent that you want to be on friendly terms with my father  yes  mr nugent gazed at him roundeyed you havent had a blow on the head or anything of that sort at any time have you he inquired  hardy shook his head impatiently you dont seem to suffer from an excess of intellect yourself he retorted i dont want to be offensive again still i should think it is pretty plain there is only one reason why i should go out of my way to seek the society of your father  say what you like about my intellect replied the dutiful son but i cant think of even onenot even a small one notgood gracious you dont meanyou cant mean  hardy looked at him  not that said mr nugent whose intellect had suddenly become painfully acutenot her  why not inquired the other  mr nugent leaned back in his chair and regarded him with an air of kindly interest well theres no need for you to worry about my father for that he said he would raise no objection  eh said hardy starting up from his chair  he would welcome it said mr nugent positively there is nothing that he would like better and i dont mind telling you a secretshe likes you  hardy reddened how do you know he stammered  i know it for a fact said the other impressively i have heard her say so but youve been very plainspoken about me jem so that i shall say what i think  do said his bewildered friend  i think youd be throwing yourself away said nugent to my mind its a most unsuitable match in every way shes got no money no looks no style nothing but a good kind heart rather the worse for wear i suppose you know shes been married once  what shouted the other married  mr nugent nodded his face was perfectly grave but the joke was beginning to prey upon his vitals in a manner which brooked no delay  i thought everybody knew it he said we have never disguised the fact her husband died twenty years ago last  twenty said his suddenly enlightened listener whowhat  mr nugent incapable of reply put his head on the table and beat the air frantically with his hand while gasping sobs rent his tortured frame  dearaunt he choked how pleaspleased shed be ifshe knew dont look like that hardy youll kill me  you seem amused said hardy between his teeth  and youll be kates uncle said mr nugent sitting up and wiping his eyes poor little kate  he put his head on the table again and mine he wailed uncle jemmywill you tip us halfcrowns nunky  mr hardys expression of lofty scorn only served to retard his recovery but he sat up at last and giving his eyes a final wipe beamed kindly upon his victim  well ill do what i can for you he observed but i suppose you know kates off for a three months visit to london tomorrow  the other observed that he didnt know it and taught by his recent experience eyed him suspiciously  its quite true said nugent shes going to stay with some relatives of ours she used to be very fond of one of the boysher cousin herbertso you mustnt be surprised if she comes back engaged but i daresay youll have forgotten all about her in three months and anyway i dont suppose shed look at you if you were the last man in the world if youll walk part of the way home with me ill regale you with anecdotes of her chilhood which will probably cause you to change your views altogether  in fullalove alley mr edward silk his forebodings fulfilled received the news of amelia kybirds faithlessness in a spirit of quiet despair and turned a deaf ear to the voluble sympathy of his neighbours similar things had happened to young men living there before but their behaviour had been widely different to mr silks bob crump for instance had been jilted on the very morning he had arranged for his wedding but instead of going about in a state of gentle melancholy he went round and fought his beloveds fathermerely because it was her fatherand wound up an exciting day by selling off his household goods to the highest bidders henry jones in similar circumstances relieved his great grief by walking up and down the alley smashing every window within reach of his stick  but these were men of spirit mr silk was cast in a different mould and his fair neighbours sympathized heartily with him in his bereavement while utterly failing to understand any man breaking his heart over amelia kybird  his mother a widow of uncertain age shook her head over him and hinted darkly at consumption an idea which was very pleasing to her son and gave him an increased interest in a slight cold from which he was suffering  he wants taking out of imself said mr wilks who had stepped across the alley to discuss the subject with his neighbour cheerful society and obbiesthats what e wants  hes got a faithful eart sighed mrs silk its in the family e cant elp it  but e might be lifted out of it urged mr wilks i ad several disappointments in my young days one time i ad a fresh gal every vyge amost  mrs silk sniffed and looked up the alley whereat two neighbours who happened to be at their doors glanced up and down casually and retreated inside to continue their vigil from the windows  silk courted me for fifteen years before i would say yes she said severely  fifteen years responded the other he cast his eyes upwards and his lips twitched the most casual observer could have seen that he was engaged in calculations of an abstruse and elusive nature  i was ony seven when e started said mrs silk sharply  mr wilks brought his eyes to a level again oh seven he remarked  and we was married two days before my nineteenth birthday added mrs silk whose own arithmetic had always been her weak point  just so said mr wilks he glanced at the sharp white face and shapeless figure before him its hard to believe you can ave a son teddys age he added gallantly  it makes you feel as if youre getting on said the widow  the exsteward agreed and after standing a minute or two in silence made a preliminary motion of withdrawal  beautiful your plants are looking said mrs silk glancing over at his window i cant think what you do to em  the gratified mr wilks began to explain it appeared that plants wanted almost as much looking after as daughters  i should like to see em close said mrs silk come in and ave a look at em responded her neighbour  mrs silk hesitated and displayed a maidenly coyness far in excess of the needs of the situation then she stepped across and five seconds later the two matrons with consternation writ large upon their faces appeared at their doors again and exchanging glances across the alley met in the centre  they were more surprised an evening or two later to see mr wilks leave his house to pay a return visit bearing in his hand a small bunch of his cherished blooms that they were blooms which would have paid the debt of nature in a few hours at most in no way detracted from the widows expressions of pleasure at receiving them and mr wilks who had been invited over to cheer up mr silk who was in a particularly black mood sat and smiled like a detected philanthropist as she placed them in water  good evenin teddy he said breezily with a sideglance at his hostess what a lovely day weve ad  so bright said mrs silk nodding with spirit  mr wilks sat down and gave vent to such a cheerful laugh that the ornaments on the mantelpiece shook with it its good to be alive he declared  ah you enjoy your life mr wilks said the widow  enjoy it roared mr wilks enjoy it why shouldnt i why shouldnt everybody enjoy their lives it was what they was given to us for  so they was affirmed mrs silk nobody can deny that not if they try  nobody wants to deny it maam retorted mr wilks in the high voice he kept for cheeringup purposes i enjoy every day o my life  he filled his pipe chuckling serenely and having lit it sat and enjoyed that mrs silk retired for a space and returning with a jug of ale poured him out a glass and set it by his elbow  heres your good ealth maam said mr wilks raising it heres yours teddya long life and a appy one  mr silk turned listlessly i dont want a long life he remarked  his mother and her visitor exchanged glances  thats ow e goes on remarked the former in an audible whisper mr wilks nodded reassuringly  i ad them ideas once he said but they go off if you could only live to see teddy at the age o ninetyfive e wouldnt want to go then ed say it was crool hard being cut off in the flower of is youth  mrs silk laughed gaily and mr wilks bellowed a gruff accompaniment mr edward silk eyed them pityingly  thats the ardship of it he said slowly as he looked round from his seat by the fireplace thats where the ollowness of things comes in thats where i envy mr wilks  envy me said the smiling visitor what for  because youre so near the grave said mr silk  mr wilks who was taking another draught of beer put the glass down and eyed him fixedly  thats why i envy you continued the other  i dont want to live and you do and yet i dessay i shall be walking about forty and fifty years after youre dead and forgotten  wot dye meannear the grave inquired  mr wilks somewhat shortly  i was referring to your age replied the other its strange to see ow the aged ang on to life you cant ave much pleasure at your time o life and youre all alone the last withered branch left  withered branch began mr wilks ere look ere teddy  all the others ave gone pursued mr silk and theyre beckoning to you  let em beckon said mr wilks coldly im not going yet  youre not young said mr silk gazing meditatively at the grate and i envy you that it can only be a matter of a year or two at most before you are sleeping your last long sleep  teddy protested mrs silk  its true mother said the melancholy youth mr wilks is old why should e mind being told of it if e had ad the trouble ive ad ed be glad to go but hell ave to go whether e likes it or not it might be tonight who can tell  mr wilks unasked poured himself out another glass of ale and drank it off with the air of a man who intended to make sure of that it seemed a trifle more flat than the last  so many men o your age and thereabouts continued mr silk think that theyre going to live on to eighty or ninety but theres very few of em do its only a short while mr wilks and the little childrenll be running about over your grave and picking daisies off of it  ho will they said the irritated mr wilks theyd better not let me catch em at it thats all  hes always talking like that now said mrs silk not without a certain pride in her tones thats why i asked you in to cheer im up  all your troublesll be over then continued the warning voice and in a month or two even your namell be forgotten thats the way of the world think ow soon the last five years of your life ave passed the next fivell pass ten times as fast even if you live as long which aint likely  he talks like a clergyman said mrs silk in a stage whisper  mr wilks nodded and despite his hostesss protests rose to go he shook hands with her and after a short but sharp inward struggle shook hands with her son it was late in the evening as he left but the houses had not yet been lit up dim figures sat in doorways or stood about the alley and there was an air of peace and rest strangely and uncomfortably in keeping with the conversation to which he had just been listening he looked in at his own door the furniture seemed stiffer than usual and the tick of the clock more deliberate he closed the door again and taking a deep breath set off towards the life and bustle of the two schooners     chapter x  time failed to soften the captains ideas concerning his sons engagement and all mention of the subject in the house was strictly forbidden occasionally he was favoured with a glimpse of his son and miss kybird out together a sight which imparted such a flavour to his temper and ordinary intercourse that mrs kingdom in unconscious imitation of mr james hardy began to count the days which must elapse before her nieces return from london his illtemper even infected the other members of the household and mrs kingdom sat brooding in her bedroom all one afternoon because bella had called her an overbearing dishpot  the finishing touch to his patience was supplied by a little misunderstanding between mr kybird and the police for the second time in his career the shopkeeper appeared before the magistrates to explain the circumstances in which he had purchased stolen property and for the second time he left the court without a stain on his character but with a significant magisterial caution not to appear there again  jack nugent gave evidence in the case and some of his replies were deemed worthy of reproduction in the sunwich herald a circumstance which lost the proprietors a subscriber of many years standing  one by one various schemes for preventing his sons projected alliance were dismissed as impracticable a cherished design of confining him in an asylum for the mentally afflicted until such time as he should have regained his senses was spoilt by the refusal of dr murchison to arrange for the necessary certificate a refusal which was like to have been fraught with serious consequences to that gentlemans hopes of entering the captains family  brooding over his wrongs the captain a day or two after his daughters return strolled slowly down towards the harbour it was afternoon and the short winter day was already drawing towards a close the shipping looked cold and desolate in the greyness but a bustle of work prevailed on the conqueror which was nearly ready for sea again the captains gaze wandered from his old craft to the small vessels dotted about the harbour and finally dwelt admiringly on the lines of the whaler seabird which had put in a few days before as the result of a slight collision with a fishingboat she was high out of the water and beautifully rigged a dog ran up and down her decks barking and a couple of squat figures leaned over the bulwarks gazing stolidly ashore  there was something about the vessel which took his fancy and he stood for some time on the edge of the quay looking at her in a day or two she would sail for a voyage the length of which would depend upon her success a voyage which would for a long period keep all on board of her out of the mischief which so easily happens ashore if only jack  he started and stared more intently than before he was not an imaginative man but he had in his minds eye a sudden vision of his only son waving farewells from the deck of the whaler as she emerged from the harbour into the open sea while amelia kybird tore her yellow locks ashore it was a vision to cheer any selfrespecting fathers heart and he brought his mind back with some regret to the reality of the anchored ship  he walked home slowly at the kybirds door the proprietor smoking a short clay pipe eyed him with furtive glee as he passed farther along the road the hardys father and son stepped briskly together altogether a trying walk and calculated to make him more dissatisfied than ever with the present state of affairs when his daughter shook her head at him and accused him of going off on a solitary frolic his stock of patience gave out entirely  a thoughtful night led to a visit to mr wilks the following evening it required a great deal of deliberation on his part before he could make up his mind to the step but he needed his old stewards assistance in a little plan he had conceived for his sons benefit and for the first time in his life he paid him the supreme honour of a call  the honour was so unexpected that mr wilks coming into the parlour in response to the tapping of the captains stick on the floor stood for a short time eyeing him in dismay only two minutes before he had taken mr james hardy into the kitchen to point out the interior beauties of an ancient clock and the situation simply appalled him the captain greeted him almost politely and bade him sit down mr wilks smiled faintly and caught his breath  sit down repeated the captain  ive left something in the kitchen sir said mr wilks ill be back in half a minute  the captain nodded in the kitchen mr wilks rapidly and incoherently explained the situation to mr hardy  ill sit here said the latter drawing up a comfortable oak chair to the stove  you see he dont know that we know each other explained the apologetic steward but i dont like leaving you in the kitchen  im all right said hardy dont you trouble about me  he waved him away and mr wilks still pale closed the door behind him and rejoining the captain sat down on the extreme edge of a chair and waited  ive come to see you on a little matter of business said his visitor  mr wilks smiled then feeling that perhaps that was not quite the right thing to do looked serious again  i came to see you about mymy son continued the captain  yes sir said mr wilks master jack you mean  ive only got one son said the other unpleasantly unless you happen to know of any more  mr wilks almost fell off the edge of the chair in his haste to disclaim any such knowledge his ideas were in a ferment and the guilty knowledge of what he had left in the kitchen added to his confusion and just at that moment the door opened and miss nugent came briskly in  her surprise at seeing her father ensconced in a chair by the fire led to a rapid volley of questions the captain in lieu of answering them asked another  what do you want here  i have come to see sam said miss nugent fancy seeing you here how are you sam  pretty well miss thankee replied mr wilks considering he added truthfully after a moments reflection  miss nugent dropped into a chair and put her feet on the fender her father eyed her restlessly  i came here to speak to sam about a private matter he said abruptly  private matter said his daughter looking round in surprise what about  a private matter repeated captain nugent suppose you come in some other time  kate nugent sighed and took her feet from the fender ill go and wait in the kitchen she said crossing to the door  both men protested the captain because it illassorted with his dignity for his daughter to sit in the kitchen and mr wilks because of the visitor already there the face of the steward indeed took on such extraordinary expressions in his endeavour to convey private information to the girl that she gazed at him in silent amazement then she turned the handle of the door and passing through closed it with a bang which was final  mr wilks stood spellbound but nothing happened there was no cry of surprise no hasty reappearance of an indignant kate nugent his features working nervously he resumed his seat and gazed dutifully at his superior officer  i suppose youve heard that my son is going to get married said the latter  i couldnt help hearing of it sir said the steward in self defence nobody could  hes going to marry that yellowheaded jezebel of kybirds said the captain staring at the fire  mr wilks murmured that he couldnt understand anybody liking yellow hair and more than that the general opinion of the ladies in fullalove alley was that it was dyed  im going to ship him on the seabird continued the captain shell probably be away for a year or two and in the meantime this girl will probably marry somebody else especially if she doesnt know what has become of him he cant get into mischief aboard ship  no sir said the wondering mr wilks is master jack agreeable to going sir  thats nothing to do with it said the captain sharply  no sir said mr wilks o course not i was only a sort o wondering how he was going to be persuaded to go if e aint  thats what i came here about said the other i want you to go and fix it up with nathan smith  do you want im to be crimped sir stammered mr wilks  i want him shipped aboard the seabird returned the other and smiths the man to do it  its a very hard thing to do in these days sir said mr wilks shaking his head what with signing on aboard the day before the ship sails and before the board o trade officers im sure its a wonder that anybody goes to sea at all  you leave that to smith said the captain impatiently the seabird sails on friday mornings tide tell smith ill arrange to meet my son here on thursday night and that he must have some liquor for us and a fly waiting on the beach  mr wilks wriggled but what about signing on sir he inquired  he wont sign on said the captain hell be a stowaway smith must get him smuggled aboard and bribe the hands to let him lie hidden in the focsle the seabird wont put back to put him ashore here is five pounds give smith two or three now and the remainder when the job is done  the steward took the money reluctantly and plucking up his courage looked his old master in the face  its a ard life afore the mast sir he said slowly  rubbish was the reply itll make a man of him besides whats it got to do with you  i dont care about the job sir said mr wilks bravely  whats that got to do with it demanded the other frowning you go and fix it up with nathan smith as soon as possible  mr wilks shuffled his feet and strove to remind himself that he was a gentleman of independent means and could please himself  ive known im since he was a baby he murmured defiantly  i dont want to hear anything more from you wilks said the captain in a hard voice those are my orders and you had better see that they are carried out my son will be one of the first to thank you later on for getting him out of such a mess  mr wilkss brow cleared somewhat i spose miss kate ud be pleased too he remarked hopefully  of course she will said the captain now i look to you wilks to manage this thing properly i wouldnt trust anybody else and youve never disappointed me yet  the steward gasped and doubting whether he had heard aright looked towards his old master but in vain for the confirmation of further compliments in all his long years of service he had never been praised by him before he leaned forward eagerly and began to discuss ways and means  in the next room conversation was also proceeding but fitfully miss nugents consternation when she closed the door behind her and found herself face to face with mr hardy was difficult of concealment too late she understood the facial contortions of mr wilks and resigning herself to the inevitable accepted the chair placed for her by the highly pleased jem and sat regarding him calmly from the other side of the fender  i am waiting here for my father she said in explanation  in deference to wilkss terrors i am waiting here until he has gone said hardy with a half smile  there was a pause i hope that he will not be long said the girl  thank you returned hardy wilfully misunderstanding but i am in no hurry  he gazed at her with admiration the cold air had heightened her colour and the brightness of her eyes shamed the solitary candle which lit up the array of burnished metal on the mantelpiece  i hope you enjoyed your visit to london he said  before replying miss nugent favoured him with a glance designed to express surprise at least at his knowledge of her movements very much thank you she said at last  mr hardy still looking at her with much comfort to himself felt an insane desire to tell her how much she had been missed by one person at least in sunwich saved from this suicidal folly by the little common sense which had survived the shock of her sudden appearance he gave the information indirectly  quite a long stay he murmured three months and three days no three months and two days  a sudden wave of colour swept over the girls face at the ingenuity of this mode of attack she was used to attention and took compliments as her due but the significant audacity of this one baffled her she sat with downcast eyes looking at the fender occasionally glancing from the corner of her eye to see whether he was preparing to renew the assault he had certainly changed from the jem hardy of olden days she had a faint idea that his taste had improved  wilks keeps his house in good order said hardy looking round  yes said the girl  wonder why he never married said hardy musingly for my part i cant understand a man remaining single all his life can you  i never think of such things said miss nugent coldlyand untruthfully  if it was only to have somebody to wait on him and keep his house clean pursued hardy with malice  miss nugent grew restless and the wrongs of her sex stirred within her you have very lofty ideas on the subject she said scornfully but i believe they are not uncommon  still you have never thought about such things you know he reminded her  and no doubt you have devoted a great deal of time to the subject  hardy admitted it frankly but only since i returned to sunwich he said  caused by the spectacle of sams forlorn condition i suppose said miss nugent  no it wasnt that he replied  miss nugent indignant at having been drawn into such a discussion lapsed into silence it was safer and far more dignified but at the same time she yearned for an opportunity of teaching this presumptuous young man a lesson so far he had had it all his own way a way strewn with ambiguities which a modest maiden had to ignore despite herself  of course wilks may have had a disappointment said hardy with the air of one willing to make allowances  i believe he had about fifty said the girl carelessly  hardy shook his head in strong disapproval no man should have more than one he said firmly a man of any strength of will wouldnt have that  strength of will repeated the astonished miss nugent  their eyes met hers sparkling with indignation his full of cold calculation if he had had any doubts before he was quite sure now that he had gone the right way to work to attract her attention she was almost quivering with excitement  your ideas will probably change with ageand disappointment she said sweetly  i shall not be disappointed said hardy coolly ill take care of that  miss nugent eyed him wistfully and racked her brains for an appropriate and crushing rejoinder in all her experienceand it was considerable considering her yearsshe had never met with such carefully constructed audacity and she longed with a great longing to lure him into the open and destroy him she was still considering ways and means of doing this when the door opened and revealed the surprised and angry form of her father and behind it the pallid countenance of mr wilks for a moment anger deprived the captain of utterance  who he stammered what  what a long time youve been father said miss nugent in a reproving voice i began to be afraid you were never going  you come home with me said the captain recovering  the command was given in his most imperious manner and his daughter dropped her muff in some resentment as she rose in order to let him have the pleasure of seeing mr hardy pick it up it rolled however in his direction and he stooped for it just as hardy darted forward their heads met with a crash and miss nugent forgot her own consternation in the joy of beholding the pitiable exhibition which terror made of mr wilks  im very sorry said hardy as he reverently dusted the muff on his coatsleeve before returning it im afraid it was my fault  it was said the infuriated captain as he held the door open for his daughter now kate  miss nugent passed through followed by her father and escorted to the front door by the steward whose faint goodnight was utterly ignored by his injured commander he stood at the door until they had turned the corner and returning to the kitchen found his remaining guest holding his aching head beneath the tap  and now said the captain sternly to his daughter how dare you sit and talk to that young cub eh how dare you  he was there when i went in said his daughter why didnt you come out then demanded her father  i was afraid of disturbing you and sam said miss nugent besides why shouldnt i speak to him  why shouted the captain why because i wont have it  i thought you liked him said miss nugent in affected surprise you patted him on the head  the captain hardly able to believe his ears came to an impressive stop in the roadway but miss nugent walked on she felt instinctively that the joke was thrown away on him and in the absence of any other audience wanted to enjoy it without interruption convulsive and halfsuppressed sounds which she ascribed to a slight cold caught while waiting in the kitchen escaped her at intervals for the remainder of the journey home     chapter xi  jack nugents first idea on seeing a letter from his father asking him to meet him at samson wilkss was to send as impolite a refusal as a strong sense of undutifulness and a not inapt pen could arrange but the united remonstrances of the kybird family made him waver  you go said mr kybird solemnly take the advice of a man wots seen life and go who knows but wot hes a thinking of doing something for you  startin of you in business or somethin said mrs kybird but if e tries to break it off between you and melia i hope you know what to say  he wont do that said her husband  if he wants to see me said mr nugent let him come here  i wouldnt ave im in my house retorted mr kybird quickly an englishmans ouse is his castle and i wont ave him in mine  why not danl asked his wife if the two families is to be connected  mr kybird shook his head and catching her eye winked at her with much significance  ave it your own way said mrs kybird who was always inclined to make concessions in minor matters ave it your own way but dont blame me thats all i ask  urged on by his friends mr nugent at last consented and in a reply to his father agreed to meet him at the house of mr wilks on thursday evening he was not free himself from a slight curiosity as to the reasons which had made the captain unbend in so unusual a fashion  mr nathan smith put in an appearance at six oclock on the fatal evening he was a short slight man with a cleanshaven face mapped with tiny wrinkles and a pair of colourless eyes the blankness of whose expression defied research in conversation especially conversation of a diplomatic nature mr smith seemed to be looking through his opponent at something beyond an uncomfortable habit which was a source of much discomfort to his victims  here we are then mr wilks he said putting his head in the door and smiling at the agitated steward  come in said mr wilks shortly  mr smith obliged nice night outside he said taking a chair clear overead wot a morning it ud be for a sail if we was only young enough is that terbacker in that canister there  the other pushed it towards him  if i was only young enoughand silly enough said the boardinghouse master producing a pipe with an unusually large bowl and slowly filling it theres nothing i should enjoy more than a three years cruise nothing to do and everything of the best  ave you made all the arrangements inquired mr wilks in a tone of cold superiority  mr smith glanced affectionately at a fishbag of bulky appearance which stood on the floor between his feet all ready he said cheerfully an if youd like a vyge yourself i can manage it for you in two twos youve ony got to say the word  i dont want one said the steward fiercely dont you try none o your larks on me nathan smith cos i wont have it  lord love your art said the boardingmaster i wouldnt urt you im ony acting under your orders now yours and the captins it aint in my reglar way o business at all but im so goodnatured i cant say no  cant say no to five pounds you mean retorted mr wilks who by no means relished these remarks  if i was getting as much out of it as you are id be a appy man sighed mr smith  me cried the other do you think id take money for thiswhy id sooner starve id sooner wot are you atapping your nose for  was i tapping it demanded mr smith in surprise well i didnt know it im glad you told me  youre quite welcome said the steward sharply crimping aint in my line id sooner sweep the roads  ear ear exclaimed mr smith approvingly ah wot a thing it is to come acrost an honest man wot a good thing it is for the eyesight  he stared stonily somewhere in the direction of mr wilks and then blinking rapidly shielded his eyes with his hand as though overcome by the sight of so much goodness the stewards wrath rose at the performance and he glowered back at him until his eyes watered  twenty past six said mr smith suddenly as he fumbled in his waistcoatpocket and drew out a small folded paper its time i made a start i spose youve got some salt in the house  plenty said mr wilks  and beer inquired the other  yes there is some beer said the steward  bring me a quart of it said the boardingmaster slowly and impressively i want it drawed in a china mug with a nice foaming ead on it  wot do you want it for inquired mr wilks eyeing him very closely  bisness purposes said mr smith if youre very good you shall see ow i do it  still the steward made no move i thought you brought the stuff with you he remarked  mr smith looked at him with mild reproach are you managing this affair or am i he inquired  the steward went out reluctantly and drawing a quart mug of beer set it down on the table and stood watching his visitor  and now i want a spoonful o sugar a spoonful o salt and a spoonful o vinegar said mr smith make haste afore the ead goes off of it  mr wilks withdrew grumbling and came back in a wonderfully short space of time considering with the articles required  thankee said the other you ave been quick i wish i could move as quick as you do but you can take em back now i find i can do without em  wheres the beer demanded the incensed mr wilks wheres the beer you underhanded swab  i altered my mind said mr smith and not liking waste and seeing by your manner that youve ad more than enough already tonight i drunk it there isnt another man in sunwich i could ha played that trick on no nor a boy neither  mr wilks was about to speak but thinking better of it threw the three spoons in the kitchen and resuming his seat by the fire sat with his back half turned to his visitor  bright cheerful young chap e is said mr smith youve knowed im ever since he was a baby havent you  mr wilks made no reply  the conquerors sailing tomorrow morning too continued his tormentor his fathers old ship ow strange itll seem to im following it out aboard a whaler life is full o surprises mr wilks and wot a big surprise it would be to you if you could ear wot he says about you when he comes to is senses  im obeying orders growled the other  quite right said mr smith approvingly as he drew a bottle of whisky from his bag and placed it on the table two glasses and there we are we dont want any salt and vinegar this time  mr wilks turned a deaf ear but ow are you going to manage so as to make one silly and not the other he inquired  its a trade secret said the other but i dont mind telling you i sent the capn something to take afore he comes and i shall be in your kitchen looking arter things  i spose you know wot youre about said mr wilks doubtfully  i spose so rejoined the other young nugent trusts you and of course hell take anything from your ouse thats the beauty of aving a character mr wilks a good character and a face like a baby with grey whiskers  mr wilks bent down and taking up a small brush carefully tidied up the hearth  like as not if my part in it gets to be known pursued mr smith mournfully ill ave that gal of kybirds scratching my eyes out or praps sticking a hatpin into me i had that once the longest hatpin that ever was made i should think  he shook his head over the perils of his calling and then after another glance at the clock withdrew to the kitchen with his bag leaving mr wilks waiting in a state of intense nervousness for the arrival of the others  captain nugent was the first to put in an appearance and by way of setting a good example poured a little of the whisky in his glass and sat there waiting then jack nugent came in fresh and glowing and mr wilks after standing about helplessly for a few moments obeyed the captains significant nod and joined mr smith in the kitchen  youd better go for a walk said that gentleman regarding him kindly thats wot the capn thought  mr wilks acquiesced eagerly and tapping at the door passed through the room again into the street a glance as he went through showed him that jack nugent was drinking and he set off in a panic to get away from the scene which he had contrived  he slackened after a time and began to pace the streets at a rate which was less noticeable as he passed the kybirds he shivered and it was not until he had consumed a pint or two of the strongest brew procurable at the two schooners that he began to regain some of his old selfesteem he felt almost maudlin at the sacrifice of character he was enduring for the sake of his old master and the fact that he could not narrate it to sympathetic friends was not the least of his troubles  the shops had closed by the time he got into the street again and he walked down and watched with much solemnity the reflection of the quay lamps in the dark water of the harbour the air was keen and the various craft distinct in the starlight perfect quiet reigned aboard the seabird and after a vain attempt to screw up his courage to see the victim taken aboard he gave it up and walked back along the beach  by the time he turned his steps homewards it was nearly eleven oclock fullalove alley was quiet and after listening for some time at his window he turned the handle of the door and passed in the nearly empty bottle stood on the table and an overturned tumbler accounted for a large dark patch on the tablecloth as he entered the room the kitchen door opened and mr nathan smith with a broad smile on his face stepped briskly in  all over he said rubbing his hands he went off like a lamb no trouble nor fighting he was a example to all of us  did the capn see im aboard inquired mr wilks  certainly not said the other as a matter o fact the capn took a little more than i told im to take and i ad to help im up to your bed accidents will appen but hell be all right in the morning if nobody goes near im leave im perfectly quiet and when e comes downstairs give im a strong cup o tea  in my bed repeated the staring mr wilks  hes as right as rain said the boarding master i brought down a pillow and blankets for you and put em in the kitchen and now ill take the other two pound ten and be getting off ome it ought to be ten pounds really with the trouble ive ad  mr wilks laid the desired amount on the table and mr nathan smith placing it in his pocket rose to go  dont disturb im till hes ad is sleep out mind he said pausing at the door else i cant answer for the consequences if e should get up in the night and come down raving mad try and soothe im goodnight and pleasant dreams  he closed the door after him quietly and the horrified steward after fetching the bedclothes on tiptoe from the kitchen locked the door which led to the staircase and after making up a bed on the floor lay down in his clothes and tried to get to sleep  he dozed off at last but woke up several times during the night with the cold the lamp burnt itself out and in the dark he listened intently for any sounds of life in the room above then he fell asleep again until at about halfpast seven in the morning a loud crash overhead awoke him with a start  in a moment he was sitting up with every faculty on the alert footsteps blundered about in the room above and a large and rapidly widening patch of damp showed on the ceiling it was evident that the sleeper in his haste to quench an abnormal thirst had broken the water jug  mr wilks shivering with dread sprang to his feet and stood irresolute judging by the noise the captain was evidently in a fine temper and mr smiths remarks about insanity occurred to him with redoubled interest then he heard a hoarse shout the latch of the bedroom door clicked and the prisoner stumbled heavily downstairs and began to fumble at the handle of the door at the bottom trembling with excitement mr wilks dashed forward and turned the key and then retreating to the street door prepared for instant flight  he opened the door so suddenly that the man on the other side with a sudden cry fell on all fours into the room and raising his face stared stupidly at the steward mr wilkss hands dropped to his sides and his tongue refused its office for in some strange fashion quite in keeping with the lawless proceedings of the previous night captain nugent had changed into a most excellent likeness of his own son     chapter xii  for some time mr wilks stood gazing at this unexpected apparition and trying to collect his scattered senses its face was pale and flabby while its glassy eyes set in rims of red eyelids were beginning to express unmistakable signs of suspicion and wrath the shock was so sudden that the steward could not even think coherently was the captain upstairs and if so what was his condition where was nathan smith and where was the five pounds  a voice a husky and discordant voice broke in upon his meditations jack nugent was also curious  what does all this mean he demanded angrily how did i get here  youyou came downstairs stammered mr wilks still racking his brains in the vain effort to discover how matters stood  mr nugent was about to speak but thinking better of it turned and blundered into the kitchen sounds of splashing and puffing ensued and the steward going to the door saw him with his head under the tap he followed him in and at the right time handed him a towel despite the disordered appearance of his hair the improvement in mr nugents condition was so manifest that the steward hoping for similar results turned the tap on again and followed his example  your head wants cooling i should think said the young man returning him the towel whats it all about  mr wilks hesitated a bright thought occurred to him and murmuring something about a dry towel he sped up the narrow stairs to his bedroom the captain was not there he pushed open the small lattice window and peered out into the alley no sign of either the captain or the ingenious mr nathan smith with a heavy heart he descended the stairs again  now said mr nugent who was sitting down with his hands in his pockets perhaps youll be good enough to explain what all this means  you were ere last night said mr wilks you and the capn  i know that said nugent how is it i didnt go home i didnt understand that it was an allnight invitation where is my father  the steward shook his head helplessly he was ere when i went out last night he said slowly when i came back the room was empty and i was told as e was upstairs in my bed  told he was in your bed repeated the other who told you  he pushed open the small lattice window and peered out into the alley  mr wilks caught his breath i mean i told myself e was in my bed he stammered because when i came in i see these bedclothes on the floor an i thought as the capn ad put them there for me and taken my bed imself  mr nugent regarded the litter of bedclothes as though hoping that they would throw a little light on the affair and then shot a puzzled glance at mr wilks  why should you think my father wanted your bed he inquired  i dont know was the reply i thought praps ed maybe taken a little more than e ought to have taken but its all a mystry to me im more astonished than wot you are  well i cant make head or tail of it said nugent rising and pacing the room i came here to meet my father so far as i remember i had one drink of whiskyyour whiskyand then i woke up in your bedroom with a splitting headache and a tongue like a piece of leather can you account for it  mr wilks shook his head again i wasnt here he said plucking up courage why not go an see your father seems to me e is the one that would know most about it  mr nugent stood for a minute considering and then raising the latch of the door opened it slowly and inhaled the cold morning air a subtle and delicate aroma of coffee and herrings which had escaped from neighbouring breakfasttables invaded the room and reminded him of an appetite he turned to go but had barely quitted the step before he saw mrs kingdom and his sister enter the alley  mr wilks saw them too and turning if anything a shade paler supported himself by the doorpest kate nugent quickened her pace as she saw them and after a surprised greeting to her brother breathlessly informed him that the captain was missing  hasnt been home all night panted mrs kingdom joining them i dont know what to think  they formed an excited little group round the stewards door and mr wilks with an instinctive feeling that the matter was one to be discussed in private led the way indoors he began to apologize for the disordered condition of the room but jack nugent interrupting him brusquely began to relate his own adventures of the past few hours  mrs kingdom listened to the narrative with unexpected calmness she knew the cause of her nephews discomfiture it was the glass of whisky acting on a system unaccustomed to alcohol and she gave a vivid and moving account of the effects of a stiff glass of hot rum which she had once taken for a cold it was quite clear to her that the captain had put his son to bed the thing to discover now was where he had put himself  sam knows something about it said her nephew darkly theres something wrong  i know no more than a babe unborn declared mr wilks the last i see of the capn e was asitting at this table opposite you  sam wouldnt hurt a fly said miss nugent with a kind glance at her favourite  well where is the governor then inquired her brother why didnt he go home last night he has never stayed out before  yes he has said mrs kingdom folding her hands in her lap when you were children he came home at halfpast eleven next morning and when i asked him where hed been he nearly bit my head off id been walking the floor all night and i shall never forget his remarks when he opened the door to the police whod come to say they couldnt find him never  a ghostly grin flitted across the features of mr wilks but he passed the back of his hand across his mouth and became serious again as he thought of his position he was almost dancing with anxiety to get away to mr nathan smith and ask for an explanation of the proceedings of the night before  ill go and have a look round for the capn he said eagerly he cant be far  ill come with you said nugent i should like to see him too there are one or two little things that want explaining you take aunt home kate and ill follow on as soon as there is any news  as he spoke the door opened a little way and a head appeared only to be instantly withdrawn at the sight of so many people mr wilks stepped forward hastily and throwing the door wide open revealed the interesting features of mr nathan smith  how do you do mr wilks said that gentleman softly i just walked round to see whether you was in ive got a message for you i didnt know youd got company  he stepped into the room and tapping the steward on the chest with a confidential finger backed him into a corner and having got him there gave an expressive wink with one eye and gazed into space with the other  i thought youd be alone he said looking round but praps its just as well as it is theyve got to know so they may as well know now as later on  know what inquired jack nugent abruptly what are you making that face for sam  mr wilks mumbled something about a decayed tooth and to give colour to the statement continued a series of contortions which made his face ache  you should take something for that tooth said the boardingmaster with great solicitude wot do you say to a glass o whisky  he motioned to the fatal bottle which still stood on the table the steward caught his breath and then rising to the occasion said that he had already had a couple of glasses and they had done no good  whats your message inquired jack nugent impatiently  im just going to tell you said mr smith i was out early this morning strolling down by the harbour to get a little appetite for breakfast when who should i see coming along looking as though e ad just come from a funeral but capn nugent i was going to pass im but he stopped me and asked me to take a message from im to is old and faithful steward mr wilks  why has he gone away exclaimed mrs kingdom  his old and faithful steward repeated mr smith motioning her to silence tell im he says that i am heartily ashamed of myself for wot took place last nightand him too tell im that after my fathers art proved too much for me i walked the streets all night and now i cant face may injured son and family yet awhile and im off to london till it has blown over  but whats it all about demanded nugent why dont you get to the point  so far as i could make out replied mr smith with the studious care of one who desires to give exact information capn nugent and mr wilks ad a little plan for giving you a sea blow  me interrupted the unfortunate steward now look ere nathan smith  them was the capns words said the boardingmaster giving him a glance of great significance are you going to take away or add to wot the capn says  mr wilks collapsed and avoiding the indignant eyes of the nugent family tried to think out his position  it seems from wot the capn told me continued mr smith that there was some objection to your marrying oldmr kybirds gal so e and mr wilks after putting their eads together decided to get you ere and after giving you a little whisky that mr wilks knows the trick of  me interrupted the unfortunate steward again  them was the capns words said mr smith coldly after youd ad it they was going to stow you away in the seabird which sailed this morning however when the capn see you overcome his art melted and instead o putting you aboard the whaler he took your feet and mr wilks your ead and after a great deal o trouble got you upstairs and put you to bed  you miserable scoundrel said the astonished mr nugent addressing the shrinking steward you infernal old reprobateyouyoui didnt think youd got it in you  so far as i could make out said mr smith kindly mr wilks was only obeying orders it was the capns plan and mr wilks was aboard ship with im for a very long time o course he oughtnt to ha done it but the capns a masterful man an i can quite understand mr wilks givin way i dessay i should myself if id been in is placehes all art is mr wilksno ead  its a good job for you youre an old man sam said mr nugent  i can hardly believe it of you sam said miss nugent i can hardly think you could have been so deceitful why weve trusted you all our lives  the unfortunate steward quailed beneath the severity of her glance even if he gave a full account of the affair it would not make his position better it was he who had made all the arrangements with mr smith and after an indignant glance at that gentleman he lowered his gaze and remained silent  it is rather odd that my father should take you into his confidence said miss nugent turning to the boardingmaster  just wot i thought miss said the complaisant mr smith but i spose there was nobody else and he wanted is message to go for fear you should get worrying the police about im or something he wants it kep quiet and is last words to me as e left me was if this affair gets known i shall never come back tell em to keep it quiet  i dont think anybody will want to go bragging about it said jack nugent rising unless it is sam wilks come along kate  miss nugent followed him obediently only pausing at the door to give a last glance of mingled surprise and reproach at mr wilks then they were outside and the door closed behind them  well thats all right said mr smith easily  all right vociferated the steward wot did you put it all on to me for why didnt you tell em your part in it  wouldnt ha done any good said mr smith wouldnt ha done you any good besides i did just wot the capn told me  whens he coming back inquired the steward  mr smith shook his head couldnt say he returned he couldnt say imself between you an me i expect es gone up to have a reglar fair spree  why did you tell me last night he was upstairs inquired the other  capns orders repeated mr smith with relish ask im not me as a matter o fact he spent the night at my place and went off this morning  an wot about the five pounds inquired mr wilks spitefully you aint earned it  i know i aint said mr smith mournfully thats wots worrying me its like a gnawing pain in my side dyou think its conscience biting of me i never felt it before or dye think its sorrow to think that ive done the whole job too cheap you think it out and let me know later on so long  he waved his hand cheerily to the steward and departed mr wilks threw himself into a chair and ignoring the cold and the general air of desolation of his best room gave way to a fit of melancholy which would have made mr edward silk green with envy     chapter xiii  days passed but no word came from the missing captain and only the determined opposition of kate nugent kept her aunt from advertising in the agony columns of the london press miss nugent was quite as desirous of secrecy in the affair as her father and it was a source of great annoyance to her when in some mysterious manner it leaked out in a very short time the news was common property and mr wilks appearing to his neighbours in an entirely new character was besieged for information  his own friends were the most tiresome their open admiration of his lawlessness and their readiness to trace other mysterious disappearances to his agency being particularly galling to a man whose respectability formed his most cherished possession other people regarded the affair as a joke and he sat gazing roundeyed one evening at the two schooners at the insensible figures of three men who had each had a modest halfpint at his expense it was a pretty conceit and well played but the steward owing to the frenzied efforts of one of the sleepers whom he had awakened with a quart pot did not stay to admire it he finished up the evening at the chequers and after getting wet through on the way home fell asleep in his wet clothes before the dying fire  he awoke with a bad cold and pains in the limbs a headache was not unexpected but the other symptoms were with trembling hands he managed to light a fire and prepare a breakfast which he left untouched this last symptom was the most alarming of all and going to the door he bribed a small boy with a penny to go for dr murchison and sat cowering over the fire until he came  well youve got a bad cold said the doctor after examining him youd better get to bed for the present youll be safe there  is it dangerous faltered the steward  and keep yourself warm said the doctor who was not in the habit of taking his patients into his confidence ill send round some medicine  i should like miss nugent to know im bad said mr wilks in a weak voice  she knows that replied murchison she was telling me about you the other day  he put his hand up to his neat black moustache to hide a smile and met the stewards indignant gaze without flinching  i mean ill said the latter sharply  oh yes said the other well you get to bed now good morning  he took up his hat and stick and departed mr wilks sat for a little while over the fire and then rising hobbled slowly upstairs to bed and forgot his troubles in sleep  he slept until the afternoon and then raising himself in bed listened to the sounds of stealthy sweeping in the room below chairs were being moved about and the tinkle of ornaments on the mantelpiece announced that dusting operations were in progress he lay down again with a satisfied smile it was like a tale in a storybook the faithful old servant and his masters daughter he closed his eyes as he heard her coming upstairs  ah pore dear said a voice  mr wilks opened his eyes sharply and beheld the meagre figure of mrs silk in one hand she held a medicinebottle and a glass and in the other paper and firewood  i only eard of it half an hour ago she said reproachfully i saw the doctors boy and i left my work and came over at once why didnt you let me know  mr wilks muttered that he didnt know and lay crossly regarding his attentive neighbour as she knelt down and daintily lit the fire this task finished she proceeded to make the room tidy and then set about making beeftea in a little saucepan  you lay still and get well she remarked with tender playfulness thats all youve got to do me and teddyll look after you  i couldnt think of troubling you said the steward earnestly  its no trouble was the reply you dont think id leave you here alone helpless do you  i was going to send for old mrs jackson if i didnt get well today said mr wilks  mrs silk shook her head at him and after punching up his pillow took an easy chair by the fire and sat there musing mr edward silk came in to tea and after remarking that mr wilks was very flushed and had got a nasty look about the eyes and a cough which he didnt like fell to discoursing on deathbeds  good nursing is the principal thing said his mother i nursed my pore dear usband all through his last illness he couldnt bear me to be out of the room i nursed my mother right up to the last and your pore aunt jane went off in my arms  mr wilks raised himself on his elbow and his eyes shone feverishly in the lamplight i think ill get a ospital nurse tomorrow he said decidedly  nonsense said mrs silk its no trouble to me at all i like nursing always did  mr wilks lay back again and closing his eyes determined to ask the doctor to provide a duly qualified nurse on the morrow to his disappointment however the doctor failed to come and although he felt much better mrs silk sternly negatived a desire on his part to get up  not till the doctors been she said firmly i couldnt think of it  i dont believe theres anything the matter with me now he declared  ow oddow very odd that you should say that said mrs silk clasping her hands  odd repeated the steward somewhat crustily how do you meanodd  they was the very last words my uncle benjamin ever uttered in this life said mrs silk with dramatic impressiveness  the steward was silent then with the ominous precedent of uncle benjamin before him he began to talk until scores of words stood between himself and a similar ending  teddy asked to be remembered to you as e went off this morning said mrs silk pausing in her labours at the grate  im much obliged muttered the invalid  he didnt ave time to come in pursued the widow you can ardly believe what a lot e thinks of you mr wilks the last words he said to me was let me know at once if theres any change  mr wilks distinctly felt a cold clammy sensation down his spine and little quivering thrills ran up and down his legs he glared indignantly at the back of the industrious mrs silk  teddys very fond of you continued the unconscious woman i spose its not aving a father but he seems to me to think more of you than anybody else in the wide wide world i get quite jealous sometimes only the other day i said to im joking like well youd better go and live with im if youre so fond of im i said  ha ha laughed mr wilks uneasily  youll never guess what e said then said mrs silk dropping her dustpan and brush and gazing at the hearth  said e couldnt leave you i spose guessed the steward gruffly  well now exclaimed mrs silk clapping her hands if you avent nearly guessed it well there i never did i wouldnt ave told you for anything if you adnt said that the exact words what e did say was not without you mother  mr wilks closed his eyes with a snap and his heart turned to water he held his breath and ransacked his brain in vain for a reply which should ignore the inner meaning of the fatal words something careless and jocular he wanted combined with a voice which should be perfectly under control failing these things he kept his eyes closed and very wideawake indeed feigned sleep he slept straight away from eleven oclock in the morning until edward silk came in at seven oclock in the evening  i feel like a new man he said rubbing his eyes and yawning  i dont see no change in your appearance said the comforting youth  es much better declared his mother thats what comes o good nursing some nurses would ave woke im up to take food but i just let im sleep on people dont feel hunger while theyre asleep  she busied herself over the preparation of a basin of arrowroot and the steward despite his distaste for this dish devoured it in a twinkling beeftea and a glass of milk in addition failed to take more than the edge off his appetite  we shall pull im through said mrs silk smiling as she put down the empty glass in a fortnight hell be on is feet  it is a matter of history that mr wilks was on his feet at five oclock the next morning and not only on his feet but dressed and ready for a journey after such a breakfast as he had not made for many a day the discourtesy involved in the disregard of the doctors instructions did not trouble him and he smirked with some satisfaction as he noiselessly closed his door behind him and looked at the drawn blinds opposite the stars were paling as he quitted the alley and made his way to the railway station a note on his tumbled pillow after thanking mrs silk for her care of him informed her that he was quite well and had gone to london in search of the missing captain  hardy who had heard from edward silk of the stewards indisposition and had been intending to pay him a visit learnt of his departure later on in the morning and being ignorant of the particulars discoursed somewhat eloquently to his partner on the old mans devotion  hm may be said swann taking off his glasses and looking at him but you dont think captain nugent is in london do you  why not inquired hardy somewhat startled if what wilks told you is true nathan smith knows said the other ill ask him  you dont expect to get the truth out of him do you inquired hardy superciliously  i do said his partner serenely and when ive got it i shall go and tell them at equator lodge it will be doing those two poor ladies a service to let them know what has really happened to the captain  ill walk round to nathan smiths with you said hardy i should like to hear what the fellow has to say  no ill go alone said his partner smiths a very shy manpainfully shy ive run across him once or twice before hes almost as bashful and retiring as you are  hardy grunted if the captain isnt in london where is he he inquired  the other shook his head ive got an idea he replied but i want to make sure kybird and smith are old friends as nugent might have known only he was always too high and mighty to take any interest in his inferiors theres something for you to go on  he bent over his desk again and worked steadily until one oclockhis hour for lunching then he put on his hat and coat and after a comfortable meal sallied out in search of mr smith  the boardinghouse an old and dilapidated building was in a bystreet convenient to the harbour the front door stood open and a couple of seamen lounging on the broken steps made way for him civilly as he entered and rapped on the bare boards with his stick mr smith clattering down the stairs in response had some difficulty in concealing his surprise at the visit but entered genially into a conversation about the weather a subject in which he was much interested when the shipbroker began to discuss the object of his visit he led him to a small sittingroom at the back of the house and repeated the information he had given to mr wilks  thats all there is to tell he concluded artlessly the capn was that ashamed of hisself hes laying low for a bit we all make mistakes sometimes i do myself  i am much obliged to you said mr swann gratefully  youre quite welcome sir said the boardingmaster  and now said the visitor musinglynow for the police  police repeated mr smith almost hastily what for  why to find the captain said mr swann in a surprised voice  mr smith shook his head youll offend the capn bitter if you go to the police about im sir he declared his last words to me was smith ave this kept quiet  itll be a little job for the police urged the shipbroker they dont have much to do down here theyll be as pleased as possible  theyll worry your life out of you sir said the other you dont know what they are  i like a little excitement returned mr swann i dont suppose theyll trouble me much but theyll turn your place topsyturvy i expect still that cant be helped you know what fools the police are theyll think youve murdered the captain and hidden his body under the boards theyll have all the floors up ha ha ha  aving floors up dont seem to me to be so amusing as wot it does to you remarked mr smith coldly  they may find all sorts of treasure for you continued his visitor its a very old house smith and there may be bags of guineas hidden away under the flooring you may be able to retire  youre a gentleman as is fond of his joke mr swann returned the boardingmaster lugubriously i wish id got that appy way of looking at things you ave  im not joking smith said the other quietly  mr smith pondered and stealing a sideglance at him stood scraping his foot along the floor  there aint nothing much to tell he grumbled and mind the worst favour you could do to the capn would be to put it about how he was done hes gone for a little trip instead of is son thats all  little trip repeated the other you call a whaling cruise a little trip  no no sir said mr smith in a shocked voice i aint so bad as that ive got some art i hope hes just gone for a little trip with is old pal hardy on the conqueror kybirds idea it was  dont you know its punishable demanded the shipbroker recovering  to mr smiths great surprise his visitor sat down suddenly and began to laugh tears of honest mirth suffused his eyes and dimmed his glasses mr smith regarding him with an air of kindly interest began to laugh to keep him company  mr smith shook his head and became serious the capn fell into is own trap he said slowly theres no lor for im hed only get laughed at the idea of trying to get me to put little amelia kybirds young man away why i was er godfather  mr swann stared at him and then with a friendly good morning departed halfway along the passage he stopped and retracing his steps produced his cigarcase and offered the astonished boardingmaster a cigar  i spose said that gentleman as he watched the others retreating figure and dubiously smelt the cigar i spose its all right but hes a larky sort and i ave heard of em exploding ill give it to kybird in case     chapter xiv  captain nugent awoke the morning after his attempt to crimp his son with a bad headache not an ordinary headache to disappear with a little cold water and fresh air but a splitting racking affair which made him feel all head and dulness weights pressed upon his eyelids and the back of his head seemed glued to his pillow  he groaned faintly and raising himself upon his elbow opened his eyes and sat up with a sharp exclamation his bed was higher from the floor than usual and moreover the floor was different in the dim light he distinctly saw a ships forecastle untidy bunks with frouzy bedclothes and shiny oilskins hanging from the bulkhead  for a few moments he stared about in mystification he was certainly ill and no doubt the forecastle was an hallucination it was a strange symptom and the odd part of it was that everything was so distinct even the smell he stared harder in the hope that his surroundings would give place to the usual ones and leaning a little bit more on his elbow nearly rolled out of the bunk resolved to probe this mystery to the bottom he lowered himself to the floor and felt distinctly the motion of a ship at sea  there was no doubt about it he staggered to the door and holding by the side looked on to the deck the steamer was rolling in a fresh sea and a sweet strong wind blew refreshingly into his face funnels bridge and masts swung with a rhythmical motion loose gear rattled and every now and then a distant tinkle sounded faintly from the stewards pantry  he stood bewildered trying to piece together the events of the preceding night and to try and understand by what miracle he was back on board his old ship the conqueror there was no doubt as to her identity he knew every inch of her and any further confirmation that might be required was fully supplied by the appearance of the long lean figure of captain hardy on the bridge  captain nugent took his breath sharply and began to realize the situation he stepped to the side and looked over the harbour was only a little way astern and sunwich itself looking cold and cheerless beyond the dirty tumbling seas little more than a mile distant  at the sight his spirits revived and with a hoarse cry he ran shouting towards the bridge captain hardy turned sharply at the noise and recognizing the intruder stood peering down at him in undisguised amazement  put back cried nugent waving up at him put back  what on earth are you doing on my ship inquired the astonished hardy  put me ashore cried nugent imperiously dont waste time talking dye hear put me ashore  the amazement died out of hardys face and gave way to an expression of anger for a time he regarded the red and threatening visage of captain nugent in silence then he turned to the second officer  this man is not one of the crew mr prowle he said in a puzzled voice  no sir said mr prowle  how did he get aboard here  captain nugent answered the question himself i was crimped by you and your drunken bullies he said sternly  how did this man get aboard here repeated captain hardy ignoring him  he must have concealed imself somewhere sir said the mate this is the first ive seen of him  a stowaway said the captain bending his brows he must have got some of the crew to hide him aboard youd better make a clean breast of it my lad who are your confederates  captain nugent shook with fury the second mate had turned away with his hand over his mouth and a suspicious hunching of his shoulders while the steward who had been standing by beat a hasty retreat and collapsed behind the chartroom  if you dont put me ashore said nugent restraining his passion by a strong effort ill take proceedings against you for crimping me the moment i reach port get a boat out and put me aboard that smack  he pointed as he spoke to a smack which was just on their beam making slowly for the harbour  when youve done issuing orders said the captain in an indifferent voice perhaps youll explain what you are doing aboard my crag  captain nugent gazed at the stern of the fastreceding smack sunwich was getting dim in the distance and there was no other sail near he began to realize that he was in for a long voyage  i awoke this morning and found myself in a bunk in vow focsle he said regarding hardy steadily however i got there is probably best known to yourself i hold you responsible for the affair  look here my lad said captain hardy in patronizing tones i dont know how you got aboard my ship and i dont care i am willing to believe that it was not intentional on your part but either the outcome of a drunken freak or else a means of escaping from some scrape you have got into ashore that being so i shall take a merciful view of it and if you behave yourself and make yourself useful you will not hear anything more of it he has something the look of a seafaring man mr prowle see what you can make of him  come along with me my lad said the grinning mr prowle tapping him on the shoulder  the captain turned with a snarl and clenching his huge horny fist let drive full in the others face and knocked him off his feet  take that man forard cried captain hardy sharply take him forard  halfadozen willing men sprang forward captain nugents views concerning sailormen were well known in sunwich and two of the men present had served under him he went forward the centre of an attentive and rotating circle and sadly out of breath was bestowed in the forecastle and urged to listen to reason  for the remainder of the morning he made no sign the land was almost out of sight and he sat down quietly to consider his course of action for the next few weeks dinnertime found him still engrossed in thought and the way in which he received an intimation from a goodnatured seaman that his dinner was getting cold showed that his spirits were still unquelled  by the time afternoon came he was faint with hunger and having determined upon his course of action he sent a fairly polite message to captain hardy and asked for an interview  the captain who was resting from his labours in the chartroom received him with the same air of cold severity which had so endeared captain nugent himself to his subordinates  you have come to explain your extraordinary behaviour of this morning i suppose he said curtly  i have come to secure a berth aft said captain nugent i will pay a small deposit now and you will of course have the balance as soon as we get back this is without prejudice to any action i may bring against you later on  oh indeed said the other raising his eyebrows we dont take passengers  i am here against my will said captain nugent and i demand the treatment due to my position  if i had treated you properly said captain hardy i should have put you in irons for knocking down my second officer i know nothing about you or your position youre a stowaway and you must do the best you can in the circumstances  are you going to give me a cabin demanded the other menacingly  certainly not said captain hardy i have been making inquiries and i find that you have only yourself to thank for the position in which you find yourself i am sorry to be harsh with you  harsh repeated the other hardly able to believe his ears you harsh to me  but it is for your own good pursued captain hardy it is no pleasure to me to punish you i shall keep an eye on you while youre aboard and if i see that your conduct is improving you will find that i am not a hard man to get on with  captain nugent stared at him with his lips parted three times he essayed to speak and failed then he turned sharply and gaining the open air stood for some time trying to regain his composure before going forward again the first mate who was on the bridge regarded him curiously and then with an insufferable air of authority ordered him away  the captain obeyed mechanically and turning a deaf ear to the inquiries of the men prepared to make the best of an intolerable situation and began to cleanse his bunk first of all he took out the bedding and shook it thoroughly and then procuring soap and a bucket of water began to scrub with a will hostile comments followed the action  we aint clean enough for im said one voice  partikler old party aint he bill said another  you leave im alone said the man addressed surveying the captains efforts with a smile of approval you keep on nugent dont you mind im theres a little bit there you aint done  keep your head out of the way unless you want it knocked off said the incensed captain  ho said the aggrieved bill ho indeed dye ear that mates a man musnt look at is own bunk now  the captain turned as though he had been stung this is my bunk he said sharply  ho is it said bill beggin of your pardon an apologizing for acontradictin of you but its mine you havent got no bunk  i slept in it last night said the captain conclusively  i know you did said bill but that was all my kindartedness  and arf a quid bill a voice reminded him  and arf a quid assented bill graciously and im very much obliged to you mate for the careful and tidy way in which youve cleaned up arter yourself  the captain eyed him many years of command at sea had given him a fine manner and force of habit was for a moment almost too much for bill and his friends but only for a moment  im going to keep this bunk said the captain deliberately  no you aint mate said bill shaking his head dont you believe it youre nobody down here not even a ordinary seaman im afraid youll ave to clean a place for yourself on the carpet theres a nice corner over there  when i get back said the furious captain some of you will go to gaol for last nights work  dont be hard on us said a mocking voice we did our best it aint our fault that you look so ridikerlously young that we took you for your own son  and you was in that state that you couldnt contradict us said another man  if it is your bunk said the captain sternly i suppose you have a right to it but perhaps youll sell it to me how much  now youre talking bisness said the highly gratified bill turning with a threatening gesture upon a speculator opposite wot do you say to a couple o pounds  the captain nodded  couple o pounds money down said bill holding out his hand  the captain examined the contents of his pocket and after considerable friction bought the bunk for a pound cash and an i o u for the balance  a more humane man would have shown a little concern as to his benefactors sleepingplace but the captain never gave the matter a thought in fact it was not until three days later that he discovered there was a spare bunk in the forecastle and that the unscrupulous seaman was occupying it  it was only one of many annoyances but the captain realizing his impotence made no sign from certain remarks let fall in his hearing he had no difficulty in connecting mr kybird with his discomfiture and of his own desire he freely included the unfortunate mr wilks  he passed his time in devising schemes of vengeance and when captain hardy relenting offered him a cabin aft he sent back such a message of refusal that the steward spent half an hour preparing a paraphrase the offer was not repeated and the captain despite the strong representations of bill and his friends continued to eat the bread of idleness before the mast     chapter xv  mr adolphus swann spent a very agreeable afternoon after his interview with nathan smith in refusing to satisfy what he termed the idle curiosity of his partner the secret of captain nugents whereabouts he declared was not to be told to everybody but was to be confided by a man of insinuating address and appearancehere he looked at himself in a handglassto miss nugent to be broken to her by a man with no ulterior motives for his visit a man in the prime of life but not too old for a little tender sympathy  i had hoped to have gone this afternoon he said with a glance at the clock but im afraid i cant get away have you got much to do hardy  no said his partner briskly ive finished  then perhaps you wouldnt mind doing my work for me so that i can go said mr swann mildly  hardy played with his pen the senior partner had been amusing himself at his expense for some time and in the hope of a favour at his hands he had endured it with unusual patience  four oclock murmured the senior partner hadnt you better see about making yourself presentable hardy  thanks said the other with alacrity as he took off his coat and crossed over to the little washstand in five minutes he had finished his toilet and giving his partner a little friendly pat on the shoulder locked up his desk  well he said at last  well repeated mr swann with a little surprise  what am i to tell them inquired hardy struggling to keep his temper  tell them repeated the innocent swann lor bless my soul how you do jump at conclusions hardy i only asked you to tidy yourself for my sake i have an artistic eye i thought you had done it to please me  when youre tired of this nonsense said the indignant hardy i shall be glad  mr swann looked him over carefully and coming to the conclusion that his patience was exhausted told him the result of his inquiries his immediate reward was the utter incredulity of mr hardy together with some pungent criticisms of his veracity when the young man did realize at last that he was speaking the truth he fell to wondering blankly what was happening aboard the conqueror  never mind about that said the older man for a few weeks you have got a clear field it is quite a bond between you both your fathers on the same ship but whatever you do dont remind her of the fate of the kilkenny cats draw a fancy picture of the two fathers sitting with their arms about each others waists and wondering whether their children  hardy left hurriedly in fear that his indignation at such frivolity should overcome his gratitude and he regretted as he walked briskly along that the diffidence peculiar to young men in his circumstances had prevented him from acquainting his father with the state of his feelings towards kate nugent  the idea of taking advantage of the captains enforced absence had occurred to other people besides mr james hardy dr murchison who had found the captain despite his bias in his favour a particularly tiresome third was taking the fullest advantage of it and mrs kybird had also judged it an admirable opportunity for paying a first call mr kybird who had not taken her into his confidence in the affair protested in vain the lady was determined and moreover had the warm support of her daughter  i know what im doing danl she said to her husband  mr kybird doubted it but held his peace and the objections of jack nugent who found to his dismay that he was to be of the party were deemed too trivial to be worthy of serious consideration  they started shortly after jem hardy had left his office despite the fact that mrs kybird who was troubled with asthma was suffering untold agonies in a black satin dress which had been originally made for a much smaller woman and had come into her husbands hands in the way of business it got into hers in what the defrauded mr kybird considered an extremely unbusinesslike manner and it was not without a certain amount of satisfaction that he regarded her discomfiture as the party sallied out  mr nugent was not happy mrs kybird in the snug seclusion of the back parlour was one thing mrs kybird in black satin at its utmost tension and a circular hat set with sable ostrich plumes nodding in the breeze was another he felt that the public eye was upon them and that it twinkled his gaze wandered from mother to daughter  what are you staring at demanded miss kybird pertly  i was thinking how well you are looking was the reply  miss kybird smiled she had hoisted some daring colours but she was of a bold type and carried them fairly well  if i ad the woman what made this dress ere gasped mrs kybird as she stopped with her hand on her side id give her a bit o my mind  i never saw you look so well in anything before ma said her daughter  mrs kybird smiled faintly and continued her pilgrimage jem hardy coming up rapidly behind composed his amused features and stepped into the road to pass  halloa hardy said nugent going home  i am calling on your sister said hardy bowing  by jove so are we said nugent relieved to find this friend in need well go together you know mrs kybird and miss kybird that is mrs kybird  mrs kybird bade him go along do and acknowledged the introduction with as stately a bow as the black satin would permit and before the dazed jem quite knew how it all happened he was leading the way with mrs kybird while the young people as she called them followed behind  we aint looking at you she said playfully over her shoulder  and were trying to shut our eyes to your goings on retorted nugent  mrs kybird stopped and with a halfturn playfully reached for him with her umbrella the exertion and the joke combined took the remnant of her breath away and she stood still panting  you had better take hardys arm i think said nugent with affected solicitude  its my breath explained mrs kybird turning to the fuming young man by her side i can ardly get along for itim much obliged to you im sure  mr hardy with a vain attempt to catch jack nugents eye resigned himself to his fate and with his fair burden on his arm walked with painful slowness towards equator lodge a ribald voice from the other side of the road addressing his companion as mother kybird told her not to hug the man and a small boy whom they met loudly asseverated his firm intention of going straight off to tell mr kybird  by the time they reached the house mr hardy entertained views on homicide which would have appeared impossible to him half an hour before he flushed crimson as he saw the astonished face of kate nugent at the window and pausing at the gate to wait for the others discovered that they had disappeared a rooted dislike to scenes of any kind together with a keen eye for the ludicrous had prompted jack nugent to suggest a pleasant stroll to amelia and put in an appearance later on  we wont wait for im said mrs kybird with decision if i dont get a sit down soon i shall drop  still clinging to the reluctant hardy she walked up the path farther back in the darkness of the room the unfortunate young gentleman saw the faces of dr murchison and mrs kingdom  and ow are you bella inquired mrs kybird with kindly condescension is mrs kingdom at ome  she pushed her way past the astonished bella and followed by mr hardy entered the room mrs kingdom with a red spot on each cheek rose to receive them  i ought to ave come before said mrs kybird subsiding thankfully into a chair but im such a bad walker i ope i see you well  we are very well thank you said mrs kingdom stiffly  thats right said her visitor cordially what a blessing ealth is what should we do without it i wonder  she leaned back in her chair and shook her head at the prospect there was an awkward lull and in the offended gaze of miss nugent mr hardy saw only too plainly that he was held responsible for the appearance of the unwelcome visitor  i was coming to see you he said leaving his chair and taking one near her i met your brother coming along and he introduced me to mrs kybird and her daughter and suggested we should come together  miss nugent received the information with a civil bow and renewed her conversation with dr murchison whose face showed such a keen appreciation of the situation that hardy had some difficulty in masking his feelings  theyre a long time acoming said mrs kybird smiling archly but there when young people are keeping company they forget everything and everybody they didnt trouble about me if it adnt been for mr ardy giving me is arm i should never ave got here  there was a prolonged silence dr murchison gave a whimsical glance at miss nugent and meeting no response in that ladys indignant eyes stroked his moustache and awaited events  it looks as though your brother is not coming said hardy to miss nugent  hell turn up byandby interposed mrs kybird looking somewhat morosely at the company they dont notice ow the time flies thats all  time does go murmured mrs kingdom with a glance at the clock  mrs kybird started ah and we notice it too maam at our age she said sweetly as she settled herself in her chair and clasped her hands in her lap i cant elp looking at you my dear she continued looking over at miss nugent theres such a wonderful likeness between jack and you dont you think so maam  mrs kingdom in a freezing voice said that she had not noticed it  of course said mrs kybird glancing at her from the corner of her eye jack has ad to rough it pore feller and thats left its mark on im im sure when we took im in he was quite done up so to speak hed only got what e stood up in and the only pair of socks hed got to his feet was in such a state of oles that they had to be throwed away i throwed em away myself  dear me said mrs kingdom  he dont look like the same feller now continued the amiable mrs kybird good living and good clothes ave worked wonders in im im sure if hed been my own son i couldnt ave done more for im and as for kybird hes like a father to him  dear me said mrs kingdom again  mrs kybird looked at her it was on the tip of her tongue to call her a poll parrot she was a freespoken woman as a rule and it was terrible to have to sit still and waste all the good things she could have said to her in favour of unsatisfying pinpricks she sat smouldering  i spose you miss the captin very much she said at last  very much was the reply  and i should think e misses you retorted mrs kybird unable to restrain herself e must miss your conversation and what i might call your liveliness  mrs kingdom turned and regarded her and the red stole back to her cheeks again she smoothed down her dress and her hands trembled both ladies were now regarding each other in a fashion which caused serious apprehension to the rest of the company  i am not a great talker but i am very careful whom i converse with said mrs kingdom in her most stately manner  i knew a lady like that once said mrs kybird leastways she wasnt a lady she added meditatively  mrs kingdom fidgeted and looked over piteously at her niece mrs kybird with a satisfied sniff sat bolt upright and meditated further assaults there were at least a score of things she could have said about her adversarys cap alone plain straightforward remarks which would have torn it to shreds the cap fascinated her and her fingers itched as she gazed at it in more congenial surroundings she might have snatched at it but being a woman of strong character she suppressed her natural instincts and confined herself to more polite methods of attack  your nephew dont seem to be in no hurry she remarked at length but there direckly e gets along o my daughter e forgits everything and everybody  i really dont think he is coming said hardy moved to speech by the glances of miss nugent  i shall give him a little longer said mrs kybird i only came ere to please im and to get ome alone is more than i can do  miss nugent looked at mr hardy and her eyes were soft and expressive as plainly as eyes could speak they asked him to take mrs kybird home lest worse things should happen  would it be far out of your way she asked in a low voice  quite the opposite direction returned mr hardy firmly  how i got ere i dont know said mrs kybird addressing the room in general its a wonder to me well once is enough in a lifetime  mr hardy said kate nugent again in a low voice i should be so much obliged if you would take mrs kybird away she seems bent on quarrelling with my aunt it is very awkward  it was difficult to resist the entreaty but mr hardy had a very fair idea of the duration of miss nugents gratitude and besides that murchison was only too plainly enjoying his discomfiture  she can get home alone all right he whispered  miss nugent drew herself up disdainfully dr murchison looking scandalized at his brusqueness hastened to the rescue  as a medical man he said with a considerable appearance of gravity i dont think that mrs kybird ought to go home alone  think not inquired hardy grimly  certain of it breathed the doctor  well why dont you take her retorted hardy its all on your way i have some news for miss nugent  miss nugent looked from one to the other and mischievous lights appeared in her eyes as she gazed at the carefully groomed and fastidious murchison from them she looked to the other side of the room where mrs kybird was stolidly eyeing mrs kingdom who was trying in vain to appear ignorant of the fact  thank you very much said miss nugent turning to the doctor  im sorry began murchison with an indignant glance at his rival  oh as you please said the girl coldly pray forgive me for asking you  if you really wish it said the doctor rising miss nugent smiled upon him and hardy also gave him a smile of kindly encouragement but this he ignored he crossed the room and bade mrs kingdom goodbye and then in a few disjointed words asked mrs kybird whether he could be of any assistance in seeing her home  im sure im much obliged to you said that lady as she rose it dont seem much use for me waiting for my future soninlaw i wish you good afternoon maam i can understand now why jack didnt come  with this parting shot she quitted the room and leaning on the doctors arm sailed majestically down the path to the gate every feather on her hat trembling in response to the excitement below  goodnatured of him said hardy glancing from the window with a triumphant smile  very said miss nugent coldly as she took a seat by her aunt what is the news to which you referred just now is it about my father     chapter xvi  the two ladies received mr hardys information with something akin to consternation the idea of the autocrat of equator lodge as a stowaway on board the ship of his ancient enemy proving too serious for ordinary comment mrs kingdoms usual expressions of surprise well i never did and good gracious alive died on her lips and she sat gazing helpless and roundeyed at her niece  i wonder what he said she gasped at last  miss nugent who was trying to imagine her father in his new role aboard the conqueror paid no heed it was not a pleasant idea and her eyes flashed with temper as she thought of it sooner or later the whole affair would be public property  i had an idea all along that he wasnt in london murmured mrs kingdom fancy that nathan smith standing in sams room telling us falsehoods like that he never even blushed  but you said that you kept picturing father walking about the streets of london wrestling with his pride and trying to make up his mind to come home again said her niece maliciously  mrs kingdom fidgeted but before she could think of a satisfactory reply bella came to the door and asked to speak to her for a moment profiting by her absence mr hardy leaned towards miss nugent and in a low voice expressed his sorrow at the mishap to her father and his firm conviction that everything that could be thought of for that unfortunate mariners comfort would be done our fathers will probably come back good friends he concluded there is nothing would give me more pleasure than that and i think that we had better begin and set them a good example  it is no good setting an example to people who are hundreds of miles away said the matteroffact miss nugent besides if they have made friends they dont want an example set them  but in that case they have set us an example which we ought to follow urged hardy  miss nugent raised her eyes to his why do you wish to be on friendly terms she asked with disconcerting composure  i should like to know your father returned hardy with perfect gravity and mrs kingdomand you  he eyed her steadily as he spoke and miss nugent despite her utmost efforts realized with some indignation that a faint tinge of colour was creeping into her cheeks she remembered his covert challenge at their last interview at mr wilkss and the necessity of reading this persistent young man a stern lesson came to her with all the force of a public duty  why she inquired softly as she lowered her eyes and assumed a pensive expression  i admire him for one thing as a fine seaman said hardy  yes said miss nugent and  and ive always had a great liking for mrs kingdom he continued she was very goodnatured to me when i was a very small boy i remember she is very kind and amiable  the baffled miss nugent stole a glance at him and she said again very softly  and very motherly said hardy without moving a muscle  miss nugent pondered and stole another glance at him the expression of his face was ingenuous not to say simple she resolved to risk it so far he had always won in their brief encounters and monotony was always distasteful to her especially monotony of that kind  and what about me she said with a friendly smile  you said hardy with a gravity of voice belied by the amusement in his eye you are the daughter of the fine seaman and the niece of the goodnatured and motherly mrs kingdom  miss nugent looked down again hastily and all the shrew within her clamoured for vengeance it was the same masterful jem hardy that had forced his way into their seat at church as a boy if he went on in this way he would become unbearable she resolved at the cost of much personal inconvenience to give him a muchneeded fall but she realized quite clearly that it would be a matter of time  of course you and jack are already good friends she said softly  very assented hardy such good friends that i have been devoting a lot of time lately to considering ways and means of getting him out of the snares of the kybirds  i should have thought that that was his affair said miss nugent haughtily  mine too said hardy i dont want him to marry miss kybird  for the first time since the engagement miss nugent almost approved of it why not let him know your wishes she said gently surely that would be sufficient  but you dont want them to marry said hardy ignoring the remark  i dont want my brother to do anything shabby replied the girl but i shouldnt be sorry of course if they did not  very good said hardy armed with your consent i shall leave no stone unturned nugent was let in for this and i am going to get him out if i can alls fair in love and war you dont mind my doing anything shabby  not in the least replied miss nugent promptly  the reappearance of mrs kingdom at this moment saved mr hardy the necessity of a reply  conversation reverted to the missing captain and hardy and mrs kingdom together drew such a picture of the two captains fraternizing that miss nugent felt that the millennium itself could have no surprises for her  he has improved very much said mrs kingdom after the door had closed behind their visitor so thoughtful  hes thoughtful enough agreed her niece  he is what i call extremely considerate pursued the elder lady but im afraid he is weak anybody could turn him round their little finger  i believe they could said miss nugent gazing at her with admiration if he wanted to be turned  the ice thus broken mr hardy spent the following day or two in devising plausible reasons for another visit he found one in the person of mr wilks who having been unsuccessful in finding his beloved master at a small tavern down by the london docks had returned to sunwich by no means benefited by his change of air to learn the terrible truth as to his disappearance from hardy  i wish theyd shanghaid me instead he said to that sympathetic listener or mrs silk  eh said the other staring  wotll be the end of it i dont know said mr wilks laying a hand which still trembled on the other knee its got about that she saved my life by er careful nussing and the way she shakes er ead at me for risking my valuable life as she calls it going up to london gives me the shivers  nonsense said hardy she cant marry you against your will just be distantly civil to her  ow can you be distantly civil when she lives just opposite inquired the steward querulously she sent teddy over at ten oclock last night to rub my chest with a bottle o liniment and its no good me saying im all right when shes been spending eighteenpence o good money over the stuff  she cant marry you unless you ask her said the comforter  mr wilks shook his head people in the alley are beginning to talk he said dolefully just as i came in this afternoon old george lee screwed up one eye at two or three women wot was gossiping near and when i asked im wot ed got to wink about he said that a bit o weddingcake ad blowed in his eye as i passed it sent them silly creeturs into fits amost  theyll soon get tired of it said hardy  mr wilks still gloomy ventured to doubt it but cheered up and became almost bright when his visitor announced his intention of trying to smooth over matters for him at equator lodge he became quite voluble in his defence and attached much importance to the fact that he had nursed miss nugent when she was in long clothes and had taught her to whistle like an angel at the age of five  ive felt being cut adrift by her more than anything he said brokenly nineantwenty years i sailed with the capn and served im faithful and this is my reward  hardy pleaded his case next day miss nugent was alone when he called and moved by the vivid picture he drew of the old mans loneliness accorded her full forgiveness and decided to pay him a visit at once the fact that hardy had not been in the house five minutes she appeared to have overlooked  ill go upstairs and put my hat and jacket on and go now she said brightly  thats very kind of you said hardy his voice expressed admiring gratitude but he made no sign of leaving his seat  you dont mind said miss nugent pausing in front of him and slightly extending her hand  not in the least was the reply but i want to see wilks myself perhaps youll let me walk down with you  the request was so unexpected that the girl had no refusal ready she hesitated and was lost finally she expressed a fear that she might keep him waiting too long while she got readya fear which he politely declined to consider  well well see said the marvelling miss nugent to herself as she went slowly upstairs hes got impudence enough for forty  she commenced her preparations for seeing mr wilks by wrapping a shawl round her shoulders and reclining in an easychair with a novel it was a good story but the room was very cold and even the pleasure of snubbing an intrusive young man did not make amends for the lack of warmth she read and shivered for an hour and then with chilled fingers lit the gas and proceeded to array herself for the journey  her temper was not improved by seeing mr hardy sitting in the dark over a good fire when she got downstairs  im afraid ive kept you waiting she said crisply  not at all said hardy ive been very comfortable  miss nugent repressed a shiver and crossing to the fire thoughtlessly extended her fingers over the blaze  im afraid youre cold said hardy  the girl looked round sharply his face or as much of it as she could see in the firelight bore a look of honest concern somewhat at variance with the quality of his voice if it had not been for the absurdity of altering her plans on his account she would have postponed her visit to the steward until another day  the walk to fullalove alley was all too short for jem hardy miss nugent stepped along with the air of a martyr anxious to get to the stake and have it over and she answered in monosyllables when her companion pointed out the beauties of the night  a bitter east wind blew up the road and set her yearning for the joys of mr wilkss best room its very cold she said shivering  hardy assented and reluctantly quickened his pace to keep step with hers miss nugent with her chin sunk in a fur boa looked neither to the right nor the left and turning briskly into the alley turned the handle of mr wilkss door and walked in leaving her companion to follow  the steward who was smoking a long pipe over the fire looked round in alarm then his expression changed and he rose and stammered out a welcome two minutes later miss nugent enthroned in the best chair with her toes on the fender gave her faithful subject a free pardon and full permission to make hot coffee  and dont you ever try and deceive me again sam she said as she sipped the comforting beverage  no miss said the steward humbly ive ad a lesson ill never try and shanghai anybody else agin as long as i live  after this virtuous sentiment he sat and smoked placidly with occasional curious glances divided between his two visitors an idle and ridiculous idea which occurred to him in connection with them was dismissed at once as too preposterous for a sensible steward to entertain  mrs kingdom well he inquired  quite well said the girl if you take me home sam you shall see her and be forgiven by her too  thankee miss said the gratified steward  and what about your foot wilks said hardy somewhat taken aback by this arrangement  foot sir said the unconscious mr wilks wot foot  why the bad one said hardy with a significant glance  ho that one said mr wilks beating time and waiting further revelations  do you think you ought to use it much inquired hardy  mr wilks looked at it or to be more exact looked at both of them and smiled weakly his previous idea recurred to him with renewed force now and several things in the young mans behaviour hitherto disregarded became suddenly charged with significance miss nugent looked on with an air of cynical interest  better not run any risk said hardy gravely i shall be very pleased to see miss nugent home if she will allow me  what is the matter with it inquired miss nugent looking him full in the face  hardy hesitated diplomacy he told himself was one thing lying another he passed the question on to the rather badly used mr wilks  matter with it repeated that gentleman glaring at him reproachfully its got shootin pains right up it i suppose it was walking miles and miles every day in london looking for the capn was too much for it  is it too bad for you to take me home sam inquired miss nugent softly  the perturbed mr wilks looked from one to the other as a sportsman his sympathies were with hardy but his duty lay with the girl  ill do my best miss he said and got up and limped very well indeed for a first attempt round the room  then miss nugent did a thing which was a puzzle to herself for some time afterwards having won the victory she deliberately threw away the fruits of it and declining to allow the steward to run any risks accepted hardys escort home mr wilks watched them from the door and with his head in a whirl caused by the nights proceedings mixed himself a stiff glass of grog to set it right and drank to the health of both of them  the wind had abated somewhat in violence as they walked home and moreover they had their backs to it the walk was slower and more enjoyable in many respects than the walk out in an unusually soft mood she replied to his remarks and stole little critical glances up at him when they reached the house she stood a little while at the gate gazing at the starry sky and listening to the crash of the sea on the beach  it is a fine night she said as she shook hands  the best i have ever known said hardy goodbye     chapter xvii  the weeks passed all too quickly for james hardy he saw kate nugent at her own home met her thanks to the able and hearty assistance of mr wilks at fullalove alley and on several occasions had the agreeable task of escorting her back home  he cabled to his father for news of the illustrious stowaway immediately the conqueror was notified as having reached port elizabeth the replyleft shipconfirmed his worst fears but he cheerfully accepted mrs kingdoms view that the captain in order to relieve the natural anxiety of his family had secured a passage on the first vessel homeward bound  captain hardy was the first to reach home in the early hours of a fine april morning the conqueror steamed slowly into sunwich harbour and in a very short time the town was revelling in a description of captain nugents first voyage before the mast from lips which were never tired of repeating it down by the waterside mr nathan smith found that he had suddenly attained the rank of a popular hero and his modesty took alarm at the publicity afforded to his action it was extremely distasteful to a man who ran a quiet business on oldfashioned lines and disbelieved in advertisement he lost three lodgers the same day  jem hardy was one of the few people in sunwich for whom the joke had no charms and he betrayed such an utter lack of sympathy with his fathers recital that the latter accused him at last of wanting a sense of humour  i dont see anything amusing in it said his son stiffly  captain hardy recapitulated one or two choice points and was even at some pains to explain them  i cant see any fun in it repeated his son your behaviour seems to me to have been deplorable  what shouted the captain hardly able to believe his ears  captain nugent was your guest pursued the other he got on your ship by accident and he should have been treated decently as a saloon passenger  and been apologized to for coming on board i suppose suggested the captain  it wouldnt have been amiss was the reply  the captain leaned back in his chair and regarded him thoughtfully i cant think whats the matter with you jem he said  ordinary decent ideas thats all said his son scathingly  theres something more in it than that said the other positively i dont like to see this loveyourenemy business with you jem it aint natural to you has your health been all right while ive been away  of course it has said his son curtly if you didnt want captain nugent aboard with you why didnt you put him ashore it wouldnt have delayed you long think of the worry and anxiety youve caused poor mrs kingdom  a holiday for her growled the captain  it has affected her health continued his son and besides think of his daughter shes a highspirited girl and all sunwich is laughing over her fathers mishap  nugent fell into his own trap exclaimed the captain impatiently and it wont do that girl of his any harm to be taken down a peg or two do her good knock some of the nonsense out of her  thats not the way to speak of a lady said jem hotly  the offended captain regarded him somewhat sourly then his face changed and he got up from his chair and stood before his son with consternation depicted on every feature  you dont mean to tell me he said slowly you dont mean to tell me that youre thinking anything of kate nugent  why not demanded the other defiantly why shouldnt i  captain hardy whistling softly made no reply but still stood eyeing him  i thought there was some other reason for your consideration besides ordinary decent ideas he said at last when did it come on how long have you had it  mr hardy jun in a studiously unfilial speech intimated that these pleasantries were not to his taste  no of course not said the captain resuming his seat well im sorry if its serious jem but i never dreamt you had any ideas in that quarter if i had id have given old nugent the best bunk on the ship and sung him to sleep myself has she given you any encouragement  dont know said jem who found the conversation awkward  extraordinary thing said the captain shaking his head extraordinary like a play  play said his son sharply  play repeated his father firmly what is the name of it i saw it once at newcastle the lovers take poison and die across each others chests because their people wont let em marry and that reminds me i saw some phosphorpaste in the kitchen jem whose is it  im glad to be the means of affording you amusement said jem grinding his teeth  captain hardy regarded him affectionately go easy my lad he said equably go easy if id known it before things would have been different as i didnt we must make the best of it shes a pretty girl and a good one too for all her airs but im afraid shes too fond of her father to overlook this  thats where youve made such a mess of things broke in his son why on earth you two old men couldnt  easy said the startled captain when you are in the early fifties my lad your ideas about age will be more accurate besides nugent is seven or eight years older than i am  what became of him inquired jem  he was off the moment we berthed said his father suppressing a smile i dont mean that he boltedhed got enough starch left in him not to do thatbut he didnt trespass on our hospitality a moment longer than was necessary i heard that he got a passage home on the columbus he knew the master she sailed some time before us for london i thought hed have been home by this  it was not until two days later however that the gossip in sunwich received a pleasant fillip by the arrival of the injured captain he came down from london by the midday train and disdaining the privacy of a cab prepared to run the gauntlet of his fellowtownsmen  a weaker man would have made a detour but he held a direct course and with a curt nod to acquaintances who would have stopped him walked swiftly in the direction of home tradesmen ran to their shopdoors to see him and smoking amphibians lounging at street corners broke out into sunny smiles as he passed he met these annoyances with a set face and a cold eye but his views concerning children were not improved by the crowd of small creatures which fluttered along the road ahead of him and hopeful of developments clustered round the gate as he passed in  it is the pride and privilege of most returned wanderers to hold forth at great length concerning their adventures but captain nugent was commendably brief at first he could hardly be induced to speak of them at all but the necessity of contradicting stories which bella had gleaned for mrs kingdom from friends in town proved too strong for him he ground his teeth with suppressed fury as he listened to some of them the truth was bad enough and his daughter sitting by his side with her hand in his was trembling with indignation  poor father she said tenderly what a time you must have had it wont bear thinking of said mrs kingdom not to be outdone in sympathy  he met these annoyances with a set face  well dont think of it said the captain shortly  mrs kingdom sighed as though to indicate that her feelings were not to be suppressed in that simple fashion  the anxiety has been very great she said shaking her head but everybodys been very kind im sure all our friends have been most sympathetic i couldnt go outside the house without somebody stopping me and asking whether there was any news of you id no idea you were so popular even the milkman  id like some tea interrupted the captain roughly that is when you have finished your very interesting information  mrs kingdom pursed her lips together to suppress the words she was afraid to utter and rang the bell  your master would like some tea she said primly as bella appeared he has had a long journey the captain started and eyed her fiercely mrs kingdom her good temper quite restored by this little retort folded her hands in her lap and gazed at him with renewed sympathy  we all missed you very much said kate softly but we had no fears once we knew that you were at sea  and i suppose some of the sailors were kind to you suggested the unfortunate mrs kingdom they are rough fellows but i suppose some of them have got their hearts in the right place i daresay they were sorry to see you in such a position  the captains reply was of a nature known to mrs kingdom and her circle as snapping ones head off he drew his chair to the table as bella brought in the tray and accepting a cup of tea began to discuss with his daughter the events which had transpired in his absence  there is no news interposed mrs kingdom during an interval mr halls aunt died the other day  never heard of her said the captain neither had i till then said his sister what a lot of people there are one never hears of john the captain stared at her offensively and went on with his meal a long silence ensued  i suppose you didnt get to hear of the cable that was sent said mrs kingdom making another effort to arouse interest  what cable inquired her brother  the one mr hardy sent to his father about you replied mrs kingdom  the captain pushed his chair back and stared her full in the face what do you mean he demanded  his sister explained  do you mean to tell me that youve been speaking to young hardy exclaimed the captain  i could hardly help doing so when he came here returned his sister with dignity he has been very anxious about you  captain nugent rose and strode up and down the room then he stopped and glanced sharply at his daughter  were you here when he called he demanded  yes was the reply  and youyou spoke to him roared the captain  i had to be civil said miss nugent calmly im not a seacaptain  her father walked up and down the room again mrs kingdom terrified at the storm she had evoked gazed helplessly at her niece  what did he come here for said the captain  miss nugent glanced down at her plate i cant imagine she said demurely the first time he came to tell us what had become of you  the captain stopped in his walk and eyed her sternly i am very fortunate in my children he said slowly one is engaged to marry the daughter of the shadiest rascal in sunwich and the other  and the other said his daughter proudly as he paused  the other said the captain as he came round the table and put his hand on her shoulder is my dear and obedient daughter  yes said miss nugent but that isnt what you were going to say you need not worry about me i shall not do anything that would displease you     chapter xviii  with a view to avoiding the awkwardness of a chance meeting with any member of the nugent family hardy took the sea road on his way to the office the morning after the captains return common sense told him to leave matters for the present to the healing hand of time and to cultivate habits of selfeffacement by no means agreeable to one of his temperament  despite himself his spirits rose as he walked it was an ideal spring morning cool and sunny the short turf by the side of the road was fragrant under his heel and a light wind stirred the blueness of the sea on the beach below two grizzled men of restful habit were endeavouring to make an old boat waterproof with red and green paint  a long figure approaching slowly from the opposite direction broke into a pleasant smile as he drew near and quickened his pace to meet him  youre out early said hardy as the old man stopped and turned with him  ave to be sir said mr wilks darkly out early and ome late and more often than not getting my dinner out thats my life nowadays  cant you let her see that her attentions are undesirable inquired hardy gravely  cant you let her see that her attentions are undesirable  i cant be rude to a woman said the steward with a melancholy smile if i could my life would ha been very different shes always stepping across to ask my advice about teddy or something o that sort all last week she kept borrowing my fryingpan so at last by way of letting er see i didnt like it i went out and bought er one for herself whats the result instead o being offended she went out and bought me a couple o neckties when i didnt wear em she pretended it was because i didnt like the colour and she went and bought two more im wearing one now  he shook his head ruefully and hardy glanced at a tie which would have paled the glories of a rainbow for some time they walked along in silence  im going to pay my respects to capn nugent this afternoon said mr wilks suddenly  ah said the other  i knew what it ud be with them two on the same ship continued mr wilks i didnt say nothing when you was talking to miss kate but i knew well enough  ah said hardy again there was no mistaking the significance of the stewards remarks and he found them somewhat galling it was all very well to make use of his humble friend but he had no desire to discuss his matrimonial projects with him  its a great pity pursued the unconscious mr wilks just as everything seemed to be going on smoothly but while theres life theres ope  thats a smart barge over there said hardy pointing it out  mr wilks nodded i shall keep my eyes open this afternoon he said reassuringly and if i get a chance of putting in a word itll be put in twentynine years i sailed with the capn and if theres anybody knows his weak spots its me  he stopped as they reached the town and said goodbye he pressed the young mans hand sympathetically and a wink of intense artfulness gave point to his last remark  theres always sam wilkss cottage he said in a husky whisper and if two of is friends should appen to meet there whod be the wiser  he gazed benevolently after the young mans retreating figure and continued his stroll his own troubles partly forgotten in the desire to assist his friends it would be a notable feat for the humble steward to be the means of bringing the young people together and thereby bringing to an end the feud of a dozen years he pictured himself eventually as the trusted friend and adviser of both families and in one daring flight of fancy saw himself hobnobbing with the two captains over pipes and whisky  neatly dressed and carrying a small offering of wallflowers he set out that afternoon to call on his old master giving as he walked the last touches to a little speech of welcome which he had prepared during dinner it was a happy effort albeit a trifle laboured but captain nugents speech the inspiration of the moment gave it no chance  he started the moment the bowing mr wilks entered the room his voice rising gradually from low bitter tones to a hurricane note which bella could hear in the kitchen without even leaving her chair mr wilks stood dazed and speechless before him holding the wallflowers in one hand and his cap in the other in this attitude he listened to a description of his character drawn with the loving skill of an artist whose whole heart was in his work and who seemed never tired of filling in details  if you ever have the hardihood to come to my house again he concluded ill break every bone in your misshapen body get  mr wilks turned and groped his way to the door then he went a little way back with some idea of defending himself but the door of the room was slammed in his face he walked slowly down the path to the road and stood there for some time in helpless bewilderment in all his sixty years of life his feelings had never been so outraged his cap was still in his hand and with a helpless gesture he put it on and scattered his floral offering in the road then he made a beeline for the two schooners  though convivial by nature and ever free with his money he sat there drinking alone in silent misery men came and went but he still sat there noting with mournful pride the attention caused by his unusual bearing to casual inquiries he shook his head to more direct ones he only sighed heavily and applied himself to his liquor curiosity increased with numbers as the day wore on and the steward determined to be miserable fought manfully against an everincreasing cheerfulness due to the warming properties of the ale within  i ope you aint lost nobody sam said a discomfited inquirer at last  mr wilks shook his head  you look as though youd lost a shilling and found a hapenny pursued the other  found a what inquired mr wilks wrinkling his forehead  a hapenny said his friend  who did said mr wilks  the other attempted to explain and was ably assisted by two friends but without avail the impression left on mr wilkss mind being that somebody had got a shilling of his he waxed exceeding bitter and said that he had been missing shillings for a long time  youre labourin under a mistake sam said the first speaker  mr wilks laughed scornfully and essayed a sneer while his friends regarding his contortions with some anxiety expressed a fear that he was not quite himself to this suggestion the steward deigned no reply and turning to the landlord bade him replenish his mug  youve ad enough mr wilks said that gentleman who had been watching him for some time  mr wilks gazing at him mistily did not at first understand the full purport of this remark but when he did his wrath was so majestic and his remarks about the quality of the brew so libellous that the landlord lost all patience  you get off home he said sharply  listen t me said mr wilks impressively  i dont want no words with you said the landlord you get off home while you can  thats right sam said one of the company putting his hand on the stewards arm you take his advice  mr wilks shook the hand off and eyed his adviser ferociously then he took a glass from the counter and smashed it on the floor the next moment the bar was in a ferment and the landlord gripping mr wilks round the middle skilfully piloted him to the door and thrust him into the road  the strong air blowing from the sea disordered the stewards faculties still further his treatment inside was forgotten and leaning against the front of the tavern he stood openmouthed gazing at marvels ships in the harbour suddenly quitted their native element and were drawn up into the firmament nobody passed but twins  evening mr wilks said a voice  the steward peered down at the voice at first he thought it was another case of twins but looking close he saw that it was mr edward silk alone he saluted him graciously and then with a wave of his hand toward the sky sought to attract his attention to the ships there  yes said the unconscious mr silk sign of a fine day tomorrow are you going my way  mr wilks smiled and detaching himself from the tavern with some difficulty just saved mr silk from a terrible fall by clutching him forcibly round the neck the ingratitude of mr silk was a rebuff to a nature which was at that moment overflowing with good will for a moment the steward was half inclined to let him go home alone but the reflection that he would never get there softened him  pull yourself tgether he said gravely now old on me  the road as they walked rose up in imitation of the shipping but mr wilks knew now the explanation teddy silk was intoxicated very gently he leaned towards the erring youth and wagged his head at him  are you going to hold up or arent you demanded mr silk shortly  the steward waived the question he knew from experience the futility of arguing with men in drink the great thing was to get teddy silk home not to argue with him he smiled goodtemperedly to himself and with a sudden movement pinned him up against the wall in time to arrest another fall  with frequent halts by the way during which the shortness of mr silks temper furnished mr wilks with the texts of several sermons none of which he finished they at last reached fullalove alley and the steward with a brief exhortation to his charge to hold his head up bore down on mrs silk who was sitting in her doorway  ive brought im ome he said steadying himself against the doorpost brought im ome  brought im ome said the bewildered mrs silk  don say anything to im entreated mr wilks my sake thing might appen anybody  hes been like that all the way said mr silk regarding the steward with much disfavour i dont know why i troubled about him im sure  crowd roun im pursued the imaginative mr wilks old up teddy  im sure its very kind of you mr wilks said the widow as she glanced at a little knot of neighbours standing near will you come inside for a minute or two  she moved the chair to let him pass and mr wilks still keeping the restraining hand of age on the shoulder of intemperate youth passed in and stood smiling amiably while mrs silk lit the lamp and placed it in the centre of the table which was laid for supper the light shone on a knuckle of boiled pork a homemade loaf and a freshcut wedge of cheese  i suppose you wont stay and pick a bit o supper with us said mrs silk  why not inquired mr wilks  im sure if i had known said mrs silk as she piloted him to a seat id ave ad something nice there now if i avent been and forgot the beer  she left the table and went into the kitchen and mr wilkss eyes glistened as she returned with a large brown jug full of foaming ale and filled his glass  teddy mustnt ave any he said sharply as she prepared to fill that gentlemans glass  just alf a glass she said winsomely  not a drop said mr wilks firmly  mrs silk hesitated and screwing up her forehead glanced significantly at her son ave some byandby she whispered  give me the jug said mr silk indignantly what are you listening to im for cant you see whats the matter with im  not to ave it said mr wilks put it ere  he thumped the table emphatically with his hand and before her indignant son could interfere mrs silk had obeyed it was the last straw mr edward silk rose to his feet with tremendous effect and first thrusting his plate violently away from him went out into the night slamming the door behind him with such violence that the startled mr wilks was nearly blown out of his chair  he dont mean nothing said mrs silk turning a rather scared face to the steward es a bit jealous of you i spose  mr wilks shook his head truth to tell he was rather at a loss to know exactly what had happened  and then theres is love affair sighed mrs silk hell never get over the loss of amelia kybird i always know when e as seen her hes that miserable theres no getting a word out of im  mr wilks smiled vaguely and went on with his supper and the meal finished allowed himself to be installed in an easychair while his hostess cleared the table he sat and smoked in high good humour with himself the occasional remarks he made being received with an enthusiasm which they seldom provoked elsewhere  i should like t sit ere all night he said at last  i dont believe it said mrs silk playfully  like t sit ere all night repeated mr wilks somewhat sternly all nex day all day after day after that day  mrs silk eyed him softly why would you like to sit here all that time she inquired in a low voice  bcause said mr wilks simply bcause i dont feels if i can stand goonight  he closed his eyes on the indignant mrs silk and fell fast asleep it was a sound sleep and dreamless and only troubled by the occasional ineffectual attempts of his hostess to arouse him she gave up the attempt at last and taking up a pair of socks sat working thoughtfully the other side of the fireplace  the steward awoke an hour or two later and after what seemed a terrible struggle found himself standing at the open door with the cold night air blowing in his face and a voice which by an effort of memory he identified as that of edward silk inviting him to go home and lose no time about it then the door slammed behind him and he stood balancing himself with some difficulty on the step wondering what had happened by the time he had walked up and down the deserted alley three or four times light was vouchsafed to him and shivering slightly he found his own door and went to bed     chapter xix  any hopes which hardy might have entertained as to the attitude of miss nugent were dispelled the first time he saw her that dutiful daughter of a strongwilled sire favouring him with a bow which was exactly half an inch in depth and then promptly bestowing her gaze elsewhere he passed captain nugent next day and for a week afterwards he had only to close his eyes to see in all its appalling virulence the glare with which that gentleman had acknowledged his attempt at recognition  he fared no better in fullalove alley a visit to mr wilks eliciting the fact that that delectable thoroughfare had been put out of bounds for miss nugent moreover mr wilks was full of his own troubles and anxious for any comfort and advice that could be given to him all the alley knew that mrs silk had quarrelled with her son over the steward and without knowing the facts spoke their mind with painful freedom concerning them  she and teddy dont speak to each other now said mr wilks gloomily and to ear people talk youd think it was my fault  hardy gave him what comfort he could he even went the length of saying that mrs silk was a fine woman  she acts like a suffering martyr exclaimed mr wilks she comes over ere dropping hints that people are talking about us and that they ask er awkward questions pretending to misunderstand er every time is enough to send me crazy and shes so sudden in what she says theres no being up to er ony this morning she asked me if i should be sorry if she died  what did you say inquired his listener  i said yes admitted mr wilks reluctantly i couldnt say anything else but i said that she wasnt to let my feelings interfere with er in any way  hardys father sailed a day or two later and after that nothing happened equator lodge was an impregnable fortress and the only member of the garrison he saw in a fortnight was bella  his depression did not escape the notice of his partner who after first advising lovephiltres and then a visit to a wellknown specialist for diseases of the heart finally recommended more work and put a generous portion of his own on to the young mans desk hardy who was in an evil temper pitched it on to the floor and with a few incisive remarks on levity unbecoming to age pursued his duties in gloomy silence  a short time afterwards however he had to grapple with his partners work in real earnest for the first time in his life the genial shipbroker was laid up with a rather serious illness a chill caught while bathing was going the round of certain unsuspected weak spots and the patient who was of an inquiring turn of mind was taking a greater interest in medical works than his doctor deemed advisable  most interesting study he said faintly to hardy as the latter sat by his bedside one evening and tried to cheer him in the usual way by telling him that there was nothing the matter with him there are dozens of different forms of liver complaint alone and ive got em all  liver isnt much said his visitor with the confidence of youth  mine is retorted the invalid its twice its proper size and still growing base of the left lung is solidifying or im much mistaken the heart instead of waltzing as is suitable to my time of life is doing a galop and everything else is as wrong as it can be  when are you coming back inquired the other  back repeated swann back you havent been listening im a wreck all through violating mans primeval instinct by messing about in cold water what is the news  hardy pondered and shook his head nugent is going to be married in july he said at last  hed better have had that trip on the whaler commented mr swann but that is not news nathan smith told it me this morning  nathan smith repeated the other in surprise  ive done him a little service said the invalid got him out of a mess with garth and co hes been here two or three times and i must confess i find him a most alluring rascal  birds of a feather began hardy superciliously  dont flatter me said swann putting his hand out of the bedclothes with a deprecatory gesture  i am not worthy to sit at his feet he is the most amusing knave on the coast he is like a sunbeam in a sick room when you can once get him to talk of his experiences have you seen young nugent lately does he seem cheerful  yes but he is not was the reply  well its natural for the young to marry said the other gravely murchison will be the next to go i expect  possibly returned hardy with affected calmness  blaikie was saying something about it this morning resumed swann regarding him from halfclosed lids but he was punching and tapping me all about the ribs while he was talking and i didnt catch all he said but i think its all arranged murchison is there nearly every day i understand i suppose you meet him there  mr hardy whistling softly rose and walked round the room uncorking medicine bottles and sniffing at their contents a smile of unaffected pleasure lit up his features as he removed the stopper from one particularly pungent mixture  two tablespoonfuls three times a day he read slowly when did you have the last swann shall i ring for the nurse  the invalid shook his head impatiently youre an ungrateful dog he muttered or you would tell me how your affair is going have you got any chance  youre getting lightheaded now said hardy calmly id better go  all right go then responded the invalid but if you lose that girl just for the want of a little skilled advice from an expert youll never forgive yourselfim serious  well you must be ill then said the younger man with anxiety  twice said mr swann lying on his back and apparently addressing the ceiling twice i have given this young man invaluable assistance and each time he has bungled  hardy laughed and the nurse returning to the room bade him goodbye and departed after the close atmosphere of the sick room the air was delicious and he walked along slowly deep in thought from nathan smith his thoughts wandered to jack nugent and his unfortunate engagement and from that to kate nugent for months he had been revolving impossible schemes in his mind to earn her gratitude and possibly that of the captain by extricating jack in the latter connection he was also reminded of that unhappy victim of unrequited affection edward silk  it was early to go indoors and the house was dull he turned and retraced his steps and his thoughts reverting to his sick partner smiled as he remembered remarks which that irresponsible person had made at various times concerning the making of his last will and testament then he came to a sudden standstill as a wild forlornhope kind of idea suddenly occurred to him he stood for some time thinking then walked a little way and then stopped again as various difficulties presented themselves for solution finally despite the lateness of the hour he walked back in some excitement to the house he had quitted over half an hour before with the intention of speaking to the invalid concerning a duty peculiarly incumbent upon elderly men of means  the nurse who came out of the sick room gently closing the door after her demurred a little to this second visit but receiving a promise from the visitor not to excite the invalid left them together the odour of the abominable physic was upon the air  well said the invalid  i have been thinking that i was rather uncivil a little while ago said hardy  ah said the other what do you want  a little of that skilled assistance you were speaking of  mr swann made an alarming noise in his throat hardy sprang forward in alarm but he motioned him back  i was only laughing he explained  hardy repressed his annoyance by an effort and endeavoured but with scant success to return the others smile  go on said the shipbroker presently  i have thought of a scheme for upsetting nugents marriage said hardy slowly  it is just a forlorn hope which depends for its success on you and nathan smith  hes a friend of kybirds said the other drily  that is the most important thing of all rejoined hardy that is next to your shrewdness and tact everything depends upon you really and whether you can fool smith it is a great thing in our favour that you have been taking him up lately  are you coming to the point or are you not demanded the shipbroker  hardy looked cautiously round the room and then drawing his chair close to the bed leaned over the prostrate man and spoke rapidly into his ear  what cried the astounded mr swann suddenly sitting up in his bed youyou scoundrel  its to be done said hardy  you ghoul said the invalid glaring at him is that the way to talk to a sick man you unscrupulous rascal  itll be amusement for you pleaded the other and if we are successful it will be the best thing in the end for everybody think of the good youll do  where you get such rascally ideas from i cant think mused the invalid your father is a straightforward honest man and your partners uprightness is the talk of sunwich  it doesnt take much to make sunwich talk retorted hardy  a preposterous suggestion to make to a man of my standing said the shipbroker ignoring the remark if the affair ever leaked out i should never hear the end of it  it cant leak out said hardy and if it does there is no direct evidence they will never really know until you die they can only suspect  very well said the shipbroker with a halfindulgent halfhumorous glance anything to get rid of you its a crackbrained scheme and could only originate with a young man whose affections have weakened his headi consent  bravo said hardy and patted him on the back mr swann referred to the base of his left lung and he apologized  ill have to fix it up with blaikie said the invalid lying down again murchison got two of his best patients last week so that it ought to be easy and besides he is fond of innocent amusement  im awfully obliged to you said hardy  it might be as well if we pretended to quarrel said the invalid reflectively especially as you are known to be a friend of nugents well have a few wordsbefore my housekeeper if possible to insure publicityand then you had better not come again send silk instead with messages  hardy thanked him and whispered a caution as a footstep was heard on the landing the door opened and the nurse followed by the housekeeper bearing a tray entered the room  and i cant be worried about these things said swann in an acrimonious voice as they entered if you are not capable of settling a simple question like that yourself ask the officeboy to instruct you  its your work retorted hardy and a nice mess its in  hsh said the nurse coming forward hastily you must leave the room sir i cant have you exciting my patient  hardy bestowed an indignant glance at the invalid  get out said that gentleman with extraordinary fierceness for one in his weak condition in future nurse i wont have this person admitted to my room  yes yes certainly said the nurse you must go sir at once please  im going said hardy almost losing his gravity at the piteous spectacle afforded by the housekeeper as she stood still holding the tray and staring openmouthed at the combatants when youre tired of skulking in bed perhaps youll come and do your share of the work  mr swann rose to a sitting position and his demeanour was so alarming that the nurse hastening over to him entreated him to lie down and waved hardy peremptorily from the room  puppy said the invalid with great relish blockhead  he gazed fixedly at the young man as he departed and then catching sight in his turn of the housekeepers perplexity laid himself down and buried his face in the bedclothes the nurse crossed over to her assistant and taking the tray from her told her in a sharp whisper that if she ever admitted mr hardy again she would not be answerable for the consequences     chapter xx  charmed at the ease with which he had demolished the objections of mr adolphus swann and won that suffering gentleman over to his plans hardy began to cast longing glances at equator lodge he reminded himself that the labourer was worthy of his hire and it seemed moreover an extremely desirable thing that captain nugent should know that he was labouring in his vineyard with the full expectation of a bounteous harvest he resolved to call  kate nugent who heard the gate swing behind him as he entered the front garden looked up and stood spellbound at his audacity as a fairly courageous young person she was naturally an admirer of boldness in others but this seemed sheer recklessness moreover it was recklessness in which if she stayed where she was she would have to bear a part or be guilty of rudeness of which she felt incapable she took a third course and raising her eyebrows at the unnecessarily loud knocking with which the young man announced his arrival retreated in good order into the garden where her father in a somewhat heated condition was laboriously planting geraniums she had barely reached him when bella in a state of fearsome glee came down the garden to tell the captain of his visitor  who said the latter sharply as he straightened his aching back  young mr hardy said bella impressively i showed im in i didnt ask im to take a chair but he took one  young hardy to see me said the captain to his daughter after bella had returned to the house how dare he come to my house infernal impudence i wont see him  shall i go in and see him for you inquired kate with affected artlessness  you stay where you are miss said her father i wont have him speak to you i wont have him look at you ill  he beat his dirty hands together and strode off towards the house jem hardy rose from his chair as the captain entered the room and ignoring a look of black inquiry bade him good afternoon  what do you want asked the captain gruffly as he stared him straight in the eye  i came to see you about your sons marriage said the other are you still desirous of preventing it  im sorry youve had the trouble said the captain in a voice of suppressed anger and now may i ask you to get out of my house  hardy bowed i am sorry i have troubled you he said calmly but i have a plan which i think would get your son out of this affair and as a business man i wanted to make something out of it  the captain eyed him scornfully but he was glad to see this welllooking successful son of his old enemy tainted with such sordid views instead of turning him out he spoke to him almost fairly  how much do you want he inquired  all things considered i am asking a good deal was the reply  how much repeated the captain impatiently  hardy hesitated in exchange for the service i want permission to visit here when i choose he said at length say twice a week  words failed the captain none with which he was acquainted seemed forcible enough for the occasion he faced his visitor stuttering with rage and pointed to the door  get out of my house he roared  im sorry to have intruded said hardy as he crossed the room and paused at the door it is none of my business of course i thought that i saw an opportunity of doing your son a good turnhe is a friend of mineand at the same time paying off old scores against kybird and nathan smith i thought that on that account it might suit you good afternoon  he walked out into the hall and reaching the front door fumbled clumsily with the catch the captain watching his efforts in grim silence began to experience the twin promptings of curiosity and temptation  what is this wonderful plan of yours he demanded with a sneer  just at present that must remain a secret said the other he came from the door and unbidden followed the captain into the room again  what do you want to visit at my house for inquired the latter in a forbidding voice  to see your daughter said hardy  the captain had a relapse he had not expected a truthful answer and when it came in the most matteroffact tone it found him quite unprepared his first idea was to sacrifice his dignity and forcibly eject his visitor but more sensible thoughts prevailed  you are quite sure i suppose that your visits would be agreeable to my daughter he said contemptuously  hardy shook his head i should come ostensibly to see you he said cheerfully to smoke a pipe with you  smoke stuttered the captain explosively smoke a pipe with me  why not said the other i am offering you my services and anything that is worth having is worth paying for i suppose we could both smoke pipes under pleasanter conditions what have you got against me it isnt my fault that you and my father have quarrelled  i dont want anything more to say to you said the captain sternly ive shown you the door once am i to take forcible measures  hardy shrugged his broad shoulders i am sorry he said moving to the door again  so am i said the other  its a pity said hardy regretfully its the chance of a lifetime i had set my heart on fooling kybird and smith and now all my trouble is wasted nathan smith would be all the better for a fall  the captain hesitated his visitor seemed to be confident and he would have given a great deal to prevent his sons marriage and a great deal to repay some portion of his debt to the ingenious mr smith moreover there seemed to be an excellent opportunity of punishing the presumption of his visitor by taking him at his word  i dont think youd enjoy your smoking here much he said curtly  ill take my chance of that said the other it will only be a matter of a few weeks and then if i am unsuccessful my visits cease  and if youre successful am i to have the pleasure of your company for the rest of my life demanded the captain  that will be for you to decide was the reply is it a bargain  the captain looked at him and deliberated all right mondays and thursdays he said laconically  hardy saw through the ruse and countered  now swann is ill i cant always get away when i wish he said easily ill just drop in when i can good day  he opened the door and fearful lest the other should alter his mind at the last moment walked briskly down the path to the gate the captain stood for some time after his departure deep in thought and then returned to the garden to be skilfully catechized by miss nugent  and when my young friend comes with his pipe youll be in another room he concluded warningly  miss nugent looked up and patted his cheek tenderly what a talent for organization you have she remarked softly a place for everything and everything in its place the idea of his taking such a fancy to you  the captain coughed and eyed her suspiciously he had been careful not to tell her hardys reasons for coming but he had a shrewd idea that his caution was wasted  today is thursday said kate slowly he will be here tomorrow and saturday what shall i wear  the captain resumed his gardening operations by no means perturbed at the prophecy much as he disliked the young man he gave him credit for a certain amount of decency and his indignation was proportionately great the following evening when bella announced mr hardy he made a genial remark about shylock and a pound of flesh but finding that it was only an excellent conversational opening the subject of shakespeares plays lapsed into silence  it was an absurd situation but he was host and hardy allowed him to see pretty plainly that he was a guest he answered the latters remarks with a very ill grace and took covert stock of him as one of a species he had not encountered before one result of his stocktaking was that he was spared any feeling of surprise when his visitor came the following evening  its the thin end of the wedge said miss nugent who came into the room after hardy had departed you dont know him as well as i do  eh said her father sharply  i mean that you are not such a judge of character as i am said kate and besides i have made a special study of young men the only thing that puzzles me is why you should have such an extraordinary fascination for him  you talk too much miss said the captain drawing the tobacco jar towards him and slowly filling his pipe  miss nugent sighed and after striking a match for him took a seat on the arm of his chair and placed her hand on his shoulder i can quite understand him liking you she said slowly  the captain grunted  and if he is like other sensible people continued miss nugent in a coaxing voice the more he sees of you the more hell like you i do hope he has not come to take you away from me  the indignant captain edged her off the side of his chair miss nugent quite undisturbed got on again and sat tapping the floor with her foot her arm stole round his neck and she laid her cheek against his head and smiled wickedly  nicelooking isnt he she said in a careless voice  i dont know anything about his looks growled her father  miss nugent gave a little exclamation of surprise first thing i noticed she said with commendable gravity hes very goodlooking and very determined what are you going to give him if he gets poor jack out of this miserable business  give him said her father staring  i met jack yesterday said kate and i can see that he is as wretched as he can be he wouldnt say so of course if mr hardy is successful you ought to recognize it i should suggest one of your new photos in an eighteenpenny frame  she slipped off the chair and quitted the room before her father could think of a suitable retort and he sat smoking silently until the entrance of mrs kingdom a few minutes later gave him an opportunity of working off a little accumulated gall  while the junior partner was thus trying to obtain a footing at equator lodge the gravest rumours of the senior partners health were prevalent in the town nathan smith who had been to see him again ostensibly to thank him for his efforts on his behalf was of opinion that he was breaking up and in conversation with mr kybird shook his head over the idea that there would soon be one openhanded gentleman the less in a world which was none too full of them  weve all got to go some day observed mr kybird philosophically ows that cough o yours getting on nat  mr smith met the pleasantry coldly the ailment referred to was one of some standing and had been a continual source of expense in the way of balsams and other remedies  hes worried about is money he said referring to mr swann  ah we shant ave that worry said mr kybird  nobody to leave it to continued mr smith seems a bit ard dont it  praps if e ad ad somebody to leave it to e wouldnt ave ad so much to leave observed mr kybird sagely its a rum world  he shook his head over it and went on with the uncongenial task of marking down wares which had suffered by being exposed outside too long mr smith who always took an interest in the welfare of his friends made suggestions  i shouldnt put a ticket marked look at this on that coat he said severely it oughtnt to be looked at  its the best out o three all anging together said mr kybird evenly  and look ere said mr smith look what an outotheway place youve put this ticket why not put it higher up on the coat  becos the mothhole aint there said mr kybird  mr smith apologized and watched his friend without further criticism  gettin ready for the wedding i spose he said presently  mr kybird assented and his brow darkened as he spoke of surreptitious raids on his stores made by mrs kybird and daughter  their idea of a wedding he said bitterly is to dress up and make a show my idea is a few real good old pals and plenty of licker  youll ave to ave both observed nathan smith whose knowledge of the sex was pretty accurate  mr kybird nodded gloomily melia and jack dont seem to ave been itting it off partikler well lately he said slowly hes getting more uppish than wot e was when e come here first but i got im to promise that hed settle any money that e might ever get left him on melia  mr smiths inscrutable eyes glistened into something as nearly approaching a twinkle as they were capable thatll settle the five undred he said warmly are you goin to send capn nugent an invite for the wedding  theyll ave to be asked o course said mr kybird with an attempt at dignity rendered necessary by a certain lightness in his friends manner the old woman dont like the nugent lot but shell do the proper thing  o course she will said mr smith soothingly come over and ave a drink with me danl its your turn to stand     chapter xxi  gossip from one or two quarters which reached captain nugents ears through the medium of his sister concerning the preparations for his sons marriage prevented him from altering his mind with regard to the visits of jem hardy and showing that painstaking young man the door indeed the nearness of the approaching nuptials bade fair to eclipse for the time being all other grievances and when hardy paid his third visit he made a determined but ineffectual attempt to obtain from him some information as to the methods by which he hoped to attain his ends his failure made him suspicious and he hinted pretty plainly that he had no guarantee that his visitor was not obtaining admittance under false pretences  well im not getting much out of it returned hardy frankly  i wonder you come said his hospitable host  i want you to get used to me said the other  the captain started and eyed him uneasily the remark seemed fraught with hidden meaning and then he inquired raising his bushy eyebrows  then perhaps i can come oftener  the captain gave him up he sank back in his chair and crossing his legs smoked with his eyes fixed on the ceiling it was difficult to know what to do with a young man who was apparently destitute of any feelings of shame or embarrassment he bestowed a puzzled glance in his direction and saw that he was lolling in the chair with an appearance of the greatest ease and enjoyment following the direction of his eyes he saw that he was gazing with much satisfaction at a photograph of miss nugent which graced the mantelpiece with an odd sensation the captain suddenly identified it as one which usually stood on the chest of drawers in his bedroom and he wondered darkly whether charity or mischief was responsible for its appearance there  in any case it disappeared before the occasion of hardys next visit and the visitor sat with his eyes unoccupied endeavouring to make conversation with a host who was if anything more discourteous than usual it was uphill work but he persevered and in fifteen minutes had ranged unchecked from north pole explorations to poultry farming it was a relief to both of them when the door opened and bella ushered in dr murchison  the captain received the new arrival with marked cordiality and giving him a chair near his own observed with some interest the curt greeting of the young men the doctors manner indicated polite surprise at seeing the other there then he turned to the captain and began to talk to him  for some time they chatted without interruption and the captains replies when hardy at last made an attempt to make the conversation general enabled the doctor to see without much difficulty that the latter was an unwelcome guest charmed with the discovery he followed his hosts lead and with a languid air replied to his rival in monosyllables the captain watched with quiet satisfaction and at each rebuff his opinion of murchison improved it was gratifying to find that the interloper had met his match  hardy sat patient i am glad to have met you tonight he said after a long pause during which the other two were discussing a former surgical experience of the captains on one of his crew  yes said murchison  you are just the man i wanted to see  yes said the doctor again  yes said the other nodding ive been very busy of late owing to my partners illness and you are attending several people i want to hear about  indeed said murchison with a halfturn towards him  how is mrs paul inquired hardy  dead replied the other briefly  dead repeated mr hardy good heavens i didnt know that there was much the matter with her  there was no hope for her from the first said murchison somewhat sharply it was merely a question of prolonging her life a little while she lived longer than i deemed possible she surprised everybody by her vitality  poor thing said hardy how is joe banks  dead said murchison again biting his lip and eyeing him furiously  dear me said hardy shaking his head i met him not a month ago he was on his way to see you then  the poor fellow had been an invalid nearly all his life said murchison to the captain casually aye i remember him was the reply  i am almost afraid to ask you continued hardy but shut up all day i hear so little how is old miss ritherdon  murchison reddened with helpless rage captain nugent gazing at the questioner with something almost approaching respect waited breathlessly for the invariable answer  she died three weeks ago im surprised that you have not heard of it said the doctor pointedly  of course she was old said hardy with the air of one advancing extenuating circumstances  very old replied the doctor who knew that the other was now at the end of his obituary list  are there any other of my patients you are anxious to hear about  no thank you returned hardy with some haste  the doctor turned to his host again but the charm was broken his talk was disconnected owing probably to the fact that he was racking his brain for facts relative to the seamy side of shipbroking and hardy without any encouragement whatever was interrupting with puerile anecdotes concerning the late lamented joe banks the captain came to the rescue  the ladies are in the garden he said to the doctor perhaps youd like to join them  he looked coldly over at hardy as he spoke to see the effect of his words their eyes met and the young man was on his feet as soon as his rival  thanks he said coolly it is a trifle close indoors  before the dismayed captain could think of any dignified pretext to stay him he was out of the room the doctor followed and the perturbed captain left alone stared blankly at the door and thought of his daughters words concerning the thin end of the wedge  he was a proud man and loth to show discomfiture so that it was not until a quarter of an hour later that he followed his guests to the garden the four people were in couples the paths favouring that formation although the doctor to the detriment of the border had made two or three determined attempts to march in fours with a feeling akin to scorn the captain saw that he was walking with mrs kingdom while some distance in the rear jem hardy followed with kate  he stood at the back door for a little while watching hardy upright and elate was listening with profound attention to miss nugent the doctor sauntering along beside mrs kingdom was listening with a languid air to an account of her celebrated escape from measles some fortythree years before as a professional man he would have died rather than have owed his life to the specific she advocated  kate nugent catching sight of her father turned and as he came slowly towards them linked her arm in his her face was slightly flushed and her eyes sparkled  i was just coming in to fetch you she observed it is so pleasant out here now  delightful said hardy  we had to drop behind a little said miss nugent raising her voice aunt and dr murchison will talk about their complaints to each other they have been exchanging prescriptions  the captain grunted and eyed her keenly  i want you to come in and give us a little music he said shortly  kate nodded what is your favourite music mr hardy she inquired with a smile  unfortunately mr hardy cant stay said the captain in a voice which there was no mistaking  hardy pulled out his watch no i must be off he said with a wellaffected start thank you for reminding me captain nugent  i am glad to have been of service said the other looking his grimmest  he acknowledged the young mans farewell with a short nod and forgetting his sudden desire for music continued to pace up and down with his daughter  what have you been saying to thatthat fellow he demanded turning to her suddenly  miss nugent reflected i said it was a fine evening she replied at last  no doubt said her father what else  i think i asked him whether he was fond of gardening said miss nugent slowly yes im sure i did  you had no business to speak to him at all said the fuming captain  i dont quite see how i could help doing so said his daughter you surely dont expect me to be rude to your visitors besides i feel rather sorry for him  sorry repeated the captain sharply what for  because he hasnt got a nice kind softspoken father said miss nugent squeezing his arm affectionately  the appearance of the other couple at the head of the path saved the captain the necessity of a retort they stood in a little knot talking but miss nugent contrary to her usual habit said but little she was holding her fathers arm and gazing absently at the dim fields stretching away beyond the garden  at the same time mr james hardy feeling despite his bold front somewhat badly snubbed was sitting on the beach thinking over the situation after a quarter of an hour in the company of kate nugent all else seemed sordid and prosaic his own conduct in his attempt to save her brother from the consequences of his folly most sordid of all he wondered gloomily what she would think when she heard of it  he rose at last and in the pale light of the new moon walked slowly along towards the town in his present state of mind he wanted to talk about kate nugent and the only person who could be depended upon for doing that was samson wilks it was a nevertiring subject of the stewards and since his discovery of the state of hardys feelings in that quarter the slightest allusion was sufficient to let loose a flood of reminiscences  it was dark by the time hardy reached the alley and in most of the houses the lamps were lit behind drawn blinds the stewards house however was in darkness and there was no response when he tapped he turned the handle of the door and looked in a dim figure rose with a start from a chair  i hope you were not asleep said hardy  no sir said the steward in a relieved voice i thought it was somebody else  he placed a chair for his visitor and having lit the lamp slowly lowered the blind and took a seat opposite  ive been sitting in the dark to make a certain party think i was out he said slowly she keeps making a excuse about teddy to come over and see me last night e talked about making a ole in the water to celebrate melia kybirds wedding and she came over and sat in that chair and cried as if er art would break after shed gone teddy comes over fierce as a eagle and wants to know wot ive been saying to is mother to make er cry between the two of em i ave a nice life of it  he is still faithful to miss kybird then said hardy with a sudden sense of relief  faithful said mr wilks faithful aint no word for it hes a sticker thats wot e is and its my misfortune that is mother takes after im i ave to go out afore breakfast and stay out till late at night and even then like as not she catches me on the doorstep  well perhaps she will make a hole in the water suggested hardy  mr wilks smiled but almost instantly became grave again shes not that sort he said bitterly and went into the kitchen to draw some beer  he drank his in a manner which betokened that the occupation afforded him no enjoyment and full of his own troubles was in no mood to discuss anything else he gave a short biography of mrs silk which would have furnished abundant material for halfadozen libel actions and alluding to the demise of the late mr silk spoke of it as though it were the supreme act of artfulness in a somewhat adventurous career  hardy walked home with a mind more at ease than it had been at any time since his overtures to mr swann the only scruple that had troubled him was now removed and in place of it he felt that he was acting the part of a guardian angel to mr edward silk     chapter xxii  mr nathan smith usually one of the most matteroffact men in the world came out of mr swanns house in a semidazed condition and for some time after the front door had closed behind him stood gaping on the narrow pavement  he looked up and down the quiet little street and shook his head sadly it was a street of staid and substantial old houses houses which had mellowed and blackened with age but whose quaint windows and chanceopened doors afforded glimpses of comfort attesting to the prosperity of those within in the usual way mr nathan smith was of too philosophical a temperament to experience the pangs of envy but today these things affected him and he experienced a strange feeling of discontent with his lot in life  some people ave all the luck he muttered and walked slowly down the road  he continued his reflections as he walked through the somewhat squalid streets of his own quarter the afternoon was wet and the houses looked dingier than usual dirty inconvenient little places most of them with a few cheap gimcracks making a brave show as near the window as possible mr smith observed them with newly opened eyes and for perhaps the first time in his life thought of the drawbacks and struggles of the poor  in his own untidy little den at the back of the house he sat for some time deep in thought over the events of the afternoon he had been permitted a peep at wealth at wealth too which was changing hands but was not coming his way he lit his pipe and producing a bottle of rum from a cupboard helped himself liberally the potent fluid softened him somewhat and a halfformed intention to keep the news from mr kybird melted away beneath its benign influence  after all weve been pals for pretty near thirty years said mr smith to himself  he took another draught thirty years is a long time he mused  he finished the glass and if e dont give me something out of it ill do im as much arm as i can he continued and buttoning up his coat he rose and set out in the direction of the high street  the rain had ceased and the sun was making faint efforts to break through watery clouds things seemed brighter and mr smiths heart beat in response he was going to play the part of a benefactor to mr kybird to offer him access at any rate to such wealth as he had never dreamed of he paused at the shop window and observing through a gap in the merchandise that mr kybird was behind the counter walked in and saluted him  ive got news for you he said slowly big news  oh said mr kybird with indifference  big news repeated mr smith sinking thoughtlessly into the broken canechair and slowly extricating himself something thatll make your eyes start out of your ed  the small black eyes in question were turned shrewdly in his direction ive ad news of you afore nat remarked mr kybird with simple severity  the philanthropist was chilled he fixed his eyes in a stony stare on the opposite wall mr kybird who had ever a wholesome dread of falling a victim to his friends cuteness regarded him with some uncertainty and reminded him of one or two pieces of information which had seriously depleted his till  banns up yet for the wedding inquired mr smith still gazing in front of him with fathomless eyes  theyll be put up next week said mr kybird  ah said his friend with great emphasis well well  wot dye mean by well well demanded the other with some heat  i was ony thinking replied mr smith mildly praps its all for the best and id better old my tongue true love is better than money after all it aint my bisness and i shouldnt get much out of it  out of wot nat inquired mr kybird uneasily  mr smith still gazing musingly before him appeared not to hear the question nice after the rain aint it he said slowly  its all right said the other shortly  everything smells so fresh and sweet continued his natureloving friend all the little dickeybirds was asinging as if their little arts would break as i come along  i dont wonder at it said the offended mr kybird  and the banns go up next week murmured the boardingmaster to himself well well  ave you got anything to say agin it demanded mr kybird  certnly not replied the other ony dont blame me when its too late thats all  mr kybird staring at him wrathfully turned this dark saying over in his mind too late for wot he inquired  ah said nathan smith slowly nice and fresh after the rain aint it as i come along all the little dickeybirds  drat the little dickeybirds interrupted mr kybird with sudden violence if youve got anything to say why dont you say it like a man  the parlour door opened suddenly before the other could reply and revealed the face of mrs kybird wot are you two aquarrelling about she demanded why dont you come inside and sit down for a bit  mr smith accepted the invitation and following her into the room found miss kybird busy stitching in the midst of a bewildering assortment of brown paper patterns and pieces of cloth mrs kybird gave him a chair and having overheard a portion of his conversation with her husband made one or two casual inquiries  ive been spending a hour or two at mr swanns said mr smith  and ow is e inquired his hostess with an appearance of amiable interest  the boardingmaster shook his head es slipping is cable he said slowly es been making is will and i was one o the witnesses  something in mr smiths manner as he uttered this simple statement made his listeners anxious to hear more mr kybird who had just entered the room and was standing with his back to the door holding the handle regarded him expectantly  its been worrying im some time pursued mr smith e asnt got nobody belonging to im and for a long time e couldnt think ow to leave it wot with ouse property and other things its a matter of over ten thousand pounds  good eavens said mr kybird who felt that he was expected to say something  dr blaikie was the other witness continued mr smith disregarding the interruption and mr swann made us both promise to keep it a dead secret till es gone but out o friendship to you i thought id step round and let you know  the emphasis on the words was unmistakable mrs kybird dropped her work and sat staring at him while her husband wriggled with excitement  e aint left it to me i spose he said with a feeble attempt at jocularity  not a brass farden replied his friend cheerfully not to none of you why should e  he aint left it to jack i spose said miss kybird who had suspended her work to listen  no my dear replied the boardingmaster es made is will all shipshape and proper and es left everythingall that ouse property and other things amounting to over ten thousand poundsto a young man becos e was jiltcrossed in love a few months ago and becos es been a good and faithful servant to im for years  dont tell me said mr kybird desperately dont tell me that es been and left all that money to young teddy silk  well i wont if you dont want me to said the accommodating mr smith but mind its a dead secret  mr kybird wiped his brow and red patches due to excitement lent a little variety to an otherwise commonplace face mrs kybirds dazed inquiry wot are we acoming to fell on deaf ears while miss kybird leaning forward with lips parted fixed her eyes intently on mr smiths face  its a pity e didnt leave it to young nugent said that gentleman noting with much pleasure the effect of his announcement but e cant stand in at no price e told me so imself i spose young teddyll be quite the gentleman now and ell be able to marry who e likes  mr kybird thrust his handkerchief into his tailpocket and all the father awoke within him ho will e he said with fierce sarcasm ho indeed and wot about my daughter i ave eard of such things as breach o promise before mr teddy gets married es got to ave a few words with me  es behaved very bad said mrs kybird nodding  e come ere night after night said mr kybird working himself up into a fury e walked out with my gal for months and months and then e takes imself off as if we wasnt good enough forim  the suppers es ad ere you wouldnt believe said mrs kybird addressing the visitor  takes imself off repeated her husband takes imself off as if we was dirt beneath is feet and never been back to give a explanation from that day to this  im not easy surprised said mrs kybird i never was from a gal but i must say teddys been a surprise to me if anybody ad told me ed ha behaved like that i wouldnt ha believed it i couldnt ive never said much about it becos my pride wouldnt let me we all ave our faults and mine is pride  i shall bring a breach o promise action agin im for five thousand pounds said mr kybird with decision  talk sense said nathan smith shortly  sense cried mr kybird is my gal to be played fast and loose with like that is my gal to be pitched over when e likes is my gal  wots the good o talking like that to me said the indignant mr smith the best thing you can do is to get er married to teddy at once afore e knows of is luck  and whenll that be inquired his friend in a calmer voice  any time said the boardingmaster shrugging his shoulders the old gentleman might go out tonight or again e might live on for a week or more e was so weak e couldnt ardly sign is name  i ope e as signed it all right said mr kybird starting  safe as ouses said his friend  well why not wait till teddy as got the money suggested mrs kybird with a knowing shake of her head  becos said mr smith in a grating voice becos for one thing ed be a rich man then and could ave is pick teddy silk on a pound or thereabouts a week and teddy silk with ten thousand pounds ud be two different people besides that ed think she was marrying im for is money  if e thought that said mrs kybird firmly id never forgive im  my advice to you said nathan smith shaking his forefinger impressively is to get em married on the quiet and as soon as possible once theyre tied up teddy cant elp imself  why on the quiet demanded mr kybird sharply  the boardingmaster uttered an impatient exclamation becos if mr swann got to ear of it hed guess id been blabbing for one thing he said sharply and for another e left it to im partly to make up for is disappointmenthed been disappointed imself in is younger days so e told me  suppose e managed to get enough strength to alter is will  mr kybird shivered it takes time to get married though he objected  yes said mr smith ironically it does get round young teddy and then put the banns up take your time about it and be sure and let mr swann know dye think e wouldnt understand wot it meant and spoil it to say nothing of teddy seeing through it  well wots to be done then inquired the staring mr kybird  send em up to london and ave em married by special license said mr smith speaking rapidlytomorrow if possible if not the day after go and pitch a tale to teddy tonight and make im understand its to be done on the strict qt  special licenses cost money said mr kybird i ave eard its a matter o thirty pounds or thereabouts  mr nathan smith rose and his eyes were almost expressive he nodded goodnight to the ladies and crossed to the door mrs kybird suddenly seized him by the coat and held him  dont be in a urry nat she pleaded we aint all as clever as you are  talk about looking a giftorse in the mouth began the indignant mr smith  sit down urged mr kybird you cant expect us to be as quick in seeing things as wot you are  he pushed his partly mollified friend into his chair again and taking a seat next him began to view the affair with enthusiasm melia shall turn young nugent off tonight he said firmly  thats right said the other go and do a few more silly things like that and we shall be appy if youd got a ead instead of wot you ave got you wouldnt talk of giving the show away like that nobody must know or guess about anything until young teddy is married to melia and got the money  it seems something like deceitfulness said miss kybird who had been listening to the plans for her future with admirable composure  its for teddys own sake said nathan smith everybody knows es half crazy after you  i dont know that i dont like im best even without the money said miss kybird calmly nobody could ave been more attentive than im i believe that ed marry me if e ad a hundred thousand but it looks better your way  better all round said nathan smith with at approving nod now danl op round to teddy and whistle im back and mind es to keep it a dead secret on account o trouble with young nugent dye twig  the admiring mr kybird said that he was a wonder and in the discussion on ways and means which followed sat listening with growing respect to the managing abilities both of his friend and his wife difficulties were only mentioned for the purpose of being satisfactorily solved and he noticed with keen appreciation that the prospect of a ten thousand pound soninlaw was already adding to that ladys dignity she sniffed haughtily as she spoke of that nugent lot and the manner in which she promised mr smith that he should not lose by his services would have graced a duchess  i didnt expect to lose by it said the boardingmaster pointedly come over and ave a glass at the chequers dan and then you can go along and see teddy     chapter xxiii  the summer evening was well advanced when mr kybird and his old friend parted the former gentleman was in almost a sentimental mood and the boardingmaster satisfied that his pupil was in a particularly appropriate frame of mind for the object of his visit renewed his instructions about binding mr silk to secrecy and departed on business of his own  mr kybird walked slowly towards fullalove alley with his head sunk in meditation he was anxious to find mr silk alone as otherwise the difficulty of his errand would be considerably increased mrs silks intelligence being by no means obscured by any ungovernable affection for the kybird family if she was at home he would have to invent some pretext for luring teddy into the privacy of the open air  the lamp was lit in the front room by the time he reached the house and the shadows of geraniums which had won through several winters formed a straggling pattern on the holland blind mr kybird first making an unsuccessful attempt to peep round the edges of this decoration tapped gently on the door and in response to a command to come in turned the handle and looked into the room to his relief he saw that mr silk was alone  good evening teddy he said with a genial smile as he entered slowly and closed the door behind him i ope i see you well  im quite well returned mr silk gazing at him with unconcealed surprise  im glad to ear it said mr kybird in a somewhat reproachful voice for your sake for everybodys sake though praps i did expect to find you looking a little bit down ah its the wimmen that ave the arts after all  mr silk coughed what dye mean he inquired somewhat puzzled  i came to see you teddy on a very delikit business said mr kybird taking a seat and gazing diffidently at his hat as he swung it between his hands though as man to man im ony doing of my dooty but if you dont want to ear wot ive got to say say so and danl kybirdll darken your door no more  how can i know whether i want to ear it or not when i dont know wot it is said mr silk judiciously  mr kybird sat biting his thumbnail then he looked up suddenly melia he said with an outburst of desperate frankness melia is crying er eyes out  mr silk with a smothered exclamation started up from his chair and regarded him eagerly  if she knew id been ere pursued mr kybird shed i dont know wot she wouldnt do thats er pride but ive got my pride too the pride of a fathers art  whatwhats she crying about inquired mr silk in an unsteady voice  shes been looking poorly for some time continued the veracious mr kybird and crying when i tell you that part o the weddingdress wot she was making ad to be taken away from er because o the tears she dropped on it you may ave some idea of wot things are like shes never forgot you teddy and it was ony your quick temper that day that made er take on with young nugent shes got a temper too but she give er love once and being my daughter she couldnt give it agin  he stole a glance at his listener mr silk very pale and upright was standing on the hearthrug shaking all over with nervous excitement twice he tried to speak and failed  thats ow it is teddy sighed mr kybird rising as though to depart ive done my dooty it was a ard thing to do but ive done it  do you mean said mr silk recovering his voice at last do you mean that amelia would marry me after all  do i mean repeated mr kybird naturally indignant that his very plain speaking should be deemed capable of any misconstruction am i speaking to a stock or a stone teddy  mr silk took a deep breath and buttoned up his coat as though preparing to meet mr nugent there and then in deadly encounter for the person of miss kybird the colour was back in his cheeks by this time and his eyes were unusually bright he took a step towards mr kybird and pressing his hand warmly pushed him back into his seat again  theres er pride to consider teddy said the latter gentleman with the whisper of a conspirator  she cant stand being talked about all over the town and pointed at  let me see anybody apointing at er said the truculent mr silk let me see em thats all  thats the way to talk teddy said mr kybird gazing at him with admiration  talk said the heroic mr silk ill do more than talk he clenched his fists and paced boldly up and down the hearthrug  you leave things to me said mr kybird with a confidential wink ill see that its all right all i ask of you is to keep it a dead secret even your mother mustnt know  ill be as secret as the grave said the overjoyed mr silk  theres lots o things to be taken into consideration said mr kybird truthfully it might be as well for you to be married immediate  immediate said the astonished mr silk  she asnt got the nerve to send young nugent about is business explained mr kybird she feels sorry for im pore fellow but es got a loving and affectionate art and she cant bear im making love to er you can understand what it is cant you  i can imagine it said mr silk gloomily and he flushed crimson as the possibilities suggested by the remark occurred to him  ive been thinking it over for some time resumed mr kybird twisting it and turning it all ways and the only thing i can see for it is for you to be married on the strict qt of course if you dont like  like repeated the transported mr silk  ill go and be married now if you like  mr kybird shook his head at such haste and then softening a little observed that it did him credit he proceeded to improve the occasion by anecdotes of his own courting some thirty years before and was in the middle of a thrilling account of the manner in which he had bearded the whole of his future wifes family when a quick step outside which paused at the door brought him to a sudden halt  mother announced mr silk in a whisper  mr kybird nodded and the heroic appearance of visage which had accompanied his tale gave way to an expression of some uneasiness he coughed behind his hand and sat gazing before him as mrs silk entered the room and gave vent to an exclamation of astonishment as she saw the visitor she gazed sharply from him to her son mr kybirds expression was now normal but despite his utmost efforts mr silk could not entirely banish the smile which trembled on his lips  me and teddy said mr kybird turning to her with a little bob which served him for a bow ave just been having a little talk about old times  he was just passing said mr silk  just passing and thought id look in said mr kybird with a careless little laugh the door was open a bit  wide open corroborated mr silk  so i just came in to say ow dye do said mr kybird  mrs silks sharp white face turned from one to the other ave you said it she inquired blandly  i ave said mr kybird restraining mr silks evident intention of hot speech by a warning glance and now ill just toddle off ome  ill go a bit o the way with you said edward silk i feel as if a bit of a walk would do me good  left alone the astonished mrs silk took the visitors vacated chair and with wrinkled brow sat putting two and two together until the sum got beyond her powers of calculation mr kybirds affability and teddys cheerfulness were alike incomprehensible she mended a hole in her pocket and darned a pair of socks and at last anxious for advice or at least a confidant resolved to see mr wilks  she opened the door and looked across the alley and saw with some satisfaction that his blind was illuminated she closed the door behind her sharply and then stood gasping on the doorstep so simultaneous were the two happenings that it actually appeared as though the closing of the door had blown mr wilkss lamp out it was a night of surprises but after a moments hesitation she stepped over and tried his door it was fast and there was no answer to her knuckling she knocked louder and listened a door slammed violently at the back of the house a distant clatter of what sounded like saucepans came from beyond and above it all a tremulous but harsh voice bellowed industriously through an interminable chant by the time the third verse was reached mr wilkss neighbours on both sides were beating madly upon their walls and bloodcurdling threats strained through the plaster  she stayed no longer but regaining her own door sat down again to await the return of her son mr silk was long in coming and she tried in vain to occupy herself with various small jobs as she speculated in vain on the meaning of the events of the night she got up and stood by the open door and as she waited the clock in the churchtower which rose over the roofs hard by slowly boomed out the hour of eleven as the echoes of the last stroke died away the figure of mr silk turned into the alley  you must ave ad quite a nice walk said his mother as she drew back into the room and noted the brightness of his eye  yes was the reply  i spose es been and asked you to the wedding said the sarcastic mrs silk  her son started and turning his back on her wound up the clock yes e has he said with a sly grin  mrs silks eyes snapped well of all the impudence she said breathlessly  well e has said her son hugging himself over the joke and whats more im going  he composed his face sufficiently to bid her goodnight and turning a deaf ear to her remonstrances and inquiries took up a candle and went off whistling     chapter xxiv  the idea in the mind of mr james hardy when he concocted his infamous plot was that jack nugent would be summarily dismissed on some pretext by miss kybird and that steps would at once be taken by her family to publish her banns together with those of mr silk in thinking thus he had made no allowance for the workings and fears of such a capable mind as nathan smiths and as days passed and nothing happened he became a prey to despair  he watched mr silk keenly but that gentleman went about his work in his usual quiet and gloomy fashion and after a days leave for the purpose of arranging the affairs of a sick aunt in camberwell came back only a little less gloomy than before it was also clear that mr swanns complaisance was nearly at an end and a letter couched in vigorous not to say regrettable terms for a moribund man expressed such a desire for fresh air and exercise that hardy was prepared to see him at any moment  it was the more unfortunate as he thought that he had of late detected a slight softening in captain nugents manner towards him on two occasions the captain who was out when he called had made no comment to find upon his return that the visitor was being entertained by his daughter going so far indeed as to permit the conversation to gain vastly in interest by that young person remaining in the room in face of this improvement he thought with dismay of having to confess failure in a scheme which apart from success was inexcusable  the captain had also unbent in another direction and mr wilks to his great satisfaction was allowed to renew his visits to equator lodge and assist his old master in the garden here at least the steward was safe from the designs of mrs silk and the innuendoes of fullalove alley  it was at this time too that the widow stood in most need of his advice the behaviour of edward silk being of a nature to cause misgivings in any mothers heart a strange restlessness possessed him varied with occasional outbursts of hilarity and good nature dark hints emanated from him at these times concerning a surprise in store for her at no distant date hints which were at once explained away in a most unsatisfactory manner when she became too pressing in her inquiries he haunted the high street and when the suspicious mrs silk spoke of amelia he only laughed and waxed humorous over such unlikely subjects as broken hearts and broken vows  it was a week after mr kybirds visit to the alley that he went as usual for a stroll up and down the high street the evening was deepening and some of the shops had already lit up as mr silk with his face against the windowpane tried in vain to penetrate the obscurity of mr kybirds shop he could just make out a dim figure behind the counter which he believed to be amelia when a match was struck and a gas jet threw a sudden light in the shop and revealed mr jack nugent standing behind the counter with his hand on the ladys shoulder  one glance was sufficient the next moment there was a sharp cry from miss kybird and a bewildered stare from nugent as something only comparable to a human cracker bounced into the shop and commenced to explode before them  take your and off raved mr silk leave er alone ow dare you dye hear me melia i wont ave it i wont ave it  dont be silly teddy remonstrated mr nugent following up miss kybird as she edged away from him  leave er alone dye ear yelled mr silk thumping the counter with his small fist shes my wife  teddys mad said mr nugent calmly stark staring raving mad poor teddy  he shook his head sadly and had just begun to recommend a few remedies when the parlour door opened and the figure of mr kybird with his wife standing close behind him appeared in the doorway  whos making all this noise demanded the former looking from one to the other  i am said mr silk fiercely its no use your winking at me im not going to ave any more of this nonsense melia you go and get your at on and come straight off ome with me  mr kybird gave a warning cough go easy teddy he murmured  and dont you cough at me said the irritated mr silk because it wont do no good  mr kybird subsided he was not going to quarrel with a soninlaw who might at any moment be worth ten thousand pounds  isnt he mad inquired the amazed mr nugent  certnly not replied mr kybird moving aside to let his daughter pass no madder than you are wot dye mean mad  mr nugent looked round in perplexity do you mean to tell me that teddy and amelia are married he said in a voice trembling with eagerness  i do said mr kybird it seems theyve been fond of one another all along and they went up all unbeknown last friday and got a license and got married  and if i see you putting your and on er shoulder agin said mr silk with alarming vagueness  but suppose she asks me to said the delighted mr nugent with much gravity  look ere we dont want none o your nonsense broke in the irate mrs kybird pushing her way past her husband and confronting the speaker  ive been deceived said mr nugent in a thrilling voice youve all been deceiving me kybird i blush for you that will save you a lot of trouble teddy i wouldnt have believed it of you i cant stay here my heart is broken  well we dont want you to retorted the aggressive mrs kybird you can take yourself off as soon as ever you like you cant be too quick to please me  mr nugent bowed and walked past the counter and not even a bit of weddingcake for me he said shaking a reproachful head at the heated mr silk why id put you down first on my list  he paused at the door and after a brief intimation that he would send for his effects on the following day provided that his broken heart had not proved fatal in the meantime waved his hand to the company and departed mr kybird followed him to the door as though to see him off the premises and gazing after the receding figure swelled with indignation as he noticed that he favoured a mode of progression which was something between a walk and a hornpipe  mr nugent had not been in such spirits since his return to sunwich and hardly able to believe in his good fortune he walked on in a state of growing excitement until he was clear of the town then he stopped to consider his next move and after a little deliberation resolved to pay a visit to jem hardy and acquaint him with the joyful tidings  that gentleman however was out and mr nugent somewhat irritated at such thoughtlessness stood in the road wondering where to go next it was absolutely impossible for him to sleep that night without telling the good news to somebody and after some thought he selected mr wilks it was true that relations had been somewhat strained between them since the latters attempt at crimping him but he was never one to bear malice and tonight he was full of the kindliest thoughts to all mankind  he burst into mr wilkss front room suddenly and then pulled up short the steward with a pitiable look of anxiety on his pallid features was leaning awkwardly against the mantelpiece and opposite him mrs silk sat in an easychair dissolved in tears  busy sam inquired mr nugent who had heard of the stewards difficulties from hardy  no sir said mr wilks hastily sit down sir  he pushed forward a chair and almost pulling his visitor into it stood over him attentively and took his hat  are you quite sure im not interrupting you inquired the thoughtful mr nugent  certain sure sir said mr wilks eagerly i was just aving a bit of a chat with my neighbour mrs silk ere thats all  the lady in question removed her handkerchief from her eyes and gazed at him with reproachful tenderness mr wilks plunged hastily into conversation  she came over ere to tell me a bit o news he said eyeing the young man doubtfully it seems that teddy  mr nugent fetched a mighty sigh and shook his head mrs silk gazed at him earnestly  life is full of surprises sir she remarked  and sadness added mr nugent i hope that they will be happy  it struck me all of a eap said mrs silk rolling her handkerchief into a ball and placing it in her lap i was doing a bit of ironing when in walks teddy with amelia kybird and says they was married last friday i was that shaken i didnt know what i did or what i said then i came over as soon as i could because i thought mr wilks ought to know about it  mr wilks cleared his throat and turned an agonized eye on mr nugent he would have liked to have asked why mrs silk should think it necessary to inform him but the fear of precipitating a crisis stayed his tongue  what im to do i dont know continued mrs silk feebly you cant ave two queens in one ouse so to speak  but she was walking out with teddy long ago urged mr wilks its no worse now than then  but i wouldnt be married by license said mrs silk deftly ignoring the remark if i cant be asked in church in the proper way i wont be married at all  quite right said mr nugent theres something so sudden about a license he added with feeling  me and mr wilks was talking about marriage only the other day pursued mrs silk with a bashfulness which set every nerve in the stewards body quivering and we both agreed that banns was the proper way  you was talking about it corrected mr wilks in a hoarse voice you brought up the subject and i agreed with younot that it matters to me ow people get married thats their affair banns or license its all one to me  i wont be married by license said mrs silk with sudden petulance leastways id rather not be she added softening  mr wilks took his handkerchief from his pocket and blew his nose violently mrs silks methods of attack left him little opportunity for the plain speaking which was necessary to dispel illusions he turned a watery appealing eye on to mr nugent and saw to his surprise that that gentleman was winking at him with great significance and persistence it would have needed a heart of stone to have been unaffected by such misery and tonight mr nugent thankful for his own escape was in a singularly merciful mood  all this sounds as though you are going to be married he said turning to mrs silk with a polite smile  the widow simpered and looked down thereby affording mr nugent an opportunity of another signal to the perturbed steward who sat with such a look of anxiety on his face lest he should miss his cue that the young mans composure was tried to the utmost  its been a understood thing for a long time she said slowly but i couldnt leave my son while e was single and nobody to look after im a good mother makes a good wife so they say a woman cant always ave er own way in everything and if its not to be by banns then by license it must be i suppose  well hell be a fortunate man whoever he is said mr nugent with another warning glance at mr wilks and i only hope that hell make a better husband than you do sam he added in a low but severe voice  mrs silk gave a violent start better husband than e does she cried sharply mr wilks aint married  mr nugents baseless charge took the steward all aback he stiffened in his chair a picture of consternation and guilt appeared stamped on every feature but he had the presence of mind to look to mr nugents eye for guidance and sufficient strength of character to accept this last bid for liberty  thats my business sir he quavered in offended tones  but you aint married screamed mrs silk  never mind said nugent pacifically perhaps i ought not to have mentioned it its a sore subject with sam and i daresay there were faults on both sides werent there sam  yes sir said mr wilks in a voice which he strove hard to make distinct especially ers  youyou never told me you were married said mrs silk breathlessly  i never said i wasnt retorted the culprit defiantly if people liked to think i was a single man i dont care its got nothing to do with them besides she lives at stepney and i dont ear from er once in six months she dont interfere with me and i dont interfere with her  mrs silk got up from her chair and stood confronting him with her hand grasping the back of it her cold eyes gleamed and her face worked with spite as she tried in vain to catch his eye of mr nugent and his ingenuous surprise at her behaviour she took no notice at all  youre a deceiver she gasped youve been behaving like a single man and everybody thought you was a single man  i hope you havent been paying attentions to anybody sam said mr nugent in a shocked voice  aah said mrs silk shivering with anger ask im the deceiving villain ask anybody and see what theyll tell you oh you wicked man i wonder you can look me in the face  truth to tell mr wilks was looking in any direction but hers his eyes met nugents but there was a look of such stern disdain on that gentlemans face that he was fain to look away again  was it a friend of yours inquired the artless mr nugent  never mind said mrs silk recovering herself never mind who it was you wait till i go and tell teddy she continued turning to the trembling mr wilks if es got the art of a man in im youll see  with this dire threat and turning occasionally to bestow another fierce glance upon the steward she walked to the door and opening it to its full extent closed it behind her with a crash and darted across the alley to her own house the two men gazed at each other without speaking and then mr wilks stepping over to the door turned the key in the lock  youre not afraid of teddy said the staring nugent  teddy said mr wilks snapping his huge fingers im not afraid o fifty teddies but she might come back with im if it adnt ha been for you sir i dont know wot wouldnt ave happened  go and draw some beer and get me a clean pipe said nugent dropping into a chair weve both been mercifully preserved sam and the best thing we can do is to drink to our noble selves and be more careful for the future  mr wilks obeyed and again thanking him warmly for his invaluable services sat down to compile a few facts about his newly acquired wife warranted to stand the severest crossexamination which might be brought to bear upon them a task interspersed with malicious reminiscences of mrs silks attacks on his liberty he also insisted on giving up his bed to nugent for the night  i suppose he said later on as mr nugent after a faint objection or two took his candlei suppose this yarn about my being married will get about  i suppose so said nugent yawning as he paused with his foot on the stair what about it  nothing said mr wilks in a somewhat dissatisfied voice nothing  what about it repeated mr nugent sternly  nothing sir said mr wilks with an insufferable simper nothing only itll make things a little bit slow for me thats all  mr nugent eyed him for a space in speechless amazement and then with a few strong remarks on ingratitude and senile vanity mounted the winding little stairs and went to bed     chapter xxv  the day after mr silks sudden and unexpected assertion of his marital rights mr kybird stood in the doorway of his shop basking in the sun the high street was in a state of postprandial repose and there was no likelihood of a customer to interfere with his confidential chat with mr nathan smith who was listening with an aspect of great severity to his explanations  it ought not to ave happened he said sharply it was teddy done it said mr kybird humbly  mr smith shrugged his shoulders it wouldnt ave happened if id been there he observed arrogantly  i dont see ow began mr kybird  no o course you dont said his friend still its no use making a fuss now the thing is done one thing is i dont suppose itll make any diff  difference suggested mr kybird after waiting for him to finish  difference said mr smith with an obvious effort his face had lost its scornful expression and given way to one almost sheepish in its mildness mr kybird staring at him in some surprise even thought that he detected a faint shade of pink  we aint all as clever as wot you are nat he said somewhat taken aback at this phenomenon it wouldnt do  mr smith made a strange noise in his throat and turned on him sharply mr kybird still staring in surprise at his unwonted behaviour drew back a little and then his lips parted and his eyes grew round as he saw the cause of his friends concern an elderly gentleman with a neatly trimmed white beard and a yellow rose in his buttonhole was just passing on the other side of the road his tread was elastic his figure as upright as a boys and he swung a light cane in his hand as he walked as mr kybird gazed he bestowed a brisk nod upon the bewildered mr smith and crossed the road with the evident intention of speaking to him  how do smith he said in a kindly voice  the boardingmaster leaned against the shopwindow and regarded him dumbly there was a twinkle in the shipbrokers eyes which irritated him almost beyond endurance and in the doorway mr kybirdhis face mottled with the intensity of his emotionsstood an unwelcome and frantic witness of his shame  youre not well smith said mr swann shaking his head at him gently you look like a man who has been doing too much brainwork lately youve been getting the better of somebody i know  mr smith gasped and eyeing him wickedly strove hard to recover his selfpossession  im all right sir he said in a thin voice im glad to see youre looking a trifle better sir  oh im quite right now said the other with a genial smile at the fermenting mr kybird im as well as ever i was illness is a serious thing smith but it is not without its little amusements  mr smith scratching his smoothshaven chin and staring blankly in front of him said that he was glad to hear it  ive had a long bout of it continued the shipbroker longer than i intended at first by the way smith youve never spoken to anybody of that business of course  of course not sir said the boardingmaster grinding his teeth  one has fancies when one is ill said mr swann in low tones as his eye dwelt with pleasure on the strained features of mr kybird i burnt the document five minutes after you had gone  did you reely said mr smith mechanically  im glad it was only you and the doctor that saw my foolishness continued the other still in a low voice other people might have talked but i knew that you were a reliable man smith and you wont talk about it in the future im quite certain of that good afternoon  mr smith managed to say good afternoon and stood watching the receding figure as though it belonged to a species hitherto unknown to him then he turned in obedience to a passionate tug at his coat sleeve from mr kybird  wot ave you got to say for yourself demanded that injured person in tones of suppressed passion wot do you mean by it youve made a pretty mess of it with your cleverness  wonderful old gentleman aint he said the discomfited mr smith fancy im getting the better o me fancy me being ad i took it all in as innercent as you please  ah youre a clever fellow you are said mr kybird bitterly eres amelia lost young nugent and is five undred all through you its a gotup thing between old swann and the nugent lot thats wot it is  looks like it admitted mr smith but fancy is picking me out for is games thats wot gets over me  wot about all that money i paid for the license demanded mr kybird in a threatening manner wot are you going to do about it  you shall ave it said the boardingmaster with sudden blandness and melia shall ave er five undred  ow inquired the other staring  its as easy as easy said mr smith who had been greatly galled by his friends manner ill leave it in my will thats the cheapest way o giving money i know of and while im about it ill leave you a decent pair o trousers and a shirt with your own name on it  while an ancient friendship was thus being dissolved mr adolphus swann was on the way to his office he could never remember such a pleasant air from the water and such a vivid enjoyment in the sight of the workaday world he gazed with delight at the crowd of miscellaneous shipping in the harbour and the bustling figures on the quay only pausing occasionally to answer anxious inquiries concerning his health from seafaring men in tarry trousers who had waylaid him with great pains from a distance  he reached his office at last and having acknowledged the respectful greetings of mr silk passed into the private room and celebrated his return to work by at once arranging with his partner for a substantial rise in the wages of that useful individual  my conscience is troubling me he declared as he hung up his hat and gazed round the room with much relish  silk is happy enough said hardy it is the best thing that could have happened to him  i should like to raise everybodys wages said the benevolent mr swann as he seated himself at his desk everything is like a holiday to me after being cooped up in that bedroom but the rest has done me a lot of good so blaikie says and now what is going to happen to you  hardy shook his head  strike while the iron is hot said the shipbroker go and see captain nugent before he has got used to the situation and you can give him to understand if you like only be careful how you do it that i have got something in view which may suit his son if you fail in this affair after all ive done for you ill enter the lists myself  the advice was good but unnecessary mr hardy having already fixed on that evening as a suitable opportunity to disclose to the captain the nature of the efforts he had been making on his behalf the success which had attended them had put him into a highly optimistic mood and he set off for equator lodge with the confident feeling that he had to say the least of it improved his footing there  captain nugent called away from his labours in the garden greeted his visitor in his customary short manner as he entered the room if youve come to tell me about this marriage ive heard of it he said bluntly murchison told me this afternoon  he didnt tell you how it was brought about i suppose said hardy  the captain shook his head i didnt ask him he said with affected indifference and sat gazing out at the window as hardy began his narration two or three times he thought he saw signs of appreciation in his listeners face but the mouth under the heavy moustache was firm and the eyes steady only when he related swanns interview with nathan smith and kybird did the captains features relax he gave a chuckling cough and feeling for his handkerchief blew his nose violently then with a strange gleam in his eye he turned to the young man opposite  very smart he said shortly  it was successful said the other modestly  very said the captain as he rose and confronted him i am much obliged of course for the trouble you have taken in the affairs of my family and now i will remind you of our agreement  agreement repeated the other  the captain nodded your visits to me were to cease when this marriage happened if i wished it he said slowly  that was the arrangement said the dumbfounded hardy but i had hoped besides it has all taken place much sooner than i had anticipated  that was the bargain said the captain stiffly and now ill bid you goodday  i am sorry that my presence should be so distasteful to you said the mortified hardy  distasteful sir said the captain sternly you have forced yourself on me for twice a week for some time past you have insisted upon talking on every subject under the sun whether i liked it or not you have taken every opportunity of evading my wishes that you should not see my daughter and you wonder that i object to you for absolute brazenness you beat anything i have ever encountered  i am sorry said hardy again  good evening said the captain  good evening  crestfallen and angry hardy moved to the door pausing with his hand on it as the captain spoke again  one word more said the older man gazing at him oddly as he stroked his grey beard if ever you try to come bothering me with your talk again ill forbid you the house  forbid me the house repeated the astonished hardy  thats what i said replied the other thats plain english isnt it  hardy looked at him in bewilderment then as the captains meaning dawned upon him he stepped forward impulsively and seizing his hand began to stammer out incoherent thanks  youd better clear before i alter my mind said captain nugent roughly ive had more than enough of you try the garden if you like  he took up a paper from the table and resumed his seat not without a grim smile at the promptitude with which the other obeyed his instructions  miss nugent reclining in a deckchair at the bottom of the garden looked up as she heard hardys footstep on the gravel it was a surprising thing to see him walking down the garden it was still more surprising to observe the brightness of his eye and the easy confidence of his bearing it was evident that he was highly pleased with himself and she was not satisfied until she had ascertained the reason then she sat silent reflecting bitterly on the clumsy frankness of the male sex in general and fathers in particular a recent conversation with the captain in which she had put in a casual word or two in hardys favour was suddenly invested with a new significance  i shall never be able to repay your father for his kindness said hardy meaningly as he took a chair near her  i expect he was pleased at this marriage said miss nugent coldly how did it happen  mr hardy shifted uneasily in his chair there isnt much to tell he said reluctantly and youyou might not approve of the means by which the end was gained  still i want to hear about it said miss nugent  for the second time that evening hardy told his story it seemed more discreditable each time he told it and he scanned the girls face anxiously as he proceeded but like her father she sat still and made no comment until he had finished then she expressed a strong feeling of gratitude that the nugent family had not been mixed up in it  why inquired hardy bluntly  i dont think it was a very nice thing to do said miss nugent with a superior air  it wouldnt have been a very nice thing for you if your brother had married miss kybird said the indignant jem and you said if you remember that you didnt mind what i did  i dont said miss nugent noticing with pleasure that the confident air of a few minutes ago had quite disappeared  you think i have been behaving badly pursued hardy  i would rather not say what i think replied miss nugent loftily i have no doubt you meant well and i should be sorry to hurt your feelings  thank you said hardy and sat gloomily gazing about him for some time neither of them spoke  where is jack now inquired the girl at last he is staying with me for a few days said hardy i sincerely hope that the association will not be injurious to him  are you trying to be rude to me inquired miss nugent raising her clear eyes to his  i am sorry said hardy hastily you are quite right of course it was not a nice thing to do but i would do a thousand times worse to please you  miss nugent thanked him warmly he seemed to understand her so well she said  i mean said hardy leaning forward and speaking with a vehemence which made the girl instinctively avert her headi mean that to please you would be the greatest happiness i could know i love you  miss nugent sat silent and a strong sense of the monstrous unfairness of such a sudden attack possessed her such a declaration she felt ought to have been led up to by numerous delicate gradations of speech each a little more daring than the last but none so daring that they could not have been checked at any time by the exercise of a little firmness  if you would do anything to please me she said at length in a low voice and without turning her head would you promise never to try and see me or speak to me again if i asked you  no said hardy promptly  miss nugent sat silent again she knew that a good woman should be sorry for a man in such extremity and should endeavour to spare his feelings by softening her refusal as much as possible little as he might deserve such consideration but man is impatient and jumps at conclusions before she was halfway through the first sentence he leaned forward and took her hand  oh goodbye she said turning to him with a pleasant smile  i am not going said hardy quietly i am never going he added as he took her other hand  captain nugent anxious for his supper found them there still debating the point some two hours later kate nugent relieved at the appearance of her natural protector clung to him with unusual warmth then in a kindly hospitable fashion she placed her other arm in that of hardy and they walked in grave silence to the house  the end
