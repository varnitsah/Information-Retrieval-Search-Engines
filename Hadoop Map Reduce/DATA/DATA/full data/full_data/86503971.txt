a little and very grimylooking shop near seven dials over which in weatherworn yellow lettering the name of c cave naturalist and dealer in antiquities was inscribed the contents of its window were curiously variegated they comprised some elephant tusks and an imperfect set of chessmen beads and weapons a box of eyes two skulls of tigers and one human several motheaten stuffed monkeys one holding a lamp an oldfashioned cabinet a flyblown ostrich egg or so some fishingtackle and an extraordinarily dirty empty glass fishtank there was also at the moment the story begins a mass of crystal worked into the shape of an egg and brilliantly polished and at that two people who stood outside the window were looking one of them a tall thin clergyman the other a blackbearded young man of dusky complexion and unobtrusive costume the dusky young man spoke with eager gesticulation and seemed anxious for his companion to purchase the article  while they were there mr cave came into his shop his beard still wagging with the bread and butter of his tea when he saw these men and the object of their regard his countenance fell he glanced guiltily over his shoulder and softly shut the door he was a little old man with pale face and peculiar watery blue eyes his hair was a dirty grey and he wore a shabby blue frock coat an ancient silk hat and carpet slippers very much down at heel he remained watching the two men as they talked the clergyman went deep into his trouser pocket examined a handful of money and showed his teeth in an agreeable smile mr cave seemed still more depressed when they came into the shop  the clergyman without any ceremony asked the price of the crystal egg mr cave glanced nervously towards the door leading into the parlour and said five pounds the clergyman protested that the price was high to his companion as well as to mr caveit was indeed very much more than mr cave had intended to ask when he had stocked the articleand an attempt at bargaining ensued mr cave stepped to the shopdoor and held it open five pounds is my price he said as though he wished to save himself the trouble of unprofitable discussion as he did so the upper portion of a womans face appeared above the blind in the glass upper panel of the door leading into the parlour and stared curiously at the two customers five pounds is my price said mr cave with a quiver in his voice  the swarthy young man had so far remained a spectator watching cave keenly now he spoke give him five pounds he said the clergyman glanced at him to see if he were in earnest and when he looked at mr cave again he saw that the latters face was white its a lot of money said the clergyman and diving into his pocket began counting his resources he had little more than thirty shillings and he appealed to his companion with whom he seemed to be on terms of considerable intimacy this gave mr cave an opportunity of collecting his thoughts and he began to explain in an agitated manner that the crystal was not as a matter of fact entirely free for sale his two customers were naturally surprised at this and inquired why he had not thought of that before he began to bargain mr cave became confused but he stuck to his story that the crystal was not in the market that afternoon that a probable purchaser of it had already appeared the two treating this as an attempt to raise the price still further made as if they would leave the shop but at this point the parlour door opened and the owner of the dark fringe and the little eyes appeared  she was a coarsefeatured corpulent woman younger and very much larger than mr cave she walked heavily and her face was flushed that crystal is for sale she said and five pounds is a good enough price for it i cant think what youre about cave not to take the gentlemans offer  mr cave greatly perturbed by the irruption looked angrily at her over the rims of his spectacles and without excessive assurance asserted his right to manage his business in his own way an altercation began the two customers watched the scene with interest and some amusement occasionally assisting mrs cave with suggestions mr cave hard driven persisted in a confused and impossible story of an enquiry for the crystal that morning and his agitation became painful but he stuck to his point with extraordinary persistence it was the young oriental who ended this curious controversy he proposed that they should call again in the course of two daysso as to give the alleged enquirer a fair chance and then we must insist said the clergyman five pounds mrs cave took it on herself to apologise for her husband explaining that he was sometimes a little odd and as the two customers left the couple prepared for a free discussion of the incident in all its bearings  mrs cave talked to her husband with singular directness the poor little man quivering with emotion muddled himself between his stories maintaining on the one hand that he had another customer in view and on the other asserting that the crystal was honestly worth ten guineas why did you ask five pounds said his wife do let me manage my business my own way said mr cave  mr cave had living with him a stepdaughter and a stepson and at supper that night the transaction was rediscussed none of them had a high opinion of mr caves business methods and this action seemed a culminating folly  its my opinion hes refused that crystal before said the stepson a looselimbed lout of eighteen  but five pounds said the stepdaughter an argumentative young woman of sixandtwenty  mr caves answers were wretched he could only mumble weak assertions that he knew his own business best they drove him from his halfeaten supper into the shop to close it for the night his ears aflame and tears of vexation behind his spectacles why had he left the crystal in the window so long the folly of it that was the trouble closest in his mind for a time he could see no way of evading sale  after supper his stepdaughter and stepson smartened themselves up and went out and his wife retired upstairs to reflect upon the business aspects of the crystal over a little sugar and lemon and so forth in hot water mr cave went into the shop and stayed there until late ostensibly to make ornamental rockeries for goldfish cases but really for a private purpose that will be better explained later the next day mrs cave found that the crystal had been removed from the window and was lying behind some secondhand books on angling she replaced it in a conspicuous position but she did not argue further about it as a nervous headache disinclined her from debate mr cave was always disinclined the day passed disagreeably mr cave was if anything more absentminded than usual and uncommonly irritable withal in the afternoon when his wife was taking her customary sleep he removed the crystal from the window again  the next day mr cave had to deliver a consignment of dogfish at one of the hospital schools where they were needed for dissection in his absence mrs caves mind reverted to the topic of the crystal and the methods of expenditure suitable to a windfall of five pounds she had already devised some very agreeable expedients among others a dress of green silk for herself and a trip to richmond when a jangling of the front door bell summoned her into the shop the customer was an examination coach who came to complain of the nondelivery of certain frogs asked for the previous day mrs cave did not approve of this particular branch of mr caves business and the gentleman who had called in a somewhat aggressive mood retired after a brief exchange of wordsentirely civil so far as he was concerned mrs caves eye then naturally turned to the window for the sight of the crystal was an assurance of the five pounds and of her dreams what was her surprise to find it gone  she went to the place behind the locker on the counter where she had discovered it the day before it was not there and she immediately began an eager search about the shop  when mr cave returned from his business with the dogfish about a quarter to two in the afternoon he found the shop in some confusion and his wife extremely exasperated and on her knees behind the counter routing among his taxidermic material her face came up hot and angry over the counter as the jangling bell announced his return and she forthwith accused him of hiding it  hid what asked mr cave  the crystal  at that mr cave apparently much surprised rushed to the window isnt it here he said great heavens what has become of it  just then mr caves stepson reentered the shop from the inner roomhe had come home a minute or so before mr caveand he was blaspheming freely he was apprenticed to a secondhand furniture dealer down the road but he had his meals at home and he was naturally annoyed to find no dinner ready  but when he heard of the loss of the crystal he forgot his meal and his anger was diverted from his mother to his stepfather their first idea of course was that he had hidden it but mr cave stoutly denied all knowledge of its fatefreely offering his bedabbled affidavit in the matterand at last was worked up to the point of accusing first his wife and then his stepson of having taken it with a view to a private sale so began an exceedingly acrimonious and emotional discussion which ended for mrs cave in a peculiar nervous condition midway between hysterics and amuck and caused the stepson to be halfanhour late at the furniture establishment in the afternoon mr cave took refuge from his wifes emotions in the shop  in the evening the matter was resumed with less passion and in a judicial spirit under the presidency of the stepdaughter the supper passed unhappily and culminated in a painful scene mr cave gave way at last to extreme exasperation and went out banging the front door violently the rest of the family having discussed him with the freedom his absence warranted hunted the house from garret to cellar hoping to light upon the crystal  the next day the two customers called again they were received by mrs cave almost in tears it transpired that no one could imagine all that she had stood from cave at various times in her married pilgrimage she also gave a garbled account of the disappearance the clergyman and the oriental laughed silently at one another and said it was very extraordinary as mrs cave seemed disposed to give them the complete history of her life they made to leave the shop thereupon mrs cave still clinging to hope asked for the clergymans address so that if she could get anything out of cave she might communicate it the address was duly given but apparently was afterwards mislaid mrs cave can remember nothing about it  in the evening of that day the caves seem to have exhausted their emotions and mr cave who had been out in the afternoon supped in a gloomy isolation that contrasted pleasantly with the impassioned controversy of the previous days for some time matters were very badly strained in the cave household but neither crystal nor customer reappeared  now without mincing the matter we must admit that mr cave was a liar he knew perfectly well where the crystal was it was in the rooms of mr jacoby wace assistant demonstrator at st catherines hospital westbourne street it stood on the sideboard partially covered by a black velvet cloth and beside a decanter of american whisky it is from mr wace indeed that the particulars upon which this narrative is based were derived cave had taken off the thing to the hospital hidden in the dogfish sack and there had pressed the young investigator to keep it for him mr wace was a little dubious at first his relationship to cave was peculiar he had a taste for singular characters and he had more than once invited the old man to smoke and drink in his rooms and to unfold his rather amusing views of life in general and of his wife in particular mr wace had encountered mrs cave too on occasions when mr cave was not at home to attend to him he knew the constant interference to which cave was subjected and having weighed the story judicially he decided to give the crystal a refuge mr cave promised to explain the reasons for his remarkable affection for the crystal more fully on a later occasion but he spoke distinctly of seeing visions therein he called on mr wace the same evening  he told a complicated story the crystal he said had come into his possession with other oddments at the forced sale of another curiosity dealers effects and not knowing what its value might be he had ticketed it at ten shillings it had hung upon his hands at that price for some months and he was thinking of reducing the figure when he made a singular discovery  at that time his health was very badand it must be borne in mind that throughout all this experience his physical condition was one of ebband he was in considerable distress by reason of the negligence the positive illtreatment even he received from his wife and stepchildren his wife was vain extravagant unfeeling and had a growing taste for private drinking his stepdaughter was mean and overreaching and his stepson had conceived a violent dislike for him and lost no chance of showing it the requirements of his business pressed heavily upon him and mr wace does not think that he was altogether free from occasional intemperance he had begun life in a comfortable position he was a man of fair education and he suffered for weeks at a stretch from melancholia and insomnia afraid to disturb his family he would slip quietly from his wifes side when his thoughts became intolerable and wander about the house and about three oclock one morning late in august chance directed him into the shop  the dirty little place was impenetrably black except in one spot where he perceived an unusual glow of light approaching this he discovered it to be the crystal egg which was standing on the corner of the counter towards the window a thin ray smote through a crack in the shutters impinged upon the object and seemed as it were to fill its entire interior  it occurred to mr cave that this was not in accordance with the laws of optics as he had known them in his younger days he could understand the rays being refracted by the crystal and coming to a focus in its interior but this diffusion jarred with his physical conceptions he approached the crystal nearly peering into it and round it with a transient revival of the scientific curiosity that in his youth had determined his choice of a calling he was surprised to find the light not steady but writhing within the substance of the egg as though that object was a hollow sphere of some luminous vapour in moving about to get different points of view he suddenly found that he had come between it and the ray and that the crystal none the less remained luminous greatly astonished he lifted it out of the light ray and carried it to the darkest part of the shop it remained bright for some four or five minutes when it slowly faded and went out he placed it in the thin streak of daylight and its luminousness was almost immediately restored  so far at least mr wace was able to verify the remarkable story of mr cave he has himself repeatedly held this crystal in a ray of light which had to be of a less diameter than one millimetre and in a perfect darkness such as could be produced by velvet wrapping the crystal did undoubtedly appear very faintly phosphorescent it would seem however that the luminousness was of some exceptional sort and not equally visible to all eyes for mr harbingerwhose name will be familiar to the scientific reader in connection with the pasteur institutewas quite unable to see any light whatever and mr waces own capacity for its appreciation was out of comparison inferior to that of mr caves even with mr cave the power varied very considerably his vision was most vivid during states of extreme weakness and fatigue  now from the outset this light in the crystal exercised a curious fascination upon mr cave and it says more for his loneliness of soul than a volume of pathetic writing could do that he told no human being of his curious observations he seems to have been living in such an atmosphere of petty spite that to admit the existence of a pleasure would have been to risk the loss of it he found that as the dawn advanced and the amount of diffused light increased the crystal became to all appearance nonluminous and for some time he was unable to see anything in it except at nighttime in dark corners of the shop  but the use of an old velvet cloth which he used as a background for a collection of minerals occurred to him and by doubling this and putting it over his head and hands he was able to get a sight of the luminous movement within the crystal even in the daytime he was very cautious lest he should be thus discovered by his wife and he practised this occupation only in the afternoons while she was asleep upstairs and then circumspectly in a hollow under the counter and one day turning the crystal about in his hands he saw something it came and went like a flash but it gave him the impression that the object had for a moment opened to him the view of a wide and spacious and strange country and turning it about he did just as the light faded see the same vision again  now it would be tedious and unnecessary to state all the phases of mr caves discovery from this point suffice that the effect was this the crystal being peered into at an angle of about 137 degrees from the direction of the illuminating ray gave a clear and consistent picture of a wide and peculiar countryside it was not dreamlike at all it produced a definite impression of reality and the better the light the more real and solid it seemed it was a moving picture that is to say certain objects moved in it but slowly in an orderly manner like real things and according as the direction of the lighting and vision changed the picture changed also it must indeed have been like looking through an oval glass at a view and turning the glass about to get at different aspects  mr caves statements mr wace assures me were extremely circumstantial and entirely free from any of that emotional quality that taints hallucinatory impressions but it must be remembered that all the efforts of mr wace to see any similar clarity in the faint opalescence of the crystal were wholly unsuccessful try as he would the difference in intensity of the impressions received by the two men was very great and it is quite conceivable that what was a view to mr cave was a mere blurred nebulosity to mr wace  the view as mr cave described it was invariably of an extensive plain and he seemed always to be looking at it from a considerable height as if from a tower or a mast to the east and to the west the plain was bounded at a remote distance by vast reddish cliffs which reminded him of those he had seen in some picture but what the picture was mr wace was unable to ascertain these cliffs passed north and southhe could tell the points of the compass by the stars that were visible of a nightreceding in an almost illimitable perspective and fading into the mists of the distance before they met he was nearer the eastern set of cliffs on the occasion of his first vision the sun was rising over them and black against the sunlight and pale against their shadow appeared a multitude of soaring forms that mr cave regarded as birds a vast range of buildings spread below him he seemed to be looking down upon them and as they approached the blurred and refracted edge of the picture they became indistinct there were also trees curious in shape and in colouring a deep mossy green and an exquisite grey beside a wide and shining canal and something great and brilliantly coloured flew across the picture but the first time mr cave saw these pictures he saw only in flashes his hands shook his head moved the vision came and went and grew foggy and indistinct and at first he had the greatest difficulty in finding the picture again once the direction of it was lost  his next clear vision which came about a week after the first the interval having yielded nothing but tantalising glimpses and some useful experience showed him the view down the length of the valley the view was different but he had a curious persuasion which his subsequent observations abundantly confirmed that he was regarding this strange world from exactly the same spot although he was looking in a different direction the long façade of the great building whose roof he had looked down upon before was now receding in perspective he recognised the roof in the front of the façade was a terrace of massive proportions and extraordinary length and down the middle of the terrace at certain intervals stood huge but very graceful masts bearing small shiny objects which reflected the setting sun the import of these small objects did not occur to mr cave until some time after as he was describing the scene to mr wace the terrace overhung a thicket of the most luxuriant and graceful vegetation and beyond this was a wide grassy lawn on which certain broad creatures in form like beetles but enormously larger reposed beyond this again was a richly decorated causeway of pinkish stone and beyond that and lined with dense red weeds and passing up the valley exactly parallel with the distant cliffs was a broad and mirrorlike expanse of water the air seemed full of squadrons of great birds manœuvring in stately curves and across the river was a multitude of splendid buildings richly coloured and glittering with metallic tracery and facets among a forest of mosslike and lichenous trees and suddenly something flapped repeatedly across the vision like the fluttering of a jewelled fan or the beating of a wing and a face or rather the upper part of a face with very large eyes came as it were close to his own and as if on the other side of the crystal mr cave was so startled and so impressed by the absolute reality of these eyes that he drew his head back from the crystal to look behind it he had become so absorbed in watching that he was quite surprised to find himself in the cool darkness of his little shop with its familiar odour of methyl mustiness and decay and as he blinked about him the glowing crystal faded and went out  such were the first general impressions of mr cave the story is curiously direct and circumstantial from the outset when the valley first flashed momentarily on his senses his imagination was strangely affected and as he began to appreciate the details of the scene he saw his wonder rose to the point of a passion he went about his business listless and distraught thinking only of the time when he should be able to return to his watching and then a few weeks after his first sight of the valley came the two customers the stress and excitement of their offer and the narrow escape of the crystal from sale as i have already told  now while the thing was mr caves secret it remained a mere wonder a thing to creep to covertly and peep at as a child might peep upon a forbidden garden but mr wace has for a young scientific investigator a particularly lucid and consecutive habit of mind directly the crystal and its story came to him and he had satisfied himself by seeing the phosphorescence with his own eyes that there really was a certain evidence for mr caves statements he proceeded to develop the matter systematically mr cave was only too eager to come and feast his eyes on this wonderland he saw and he came every night from halfpast eight until halfpast ten and sometimes in mr waces absence during the day on sunday afternoons also he came from the outset mr wace made copious notes and it was due to his scientific method that the relation between the direction from which the initiating ray entered the crystal and the orientation of the picture were proved and by covering the crystal in a box perforated only with a small aperture to admit the exciting ray and by substituting black holland for his buff blinds he greatly improved the conditions of the observations so that in a little while they were able to survey the valley in any direction they desired  so having cleared the way we may give a brief account of this visionary world within the crystal the things were in all cases seen by mr cave and the method of working was invariably for him to watch the crystal and report what he saw while mr wace who as a science student had learnt the trick of writing in the dark wrote a brief note of his report when the crystal faded it was put into its box in the proper position and the electric light turned on mr wace asked questions and suggested observations to clear up difficult points nothing indeed could have been less visionary and more matteroffact  the attention of mr cave had been speedily directed to the birdlike creatures he had seen so abundantly present in each of his earlier visions his first impression was soon corrected and he considered for a time that they might represent a diurnal species of bat then he thought grotesquely enough that they might be cherubs their heads were round and curiously human and it was the eyes of one of them that had so startled him on his second observation they had broad silvery wings not feathered but glistening almost as brilliantly as newkilled fish and with the same subtle play of colour and these wings were not built on the plan of birdwing or bat mr wace learned but supported by curved ribs radiating from the body a sort of butterfly wing with curved ribs seems best to express their appearance the body was small but fitted with two bunches of prehensile organs like long tentacles immediately under the mouth incredible as it appeared to mr wace the persuasion at last became irresistible that it was these creatures which owned the great quasihuman buildings and the magnificent garden that made the broad valley so splendid and mr cave perceived that the buildings with other peculiarities had no doors but that the great circular windows which opened freely gave the creatures egress and entrance they would alight upon their tentacles fold their wings to a smallness almost rodlike and hop into the interior but among them was a multitude of smallerwinged creatures like great dragonflies and moths and flying beetles and across the greensward brilliantlycoloured gigantic groundbeetles crawled lazily to and fro moreover on the causeways and terraces largeheaded creatures similar to the greater winged flies but wingless were visible hopping busily upon their handlike tangle of tentacles  allusion has already been made to the glittering objects upon masts that stood upon the terrace of the nearer building it dawned upon mr cave after regarding one of these masts very fixedly on one particularly vivid day that the glittering object there was a crystal exactly like that into which he peered and a still more careful scrutiny convinced him that each one in a vista of nearly twenty carried a similar object  occasionally one of the large flying creatures would flutter up to one and folding its wings and coiling a number of its tentacles about the mast would regard the crystal fixedly for a spacesometimes for as long as fifteen minutes and a series of observations made at the suggestion of mr wace convinced both watchers that so far as this visionary world was concerned the crystal into which they peered actually stood at the summit of the endmost mast on the terrace and that on one occasion at least one of these inhabitants of this other world had looked into mr caves face while he was making these observations  so much for the essential facts of this very singular story unless we dismiss it all as the ingenious fabrication of mr wace we have to believe one of two things either that mr caves crystal was in two worlds at once and that while it was carried about in one it remained stationary in the other which seems altogether absurd or else that it had some peculiar relation of sympathy with another and exactly similar crystal in this other world so that what was seen in the interior of the one in this world was under suitable conditions visible to an observer in the corresponding crystal in the other world and vice versa at present indeed we do not know of any way in which two crystals could so come en rapport but nowadays we know enough to understand that the thing is not altogether impossible this view of the crystals as en rapport was the supposition that occurred to mr wace and to me at least it seems extremely plausible  and where was this other world on this also the alert intelligence of mr wace speedily threw light after sunset the sky darkened rapidlythere was a very brief twilight interval indeedand the stars shone out they were recognisably the same as those we see arranged in the same constellations mr cave recognised the bear the pleiades aldebaran and sirius so that the other world must be somewhere in the solar system and at the utmost only a few hundreds of millions of miles from our own following up this clue mr wace learned that the midnight sky was a darker blue even than our midwinter sky and that the sun seemed a little smaller and there were two small moons like our moon but smaller and quite differently marked one of which moved so rapidly that its motion was clearly visible as one regarded it these moons were never high in the sky but vanished as they rose that is every time they revolved they were eclipsed because they were so near their primary planet and all this answers quite completely although mr cave did not know it to what must be the condition of things on mars  indeed it seems an exceedingly plausible conclusion that peering into this crystal mr cave did actually see the planet mars and its inhabitants and if that be the case then the evening star that shone so brilliantly in the sky of that distant vision was neither more nor less than our own familiar earth  for a time the martiansif they were martiansdo not seem to have known of mr caves inspection once or twice one would come to peer and go away very shortly to some other mast as though the vision was unsatisfactory during this time mr cave was able to watch the proceedings of these winged people without being disturbed by their attentions and although his report is necessarily vague and fragmentary it is nevertheless very suggestive imagine the impression of humanity a martian observer would get who after a difficult process of preparation and with considerable fatigue to the eyes was able to peer at london from the steeple of st martins church for stretches at longest of four minutes at a time mr cave was unable to ascertain if the winged martians were the same as the martians who hopped about the causeways and terraces and if the latter could put on wings at will he several times saw certain clumsy bipeds dimly suggestive of apes white and partially translucent feeding among certain of the lichenous trees and once some of these fled before one of the hopping roundheaded martians the latter caught one in its tentacles and then the picture faded suddenly and left mr cave most tantalisingly in the dark on another occasion a vast thing that mr cave thought at first was some gigantic insect appeared advancing along the causeway beside the canal with extraordinary rapidity as this drew nearer mr cave perceived that it was a mechanism of shining metals and of extraordinary complexity and then when he looked again it had passed out of sight  after a time mr wace aspired to attract the attention of the martians and the next time that the strange eyes of one of them appeared close to the crystal mr cave cried out and sprang away and they immediately turned on the light and began to gesticulate in a manner suggestive of signalling but when at last mr cave examined the crystal again the martian had departed  thus far these observations had progressed in early november and then mr cave feeling that the suspicions of his family about the crystal were allayed began to take it to and fro with him in order that as occasion arose in the daytime or night he might comfort himself with what was fast becoming the most real thing in his existence  in december mr waces work in connection with a forthcoming examination became heavy the sittings were reluctantly suspended for a week and for ten or eleven dayshe is not quite sure whichhe saw nothing of cave he then grew anxious to resume these investigations and the stress of his seasonal labours being abated he went down to seven dials at the corner he noticed a shutter before a bird fanciers window and then another at a cobblers mr caves shop was closed  he rapped and the door was opened by the stepson in black he at once called mrs cave who was mr wace could not but observe in cheap but ample widows weeds of the most imposing pattern without any very great surprise mr wace learnt that cave was dead and already buried she was in tears and her voice was a little thick she had just returned from highgate her mind seemed occupied with her own prospects and the honourable details of the obsequies but mr wace was at last able to learn the particulars of caves death he had been found dead in his shop in the early morning the day after his last visit to mr wace and the crystal had been clasped in his stonecold hands his face was smiling said mrs cave and the velvet cloth from the minerals lay on the floor at his feet he must have been dead five or six hours when he was found  this came as a great shock to wace and he began to reproach himself bitterly for having neglected the plain symptoms of the old mans illhealth but his chief thought was of the crystal he approached that topic in a gingerly manner because he knew mrs caves peculiarities he was dumbfoundered to learn that it was sold  mrs caves first impulse directly caves body had been taken upstairs had been to write to the mad clergyman who had offered five pounds for the crystal informing him of its recovery but after a violent hunt in which her daughter joined her they were convinced of the loss of his address as they were without the means required to mourn and bury cave in the elaborate style the dignity of an old seven dials inhabitant demands they had appealed to a friendly fellowtradesman in great portland street he had very kindly taken over a portion of the stock at a valuation the valuation was his own and the crystal egg was included in one of the lots mr wace after a few suitable consolatory observations a little offhandedly proffered perhaps hurried at once to great portland street but there he learned that the crystal egg had already been sold to a tall dark man in grey and there the material facts in this curious and to me at least very suggestive story come abruptly to an end the great portland street dealer did not know who the tall dark man in grey was nor had he observed him with sufficient attention to describe him minutely he did not even know which way this person had gone after leaving the shop for a time mr wace remained in the shop trying the dealers patience with hopeless questions venting his own exasperation and at last realising abruptly that the whole thing had passed out of his hands had vanished like a vision of the night he returned to his own rooms a little astonished to find the notes he had made still tangible and visible upon his untidy table  his annoyance and disappointment were naturally very great he made a second call equally ineffectual upon the great portland street dealer and he resorted to advertisements in such periodicals as were likely to come into the hands of a bricabrac collector he also wrote letters to the daily chronicle and nature but both those periodicals suspecting a hoax asked him to reconsider his action before they printed and he was advised that such a strange story unfortunately so bare of supporting evidence might imperil his reputation as an investigator moreover the calls of his proper work were urgent so that after a month or so save for an occasional reminder to certain dealers he had reluctantly to abandon the quest for the crystal egg and from that day to this it remains undiscovered occasionally however he tells me and i can quite believe him he has bursts of zeal in which he abandons his more urgent occupation and resumes the search  whether or not it will remain lost for ever with the material and origin of it are things equally speculative at the present time if the present purchaser is a collector one would have expected the enquiries of mr wace to have reached him through the dealers he has been able to discover mr caves clergyman and orientalno other than the rev james parker and the young prince of bossokuni in java i am obliged to them for certain particulars the object of the prince was simply curiosityand extravagance he was so eager to buy because cave was so oddly reluctant to sell it is just as possible that the buyer in the second instance was simply a casual purchaser and not a collector at all and the crystal egg for all i know may at the present moment be within a mile of me decorating a drawingroom or serving as a paperweightits remarkable functions all unknown indeed it is partly with the idea of such a possibility that i have thrown this narrative into a form that will give it a chance of being read by the ordinary consumer of fiction  my own ideas in the matter are practically identical with those of mr wace i believe the crystal on the mast in mars and the crystal egg of mr caves to be in some physical but at present quite inexplicable way en rapport and we both believe further that the terrestrial crystal must have beenpossibly at some remote datesent hither from that planet in order to give the martians a near view of our affairs possibly the fellows to the crystals in the other masts are also on our globe no theory of hallucination suffices for the facts     the star     the star   it was on the first day of the new year that the announcement was made almost simultaneously from three observatories that the motion of the planet neptune the outermost of all the planets that wheel about the sun had become very erratic ogilvy had already called attention to a suspected retardation in its velocity in december such a piece of news was scarcely calculated to interest a world the greater portion of whose inhabitants were unaware of the existence of the planet neptune nor outside the astronomical profession did the subsequent discovery of a faint remote speck of light in the region of the perturbed planet cause any very great excitement scientific people however found the intelligence remarkable enough even before it became known that the new body was rapidly growing larger and brighter that its motion was quite different from the orderly progress of the planets and that the deflection of neptune and its satellite was becoming now of an unprecedented kind  few people without a training in science can realise the huge isolation of the solar system the sun with its specks of planets its dust of planetoids and its impalpable comets swims in a vacant immensity that almost defeats the imagination beyond the orbit of neptune there is space vacant so far as human observation has penetrated without warmth or light or sound blank emptiness for twenty million times a million miles that is the smallest estimate of the distance to be traversed before the very nearest of the stars is attained and saving a few comets more unsubstantial than the thinnest flame no matter had ever to human knowledge crossed this gulf of space until early in the twentieth century this strange wanderer appeared a vast mass of matter it was bulky heavy rushing without warning out of the black mystery of the sky into the radiance of the sun by the second day it was clearly visible to any decent instrument as a speck with a barely sensible diameter in the constellation leo near regulus in a little while an opera glass could attain it  on the third day of the new year the newspaper readers of two hemispheres were made aware for the first time of the real importance of this unusual apparition in the heavens a planetary collision one london paper headed the news and proclaimed duchaines opinion that this strange new planet would probably collide with neptune the leader writers enlarged upon the topic so that in most of the capitals of the world on january 3rd there was an expectation however vague of some imminent phenomenon in the sky and as the night followed the sunset round the globe thousands of men turned their eyes skyward to seethe old familiar stars just as they had always been  until it was dawn in london and pollux setting and the stars overhead grown pale the winters dawn it was a sickly filtering accumulation of daylight and the light of gas and candles shone yellow in the windows to show where people were astir but the yawning policeman saw the thing the busy crowds in the markets stopped agape workmen going to their work betimes milkmen the drivers of newscarts dissipation going home jaded and pale homeless wanderers sentinels on their beats and in the country labourers trudging afield poachers slinking home all over the dusky quickening country it could be seenand out at sea by seamen watching for the daya great white star come suddenly into the westward sky  brighter it was than any star in our skies brighter than the evening star at its brightest it still glowed out white and large no mere twinkling spot of light but a small round clear shining disc an hour after the day had come and where science has not reached men stared and feared telling one another of the wars and pestilences that are foreshadowed by these fiery signs in the heavens sturdy boers dusky hottentots gold coast negroes frenchmen spaniards portuguese stood in the warmth of the sunrise watching the setting of this strange new star  and in a hundred observatories there had been suppressed excitement rising almost to shouting pitch as the two remote bodies had rushed together and a hurrying to and fro to gather photographic apparatus and spectroscope and this appliance and that to record this novel astonishing sight the destruction of a world for it was a world a sister planet of our earth far greater than our earth indeed that had so suddenly flashed into flaming death neptune it was had been struck fairly and squarely by the strange planet from outer space and the heat of the concussion had incontinently turned two solid globes into one vast mass of incandescence round the world that day two hours before the dawn went the pallid great white star fading only as it sank westward and the sun mounted above it everywhere men marvelled at it but of all those who saw it none could have marvelled more than those sailors habitual watchers of the stars who far away at sea had heard nothing of its advent and saw it now rise like a pigmy moon and climb zenithward and hang overhead and sink westward with the passing of the night  and when next it rose over europe everywhere were crowds of watchers on hilly slopes on houseroofs in open spaces staring eastward for the rising of the great new star it rose with a white glow in front of it like the glare of a white fire and those who had seen it come into existence the night before cried out at the sight of it it is larger they cried it is brighter and indeed the moon a quarter full and sinking in the west was in its apparent size beyond comparison but scarcely in all its breadth had it as much brightness now as the little circle of the strange new star  it is brighter cried the people clustering in the streets but in the dim observatories the watchers held their breath and peered at one another it is nearer they said nearer  and voice after voice repeated it is nearer and the clicking telegraph took that up and it trembled along telephone wires and in a thousand cities grimy compositors fingered the type it is nearer men writing in offices struck with a strange realisation flung down their pens men talking in a thousand places suddenly came upon a grotesque possibility in those words it is nearer it hurried along awakening streets it was shouted down the froststilled ways of quiet villages men who had read these things from the throbbing tape stood in yellowlit doorways shouting the news to the passersby it is nearer pretty women flushed and glittering heard the news told jestingly between the dances and feigned an intelligent interest they did not feel nearer indeed how curious how very very clever people must be to find out things like that  lonely tramps faring through the wintry night murmured those words to comfort themselveslooking skyward it has need to be nearer for the nights as cold as charity dont seem much warmth from it if it is nearer all the same  what is a new star to me cried the weeping woman kneeling beside her dead  the schoolboy rising early for his examination work puzzled it out for himselfwith the great white star shining broad and bright through the frostflowers of his window centrifugal centripetal he said with his chin on his fist stop a planet in its flight rob it of its centrifugal force what then centripetal has it and down it falls into the sun and this  do we come in the way i wonder  the light of that day went the way of its brethren and with the later watches of the frosty darkness rose the strange star again and it was now so bright that the waxing moon seemed but a pale yellow ghost of itself hanging huge in the sunset in a south african city a great man had married and the streets were alight to welcome his return with his bride even the skies have illuminated said the flatterer under capricorn two negro lovers daring the wild beasts and evil spirits for love of one another crouched together in a cane brake where the fireflies hovered that is our star they whispered and felt strangely comforted by the sweet brilliance of its light  the master mathematician sat in his private room and pushed the papers from him his calculations were already finished in a small white phial there still remained a little of the drug that had kept him awake and active for four long nights each day serene explicit patient as ever he had given his lecture to his students and then had come back at once to this momentous calculation his face was grave a little drawn and hectic from his drugged activity for some time he seemed lost in thought then he went to the window and the blind went up with a click half way up the sky over the clustering roofs chimneys and steeples of the city hung the star  he looked at it as one might look into the eyes of a brave enemy you may kill me he said after a silence but i can hold youand all the universe for that matterin the grip of this little brain i would not change even now  he looked at the little phial there will be no need of sleep again he said the next day at noon punctual to the minute he entered his lecture theatre put his hat on the end of the table as his habit was and carefully selected a large piece of chalk it was a joke among his students that he could not lecture without that piece of chalk to fumble in his fingers and once he had been stricken to impotence by their hiding his supply he came and looked under his grey eyebrows at the rising tiers of young fresh faces and spoke with his accustomed studied commonness of phrasing circumstances have arisencircumstances beyond my control he said and paused which will debar me from completing the course i had designed it would seem gentlemen if i may put the thing clearly and briefly thatman has lived in vain  the students glanced at one another had they heard aright mad raised eyebrows and grinning lips there were but one or two faces remained intent upon his calm greyfringed face it will be interesting he was saying to devote this morning to an exposition so far as i can make it clear to you of the calculations that have led me to this conclusion let us assume  he turned towards the blackboard meditating a diagram in the way that was usual to him what was that about lived in vain whispered one student to another listen said the other nodding towards the lecturer  and presently they began to understand  that night the star rose later for its proper eastward motion had carried it some way across leo towards virgo and its brightness was so great that the sky became a luminous blue as it rose and every star was hidden in its turn save only jupiter near the zenith capella aldebaran sirius and the pointers of the bear it was very white and beautiful in many parts of the world that night a pallid halo encircled it about it was perceptibly larger in the clear refractive sky of the tropics it seemed as if it were nearly a quarter the size of the moon the frost was still on the ground in england but the world was as brightly lit as if it were midsummer moonlight one could see to read quite ordinary print by that cold clear light and in the cities the lamps burnt yellow and wan  and everywhere the world was awake that night and throughout christendom a sombre murmur hung in the keen air over the countryside like the belling of bees in the heather and this murmurous tumult grew to a clangour in the cities it was the tolling of the bells in a million belfry towers and steeples summoning the people to sleep no more to sin no more but to gather in their churches and pray and overhead growing larger and brighter as the earth rolled on its way and the night passed rose the dazzling star  and the streets and houses were alight in all the cities the shipyards glared and whatever roads led to high country were lit and crowded all night long and in all the seas about the civilised lands ships with throbbing engines and ships with bellying sails crowded with men and living creatures were standing out to ocean and the north for already the warning of the master mathematician had been telegraphed all over the world and translated into a hundred tongues the new planet and neptune locked in a fiery embrace were whirling headlong ever faster and faster towards the sun already every second this blazing mass flew a hundred miles and every second its terrific velocity increased as it flew now indeed it must pass a hundred million of miles wide of the earth and scarcely affect it but near its destined path as yet only slightly perturbed spun the mighty planet jupiter and his moons sweeping splendid round the sun every moment now the attraction between the fiery star and the greatest of the planets grew stronger and the result of that attraction inevitably jupiter would be deflected from its orbit into an elliptical path and the burning star swung by his attraction wide of its sunward rush would describe a curved path and perhaps collide with and certainly pass very close to our earth earthquakes volcanic outbreaks cyclones sea waves floods and a steady rise in temperature to i know not what limitso prophesied the master mathematician  and overhead to carry out his words lonely and cold and livid blazed the star of the coming doom  to many who stared at it that night until their eyes ached it seemed that it was visibly approaching and that night too the weather changed and the frost that had gripped all central europe and france and england softened towards a thaw  but you must not imagine because i have spoken of people praying through the night and people going aboard ships and people fleeing towards mountainous country that the whole world was already in a terror because of the star as a matter of fact use and wont still ruled the world and save for the talk of idle moments and the splendour of the night nine human beings out of ten were still busy at their common occupations in all the cities the shops save one here and there opened and closed at their proper hours the doctor and the undertaker plied their trades the workers gathered in the factories soldiers drilled scholars studied lovers sought one another thieves lurked and fled politicians planned their schemes the presses of the newspapers roared through the nights and many a priest of this church and that would not open his holy building to further what he considered a foolish panic the newspapers insisted on the lesson of the year 1000for then too people had anticipated the end the star was no starmere gasa comet and were it a star it could not possibly strike the earth there was no precedent for such a thing common sense was sturdy everywhere scornful jesting a little inclined to persecute the obdurate fearful that night at sevenfifteen by greenwich time the star would be at its nearest to jupiter then the world would see the turn things would take the master mathematicians grim warnings were treated by many as so much mere elaborate selfadvertisement common sense at last a little heated by argument signified its unalterable convictions by going to bed so too barbarism and savagery already tired of the novelty went about their nightly business and save for a howling dog here and there the beast world left the star unheeded  and yet when at last the watchers in the european states saw the star rise an hour later it is true but no larger than it had been the night before there were still plenty awake to laugh at the master mathematicianto take the danger as if it had passed  but hereafter the laughter ceased the star grewit grew with a terrible steadiness hour after hour a little larger each hour a little nearer the midnight zenith and brighter and brighter until it had turned night into a second day had it come straight to the earth instead of in a curved path had it lost no velocity to jupiter it must have leapt the intervening gulf in a day but as it was it took five days altogether to come by our planet the next night it had become a third the size of the moon before it set to english eyes and the thaw was assured it rose over america near the size of the moon but blinding white to look at and hot and a breath of hot wind blew now with its rising and gathering strength and in virginia and brazil and down the st lawrence valley it shone intermittently through a driving reek of thunderclouds flickering violet lightning and hail unprecedented in manitoba was a thaw and devastating floods and upon all the mountains of the earth the snow and ice began to melt that night and all the rivers coming out of high country flowed thick and turbid and soonin their upper reacheswith swirling trees and the bodies of beasts and men they rose steadily steadily in the ghostly brilliance and came trickling over their banks at last behind the flying population of their valleys  and along the coast of argentina and up the south atlantic the tides were higher than had ever been in the memory of man and the storms drove the waters in many cases scores of miles inland drowning whole cities and so great grew the heat during the night that the rising of the sun was like the coming of a shadow the earthquakes began and grew until all down america from the arctic circle to cape horn hillsides were sliding fissures were opening and houses and walls crumbling to destruction the whole side of cotopaxi slipped out in one vast convulsion and a tumult of lava poured out so high and broad and swift and liquid that in one day it reached the sea  so the star with the wan moon in its wake marched across the pacific trailed the thunderstorms like the hem of a robe and the growing tidal wave that toiled behind it frothing and eager poured over island and island and swept them clear of men until that wave came at lastin a blinding light and with the breath of a furnace swift and terrible it camea wall of water fifty feet high roaring hungrily upon the long coasts of asia and swept inland across the plains of china for a space the star hotter now and larger and brighter than the sun in its strength showed with pitiless brilliance the wide and populous country towns and villages with their pagodas and trees roads wide cultivated fields millions of sleepless people staring in helpless terror at the incandescent sky and then low and growing came the murmur of the flood and thus it was with millions of men that nighta flight nowhither with limbs heavy with heat and breath fierce and scant and the flood like a wall swift and white behind and then death  china was lit glowing white but over japan and java and all the islands of eastern asia the great star was a ball of dull red fire because of the steam and smoke and ashes the volcanoes were spouting forth to salute its coming above was the lava hot gases and ash and below the seething floods and the whole earth swayed and rumbled with the earthquake shocks soon the immemorial snows of thibet and the himalaya were melting and pouring down by ten million deepening converging channels upon the plains of burmah and hindostan the tangled summits of the indian jungles were aflame in a thousand places and below the hurrying waters around the stems were dark objects that still struggled feebly and reflected the bloodred tongues of fire and in a rudderless confusion a multitude of men and women fled down the broad riverways to that one last hope of menthe open sea  larger grew the star and larger hotter and brighter with a terrible swiftness now the tropical ocean had lost its phosphorescence and the whirling steam rose in ghostly wreaths from the black waves that plunged incessantly speckled with stormtossed ships  and then came a wonder it seemed to those who in europe watched for the rising of the star that the world must have ceased its rotation in a thousand open spaces of down and upland the people who had fled thither from the floods and the falling houses and sliding slopes of hill watched for that rising in vain hour followed hour through a terrible suspense and the star rose not once again men set their eyes upon the old constellations they had counted lost to them forever in england it was hot and clear overhead though the ground quivered perpetually but in the tropics sirius and capella and aldebaran showed through a veil of steam and when at last the great star rose near ten hours late the sun rose close upon it and in the centre of its white heart was a disc of black  over asia it was the star had begun to fall behind the movement of the sky and then suddenly as it hung over india its light had been veiled all the plain of india from the mouth of the indus to the mouths of the ganges was a shallow waste of shining water that night out of which rose temples and palaces mounds and hills black with people every minaret was a clustering mass of people who fell one by one into the turbid waters as heat and terror overcame them the whole land seemed awailing and suddenly there swept a shadow across that furnace of despair and a breath of cold wind and a gathering of clouds out of the cooling air men looking up near blinded at the star saw that a black disc was creeping across the light it was the moon coming between the star and the earth and even as men cried to god at this respite out of the east with a strange inexplicable swiftness sprang the sun and then star sun and moon rushed together across the heavens  so it was that presently to the european watchers star and sun rose close upon each other drove headlong for a space and then slower and at last came to rest star and sun merged into one glare of flame at the zenith of the sky the moon no longer eclipsed the star but was lost to sight in the brilliance of the sky and though those who were still alive regarded it for the most part with that dull stupidity that hunger fatigue heat and despair engender there were still men who could perceive the meaning of these signs star and earth had been at their nearest had swung about one another and the star had passed already it was receding swifter and swifter in the last stage of its headlong journey downward into the sun  and then the clouds gathered blotting out the vision of the sky the thunder and lightning wove a garment round the world all over the earth was such a downpour of rain as men had never before seen and where the volcanoes flared red against the cloud canopy there descended torrents of mud everywhere the waters were pouring off the land leaving mudsilted ruins and the earth littered like a stormworn beach with all that had floated and the dead bodies of the men and brutes its children for days the water streamed off the land sweeping away soil and trees and houses in the way and piling huge dykes and scooping out titanic gullies over the country side those were the days of darkness that followed the star and the heat all through them and for many weeks and months the earthquakes continued  but the star had passed and men hungerdriven and gathering courage only slowly might creep back to their ruined cities buried granaries and sodden fields such few ships as had escaped the storms of that time came stunned and shattered and sounding their way cautiously through the new marks and shoals of once familiar ports and as the storms subsided men perceived that everywhere the days were hotter than of yore and the sun larger and the moon shrunk to a third of its former size took now fourscore days between its new and new  but of the new brotherhood that grew presently among men of the saving of laws and books and machines of the strange change that had come over iceland and greenland and the shores of baffins bay so that the sailors coming there presently found them green and gracious and could scarce believe their eyes this story does not tell nor of the movement of mankind now that the earth was hotter northward and southward towards the poles of the earth it concerns itself only with the coming and the passing of the star  the martian astronomersfor there are astronomers on mars although they are very different beings from menwere naturally profoundly interested by these things they saw them from their own standpoint of course considering the mass and temperature of the missile that was flung through our solar system into the sun one wrote it is astonishing what a little damage the earth which it missed so narrowly has sustained all the familiar continental markings and the masses of the seas remain intact and indeed the only difference seems to be a shrinkage of the white discolouration supposed to be frozen water round either pole which only shows how small the vastest of human catastrophes may seem at a distance of a few million miles     a story of the stone age     a story of the stone age   iughlomi and uya  this story is of a time beyond the memory of man before the beginning of history a time when one might have walked dryshod from france as we call it now to england and when a broad and sluggish thames flowed through its marshes to meet its father rhine flowing through a wide and level country that is under water in these latter days and which we know by the name of the north sea in that remote age the valley which runs along the foot of the downs did not exist and the south of surrey was a range of hills firclad on the middle slopes and snowcapped for the better part of the year the cores of its summits still remain as leith hill and pitch hill and hindhead on the lower slopes of the range below the grassy spaces where the wild horses grazed were forests of yew and sweetchestnut and elm and the thickets and dark places hid the grizzly bear and the hyæna and the grey apes clambered through the branches and still lower amidst the woodland and marsh and open grass along the wey did this little drama play itself out to the end that i have to tell fifty thousand years ago it was fifty thousand yearsif the reckoning of geologists is correct  and in those days the springtime was as joyful as it is now and sent the blood coursing in just the same fashion the afternoon sky was blue with piled white clouds sailing through it and the southwest wind came like a soft caress the newcome swallows drove to and fro the reaches of the river were spangled with white ranunculus the marshy places were starred with ladyssmock and lit with marshmallow wherever the regiments of the sedges lowered their swords and the northwardmoving hippopotami shiny black monsters sporting clumsily came floundering and blundering through it all rejoicing dimly and possessed with one clear idea to splash the river muddy  up the river and well in sight of the hippopotami a number of little buffcoloured animals dabbled in the water there was no fear no rivalry and no enmity between them and the hippopotami as the great bulks came crashing through the reeds and smashed the mirror of the water into silvery splashes these little creatures shouted and gesticulated with glee it was the surest sign of high spring boloo they cried baayah boloo they were the children of the men folk the smoke of whose encampment rose from the knoll at the rivers bend wildeyed youngsters they were with matted hair and little broadnosed impish faces covered as some children are covered even nowadays with a delicate down of hair they were narrow in the loins and long in the arms and their ears had no lobes and had little pointed tips a thing that still in rare instances survives starknaked vivid little gipsies as active as monkeys and as full of chatter though a little wanting in words  their elders were hidden from the wallowing hippopotami by the crest of the knoll the human squattingplace was a trampled area among the dead brown fronds of royal fern through which the crosiers of this years growth were unrolling to the light and warmth the fire was a smouldering heap of char light grey and black replenished by the old women from time to time with brown leaves most of the men were asleepthey slept sitting with their foreheads on their knees they had killed that morning a good quarry enough for all a deer that had been wounded by hunting dogs so that there had been no quarrelling among them and some of the women were still gnawing the bones that lay scattered about others were making a heap of leaves and sticks to feed brother fire when the darkness came again that he might grow strong and tall therewith and guard them against the beasts and two were piling flints that they brought an armful at a time from the bend of the river where the children were at play  none of these buffskinned savages were clothed but some wore about their hips rude girdles of adderskin or crackling undressed hide from which depended little bags not made but torn from the paws of beasts and carrying the rudelydressed flints that were mens chief weapons and tools and one woman the mate of uya the cunning man wore a wonderful necklace of perforated fossilsthat others had worn before her beside some of the sleeping men lay the big antlers of the elk with the tines chipped to sharp edges and long sticks hacked at the ends with flints into sharp points there was little else save these things and the smouldering fire to mark these human beings off from the wild animals that ranged the country but uya the cunning did not sleep but sat with a bone in his hand and scraped busily thereon with a flint a thing no animal would do he was the oldest man in the tribe beetlebrowed prognathous lankarmed he had a beard and his cheeks were hairy and his chest and arms were black with thick hair and by virtue both of his strength and cunning he was master of the tribe and his share was always the most and the best  eudena had hidden herself among the alders because she was afraid of uya she was still a girl and her eyes were bright and her smile pleasant to see he had given her a piece of the liver a mans piece and a wonderful treat for a girl to get but as she took it the other woman with the necklace had looked at her an evil glance and ughlomi had made a noise in his throat at that uya had looked at him long and steadfastly and ughlomis face had fallen and then uya had looked at her she was frightened and she had stolen away while the feeding was still going on and uya was busy with the marrow of a bone afterwards he had wandered about as if looking for her and now she crouched among the alders wondering mightily what uya might be doing with the flint and the bone and ughlomi was not to be seen  presently a squirrel came leaping through the alders and she lay so quiet the little man was within six feet of her before he saw her whereupon he dashed up a stem in a hurry and began to chatter and scold her what are you doing here he asked away from the other men beasts peace said eudena but he only chattered more and then she began to break off the little black cones to throw at him he dodged and defied her and she grew excited and rose up to throw better and then she saw uya coming down the knoll he had seen the movement of her pale arm amidst the thickethe was very keeneyed  at that she forgot the squirrel and set off through the alders and reeds as fast as she could go she did not care where she went so long as she escaped uya she splashed nearly kneedeep through a swampy place and saw in front of her a slope of fernsgrowing more slender and green as they passed up out of the light into the shade of the young chestnuts she was soon amidst the treesshe was very fleet of foot and she ran on and on until the forest was old and the vales great and the vines about their stems where the light came were thick as young trees and the ropes of ivy stout and tight on she went and she doubled and doubled again and then at last lay down amidst some ferns in a hollow place near a thicket and listened with her heart beating in her ears  she heard footsteps presently rustling among the dead leaves far off and they died away and everything was still again except the scandalising of the midgesfor the evening was drawing onand the incessant whisper of the leaves she laughed silently to think the cunning uya should go by her she was not frightened sometimes playing with the other girls and lads she had fled into the wood though never so far as this it was pleasant to be hidden and alone  she lay a long time there glad of her escape and then she sat up listening  it was a rapid pattering growing louder and coming towards her and in a little while she could hear grunting noises and the snapping of twigs it was a drove of lean grisly wild swine she turned about her for a boar is an ill fellow to pass too closely on account of the sideway slash of his tusks and she made off slantingly through the trees but the patter came nearer they were not feeding as they wandered but going fastor else they would not overtake herand she caught the limb of a tree swung on to it and ran up the stem with something of the agility of a monkey  down below the sharp bristling backs of the swine were already passing when she looked and she knew the short sharp grunts they made meant fear what were they afraid of a man they were in a great hurry for just a man  and then so suddenly it made her grip on the branch tighten involuntarily a fawn started in the brake and rushed after the swine something else went by low and grey with a long body she did not know what it was indeed she saw it only momentarily through the interstices of the young leaves and then there came a pause  she remained stiff and expectant as rigid almost as though she was a part of the tree she clung to peering down  then far away among the trees clear for a moment then hidden then visible kneedeep in ferns then gone again ran a man she knew it was young ughlomi by the fair colour of his hair and there was red upon his face somehow his frantic flight and that scarlet mark made her feel sick and then nearer running heavily and breathing hard came another man at first she could not see and then she saw foreshortened and clear to her uya running with great strides and his eyes staring he was not going after ughlomi his face was white it was uyaafraid he passed and was still loud hearing when something else something large and with grizzled fur swinging along with soft swift strides came rushing in pursuit of him  eudena suddenly became rigid ceased to breathe her clutch convulsive and her eyes starting  she had never seen the thing before she did not even see him clearly now but she knew at once it was the terror of the woodshade his name was a legend the children would frighten one another frighten even themselves with his name and run screaming to the squattingplace no man had ever killed any of his kind even the mighty mammoth feared his anger it was the grizzly bear the lord of the world as the world went then  as he ran he made a continuous growling grumble men in my very lair fighting and blood at the very mouth of my lair men men men fighting and blood for he was the lord of the wood and of the caves  long after he had passed she remained a girl of stone staring down through the branches all her power of action had gone from her she gripped by instinct with hands and knees and feet it was some time before she could think and then only one thing was clear in her mind that the terror was between her and the tribethat it would be impossible to descend  presently when her fear was a little abated she clambered into a more comfortable position where a great branch forked the trees rose about her so that she could see nothing of brother fire who is black by day birds began to stir and things that had gone into hiding for fear of her movements crept out  after a time the taller branches flamed out at the touch of the sunset high overhead the rooks who were wiser than men went cawing home to their squattingplaces among the elms looking down things were clearer and darker eudena thought of going back to the squattingplace she let herself down some way and then the fear of the terror of the woodshade came again while she hesitated a rabbit squealed dismally and she dared not descend farther  the shadows gathered and the deeps of the forest began stirring eudena went up the tree again to be nearer the light down below the shadows came out of their hidingplaces and walked abroad overhead the blue deepened a dreadful stillness came and then the leaves began whispering  eudena shivered and thought of brother fire  the shadows now were gathering in the trees they sat on the branches and watched her branches and leaves were turned to ominous quiet black shapes that would spring on her if she stirred then the white owl flitting silently came ghostly through the shades darker grew the world and darker until the leaves and twigs against the sky were black and the ground was hidden  she remained there all night an agelong vigil straining her ears for the things that went on below in the darkness and keeping motionless lest some stealthy beast should discover her man in those days was never alone in the dark save for such rare accidents as this age after age he had learnt the lesson of its terrora lesson we poor children of his have nowadays painfully to unlearn eudena though in age a woman was in heart like a little child she kept as still poor little animal as a hare before it is started  the stars gathered and watched herher one grain of comfort in one bright one she fancied there was something like ughlomi then she fancied it was ughlomi and near him red and duller was uya and as the night passed ughlomi fled before him up the sky  she tried to see brother fire who guarded the squattingplace from beasts but he was not in sight and far away she heard the mammoths trumpeting as they went down to the drinkingplace and once some huge bulk with heavy paces hurried along making a noise like a calf but what it was she could not see but she thought from the voice it was yaaa the rhinoceros who stabs with his nose goes always alone and rages without cause  at last the little stars began to hide and then the larger ones it was like all the animals vanishing before the terror the sun was coming lord of the sky as the grizzly was lord of the forest eudena wondered what would happen if one star stayed behind and then the sky paled to the dawn  when the daylight came the fear of lurking things passed and she could descend she was stiff but not so stiff as you would have been dear young lady by virtue of your upbringing and as she had not been trained to eat at least once in three hours but instead had often fasted three days she did not feel uncomfortably hungry she crept down the tree very cautiously and went her way stealthily through the wood and not a squirrel sprang or deer started but the terror of the grizzly bear froze her marrow  her desire was now to find her people again her dread of uya the cunning was consumed by a greater dread of loneliness but she had lost her direction she had run heedlessly overnight and she could not tell whether the squattingplace was sunward or where it lay ever and again she stopped and listened and at last very far away she heard a measured chinking it was so faint even in the morning stillness that she could tell it must be far away but she knew the sound was that of a man sharpening a flint  presently the trees began to thin out and then came a regiment of nettles barring the way she turned aside and then she came to a fallen tree that she knew with a noise of bees about it and so presently she was in sight of the knoll very far off and the river under it and the children and the hippopotami just as they had been yesterday and the thin spire of smoke swaying in the morning breeze far away by the river was the cluster of alders where she had hidden and at the sight of that the fear of uya returned and she crept into a thicket of bracken out of which a rabbit scuttled and lay awhile to watch the squattingplace  the men were mostly out of sight saving wau the flintchopper and at that she felt safer they were away hunting food no doubt some of the women too were down in the stream stooping intent seeking mussels crayfish and watersnails and at the sight of their occupation eudena felt hungry she rose and ran through the fern designing to join them as she went she heard a voice among the bracken calling softly she stopped then suddenly she heard a rustle behind her and turning saw ughlomi rising out of the fern there were streaks of brown blood and dirt on his face and his eyes were fierce and the white stone of uya the white fire stone that none but uya dared to touch was in his hand in a stride he was beside her and gripped her arm he swung her about and thrust her before him towards the woods uya he said and waved his arms about she heard a cry looked back and saw all the women standing up and two wading out of the stream then came a nearer howling and the old woman with the beard who watched the fire on the knoll was waving her arms and wau the man who had been chipping the flint was getting to his feet the little children too were hurrying and shouting  come said ughlomi and dragged her by the arm  she still did not understand  uya has called the death word said ughlomi and she glanced back at the screaming curve of figures and understood  wau and all the women and children were coming towards them a scattered array of buff shockheaded figures howling leaping and crying over the knoll two youths hurried down among the ferns to the right came a man heading them off from the wood ughlomi left her arm and the two began running side by side leaping the bracken and stepping clear and wide eudena knowing her fleetness and the fleetness of ughlomi laughed aloud at the unequal chase they were an exceptionally straightlimbed couple for those days  they soon cleared the open and drew near the wood of chestnuttrees againneither afraid now because neither was alone they slackened their pace already not excessive and suddenly eudena cried and swerved aside pointing and looking up through the treestems ughlomi saw the feet and legs of men running towards him eudena was already running off at a tangent and as he too turned to follow her they heard the voice of uya coming through the trees and roaring out his rage at them  then terror came in their hearts not the terror that numbs but the terror that makes one silent and swift they were cut off now on two sides they were in a sort of corner of pursuit on the right hand and near by them came the men swift and heavy with bearded uya antler in hand leading them and on the left scattered as one scatters corn yellow dashes among the fern and grass ran wau and the women and even the little children from the shallow had joined the chase the two parties converged upon them off they went with eudena ahead  they knew there was no mercy for them there was no hunting so sweet to these ancient men as the hunting of men once the fierce passion of the chase was lit the feeble beginnings of humanity in them were thrown to the winds and uya in the night had marked ughlomi with the death word ughlomi was the days quarry the appointed feast  they ran straightit was their only chancetaking whatever ground came in the waya spread of stinging nettles an open glade a clump of grass out of which a hyæna fled snarling then woods again long stretches of shady leafmould and moss under the green trunks then a stiff slope treeclad and long vistas of trees a glade a succulent green area of black mud a wide open space again and then a clump of lacerating brambles with beast tracks through it behind them the chase trailed out and scattered with uya ever at their heels eudena kept the first place running light and with her breath easy for ughlomi carried the fire stone in his hand  it told on his pacenot at first but after a time his footsteps behind her suddenly grew remote glancing over her shoulder as they crossed another open space eudena saw that ughlomi was many yards behind her and uya close upon him with antler already raised in the air to strike him down wau and the others were but just emerging from the shadow of the woods  seeing ughlomi in peril eudena ran sideways looking back threw up her arms and cried aloud just as the antler flew and young ughlomi expecting this and understanding her cry ducked his head so that the missile merely struck his scalp lightly making but a trivial wound and flew over him he turned forthwith the quartzite fire stone in both hands and hurled it straight at uyas body as he ran loose from the throw uya shouted but could not dodge it it took him under the ribs heavy and flat and he reeled and went down without a cry ughlomi caught up the antlerone tine of it was tipped with his own bloodand came running on again with a red trickle just coming out of his hair  uya rolled over twice and lay a moment before he got up and then he did not run fast the colour of his face was changed wau overtook him and then others and he coughed and laboured in his breath but he kept on  at last the two fugitives gained the bank of the river where the stream ran deep and narrow and they still had fifty yards in hand of wau the foremost pursuer the man who made the smitingstones he carried one a large flint the shape of an oyster and double the size chipped to a chisel edge in either hand  they sprang down the steep bank into the stream rushed through the water swam the deep current in two or three strokes and came out wading again dripping and refreshed to clamber up the farther bank it was undermined and with willows growing thickly therefrom so that it needed clambering and while eudena was still among the silvery branches and ughlomi still in the waterfor the antler had encumbered himwau came up against the sky on the opposite bank and the smitingstone thrown cunningly took the side of eudenas knee she struggled to the top and fell  they heard the pursuers shout to one another and ughlomi climbing to her and moving jerkily to mar waus aim felt the second smitingstone graze his ear and heard the water splash below him  then it was ughlomi the stripling proved himself to have come to mans estate for running on he found eudena fell behind limping and at that he turned and crying savagely and with a face terrible with sudden wrath and trickling blood ran swiftly past her back to the bank whirling the antler round his head and eudena kept on running stoutly still though she must needs limp at every step and the pain was already sharp  so that wau rising over the edge and clutching the straight willow branches saw ughlomi towering over him gigantic against the blue saw his whole body swing round and the grip of his hands upon the antler the edge of the antler came sweeping through the air and he saw no more the water under the osiers whirled and eddied and went crimson six feet down the stream uya following stopped kneehigh across the stream and the man who was swimming turned about  the other men who trailed afterthey were none of them very mighty men for uya was more cunning than strong brooking no sturdy rivalsslackened momentarily at the sight of ughlomi standing there above the willows bloody and terrible between them and the halting girl with the huge antler waving in his hand it seemed as though he had gone into the water a youth and come out of it a man full grown  he knew what there was behind him a broad stretch of grass and then a thicket and in that eudena could hide that was clear in his mind though his thinking powers were too feeble to see what should happen thereafter uya stood kneedeep undecided and unarmed his heavy mouth hung open showing his canine teeth and he panted heavily his side was flushed and bruised under the hair the other man beside him carried a sharpened stick the rest of the hunters came up one by one to the top of the bank hairy longarmed men clutching flints and sticks two ran off along the bank down stream and then clambered to the water where wau had come to the surface struggling weakly before they could reach him he went under again two others threatened ughlomi from the bank  he answered back shouts vague insults gestures then uya who had been hesitating roared with rage and whirling his fists plunged into the water his followers splashed after him  ughlomi glanced over his shoulder and found eudena already vanished into the thicket he would perhaps have waited for uya but uya preferred to spar in the water below him until the others were beside him human tactics in those days in all serious fighting were the tactics of the pack prey that turned at bay they gathered around and rushed ughlomi felt the rush coming and hurling the antler at uya turned about and fled  when he halted to look back from the shadow of the thicket he found only three of his pursuers had followed him across the river and they were going back again uya with a bleeding mouth was on the farther side of the stream again but lower down and holding his hand to his side the others were in the river dragging something to shore for a time at least the chase was intermitted  ughlomi stood watching for a space and snarled at the sight of uya then he turned and plunged into the thicket  in a minute eudena came hastening to join him and they went on hand in hand he dimly perceived the pain she suffered from the cut and bruised knee and chose the easier ways but they went on all that day mile after mile through wood and thicket until at last they came to the chalkland open grass with rare woods of beech and the birch growing near water and they saw the wealden mountains nearer and groups of horses grazing together they went circumspectly keeping always near thicket and cover for this was a strange regioneven its ways were strange steadily the ground rose until the chestnut forests spread wide and blue below them and the thames marshes shone silvery high and far they saw no men for in those days men were still only just come into this part of the world and were moving but slowly along the riverways towards evening they came on the river again but now it ran in a gorge between high cliffs of white chalk that sometimes overhung it down the cliffs was a scrub of birches and there were many birds there and high up the cliff was a little shelf by a tree whereon they clambered to pass the night  they had had scarcely any food it was not the time of year for berries and they had no time to go aside to snare or waylay they tramped in a hungry weary silence gnawing at twigs and leaves but over the surface of the cliffs were a multitude of snails and in a bush were the freshly laid eggs of a little bird and then ughlomi threw at and killed a squirrel in a beechtree so that at last they fed well ughlomi watched during the night his chin on his knees and he heard young foxes crying hard by and the noise of mammoths down the gorge and the hyænas yelling and laughing far away it was chilly but they dared not light a fire whenever he dozed his spirit went abroad and straightway met with the spirit of uya and they fought and always ughlomi was paralysed so that he could not smite nor run and then he would awake suddenly eudena too dreamt evil things of uya so that they both awoke with the fear of him in their hearts and by the light of the dawn they saw a woolly rhinoceros go blundering down the valley  during the day they caressed one another and were glad of the sunshine and eudenas leg was so stiff she sat on the ledge all day ughlomi found great flints sticking out of the cliff face greater than any he had seen and he dragged some to the ledge and began chipping so as to be armed against uya when he came again and at one he laughed heartily and eudena laughed and they threw it about in derision it had a hole in it they stuck their fingers through it it was very funny indeed then they peeped at one another through it afterwards ughlomi got himself a stick and thrusting by chance at this foolish flint the stick went in and stuck there he had rammed it in too tightly to withdraw it that was still strangerscarcely funny terrible almost and for a time ughlomi did not greatly care to touch the thing it was as if the flint had bit and held with its teeth but then he got familiar with the odd combination he swung it about and perceived that the stick with the heavy stone on the end struck a better blow than anything he knew he went to and fro swinging it and striking with it but later he tired of it and threw it aside in the afternoon he went up over the brow of the white cliff and lay watching by a rabbitwarren until the rabbits came out to play there were no men thereabouts and the rabbits were heedless he threw a smitingstone he had made and got a kill  that night they made a fire from flint sparks and bracken fronds and talked and caressed by it and in their sleep uyas spirit came again and suddenly while ughlomi was trying to fight vainly the foolish flint on the stick came into his hand and he struck uya with it and behold it killed him but afterwards came other dreams of uyafor spirits take a lot of killing and he had to be killed again then after that the stone would not keep on the stick he awoke tired and rather gloomy and was sulky all the forenoon in spite of eudenas kindliness and instead of hunting he sat chipping a sharp edge to the singular flint and looking strangely at her then he bound the perforated flint on to the stick with strips of rabbit skin and afterwards he walked up and down the ledge striking with it and muttering to himself and thinking of uya it felt very fine and heavy in the hand  several days more than there was any counting in those days five days it may be or six did ughlomi and eudena stay on that shelf in the gorge of the river and they lost all fear of men and their fire burnt redly of a night and they were very merry together there was food every day sweet water and no enemies eudenas knee was well in a couple of days for those ancient savages had quickhealing flesh indeed they were very happy  on one of those days ughlomi dropped a chunk of flint over the cliff he saw it fall and go bounding across the river bank into the river and after laughing and thinking it over a little he tried another this smashed a bush of hazel in the most interesting way they spent all the morning dropping stones from the ledge and in the afternoon they discovered this new and interesting pastime was also possible from the cliffbrow the next day they had forgotten this delight or at least it seemed they had forgotten  but uya came in dreams to spoil the paradise three nights he came fighting ughlomi in the morning after these dreams ughlomi would walk up and down threatening him and swinging the axe and at last came the night after ughlomi brained the otter and they had feasted uya went too far ughlomi awoke scowling under his heavy brows and he took his axe and extending his hand towards eudena he bade her wait for him upon the ledge then he clambered down the white declivity glanced up once from the foot of it and flourished his axe and without looking back again went striding along the river bank until the overhanging cliff at the bend hid him  two days and nights did eudena sit alone by the fire on the ledge waiting and in the night the beasts howled over the cliffs and down the valley and on the cliff over against her the hunched hyænas prowled black against the sky but no evil thing came near her save fear once far away she heard the roaring of a lion following the horses as they came northward over the grass lands with the spring all that time she waitedthe waiting that is pain  and the third day ughlomi came back up the river the plumes of a raven were in his hair the first axe was redstained and had long dark hairs upon it and he carried the necklace that had marked the favourite of uya in his hand he walked in the soft places giving no heed to his trail save a raw cut below his jaw there was not a wound upon him uya cried ughlomi exultant and eudena saw it was well he put the necklace on eudena and they ate and drank together and after eating he began to rehearse the whole story from the beginning when uya had cast his eyes on eudena and uya and ughlomi fighting in the forest had been chased by the bear eking out his scanty words with abundant pantomime springing to his feet and whirling the stone axe round when it came to the fighting the last fight was a mighty one stamping and shouting and once a blow at the fire that sent a torrent of sparks up into the night and eudena sat red in the light of the fire gloating on him her face flushed and her eyes shining and the necklace uya had made about her neck it was a splendid time and the stars that look down on us looked down on her our ancestorwho has been dead now these fifty thousand years   iithe cave bear  in the days when eudena and ughlomi fled from the people of uya towards the firclad mountains of the weald across the forests of sweet chestnut and the grassclad chalkland and hid themselves at last in the gorge of the river between the chalk cliffs men were few and their squattingplaces far between the nearest men to them were those of the tribe a full days journey down the river and up the mountains there were none man was indeed a newcomer to this part of the world in that ancient time coming slowly along the rivers generation after generation from one squattingplace to another from the southwestward and the animals that held the land the hippopotamus and rhinoceros of the river valleys the horses of the grass plains the deer and swine of the woods the grey apes in the branches the cattle of the uplands feared him but littlelet alone the mammoths in the mountains and the elephants that came through the land in the summertime out of the south for why should they fear him with but the rough chipped flints that he had not learnt to haft and which he threw but ill and the poor spear of sharpened wood as all the weapons he had against hoof and horn tooth and claw  andoo the huge cave bear who lived in the cave up the gorge had never even seen a man in all his wise and respectable life until midway through one night as he was prowling down the gorge along the cliff edge he saw the glare of eudenas fire upon the ledge and eudena red and shining and ughlomi with a gigantic shadow mocking him upon the white cliff going to and fro shaking his mane of hair and waving the axe of stonethe first axe of stonewhile he chanted of the killing of uya the cave bear was far up the gorge and he saw the thing slantingways and far off he was so surprised he stood quite still upon the edge sniffing the novel odour of burning bracken and wondering whether the dawn was coming up in the wrong place  he was the lord of the rocks and caves was the cave bear as his slighter brother the grizzly was lord of the thick woods below and as the dappled lionthe lion of those days was dappledwas lord of the thornthickets reedbeds and open plains he was the greatest of all meateaters he knew no fear none preyed on him and none gave him battle only the rhinoceros was beyond his strength even the mammoth shunned his country this invasion perplexed him he noticed these new beasts were shaped like monkeys and sparsely hairy like young pigs monkey and young pig said the cave bear it might not be so bad but that red thing that jumps and the black thing jumping with it yonder never in my life have i seen such things before  he came slowly along the brow of the cliff towards them stopping thrice to sniff and peer and the reek of the fire grew stronger a couple of hyænas also were so intent upon the thing below that andoo coming soft and easy was close upon them before they knew of him or he of them they started guiltily and went lurching off coming round in a wheel a hundred yards off they began yelling and calling him names to revenge themselves for the start they had had yaha they cried who cant grub his own burrow who eats roots like a pig yaha for even in those days the hyænas manners were just as offensive as they are now  who answers the hyæna growled andoo peering through the midnight dimness at them and then going to look at the cliff edge  there was ughlomi still telling his story and the fire getting low and the scent of the burning hot and strong  andoo stood on the edge of the chalk cliff for some time shifting his vast weight from foot to foot and swaying his head to and fro with his mouth open his ears erect and twitching and the nostrils of his big black muzzle sniffing he was very curious was the cave bear more curious than any of the bears that live now and the flickering fire and the incomprehensible movements of the man let alone the intrusion into his indisputable province stirred him with a sense of strange new happenings he had been after red deer fawn that night for the cave bear was a miscellaneous hunter but this quite turned him from that enterprise  yaha yelled the hyænas behind yahaha  peering through the starlight andoo saw there were now three or four going to and fro against the grey hillside they will hang about me now all the night  until i kill said andoo filth of the world and mainly to annoy them he resolved to watch the red flicker in the gorge until the dawn came to drive the hyæna scum home and after a time they vanished and he heard their voices like a party of cockney beanfeasters away in the beechwoods then they came slinking near again andoo yawned and went on along the cliff and they followed then he stopped and went back  it was a splendid night beset with shining constellations the same stars but not the same constellations we know for since those days all the stars have had time to move into new places far away across the open space beyond where the heavyshouldered leanbodied hyænas blundered and howled was a beechwood and the mountain slopes rose beyond a dim mystery until their snowcapped summits came out white and cold and clear touched by the first rays of the yet unseen moon it was a vast silence save when the yell of the hyænas flung a vanishing discordance across its peace or when from down the hills the trumpeting of the newcome elephants came faintly on the faint breeze and below now the red flicker had dwindled and was steady and shone a deeper red and ughlomi had finished his story and was preparing to sleep and eudena sat and listened to the strange voices of unknown beasts and watched the dark eastern sky growing deeply luminous at the advent of the moon down below the river talked to itself and things unseen went to and fro  after a time the bear went away but in an hour he was back again then as if struck by a thought he turned and went up the gorge  the night passed and ughlomi slept on the waning moon rose and lit the gaunt white cliff overhead with a light that was pale and vague the gorge remained in a deeper shadow and seemed all the darker then by imperceptible degrees the day came stealing in the wake of the moonlight eudenas eyes wandered to the cliff brow overhead once and then again each time the line was sharp and clear against the sky and yet she had a dim perception of something lurking there the red of the fire grew deeper and deeper grey scales spread upon it its vertical column of smoke became more and more visible and up and down the gorge things that had been unseen grew clear in a colourless illumination she may have dozed  suddenly she started up from her squatting position erect and alert scrutinising the cliff up and down  she made the faintest sound and ughlomi too lightsleeping like an animal was instantly awake he caught up his axe and came noiselessly to her side  the light was still dim the world now all in black and dark grey and one sickly star still lingered overhead the ledge they were on was a little grassy space six feet wide perhaps and twenty feet long sloping outwardly and with a handful of st johns wort growing near the edge below it the soft white rock fell away in a steep slope of nearly fifty feet to the thick bush of hazel that fringed the river down the river this slope increased until some way off a thin grass held its own right up to the crest of the cliff overhead forty or fifty feet of rock bulged into the great masses characteristic of chalk but at the end of the ledge a gully a precipitous groove of discoloured rock slashed the face of the cliff and gave a footing to a scrubby growth by which eudena and ughlomi went up and down  they stood as noiseless as startled deer with every sense expectant for a minute they heard nothing and then came a faint rattling of dust down the gully and the creaking of twigs  ughlomi gripped his axe and went to the edge of the ledge for the bulge of the chalk overhead had hidden the upper part of the gully and forthwith with a sudden contraction of the heart he saw the cave bear halfway down from the brow and making a gingerly backward step with his flat hindfoot his hindquarters were towards ughlomi and he clawed at the rocks and bushes so that he seemed flattened against the cliff he looked none the less for that from his shining snout to his stumpy tail he was a lion and a half the length of two tall men he looked over his shoulder and his huge mouth was open with the exertion of holding up his great carcase and his tongue lay out  he got his footing and came down slowly a yard nearer  bear said ughlomi looking round with his face white  but eudena with terror in her eyes was pointing down the cliff  ughlomis mouth fell open for down below with her big forefeet against the rock stood another big browngrey bulkthe shebear she was not so big as andoo but she was big enough for all that  then suddenly ughlomi gave a cry and catching up a handful of the litter of ferns that lay scattered on the ledge he thrust it into the pallid ash of the fire brother fire he cried brother fire and eudena starting into activity did likewise brother fire help help brother fire  brother fire was still red in his heart but he turned to grey as they scattered him brother fire they screamed but he whispered and passed and there was nothing but ashes then ughlomi danced with anger and struck the ashes with his fist but eudena began to hammer the firestone against a flint and the eyes of each were turning ever and again towards the gully by which andoo was climbing down brother fire  suddenly the huge furry hindquarters of the bear came into view beneath the bulge of the chalk that had hidden him he was still clambering gingerly down the nearly vertical surface his head was yet out of sight but they could hear him talking to himself pig and monkey said the cave bear it ought to be good  eudena struck a spark and blew at it it twinkled brighter and thenwent out at that she cast down flint and firestone and stared blankly then she sprang to her feet and scrambled a yard or so up the cliff above the ledge how she hung on even for a moment i do not know for the chalk was vertical and without grip for a monkey in a couple of seconds she had slid back to the ledge again with bleeding hands  ughlomi was making frantic rushes about the ledgenow he would go to the edge now to the gully he did not know what to do he could not think the shebear looked smaller than her matemuch if they rushed down on her together one might live ugh said the cave bear and ughlomi turned again and saw his little eyes peering under the bulge of the chalk  eudena cowering at the end of the ledge began to scream like a gripped rabbit  at that a sort of madness came upon ughlomi with a mighty cry he caught up his axe and ran towards andoo the monster gave a grunt of surprise in a moment ughlomi was clinging to a bush right underneath the bear and in another he was hanging to its back half buried in fur with one fist clutched in the hair under its jaw the bear was too astonished at this fantastic attack to do more than cling passive and then the axe the first of all axes rang on its skull  the bears head twisted from side to side and he began a petulant scolding growl the axe bit within an inch of the left eye and the hot blood blinded that side at that the brute roared with surprise and anger and his teeth gnashed six inches from ughlomis face then the axe clubbed close came down heavily on the corner of the jaw  the next blow blinded the right side and called forth a roar this time of pain eudena saw the huge flat feet slipping and sliding and suddenly the bear gave a clumsy leap sideways as if for the ledge then everything vanished and the hazels smashed and a roar of pain and a tumult of shouts and growls came up from far below  eudena screamed and ran to the edge and peered over for a moment man and bears were a heap together ughlomi uppermost and then he had sprung clear and was scaling the gully again with the bears rolling and striking at one another among the hazels but he had left his axe below and three knobended streaks of carmine were shooting down his thigh up he cried and in a moment eudena was leading the way to the top of the cliff  in half a minute they were at the crest their hearts pumping noisily with andoo and his wife far and safe below them andoo was sitting on his haunches both paws at work trying with quick exasperated movements to wipe the blindness out of his eyes and the shebear stood on allfours a little way off ruffled in appearance and growling angrily ughlomi flung himself flat on the grass and lay panting and bleeding with his face on his arms  for a second eudena regarded the bears then she came and sat beside him looking at him  presently she put forth her hand timidly and touched him and made the guttural sound that was his name he turned over and raised himself on his arm his face was pale like the face of one who is afraid he looked at her steadfastly for a moment and then suddenly he laughed waugh he said exultantly  waugh said shea simple but expressive conversation  then ughlomi came and knelt beside her and on hands and knees peered over the brow and examined the gorge his breath was steady now and the blood on his leg had ceased to flow though the scratches the shebear had made were open and wide he squatted up and sat staring at the footmarks of the great bear as they came to the gullythey were as wide as his head and twice as long then he jumped up and went along the cliff face until the ledge was visible here he sat down for some time thinking while eudena watched him presently she saw the bears had gone  at last ughlomi rose as one whose mind is made up he returned towards the gully eudena keeping close by him and together they clambered to the ledge they took the firestone and a flint and then ughlomi went down to the foot of the cliff very cautiously and found his axe they returned to the cliff as quietly as they could and set off at a brisk walk the ledge was a home no longer with such callers in the neighbourhood ughlomi carried the axe and eudena the firestone so simple was a palæolithic removal  they went upstream although it might lead to the very lair of the cave bear because there was no other way to go down the stream was the tribe and had not ughlomi killed uya and wau by the stream they had to keepbecause of drinking  so they marched through beech trees with the gorge deepening until the river flowed a frothing rapid five hundred feet below them of all the changeful things in this world of change the courses of rivers in deep valleys change least it was the river wey the river we know today and they marched over the very spots where nowadays stand little guildford and godalmingthe first human beings to come into the land once a grey ape chattered and vanished and all along the cliff edge vast and even ran the spoor of the great cave bear  and then the spoor of the bear fell away from the cliff showing ughlomi thought that he came from some place to the left and keeping to the cliffs edge they presently came to an end they found themselves looking down on a great semicircular space caused by the collapse of the cliff it had smashed right across the gorge banking the upstream water back in a pool which overflowed in a rapid the slip had happened long ago it was grassed over but the face of the cliffs that stood about the semicircle was still almost freshlooking and white as on the day when the rock must have broken and slid down starkly exposed and black under the foot of these cliffs were the mouths of several caves and as they stood there looking at the space and disinclined to skirt it because they thought the bears lair lay somewhere on the left in the direction they must needs take they saw suddenly first one bear and then two coming up the grass slope to the right and going across the amphitheatre towards the caves andoo was first he dropped a little on his forefoot and his mien was despondent and the shebear came shuffling behind  eudena and ughlomi stepped back from the cliff until they could just see the bears over the verge then ughlomi stopped eudena pulled his arm but he turned with a forbidding gesture and her hand dropped ughlomi stood watching the bears with his axe in his hand until they had vanished into the cave he growled softly and shook the axe at the shebears receding quarters then to eudenas terror instead of creeping off with her he lay flat down and crawled forward into such a position that he could just see the cave it was bearsand he did it as calmly as if it had been rabbits he was watching  he lay still like a barked log sundappled in the shadow of the trees he was thinking and eudena had learnt even when a little girl that when ughlomi became still like that jawbone on fist novel things presently began to happen  it was an hour before the thinking was over it was noon when the two little savages had found their way to the cliff brow that overhung the bears cave and all the long afternoon they fought desperately with a great boulder of chalk trundling it with nothing but their unaided sturdy muscles from the gully where it had hung like a loose tooth towards the cliff top it was full two yards about it stood as high as eudenas waist it was obtuseangled and toothed with flints and when the sun set it was poised three inches from the edge above the cave of the great cave bear  in the cave conversation languished during that afternoon the shebear snoozed sulkily in her cornerfor she was fond of pig and monkeyand andoo was busy licking the side of his paw and smearing his face to cool the smart and inflammation of his wounds afterwards he went and sat just within the mouth of the cave blinking out at the afternoon sun with his uninjured eye and thinking  i never was so startled in my life he said at last they are the most extraordinary beasts attacking me  i dont like them said the shebear out of the darkness behind  a feebler sort of beast i never saw i cant think what the world is coming to scraggy weedy legs wonder how they keep warm in winter  very likely they dont said the shebear  i suppose its a sort of monkey gone wrong  its a change said the shebear  a pause  the advantage he had was merely accidental said andoo these things will happen at times  i cant understand why you let go said the shebear  that matter had been discussed before and settled so andoo being a bear of experience remained silent for a space then he resumed upon a different aspect of the matter he has a sort of clawa long claw that he seemed to have first on one paw and then on the other just one claw theyre very odd things the bright thing too they seemed to havelike that glare that comes in the sky in daytimeonly it jumps aboutits really worth seeing its a thing with a root toolike grass when it is windy  does it bite asked the shebear if it bites it cant be a plant  noi dont know said andoo but its curious anyhow  i wonder if they are good eating said the shebear  they look it said andoo with appetitefor the cave bear like the polar bear was an incurable carnivoreno roots or honey for him  the two bears fell into a meditation for a space then andoo resumed his simple attentions to his eye the sunlight up the green slope before the cave mouth grew warmer in tone and warmer until it was a ruddy amber  curious sort of thingday said the cave bear lot too much of it i think quite unsuitable for hunting dazzles me always i cant smell nearly so well by day  the shebear did not answer but there came a measured crunching sound out of the darkness she had turned up a bone andoo yawned well he said he strolled to the cave mouth and stood with his head projecting surveying the amphitheatre he found he had to turn his head completely round to see objects on his righthand side no doubt that eye would be all right tomorrow  he yawned again there was a tap overhead and a big mass of chalk flew out from the cliff face dropped a yard in front of his nose and starred into a dozen unequal fragments it startled him extremely  when he had recovered a little from his shock he went and sniffed curiously at the representative pieces of the fallen projectile they had a distinctive flavour oddly reminiscent of the two drab animals of the ledge he sat up and pawed the larger lump and walked round it several times trying to find a man about it somewhere  when night had come he went off down the river gorge to see if he could cut off either of the ledges occupants the ledge was empty there were no signs of the red thing but as he was rather hungry he did not loiter long that night but pushed on to pick up a red deer fawn he forgot about the drab animals he found a fawn but the doe was close by and made an ugly fight for her young andoo had to leave the fawn but as her blood was up she stuck to the attack and at last he got in a blow of his paw on her nose and so got hold of her more meat but less delicacy and the shebear following had her share the next afternoon curiously enough the very fellow of the first white rock fell and smashed precisely according to precedent  the aim of the third that fell the night after however was better it hit andoos unspeculative skull with a crack that echoed up the cliff and the white fragments went dancing to all the points of the compass the shebear coming after him and sniffing curiously at him found him lying in an odd sort of attitude with his head wet and all out of shape she was a young shebear and inexperienced and having sniffed about him for some time and licked him a little and so forth she decided to leave him until the odd mood had passed and went on her hunting alone  she looked up the fawn of the red doe they had killed two nights ago and found it but it was lonely hunting without andoo and she returned caveward before dawn the sky was grey and overcast the trees up the gorge were black and unfamiliar and into her ursine mind came a dim sense of strange and dreary happenings she lifted up her voice and called andoo by name the sides of the gorge reechoed her  as she approached the caves she saw in the half light and heard a couple of jackals scuttle off and immediately after a hyæna howled and a dozen clumsy bulks went lumbering up the slope and stopped and yelled derision lord of the rocks and cavesyaha came down the wind the dismal feeling in the shebears mind became suddenly acute she shuffled across the amphitheatre  yaha said the hyænas retreating yaha  the cave bear was not lying quite in the same attitude because the hyænas had been busy and in one place his ribs showed white dotted over the turf about him lay the smashed fragments of the three great lumps of chalk and the air was full of the scent of death  the shebear stopped dead even now that the great and wonderful andoo was killed was beyond her believing then she heard far overhead a sound a queer sound a little like the shout of a hyæna but fuller and lower in pitch she looked up her little dawnblinded eyes seeing little her nostrils quivering and there on the cliff edge far above her against the bright pink of dawn were two little shaggy round dark things the heads of eudena and ughlomi as they shouted derision at her but though she could not see them very distinctly she could hear and dimly she began to apprehend a novel feeling as of imminent strange evils came into her heart  she began to examine the smashed fragments of chalk that lay about andoo for a space she stood still looking about her and making a low continuous sound that was almost a moan then she went back incredulously to andoo to make one last effort to rouse him   iiithe first horseman  in the days before ughlomi there was little trouble between the horses and men they lived apartthe men in the river swamps and thickets the horses on the wide grassy uplands between the chestnuts and the pines sometimes a pony would come straying into the clogging marshes to make a flinthacked meal and sometimes the tribe would find one the kill of a lion and drive off the jackals and feast heartily while the sun was high these horses of the old time were clumsy at the fetlock and duncoloured with a rough tail and big head they came every springtime northwestward into the country after the swallows and before the hippopotami as the grass on the wide downland stretches grew long they came only in small bodies thus far each herd a stallion and two or three mares and a foal or so having its own stretch of country and they went again when the chestnuttrees were yellow and the wolves came down the wealden mountains  it was their custom to graze right out in the open going into cover only in the heat of the day they avoided the long stretches of thorn and beechwood preferring an isolated group of trees void of ambuscade so that it was hard to come upon them they were never fighters their heels and teeth were for one another but in the clear country once they were started no living thing came near them though perhaps the elephant might have done so had he felt the need and in those days man seemed a harmless thing enough no whisper of prophetic intelligence told the species of the terrible slavery that was to come of the whip and spur and bearingrein the clumsy load and the slippery street the insufficient food and the knackers yard that was to replace the wide grassland and the freedom of the earth  down in the wey marshes ughlomi and eudena had never seen the horses closely but now they saw them every day as the two of them raided out from their lair on the ledge in the gorge raiding together in search of food they had returned to the ledge after the killing of andoo for of the shebear they were not afraid the shebear had become afraid of them and when she winded them she went aside the two went together everywhere for since they had left the tribe eudena was not so much ughlomis woman as his mate she learnt to hunt evenas much that is as any woman could she was indeed a marvellous woman he would lie for hours watching a beast or planning catches in that shock head of his and she would stay beside him with her bright eyes upon him offering no irritating suggestionsas still as any man a wonderful woman  at the top of the cliff was an open grassy lawn and then beechwoods and going through the beechwoods one came to the edge of the rolling grassy expanse and in sight of the horses here on the edge of the wood and bracken were the rabbitburrows and here among the fronds eudena and ughlomi would lie with their throwingstones ready until the little people came out to nibble and play in the sunset and while eudena would sit a silent figure of watchfulness regarding the burrows ughlomis eyes were ever away across the greensward at those wonderful grazing strangers  in a dim way he appreciated their grace and their supple nimbleness as the sun declined in the eveningtime and the heat of the day passed they would become active would start chasing one another neighing dodging shaking their manes coming round in great curves sometimes so close that the pounding of the turf sounded like hurried thunder it looked so fine that ughlomi wanted to join in badly and sometimes one would roll over on the turf kicking four hoofs heavenward which seemed formidable and was certainly much less alluring  dim imaginings ran through ughlomis mind as he watchedby virtue of which two rabbits lived the longer and sleeping his brains were clearer and bolderfor that was the way in those days he came near the horses he dreamt and fought smitingstone against hoof but then the horses changed to men or at least to men with horses heads and he awoke in a cold sweat of terror  yet the next day in the morning as the horses were grazing one of the mares whinnied and they saw ughlomi coming up the wind they all stopped their eating and watched him ughlomi was not coming towards them but strolling obliquely across the open looking at anything in the world but horses he had stuck three fernfronds into the mat of his hair giving him a remarkable appearance and he walked very slowly whats up now said the master horse who was capable but inexperienced  it looks more like the first half of an animal than anything else in the world he said forelegs and no hind  its only one of those pink monkey things said the eldest mare theyre a sort of river monkey theyre quite common on the plains  ughlomi continued his oblique advance the eldest mare was struck with the want of motive in his proceedings  fool said the eldest mare in a quick conclusive way she had she resumed her grazing the master horse and the second mare followed suit  look hes nearer said the foal with a stripe  one of the younger foals made uneasy movements ughlomi squatted down and sat regarding the horses fixedly in a little while he was satisfied that they meant neither flight nor hostilities he began to consider his next procedure he did not feel anxious to kill but he had his axe with him and the spirit of sport was upon him how would one kill one of these creaturesthese great beautiful creatures  eudena watching him with a fearful admiration from the cover of the bracken saw him presently go on all fours and so proceed again but the horses preferred him a biped to a quadruped and the master horse threw up his head and gave the word to move ughlomi thought they were off for good but after a minutes gallop they came round in a wide curve and stood winding him then as a rise in the ground hid him they tailed out the master horse leading and approached him spirally  he was as ignorant of the possibilities of a horse as they were of his and at this stage it would seem he funked he knew this kind of stalking would make red deer or buffalo charge if it were persisted in at any rate eudena saw him jump up and come walking towards her with the fern plumes held in his hand  she stood up and he grinned to show that the whole thing was an immense lark and that what he had done was just what he had planned to do from the very beginning so that incident ended but he was very thoughtful all that day  the next day this foolish drab creature with the leonine mane instead of going about the grazing or hunting he was made for was prowling round the horses again the eldest mare was all for silent contempt i suppose he wants to learn something from us she said and let him the next day he was at it again the master horse decided he meant absolutely nothing but as a matter of fact ughlomi the first of men to feel that curious spell of the horse that binds us even to this day meant a great deal he admired them unreservedly there was a rudiment of the snob in him i am afraid and he wanted to be near these beautifullycurved animals then there were vague conceptions of a kill if only they would let him come near them but they drew the line he found at fifty yards if he came nearer than that they moved offwith dignity i suppose it was the way he had blinded andoo that made him think of leaping on the back of one of them but though eudena after a time came out in the open too and they did some unobtrusive stalking things stopped there  then one memorable day a new idea came to ughlomi the horse looks down and level but he does not look up no animals look upthey have too much commonsense it was only that fantastic creature man could waste his wits skyward ughlomi made no philosophical deductions but he perceived the thing was so so he spent a weary day in a beech that stood in the open while eudena stalked usually the horses went into the shade in the heat of the afternoon but that day the sky was overcast and they would not in spite of eudenas solicitude  it was two days after that that ughlomi had his desire the day was blazing hot and the multiplying flies asserted themselves the horses stopped grazing before midday and came into the shadow below him and stood in couples nose to tail flapping  the master horse by virtue of his heels came closest to the tree and suddenly there was a rustle and a creak a thud then a sharp chipped flint bit him on the cheek the master horse stumbled came on one knee rose to his feet and was off like the wind the air was full of the whirl of limbs the prance of hoofs and snorts of alarm ughlomi was pitched a foot in the air came down again up again his stomach was hit violently and then his knees got a grip of something between them he found himself clutching with knees feet and hands careering violently with extraordinary oscillation through the airhis axe gone heaven knows whither hold tight said mother instinct and he did  he was aware of a lot of coarse hair in his face some of it between his teeth and of green turf streaming past in front of his eyes he saw the shoulder of the master horse vast and sleek with the muscles flowing swiftly under the skin he perceived that his arms were round the neck and that the violent jerkings he experienced had a sort of rhythm  then he was in the midst of a wild rush of treestems and then there were fronds of bracken about and then more open turf then a stream of pebbles rushing past little pebbles flying sideways athwart the stream from the blow of the swift hoofs ughlomi began to feel frightfully sick and giddy but he was not the stuff to leave go simply because he was uncomfortable  he dared not leave his grip but he tried to make himself more comfortable he released his hug on the neck gripping the mane instead he slipped his knees forward and pushing back came into a sitting position where the quarters broaden it was nervous work but he managed it and at last he was fairly seated astride breathless indeed and uncertain but with that frightful pounding of his body at any rate relieved  slowly the fragments of ughlomis mind got into order again the pace seemed to him terrific but a kind of exultation was beginning to oust his first frantic terror the air rushed by sweet and wonderful the rhythm of the hoofs changed and broke up and returned into itself again they were on turf now a wide gladethe beechtrees a hundred yards away on either side and a succulent band of green starred with pink blossom and shot with silver water here and there meandered down the middle far off was a glimpse of blue valleyfar away the exultation grew it was mans first taste of pace  then came a wide space dappled with flying fallow deer scattering this way and that and then a couple of jackals mistaking ughlomi for a lion came hurrying after him and when they saw it was not a lion they still came on out of curiosity on galloped the horse with his one idea of escape and after him the jackals with pricked ears and quicklybarked remarks which kills which said the first jackal its the horse being killed said the second they gave the howl of following and the horse answered to it as a horse answers nowadays to the spur  on they rushed a little tornado through the quiet day putting up startled birds sending a dozen unexpected things darting to cover raising a myriad of indignant dungflies smashing little blossoms flowering complacently back into their parental turf trees again and then splash splash across a torrent then a hare shot out of a tuft of grass under the very hoofs of the master horse and the jackals left them incontinently so presently they broke into the open again a wide expanse of turfy hillsidethe very grassy downs that fall northward nowadays from the epsom stand  the first hot bolt of the master horse was long since over he was falling into a measured trot and ughlomi albeit bruised exceedingly and quite uncertain of the future was in a state of glorious enjoyment and now came a new development the pace broke again the master horse came round on a short curve and stopped dead  ughlomi became alert he wished he had a flint but the throwingflint he had carried in a thong about his waist waslike the axeheaven knows where the master horse turned his head and ughlomi became aware of an eye and teeth he whipped his leg into a position of security and hit at the cheek with his fist then the head went down somewhere out of existence apparently and the back he was sitting on flew up into a dome ughlomi became a thing of instinct againstrictly prehensile he held by knees and feet and his head seemed sliding towards the turf his fingers were twisted into the shock of mane and the rough hair of the horse saved him the gradient he was on lowered again and thenwhup said ughlomi astonished and the slant was the other way up but ughlomi was a thousand generations nearer the primordial than man no monkey could have held on better and the lion had been training the horse for countless generations against the tactics of rolling and rearing back but he kicked like a master and buckjumped rather neatly in five minutes ughlomi lived a lifetime if he came off the horse would kill him he felt assured  then the master horse decided to stick to his old tactics again and suddenly went off at a gallop he headed down the slope taking the steep places at a rush swerving neither to the right nor to the left and as they rode down the wide expanse of valley sank out of sight behind the approaching skirmishers of oak and hawthorn they skirted a sudden hollow with the pool of a spring rank weeds and silver bushes the ground grew softer and the grass taller and on the righthand side and the left came scattered bushes of maystill splashed with belated blossom presently the bushes thickened until they lashed the passing rider and little flashes and gouts of blood came out on horse and man then the way opened again  and then came a wonderful adventure a sudden squeal of unreasonable anger rose amidst the bushes the squeal of some creature bitterly wronged and crashing after them appeared a big greyblue shape it was yaaa the bighorned rhinoceros in one of those fits of fury of his charging full tilt after the manner of his kind he had been startled at his feeding and someone it did not matter who was to be ripped and trampled therefore he was bearing down on them from the left with his wicked little eye red his great horn down and his tail like a jurymast behind him for a minute ughlomi was minded to slip off and dodge and then behold the staccato of the hoofs grew swifter and the rhinoceros and his stumpy hurrying little legs seemed to slide out at the back corner of ughlomis eye in two minutes they were through the bushes of may and out in the open going fast for a space he could hear the ponderous paces in pursuit receding behind him and then it was just as if yaaa had not lost his temper as if yaaa had never existed  the pace never faltered on they rode and on  ughlomi was now all exultation to exult in those days was to insult yaha big nose he said trying to crane back and see some remote speck of a pursuer why dont you carry your smitingstone in your fist he ended with a frantic whoop  but that whoop was unfortunate for coming close to the ear of the horse and being quite unexpected it startled the stallion extremely he shied violently ughlomi suddenly found himself uncomfortable again he was hanging on to the horse he found by one arm and one knee  the rest of the ride was honourable but unpleasant the view was chiefly of blue sky and that was combined with the most unpleasant physical sensations finally a bush of thorn lashed him and he let go  he hit the ground with his cheek and shoulder and then after a complicated and extraordinarily rapid movement hit it again with the end of his backbone he saw splashes and sparks of light and colour the ground seemed bouncing about just like the horse had done then he found he was sitting on turf six yards beyond the bush in front of him was a space of grass growing greener and greener and a number of human beings in the distance and the horse was going round at a smart gallop quite a long way off to the right  the human beings were on the opposite side of the river some still in the water but they were all running away as hard as they could go the advent of a monster that took to pieces was not the sort of novelty they cared for for quite a minute ughlomi sat regarding them in a purely spectacular spirit the bend of the river the knoll among the reeds and royal ferns the thin streams of smoke going up to heaven were all perfectly familiar to him it was the squattingplace of the sons of uya of uya from whom he had fled with eudena and whom he had waylaid in the chestnut woods and killed with the first axe  he rose to his feet still dazed from his fall and as he did so the scattering fugitives turned and regarded him some pointed to the receding horse and chattered he walked slowly towards them staring he forgot the horse he forgot his own bruises in the growing interest of this encounter there were fewer of them than there had beenhe supposed the others must have hidthe heap of fern for the night fire was not so high by the flint heaps should have sat waubut then he remembered he had killed wau suddenly brought back to this familiar scene the gorge and the bears and eudena seemed things remote things dreamt of  he stopped at the bank and stood regarding the tribe his mathematical abilities were of the slightest but it was certain there were fewer the men might be away but there were fewer women and children he gave the shout of homecoming his quarrel had been with uya and waunot with the others children of uya he cried they answered with his name a little fearfully because of the strange way he had come  for a space they spoke together then an old woman lifted a shrill voice and answered him our lord is a lion  ughlomi did not understand that saying they answered him again several together uya comes again he comes as a lion our lord is a lion he comes at night he slays whom he will but none other may slay us ughlomi none other may slay us  still ughlomi did not understand  our lord is a lion he speaks no more to men  ughlomi stood regarding them he had had dreamshe knew that though he had killed uya uya still existed and now they told him uya was a lion  the shrivelled old woman the mistress of the fireminders suddenly turned and spoke softly to those next to her she was a very old woman indeed she had been the first of uyas wives and he had let her live beyond the age to which it is seemly a woman should be permitted to live she had been cunning from the first cunning to please uya and to get food and now she was great in counsel she spoke softly and ughlomi watched her shrivelled form across the river with a curious distaste then she called aloud come over to us ughlomi  a girl suddenly lifted up her voice come over to us ughlomi she said and they all began crying come over to us ughlomi  it was strange how their manner changed after the old woman called  he stood quite still watching them all it was pleasant to be called and the girl who had called first was a pretty one but she made him think of eudena  come over to us ughlomi they cried and the voice of the shrivelled old woman rose above them all at the sound of her voice his hesitation returned  he stood on the river bank ughlomiugh the thinkerwith his thoughts slowly taking shape presently one and then another paused to see what he would do he was minded to go back he was minded not to suddenly his fear or his caution got the upper hand without answering them he turned and walked back towards the distant thorntrees the way he had come forthwith the whole tribe started crying to him again very eagerly he hesitated and turned then he went on then he turned again and then once again regarding them with troubled eyes as they called the last time he took two paces back before his fear stopped him they saw him stop once more and suddenly shake his head and vanish among the hawthorntrees  then all the women and children lifted up their voices together and called to him in one last vain effort  far down the river the reeds were stirring in the breeze where convenient for his new sort of feeding the old lion who had taken to maneating had made his lair  the old woman turned her face that way and pointed to the hawthorn thickets uya she screamed there goes thine enemy there goes thine enemy uya why do you devour us nightly we have tried to snare him there goes thine enemy uya  but the lion who preyed upon the tribe was taking his siesta the cry went unheard that day he had dined on one of the plumper girls and his mood was a comfortable placidity he really did not understand that he was uya or that ughlomi was his enemy  so it was that ughlomi rode the horse and heard first of uya the lion who had taken the place of uya the master and was eating up the tribe and as he hurried back to the gorge his mind was no longer full of the horse but of the thought that uya was still alive to slay or be slain over and over again he saw the shrunken band of women and children crying that uya was a lion uya was a lion  and presently fearing the twilight might come upon him ughlomi began running   ivuya the lion  the old lion was in luck the tribe had a certain pride in their ruler but that was all the satisfaction they got out of it he came the very night that ughlomi killed uya the cunning and so it was they named him uya it was the old woman the fireminder who first named him uya a shower had lowered the fires to a glow and made the night dark and as they conversed together and peered at one another in the darkness and wondered fearfully what uya would do to them in their dreams now that he was dead they heard the mounting reverberations of the lions roar close at hand then everything was still  they held their breath so that almost the only sounds were the patter of the rain and the hiss of the raindrops in the ashes and then after an interminable time a crash and a shriek of fear and a growling they sprang to their feet shouting screaming running this way and that but brands would not burn and in a minute the victim was being dragged away through the ferns it was irk the brother of wau  so the lion came  the ferns were still wet from the rain the next night and he came and took click with the red hair that sufficed for two nights and then in the dark between the moons he came three nights night after night and that though they had good fires he was an old lion with stumpy teeth but very silent and very cool he knew of fires before these were not the first of mankind that had ministered to his old age the third night he came between the outer fire and the inner and he leapt the flint heap and pulled down irm the son of irk who had seemed like to be the leader that was a dreadful night because they lit great flares of fern and ran screaming and the lion missed his hold of irm by the glare of the fire they saw irm struggle up and run a little way towards them and then the lion in two bounds had him down again that was the last of irm  so fear came and all the delight of spring passed out of their lives already there were five gone out of the tribe and four nights added three more to the number foodseeking became spiritless none knew who might go next and all day the women toiled even the favourite women gathering litter and sticks for the night fires and the hunters hunted ill in the warm springtime hunger came again as though it was still winter the tribe might have moved had they had a leader but they had no leader and none knew where to go that the lion could not follow them so the old lion waxed fat and thanked heaven for the kindly race of men two of the children and a youth died while the moon was still new and then it was the shrivelled old fireminder first bethought herself in a dream of eudena and ughlomi and of the way uya had been slain she had lived in fear of uya all her days and now she lived in fear of the lion that ughlomi could kill uya for goodughlomi whom she had seen bornwas impossible it was uya still seeking his enemy  and then came the strange return of ughlomi a wonderful animal seen galloping far across the river that suddenly changed into two animals a horse and a man following this portent the vision of ughlomi on the farther bank of the river yes it was all plain to her uya was punishing them because they had not hunted down ughlomi and eudena  the men came straggling back to the chances of the night while the sun was still golden in the sky they were received with the story of ughlomi she went across the river with them and showed them his spoor hesitating on the farther bank siss the tracker knew the feet for ughlomis uya needs ughlomi cried the old woman standing on the left of the bend a gesticulating figure of flaring bronze in the sunset her cries were strange sounds flitting to and fro on the borderland of speech but this was the sense they carried the lion needs eudena he comes night after night seeking eudena and ughlomi when he cannot find eudena and ughlomi he grows angry and he kills hunt eudena and ughlomi eudena whom he pursued and ughlomi for whom he gave the deathword hunt eudena and ughlomi  she turned to the distant reedbed as sometimes she had turned to uya in his life is it not so my lord she cried and as if in answer the tall reeds bowed before a breath of wind  far into the twilight the sound of hacking was heard from the squattingplaces it was the men sharpening their ashen spears against the hunting of the morrow and in the night early before the moon rose the lion came and took the girl of siss the tracker  in the morning before the sun had risen siss the tracker and the lad wauhau who now chipped flints and one eye and bo and the snaileater the two redhaired men and catsskin and snake all the men that were left alive of the sons of uya taking their ash spears and their smitingstones and with throwingstones in the beastpaw bags started forth upon the trail of ughlomi through the hawthorn thickets where yaaa the rhinoceros and his brothers were feeding and up the bare downland towards the beechwoods  that night the fires burnt high and fierce as the waxing moon set and the lion left the crouching women and children in peace  and the next day while the sun was still high the hunters returnedall save one eye who lay dead with a smashed skull at the foot of the ledge when ughlomi came back that evening from stalking the horses he found the vultures already busy over him and with them the hunters brought eudena bruised and wounded but alive that had been the strange order of the shrivelled old woman that she was to be brought aliveshe is no kill for us she is for uya the lion her hands were tied with thongs as though she had been a man and she came weary and droopingher hair over her eyes and matted with blood they walked about her and ever and again the snaileater whose name she had given would laugh and strike her with his ashen spear and after he had struck her with his spear he would look over his shoulder like one who had done an overbold deed the others too looked over their shoulders ever and again and all were in a hurry save eudena when the old woman saw them coming she cried aloud with joy  they made eudena cross the river with her hands tied although the current was strong and when she slipped the old woman screamed first with joy and then for fear she might be drowned and when they had dragged eudena to shore she could not stand for a time albeit they beat her sore so they let her sit with her feet touching the water and her eyes staring before her and her face set whatever they might do or say all the tribe came down to the squattingplace even curly little haha who as yet could scarcely toddle and stood staring at eudena and the old woman as now we should stare at some strange wounded beast and its captor  the old woman tore off the necklace of uya that was about eudenas neck and put it on herselfshe had been the first to wear it then she tore at eudenas hair and took a spear from siss and beat her with all her might and when she had vented the warmth of her heart on the girl she looked closely into her face eudenas eyes were closed and her features were set and she lay so still that for a moment the old woman feared she was dead and then her nostrils quivered at that the old woman slapped her face and laughed and gave the spear to siss again and went a little way off from her and began to talk and jeer at her after her manner  the old woman had more words than any in the tribe and her talk was a terrible thing to hear sometimes she screamed and moaned incoherently and sometimes the shape of her guttural cries was the mere phantom of thoughts but she conveyed to eudena nevertheless much of the things that were yet to come of the lion and of the torment he would do her and ughlomi ha ha ughlomi is slain  and suddenly eudenas eyes opened and she sat up again and her look met the old womans fair and level no she said slowly like one trying to remember i did not see my ughlomi slain i did not see my ughlomi slain  tell her cried the old woman tell herhe that killed him tell her how ughlomi was slain  she looked and all the women and children there looked from man to man  none answered her they stood shamefaced  tell her said the old woman the men looked at one another  eudenas face suddenly lit  tell her she said tell her mighty men tell her the killing of ughlomi  the old woman rose and struck her sharply across her mouth  we could not find ughlomi said siss the tracker slowly who hunts two kills none  then eudenas heart leapt but she kept her face hard it was as well for the old woman looked at her sharply with murder in her eyes  then the old woman turned her tongue upon the men because they had feared to go on after ughlomi she dreaded no one now uya was slain she scolded them as one scolds children and they scowled at her and began to accuse one another until suddenly siss the tracker raised his voice and bade her hold her peace  and so when the sun was setting they took eudena and wentthough their hearts sank within themalong the trail the old lion had made in the reeds all the men went together at one place was a group of alders and here they hastily bound eudena where the lion might find her when he came abroad in the twilight and having done so they hurried back until they were near the squattingplace then they stopped siss stopped first and looked back again at the alders they could see her head even from the squattingplace a little black shock under the limb of the larger tree that was as well  all the women and children stood watching upon the crest of the mound and the old woman stood and screamed for the lion to take her whom he sought and counselled him on the torments he might do her  eudena was very weary now stunned by beatings and fatigue and sorrow and only the fear of the thing that was still to come upheld her the sun was broad and bloodred between the stems of the distant chestnuts and the west was all on fire the evening breeze had died to a warm tranquillity the air was full of midge swarms the fish in the river hard by would leap at times and now and again a cockchafer would drone through the air out of the corner of her eye eudena could see a part of the squattingknoll and little figures standing and staring at her anda very little sound but very clearshe could hear the beating of the firestone dark and near to her and still was the reedfringed thicket of the lair  presently the firestone ceased she looked for the sun and found he had gone and overhead and growing brighter was the waxing moon she looked towards the thicket of the lair seeking shapes in the reeds and then suddenly she began to wriggle and wriggle weeping and calling upon ughlomi  but ughlomi was far away when they saw her head moving with her struggles they shouted together on the knoll and she desisted and was still and then came the bats and the star that was like ughlomi crept out of its blue hidingplace in the west she called to it but softly because she feared the lion and all through the coming of the twilight the thicket was still  so the dark crept upon eudena and the moon grew bright and the shadows of things that had fled up the hillside and vanished with the evening came back to them short and black and the dark shapes in the thicket of reeds and alders where the lion lay gathered and a faint stir began there but nothing came out therefrom all through the gathering of the darkness  she looked at the squattingplace and saw the fires glowing smokyred and the men and women going to and fro the other way over the river a white mist was rising then far away came the whimpering of young foxes and the yell of a hyæna  there were long gaps of aching waiting after a long time some animal splashed in the water and seemed to cross the river at the ford beyond the lair but what animal it was she could not see from the distant drinkingpools she could hear the sound of splashing and the noise of elephantsso still was the night  the earth was now a colourless arrangement of white reflections and impenetrable shadows under the blue sky the silvery moon was already spotted with the filigree crests of the chestnut woods and over the shadowy eastward hills the stars were multiplying the knoll fires were bright red now and black figures stood waiting against them they were waiting for a scream surely it would be soon  the night suddenly seemed full of movement she held her breath things were passingone two threesubtly sneaking shadows jackals  then a long waiting again  then asserting itself as real at once over all the sounds her mind had imagined came a stir in the thicket then a vigorous movement there was a snap the reeds crashed heavily once twice thrice and then everything was still save a measured swishing she heard a low tremulous growl and then everything was still again the stillness lengthenedwould it never end she held her breath she bit her lips to stop screaming then something scuttled through the undergrowth her scream was involuntary she did not hear the answering yell from the mound  immediately the thicket woke up to vigorous movement again she saw the grass stems waving in the light of the setting moon the alders swaying she struggled violentlyher last struggle but nothing came towards her a dozen monsters seemed rushing about in that little place for a couple of minutes and then again came silence the moon sank behind the distant chestnuts and the night was dark  then an odd sound a sobbing panting that grew faster and fainter yet another silence and then dim sounds and the grunting of some animal  everything was still again far away eastwards an elephant trumpeted and from the woods came a snarling and yelping that died away  in the long interval the moon shone out again between the stems of the trees on the ridge sending two great bars of light and a bar of darkness across the reedy waste then came a steady rustling a splash and the reeds swayed wider and wider apart and at last they broke open cleft from root to crest the end had come  she looked to see the thing that had come out of the reeds for a moment it seemed certainly the great head and jaw she expected and then it dwindled and changed it was a dark low thing that remained silent but it was not the lion it became stilleverything became still she peered it was like some gigantic frog two limbs and a slanting body its head moved about searching the shadows  a rustle and it moved clumsily with a sort of hopping and as it moved it gave a low groan  the blood rushing through her veins was suddenly joy ughlomi she whispered  the thing stopped eudena he answered softly with pain in his voice and peering into the alders  he moved again and came out of the shadow beyond the reeds into the moonlight all his body was covered with dark smears she saw he was dragging his legs and that he gripped his axe the first axe in one hand in another moment he had struggled into the position of all fours and had staggered over to her the lion he said in a strange mingling of exultation and anguish waui have slain a lion with my own hand even as i slew the great bear he moved to emphasise his words and suddenly broke off with a faint cry for a space he did not move  let me free whispered eudena  he answered her no words but pulled himself up from his crawling attitude by means of the alder stem and hacked at her thongs with the sharp edge of his axe she heard him sob at each blow he cut away the thongs about her chest and arms and then his hand dropped his chest struck against her shoulder and he slipped down beside her and lay still  but the rest of her release was easy very hastily she freed herself she made one step from the tree and her head was spinning her last conscious movement was towards him she reeled and dropped her hand fell upon his thigh it was soft and wet and gave way under her pressure he cried out at her touch and writhed and lay still again  presently a dark doglike shape came very softly through the reeds then stopped dead and stood sniffing hesitated and at last turned and slunk back into the shadows  long was the time they remained there motionless with the light of the setting moon shining on their limbs very slowly as slowly as the setting of the moon did the shadow of the reeds towards the mound flow over them presently their legs were hidden and ughlomi was but a bust of silver the shadow crept to his neck crept over his face and so at last the darkness of the night swallowed them up  the shadow became full of instinctive stirrings there was a patter of feet and a faint snarlingthe sound of a blow                                       there was little sleep that night for the women and children at the squattingplace until they heard eudena scream but the men were weary and sat dozing when eudena screamed they felt assured of their safety and hurried to get the nearest places to the fires the old woman laughed at the scream and laughed again because si the little friend of eudena whimpered directly the dawn came they were all alert and looking towards the alders they could see that eudena had been taken they could not help feeling glad to think that uya was appeased but across the minds of the men the thought of ughlomi fell like a shadow they could understand revenge for the world was old in revenge but they did not think of rescue suddenly a hyæna fled out of the thicket and came galloping across the reed space his muzzle and paws were darkstained at that sight all the men shouted and clutched at throwingstones and ran towards him for no animal is so pitiful a coward as the hyæna by day all men hated the hyæna because he preyed on children and would come and bite when one was sleeping on the edge of the squattingplace and catsskin throwing fair and straight hit the brute shrewdly on the flank whereat the whole tribe yelled with delight  at the noise they made there came a flapping of wings from the lair of the lion and three whiteheaded vultures rose slowly and circled and came to rest amidst the branches of an alder overlooking the lair our lord is abroad said the old woman pointing the vultures have their share of eudena for a space they remained there and then first one and then another dropped back into the thicket  then over the eastern woods and touching the whole world to life and colour poured with the exaltation of a trumpet blast the light of the rising sun at the sight of him the children shouted together and clapped their hands and began to race off towards the water only little si lagged behind and looked wonderingly at the alders where she had seen the head of eudena overnight  but uya the old lion was not abroad but at home and he lay very still and a little on one side he was not in his lair but a little way from it in a place of trampled grass under one eye was a little wound the feeble little bite of the first axe but all the ground beneath his chest was ruddy brown with a vivid streak and in his chest was a little hole that had been made by ughlomis stabbingspear along his side and at his neck the vultures had marked their claims for so ughlomi had slain him lying stricken under his paw and thrusting haphazard at his chest he had driven the spear in with all his strength and stabbed the giant to the heart so it was the reign of the lion of the second incarnation of uya the master came to an end  from the knoll the bustle of preparation grew the hacking of spears and throwingstones none spake the name of ughlomi for fear that it might bring him the men were going to keep together close together in the hunting for a day or so and their hunting was to be ughlomi lest instead he should come ahunting them  but ughlomi was lying very still and silent outside the lions lair and eudena squatted beside him with the ash spear all smeared with lions blood gripped in her hand   vthe fight in the lions thicket  ughlomi lay still his back against an alder and his thigh was a red mass terrible to see no civilised man could have lived who had been so sorely wounded but eudena got him thorns to close his wounds and squatted beside him day and night smiting the flies from him with a fan of reeds by day and in the night threatening the hyænas with the first axe in her hand and in a little while he began to heal it was high summer and there was no rain little food they had during the first two days his wounds were open in the low place where they hid were no roots nor little beasts and the stream with its watersnails and fish was in the open a hundred yards away she could not go abroad by day for fear of the tribe her brothers and sisters nor by night for fear of the beasts both on his account and hers so they shared the lion with the vultures but there was a trickle of water near by and eudena brought him plenty in her hands  where ughlomi lay was well hidden from the tribe by a thicket of alders and all fenced about with bulrushes and tall reeds the dead lion he had killed lay near his old lair on a place of trampled reeds fifty yards away in sight through the reedstems and the vultures fought each other for the choicest pieces and kept the jackals off him very soon a cloud of flies that looked like bees hung over him and ughlomi could hear their humming and when ughlomis flesh was already healingand it was not many days before that beganonly a few bones of the lion remained scattered and shining white  for the most part ughlomi sat still during the day looking before him at nothing sometimes he would mutter of the horses and bears and lions and sometimes he would beat the ground with the first axe and say the names of the tribehe seemed to have no fear of bringing the tribefor hours together but chiefly he slept dreaming little because of his loss of blood and the slightness of his food during the short summer night both kept awake all the while the darkness lasted things moved about them things they never saw by day for some nights the hyænas did not come and then one moonless night near a dozen came and fought for what was left of the lion the night was a tumult of growling and ughlomi and eudena could hear the bones snap in their teeth but they knew the hyæna dare not attack any creature alive and awake and so they were not greatly afraid  of a daytime eudena would go along the narrow path the old lion had made in the reeds until she was beyond the bend and then she would creep into the thicket and watch the tribe she would lie close by the alders where they had bound her to offer her up to the lion and thence she could see them on the knoll by the fire small and clear as she had seen them that night but she told ughlomi little of what she saw because she feared to bring them by their names for so they believed in those days that naming called  she saw the men prepare stabbingspears and throwingstones on the morning after ughlomi had slain the lion and go out to hunt him leaving the women and children on the knoll little they knew how near he was as they tracked off in single file towards the hills with siss the tracker leading them and she watched the women and children after the men had gone gathering fernfronds and twigs for the night fire and the boys and girls running and playing together but the very old woman made her feel afraid towards noon when most of the others were down at the stream by the bend she came and stood on the hither side of the knoll a gnarled brown figure and gesticulated so that eudena could scarce believe she was not seen eudena lay like a hare in its form with shining eyes fixed on the bent witch away there and presently she dimly understood it was the lion the old woman was worshippingthe lion ughlomi had slain  and the next day the hunters came back weary carrying a fawn and eudena watched the feast enviously and then came a strange thing she sawdistinctly she heardthe old woman shrieking and gesticulating and pointing towards her she was afraid and crept like a snake out of sight again but presently curiosity overcame her and she was back at her spyingplace and as she peered her heart stopped for there were all the men with their weapons in their hands walking together towards her from the knoll  she dared not move lest her movement should be seen but she pressed herself close to the ground the sun was low and the golden light was in the faces of the men she saw they carried a piece of rich red meat thrust through by an ashen stake presently they stopped go on screamed the old woman catsskin grumbled and they came on searching the thicket with sundazzled eyes here said siss and they took the ashen stake with the meat upon it and thrust it into the ground uya cried siss behold thy portion and ughlomi we have slain of a truth we have slain ughlomi this day we slew ughlomi and tomorrow we will bring his body to you and the others repeated the words  they looked at each other and behind them and partly turned and began going back at first they walked half turned to the thicket then facing the mound they walked faster looking over their shoulders then faster soon they ran it was a race at last until they were near the knoll then siss who was hindmost was first to slacken his pace  the sunset passed and the twilight came the fires glowed red against the hazy blue of the distant chestnuttrees and the voices over the mound were merry eudena lay scarcely stirring looking from the mound to the meat and then to the mound she was hungry but she was afraid at last she crept back to ughlomi  he looked round at the little rustle of her approach his face was in shadow have you got me some food he said  she said she could find nothing but that she would seek further and went back along the lions path until she could see the mound again but she could not bring herself to take the meat she had the brutes instinct of a snare she felt very miserable  she crept back at last towards ughlomi and heard him stirring and moaning she turned back to the mound again then she saw something in the darkness near the stake and peering distinguished a jackal in a flash she was brave and angry she sprang up cried out and ran towards the offering she stumbled and fell and heard the growling of the jackal going off  when she arose only the ashen stake lay on the ground the meat was gone so she went back to fast through the night with ughlomi and ughlomi was angry with her because she had no food for him but she told him nothing of the things she had seen  two days passed and they were near starving when the tribe slew a horse then came the same ceremony and a haunch was left on the ashen stake but this time eudena did not hesitate  by acting and words she made ughlomi understand but he ate most of the food before he understood and then as her meaning passed to him he grew merry with his food i am uya he said i am the lion i am the great cave bear i who was only ughlomi i am wau the cunning it is well that they should feed me for presently i will kill them all  then eudenas heart was light and she laughed with him and afterwards she ate what he had left of the horseflesh with gladness  after that it was he had a dream and the next day he made eudena bring him the lions teeth and clawsso much of them as she could findand hack him a club of alder and he put the teeth and claws very cunningly into the wood so that the points were outward very long it took him and he blunted two of the teeth hammering them in and was very angry and threw the thing away but afterwards he dragged himself to where he had thrown it and finished ita club of a new sort set with teeth that day there was more meat for them both an offering to the lion from the tribe  it was one daymore than a hands fingers of days more than anyone had skill to countafter ughlomi had made the club that eudena while he was asleep was lying in the thicket watching the squattingplace there had been no meat for three days and the old woman came and worshipped after her manner now while she worshipped eudenas little friend si and another the child of the first girl siss had loved came over the knoll and stood regarding her skinny figure and presently they began to mock her eudena found this entertaining but suddenly the old woman turned on them quickly and saw them for a moment she stood and they stood motionless and then with a shriek of rage she rushed towards them and all three disappeared over the crest of the knoll  presently the children reappeared among the ferns beyond the shoulder of the hill little si ran first for she was an active girl and the other child ran squealing with the old woman close upon her and over the knoll came siss with a bone in his hand and bo and catsskin obsequiously behind him each holding a piece of food and they laughed aloud and shouted to see the old woman so angry and with a shriek the child was caught and the old woman set to work slapping and the child screaming and it was very good afterdinner fun for them little si ran on a little way and stopped at last between fear and curiosity  and suddenly came the mother of the child with hair streaming panting and with a stone in her hand and the old woman turned about like a wild cat she was the equal of any woman was the chief of the fireminders in spite of her years but before she could do anything siss shouted to her and the clamour rose loud other shock heads came into sight it seemed the whole tribe was at home and feasting but the old woman dared not go on wreaking herself on the child siss befriended  everyone made noises and called nameseven little si abruptly the old woman let go of the child she had caught and made a swift run at si for si had no friends and si realising her danger when it was almost upon her made off headlong with a faint cry of terror not heeding whither she ran straight to the lair of the lion she swerved aside into the reeds presently realising now whither she went  but the old woman was a wonderful old woman as active as she was spiteful and she caught si by the streaming hair within thirty yards of eudena all the tribe now was running down the knoll and shouting and laughing ready to see the fun  then something stirred in eudena something that had never stirred in her before and thinking all of little si and nothing of her fear she sprang up from her ambush and ran swiftly forward the old woman did not see her for she was busy beating little sis face with her hand beating with all her heart and suddenly something hard and heavy struck her cheek she went reeling and saw eudena with flaming eyes and cheeks between her and little si she shrieked with astonishment and terror and little si not understanding set off towards the gaping tribe they were quite close now for the sight of eudena had driven their fading fear of the lion out of their heads  in a moment eudena had turned from the cowering old woman and overtaken si si she cried si she caught the child up in her arms as it stopped pressed the naillined face to hers and turned about to run towards her lair the lair of the old lion the old woman stood waisthigh in the reeds and screamed foul things and inarticulate rage but did not dare to intercept her and at the bend of the path eudena looked back and saw all the men of the tribe crying to one another and siss coming at a trot along the lions trail  she ran straight along the narrow way through the reeds to the shady place where ughlomi sat with his healing thigh just awakened by the shouting and rubbing his eyes she came to him a woman with little si in her arms her heart throbbed in her throat ughlomi she cried ughlomi the tribe comes  ughlomi sat staring in stupid astonishment at her and si  she pointed with si in one arm she sought among her feeble store of words to explain she could hear the men calling apparently they had stopped outside she put down si and caught up the new club with the lions teeth and put it into ughlomis hand and ran three yards and picked up the first axe  ah said ughlomi waving the new club and suddenly he perceived the occasion and rolling over began to struggle to his feet  he stood but clumsily he supported himself by one hand against the tree and just touched the ground gingerly with the toe of his wounded leg in the other hand he gripped the new club he looked at his healing thigh and suddenly the reeds began whispering and ceased and whispered again and coming cautiously along the track bending down and holding his firehardened stabbingstick of ash in his hand appeared siss he stopped dead and his eyes met ughlomis  ughlomi forgot he had a wounded leg he stood firmly on both feet something trickled he glanced down and saw a little gout of blood had oozed out along the edge of the healing wound he rubbed his hand there to give him the grip of his club and fixed his eyes again on siss  wau he cried and sprang forward and siss still stooping and watchful drove his stabbingstick up very quickly in an ugly thrust it ripped ughlomis guarding arm and the club came down in a counter that siss was never to understand he fell as an ox falls to the poleaxe at ughlomis feet  to bo it seemed the strangest thing he had a comforting sense of tall reeds on either side and an impregnable rampart siss between him and any danger snaileater was close behind and there was no danger there he was prepared to shove behind and send siss to death or victory that was his place as second man he saw the butt of the spear siss carried leap away from him and suddenly a dull whack and the broad back fell away forward and he looked ughlomi in the face over his prostrate leader it felt to bo as if his heart had fallen down a well he had a throwingstone in one hand and an ashen stabbingstick in the other he did not live to the end of his momentary hesitation which to use  snaileater was a readier man and besides bo did not fall forward as siss had done but gave at his knees and hips crumpling up with the toothed club upon his head the snaileater drove his spear forward swift and straight and took ughlomi in the muscle of the shoulder and then he drove him hard with the smitingstone in his other hand shouting out as he did so the new club swished ineffectually through the reeds eudena saw ughlomi come staggering back from the narrow path into the open space tripping over siss and with a foot of ashen stake sticking out of him over his arm and then the snaileater whose name she had given had his final injury from her as his exultant face came out of the reeds after his spear for she swung the first axe swift and high and hit him fair and square on the temple and down he went on siss at prostrate ughlomis feet  but before ughlomi could get up the two redhaired men were tumbling out of the reeds spears and smitingstones ready and snake hard behind them one she struck on the neck but not to fell him and he blundered aside and spoilt his brothers blow at ughlomis head in a moment ughlomi dropped his club and had his assailant by the waist and had pitched him sideways sprawling he snatched at his club again and recovered it the man eudena had hit stabbed at her with his spear as he stumbled from her blow and involuntarily she gave ground to avoid him he hesitated between her and ughlomi half turned gave a vague cry at finding ughlomi so near and in a moment ughlomi had him by the throat and the club had its third victim as he went down ughlomi shoutedno words but an exultant cry  the other redhaired man was six feet from her with his back to her and a darker red streaking his head he was struggling to his feet she had an irrational impulse to stop his rising she flung the axe at him missed saw his face in profile and he had swerved beyond little si and was running through the reeds she had a transitory vision of snake standing in the throat of the path half turned away from her and then she saw his back she saw the club whirling through the air and the shock head of ughlomi with blood in the hair and blood upon the shoulder vanishing below the reeds in pursuit then she heard snake scream like a woman  she ran past si to where the handle of the axe stuck out of a clump of fern and turning found herself panting and alone with three motionless bodies the air was full of shouts and screams for a space she was sick and giddy and then it came into her head that ughlomi was being killed along the reedpath and with an inarticulate cry she leapt over the body of bo and hurried after him snakes feet lay across the path and his head was among the reeds she followed the path until it bent round and opened out by the alders and thence she saw all that was left of the tribe in the open scattering like dead leaves before a gale and going back over the knoll ughlomi was hard upon catsskin  but catsskin was fleet of foot and got away and so did young wauhau when ughlomi turned upon him and ughlomi pursued wauhau far beyond the knoll before he desisted he had the rage of battle on him now and the wood thrust through his shoulder stung him like a spur when she saw he was in no danger she stopped running and stood panting watching the distant active figures run up and vanish one by one over the knoll in a little time she was alone again everything had happened very swiftly the smoke of brother fire rose straight and steady from the squattingplace just as it had done ten minutes ago when the old woman had stood yonder worshipping the lion  and after a long time as it seemed ughlomi reappeared over the knoll and came back to eudena triumphant and breathing heavily she stood her hair about her eyes and hotfaced with the bloodstained axe in her hand at the place where the tribe had offered her as a sacrifice to the lion wau cried ughlomi at the sight of her his face alight with the fellowship of battle and he waved his new club red now and hairy and at the sight of his glowing face her tense pose relaxed somewhat and she stood sobbing and rejoicing  ughlomi had a queer unaccountable pang at the sight of her tears but he only shouted wau the louder and shook the axe east and west he called manfully to her to follow him and turned back striding with the club swinging in his hand towards the squattingplace as if he had never left the tribe and she ceased her weeping and followed quickly as a woman should  so ughlomi and eudena came back to the squattingplace from which they had fled many days before from the face of uya and by the squattingplace lay a deer half eaten just as there had been before ughlomi was man or eudena woman so ughlomi sat down to eat and eudena beside him like a man and the rest of the tribe watched them from safe hidingplaces and after a time one of the elder girls came back timorously carrying little si in her arms and eudena called to them by name and offered them food but the elder girl was afraid and would not come though si struggled to come to eudena afterwards when ughlomi had eaten he sat dozing and at last he slept and slowly the others came out of the hidingplaces and drew near and when ughlomi woke save that there were no men to be seen it seemed as though he had never left the tribe  now there is a thing strange but true that all through this fight ughlomi forgot that he was lame and was not lame and after he had rested behold he was a lame man and he remained a lame man to the end of his days  catsskin and the second redhaired man and wauhau who chipped flints cunningly as his father had done before him fled from the face of ughlomi and none knew where they hid but two days after they came and squatted a good way off from the knoll among the bracken under the chestnuts and watched ughlomis rage had gone he moved to go against them and did not and at sundown they went away that day too they found the old woman among the ferns where ughlomi had blundered upon her when he had pursued wauhau she was dead and more ugly than ever but whole the jackals and vultures had tried her and left hershe was ever a wonderful old woman  the next day the three men came again and squatted nearer and wauhau had two rabbits to hold up and the redhaired man a woodpigeon and ughlomi stood before the women and mocked them  the next day they sat again nearerwithout stones or sticks and with the same offerings and catsskin had a trout it was rare men caught fish in those days but catsskin would stand silently in the water for hours and catch them with his hand and the fourth day ughlomi suffered these three to come to the squattingplace in peace with the food they had with them ughlomi ate the trout thereafter for many moons ughlomi was master and had his will in peace and on the fulness of time he was killed and eaten even as uya had been slain     a story of the days to come     a story of the days to come   ithe cure for love  the excellent mr morris was an englishman and he lived in the days of queen victoria the good he was a prosperous and very sensible man he read the times and went to church and as he grew towards middle age an expression of quiet contented contempt for all who were not as himself settled on his face he was one of those people who do everything that is right and proper and sensible with inevitable regularity he always wore just the right and proper clothes steering the narrow way between the smart and the shabby always subscribed to the right charities just the judicious compromise between ostentation and meanness and never failed to have his hair cut to exactly the proper length  everything that it was right and proper for a man in his position to possess he possessed and everything that it was not right and proper for a man in his position to possess he did not possess  and among other right and proper possessions this mr morris had a wife and children they were the right sort of wife and the right sort and number of children of course nothing imaginative or hightyflighty about any of them so far as mr morris could see they wore perfectly correct clothing neither smart nor hygienic nor faddy in any way but just sensible and they lived in a nice sensible house in the later victorian sham queen anne style of architecture with sham halftimbering of chocolatepainted plaster in the gables lincrusta walton sham carved oak panels a terrace of terra cotta to imitate stone and cathedral glass in the front door his boys went to good solid schools and were put to respectable professions his girls in spite of a fantastic protest or so were all married to suitable steady oldish young men with good prospects and when it was a fit and proper thing for him to do so mr morris died his tomb was of marble and without any art nonsense or laudatory inscription quietly imposingsuch being the fashion of his time  he underwent various changes according to the accepted custom in these cases and long before this story begins his bones even had become dust and were scattered to the four quarters of heaven and his sons and his grandsons and his greatgrandsons and his greatgreatgrandsons they too were dust and ashes and were scattered likewise it was a thing he could not have imagined that a day would come when even his greatgreatgrandsons would be scattered to the four winds of heaven if any one had suggested it to him he would have resented it he was one of those worthy people who take no interest in the future of mankind at all he had grave doubts indeed if there was any future for mankind after he was dead  it seemed quite impossible and quite uninteresting to imagine anything happening after he was dead yet the thing was so and when even his greatgreatgrandson was dead and decayed and forgotten when the sham halftimbered house had gone the way of all shams and the times was extinct and the silk hat a ridiculous antiquity and the modestly imposing stone that had been sacred to mr morris had been burnt to make lime for mortar and all that mr morris had found real and important was sere and dead the world was still going on and people were still going about it just as heedless and impatient of the future or indeed of anything but their own selves and property as mr morris had been  and strange to tell and much as mr morris would have been angered if any one had foreshadowed it to him all over the world there were scattered a multitude of people filled with the breath of life in whose veins the blood of mr morris flowed just as some day the life which is gathered now in the reader of this very story may also be scattered far and wide about this world and mingled with a thousand alien strains beyond all thought and tracing  and among the descendants of this mr morris was one almost as sensible and clearheaded as his ancestor he had just the same stout short frame as that ancient man of the nineteenth century from whom his name of morrishe spelt it mwrescame he had the same halfcontemptuous expression of face he was a prosperous person too as times went and he disliked the newfangled and bothers about the future and the lower classes just as much as the ancestral morris had done he did not read the times indeed he did not know there ever had been a timesthat institution had foundered somewhere in the intervening gulf of years but the phonograph machine that talked to him as he made his toilet of a morning might have been the voice of a reincarnated blowitz when it dealt with the worlds affairs this phonographic machine was the size and shape of a dutch clock and down the front of it were electric barometric indicators and an electric clock and calendar and automatic engagement reminders and where the clock would have been was the mouth of a trumpet when it had news the trumpet gobbled like a turkey galloop galloop and then brayed out its message as let us say a trumpet might bray it would tell mwres in full rich throaty tones about the overnight accidents to the omnibus flyingmachines that plied around the world the latest arrivals at the fashionable resorts in tibet and of all the great monopolist company meetings of the day before while he was dressing if mwres did not like hearing what it said he had only to touch a stud and it would choke a little and talk about something else  of course his toilet differed very much from that of his ancestor it is doubtful which would have been the more shocked and pained to find himself in the clothing of the other mwres would certainly have sooner gone forth to the world stark naked than in the silk hat frock coat grey trousers and watchchain that had filled mr morris with sombre selfrespect in the past for mwres there was no shaving to do a skilful operator had long ago removed every hairroot from his face his legs he encased in pleasant pink and amber garments of an airtight material which with the help of an ingenious little pump he distended so as to suggest enormous muscles above this he also wore pneumatic garments beneath an amber silk tunic so that he was clothed in air and admirably protected against sudden extremes of heat or cold over this he flung a scarlet cloak with its edge fantastically curved on his head which had been skilfully deprived of every scrap of hair he adjusted a pleasant little cap of bright scarlet held on by suction and inflated with hydrogen and curiously like the comb of a cock so his toilet was complete and conscious of being soberly and becomingly attired he was ready to face his fellowbeings with a tranquil eye  this mwresthe civility of mr had vanished ages agowas one of the officials under the wind vane and waterfall trust the great company that owned every wind wheel and waterfall in the world and which pumped all the water and supplied all the electric energy that people in these latter days required he lived in a vast hotel near that part of london called seventh way and had very large and comfortable apartments on the seventeenth floor households and family life had long since disappeared with the progressive refinement of manners and indeed the steady rise in rents and land values the disappearance of domestic servants the elaboration of cookery had rendered the separate domicile of victorian times impossible even had any one desired such a savage seclusion when his toilet was completed he went towards one of the two doors of his apartmentthere were doors at opposite ends each marked with a huge arrow pointing one one way and one the othertouched a stud to open it and emerged on a wide passage the centre of which bore chairs and was moving at a steady pace to the left on some of these chairs were seated gailydressed men and women he nodded to an acquaintanceit was not in those days etiquette to talk before breakfastand seated himself on one of these chairs and in a few seconds he had been carried to the doors of a lift by which he descended to the great and splendid hall in which his breakfast would be automatically served  it was a very different meal from a victorian breakfast the rude masses of bread needing to be carved and smeared over with animal fat before they could be made palatable the still recognisable fragments of recently killed animals hideously charred and hacked the eggs torn ruthlessly from beneath some protesting hensuch things as these though they constituted the ordinary fare of victorian times would have awakened only horror and disgust in the refined minds of the people of these latter days instead were pastes and cakes of agreeable and variegated design without any suggestion in colour or form of the unfortunate animals from which their substance and juices were derived they appeared on little dishes sliding out upon a rail from a little box at one side of the table the surface of the table to judge by touch and eye would have appeared to a nineteenthcentury person to be covered with fine white damask but this was really an oxidised metallic surface and could be cleaned instantly after a meal there were hundreds of such little tables in the hall and at most of them were other latterday citizens singly or in groups and as mwres seated himself before his elegant repast the invisible orchestra which had been resting during an interval resumed and filled the air with music  but mwres did not display any great interest either in his breakfast or the music his eye wandered incessantly about the hall as though he expected a belated guest at last he rose eagerly and waved his hand and simultaneously across the hall appeared a tall dark figure in a costume of yellow and olive green as this person walking amidst the tables with measured steps drew near the pallid earnestness of his face and the unusual intensity of his eyes became apparent mwres reseated himself and pointed to a chair beside him  i feared you would never come he said in spite of the intervening space of time the english language was still almost exactly the same as it had been in england under victoria the good the invention of the phonograph and suchlike means of recording sound and the gradual replacement of books by such contrivances had not only saved the human eyesight from decay but had also by the establishment of a sure standard arrested the process of change in accent that had hitherto been so inevitable  i was delayed by an interesting case said the man in green and yellow a prominent politicianahemsuffering from overwork he glanced at the breakfast and seated himself i have been awake for forty hours  eh dear said mwres fancy that you hypnotists have your work to do  the hypnotist helped himself to some attractive ambercoloured jelly i happen to be a good deal in request he said modestly  heaven knows what we should do without you  oh were not so indispensable as all that said the hypnotist ruminating the flavour of the jelly the world did very well without us for some thousands of years two hundred years ago evennot one in practice that is physicians by the thousand of coursefrightfully clumsy brutes for the most part and following one another like sheepbut doctors of the mind except a few empirical flounderers there were none  he concentrated his mind on the jelly  but were people so sane began mwres  the hypnotist shook his head it didnt matter then if they were a bit silly or faddy life was so easygoing then no competition worth speaking ofno pressure a human being had to be very lopsided before anything happened then you know they clapped em away in what they called a lunatic asylum  i know said mwres in these confounded historical romances that every one is listening to they always rescue a beautiful girl from an asylum or something of the sort i dont know if you attend to that rubbish  i must confess i do said the hypnotist it carries one out of oneself to hear of those quaint adventurous halfcivilised days of the nineteenth century when men were stout and women simple i like a good swaggering story before all things curious times they were with their smutty railways and puffing old iron trains their rum little houses and their horse vehicles i suppose you dont read books  dear no said mwres i went to a modern school and we had none of that oldfashioned nonsense phonographs are good enough for me  of course said the hypnotist of course and surveyed the table for his next choice you know he said helping himself to a dark blue confection that promised well in those days our business was scarcely thought of i daresay if any one had told them that in two hundred years time a class of men would be entirely occupied in impressing things upon the memory effacing unpleasant ideas controlling and overcoming instinctive but undesirable impulses and so forth by means of hypnotism they would have refused to believe the thing possible few people knew that an order made during a mesmeric trance even an order to forget or an order to desire could be given so as to be obeyed after the trance was over yet there were men alive then who could have told them the thing was as absolutely certain to come about aswell the transit of venus  they knew of hypnotism then  oh dear yes they used itfor painless dentistry and things like that this blue stuff is confoundedly good what is it  havent the faintest idea said mwres but i admit its very good take some more  the hypnotist repeated his praises and there was an appreciative pause  speaking of these historical romances said mwres with an attempt at an easy offhand manner brings meahto the matter iahhad in mind when i asked youwhen i expressed a wish to see you he paused and took a deep breath  the hypnotist turned an attentive eye upon him and continued eating  the fact is said mwres i have ain fact adaughter well you know i have given herahevery educational advantage lecturesnot a solitary lecturer of ability in the world but she has had a telephone direct dancing deportment conversation philosophy art criticism  he indicated catholic culture by a gesture of his hand i had intended her to marry a very good friend of minebindon of the lighting commissionplain little man you know and a bit unpleasant in some of his ways but an excellent fellow reallyan excellent fellow  yes said the hypnotist go on how old is she  eighteen  a dangerous age well  well it seems that she has been indulging in these historical romancesexcessively excessively even to the neglect of her philosophy filled her mind with unutterable nonsense about soldiers who fightwhat is itetruscans  egyptians  egyptiansvery probably hack about with swords and revolvers and thingsbloodshed galorehorribleand about young men on torpedo catchers who blow upspaniards i fancyand all sorts of irregular adventurers and she has got it into her head that she must marry for love and that poor little bindon  ive met similar cases said the hypnotist who is the other young man  mwres maintained an appearance of resigned calm you may well ask he said he isand his voice sank with shamea mere attendant upon the stage on which the flyingmachines from paris alight he hasas they say in the romancesgood looks he is quite young and very eccentric affects the antiquehe can read and write so can she and instead of communicating by telephone like sensible people they write and deliverwhat is it  notes  nonot notes ahpoems  the hypnotist raised his eyebrows how did she meet him  tripped coming down from the flyingmachine from parisand fell into his arms the mischief was done in a moment  yes  wellthats all things must be stopped that is what i want to consult you about what must be done what can be done of course im not a hypnotist my knowledge is limited but you  hypnotism is not magic said the man in green putting both arms on the table  oh precisely but still  people cannot be hypnotised without their consent if she is able to stand out against marrying bindon she will probably stand out against being hypnotised but if once she can be hypnotisedeven by somebody elsethe thing is done  you can  oh certainly once we get her amenable then we can suggest that she must marry bindonthat that is her fate or that the young man is repulsive and that when she sees him she will be giddy and faint or any little thing of that sort or if we can get her into a sufficiently profound trance we can suggest that she should forget him altogether  precisely  but the problem is to get her hypnotised of course no sort of proposal or suggestion must come from youbecause no doubt she already distrusts you in the matter  the hypnotist leant his head upon his arm and thought  its hard a man cannot dispose of his own daughter said mwres irrelevantly  you must give me the name and address of the young lady said the hypnotist and any information bearing upon the matter and by the bye is there any money in the affair  mwres hesitated  theres a sumin fact a considerable suminvested in the patent road company from her mother thats what makes the thing so exasperating  exactly said the hypnotist and he proceeded to crossexamine mwres on the entire affair  it was a lengthy interview  and meanwhile elizebeθ mwres as she spelt her name or elizabeth morris as a nineteenthcentury person would have put it was sitting in a quiet waitingplace beneath the great stage upon which the flyingmachine from paris descended and beside her sat her slender handsome lover reading her the poem he had written that morning while on duty upon the stage when he had finished they sat for a time in silence and then as if for their special entertainment the great machine that had come flying through the air from america that morning rushed down out of the sky  at first it was a little oblong faint and blue amidst the distant fleecy clouds and then it grew swiftly large and white and larger and whiter until they could see the separate tiers of sails each hundreds of feet wide and the lank body they supported and at last even the swinging seats of the passengers in a dotted row although it was falling it seemed to them to be rushing up the sky and over the roofspaces of the city below its shadow leapt towards them they heard the whistling rush of the air about it and its yelling siren shrill and swelling to warn those who were on its landingstage of its arrival and abruptly the note fell down a couple of octaves and it had passed and the sky was clear and void and she could turn her sweet eyes again to denton at her side  their silence ended and denton speaking in a little language of broken english that was they fancied their private possessionthough lovers have used such little languages since the world begantold her how they too would leap into the air one morning out of all the obstacles and difficulties about them and fly to a sunlit city of delight he knew of in japan halfway about the world  she loved the dream but she feared the leap and she put him off with some day dearest one some day to all his pleading that it might be soon and at last came a shrilling of whistles and it was time for him to go back to his duties on the stage they partedas lovers have been wont to part for thousands of years she walked down a passage to a lift and so came to one of the streets of that latterday london all glazed in with glass from the weather and with incessant moving platforms that went to all parts of the city and by one of these she returned to her apartments in the hotel for women where she lived the apartments that were in telephonic communication with all the best lecturers in the world but the sunlight of the flying stage was in her heart and the wisdom of all the best lecturers in the world seemed folly in that light  she spent the middle part of the day in the gymnasium and took her midday meal with two other girls and their common chaperonefor it was still the custom to have a chaperone in the case of motherless girls of the more prosperous classes the chaperone had a visitor that day a man in green and yellow with a white face and vivid eyes who talked amazingly among other things he fell to praising a new historical romance that one of the great popular storytellers of the day had just put forth it was of course about the spacious times of queen victoria and the author among other pleasing novelties made a little argument before each section of the story in imitation of the chapter headings of the oldfashioned books as for example how the cabmen of pimlico stopped the victoria omnibuses and of the great fight in palace yard and how the piccadilly policeman was slain in the midst of his duty the man in green and yellow praised this innovation these pithy sentences he said are admirable they show at a glance those headlong tumultuous times when men and animals jostled in the filthy streets and death might wait for one at every corner life was life then how great the world must have seemed then how marvellous they were still parts of the world absolutely unexplored nowadays we have almost abolished wonder we lead lives so trim and orderly that courage endurance faith all the noble virtues seem fading from mankind  and so on taking the girls thoughts with him until the life they led life in the vast and intricate london of the twentysecond century a life interspersed with soaring excursions to every part of the globe seemed to them a monotonous misery compared with the dædal past  at first elizabeth did not join in the conversation but after a time the subject became so interesting that she made a few shy interpolations but he scarcely seemed to notice her as he talked he went on to describe a new method of entertaining people they were hypnotised and then suggestions were made to them so skilfully that they seemed to be living in ancient times again they played out a little romance in the past as vivid as reality and when at last they awakened they remembered all they had been through as though it were a real thing  it is a thing we have sought to do for years and years said the hypnotist it is practically an artificial dream and we know the way at last think of all it opens out to usthe enrichment of our experience the recovery of adventure the refuge it offers from this sordid competitive life in which we live think  and you can do that said the chaperone eagerly  the thing is possible at last the hypnotist said you may order a dream as you wish  the chaperone was the first to be hypnotised and the dream she said was wonderful when she came to again  the other two girls encouraged by her enthusiasm also placed themselves in the hands of the hypnotist and had plunges into the romantic past no one suggested that elizabeth should try this novel entertainment it was at her own request at last that she was taken into that land of dreams where there is neither any freedom of choice nor will  and so the mischief was done  one day when denton went down to that quiet seat beneath the flying stage elizabeth was not in her wonted place he was disappointed and a little angry the next day she did not come and the next also he was afraid to hide his fear from himself he set to work to write sonnets for her when she should come again  for three days he fought against his dread by such distraction and then the truth was before him clear and cold and would not be denied she might be ill she might be dead but he would not believe that he had been betrayed there followed a week of misery and then he knew she was the only thing on earth worth having and that he must seek her however hopeless the search until she was found once more  he had some small private means of his own and so he threw over his appointment on the flying stage and set himself to find this girl who had become at last all the world to him he did not know where she lived and little of her circumstances for it had been part of the delight of her girlish romance that he should know nothing of her nothing of the difference of their station the ways of the city opened before him east and west north and south even in victorian days london was a maze that little london with its poor four millions of people but the london he explored the london of the twentysecond century was a london of thirty million souls at first he was energetic and headlong taking time neither to eat nor sleep he sought for weeks and months he went through every imaginable phase of fatigue and despair overexcitement and anger long after hope was dead by the sheer inertia of his desire he still went to and fro peering into faces and looking this way and that in the incessant ways and lifts and passages of that interminable hive of men  at last chance was kind to him and he saw her  it was in a time of festivity he was hungry he had paid the inclusive fee and had gone into one of the gigantic diningplaces of the city he was pushing his way among the tables and scrutinising by mere force of habit every group he passed  he stood still robbed of all power of motion his eyes wide his lips apart elizabeth sat scarcely twenty yards away from him looking straight at him her eyes were as hard to him as hard and expressionless and void of recognition as the eyes of a statue  she looked at him for a moment and then her gaze passed beyond him  had he had only her eyes to judge by he might have doubted if it was indeed elizabeth but he knew her by the gesture of her hand by the grace of a wanton little curl that floated over her ear as she moved her head something was said to her and she turned smiling tolerantly to the man beside her a little man in foolish raiment knobbed and spiked like some odd reptile with pneumatic hornsthe bindon of her fathers choice  for a moment denton stood white and wildeyed then came a terrible faintness and he sat before one of the little tables he sat down with his back to her and for a time he did not dare to look at her again when at last he did she and bindon and two other people were standing up to go the others were her father and her chaperone  he sat as if incapable of action until the four figures were remote and small and then he rose up possessed with the one idea of pursuit for a space he feared he had lost them and then he came upon elizabeth and her chaperone again in one of the streets of moving platforms that intersected the city bindon and mwres had disappeared  he could not control himself to patience he felt he must speak to her forthwith or die he pushed forward to where they were seated and sat down beside them his white face was convulsed with halfhysterical excitement  he laid his hand on her wrist elizabeth he said  she turned in unfeigned astonishment nothing but the fear of a strange man showed in her face  elizabeth he cried and his voice was strange to him dearestyou know me  elizabeths face showed nothing but alarm and perplexity she drew herself away from him the chaperone a little greyheaded woman with mobile features leant forward to intervene her resolute bright eyes examined denton what do you say she asked  this young lady said dentonshe knows me  do you know him dear  no said elizabeth in a strange voice and with a hand to her forehead speaking almost as one who repeats a lesson no i do not know him i knowi do not know him  butbut  not know me it is identon denton to whom you used to talk dont you remember the flying stages the little seat in the open air the verses  no cried elizabethno i do not know him i do not know him there is something but i dont know all i know is that i do not know him her face was a face of infinite distress  the sharp eyes of the chaperone flitted to and fro from the girl to the man you see she said with the faint shadow of a smile she does not know you  i do not know you said elizabeth of that i am sure  but dearthe songsthe little verses  she does not know you said the chaperone you must not you have made a mistake you must not go on talking to us after that you must not annoy us on the public ways  but said denton and for a moment his miserably haggard face appealed against fate  you must not persist young man protested the chaperone  elizabeth he cried  her face was the face of one who is tormented i do not know you she cried hand to brow oh i do not know you  for an instant denton sat stunned then he stood up and groaned aloud  he made a strange gesture of appeal towards the remote glass roof of the public way then turned and went plunging recklessly from one moving platform to another and vanished amidst the swarms of people going to and fro thereon the chaperones eyes followed him and then she looked at the curious faces about her  dear asked elizabeth clasping her hand and too deeply moved to heed observation who was that man who was that man  the chaperone raised her eyebrows she spoke in a clear audible voice some halfwitted creature i have never set eyes on him before  never  never dear do not trouble your mind about a thing like this                                       and soon after this the celebrated hypnotist who dressed in green and yellow had another client the young man paced his consultingroom pale and disordered i want to forget he cried i must forget  the hypnotist watched him with quiet eyes studied his face and clothes and bearing to forget anythingpleasure or painis to be by so muchless however you know your own concern my fee is high  if only i can forget  thats easy enough with you you wish it ive done much harder things quite recently i hardly expected to do it the thing was done against the will of the hypnotised person a love affair toolike yours a girl so rest assured  the young man came and sat beside the hypnotist his manner was a forced calm he looked into the hypnotists eyes i will tell you of course you will want to know what it is there was a girl her name was elizabeth mwres well   he stopped he had seen the instant surprise on the hypnotists face in that instant he knew he stood up he seemed to dominate the seated figure by his side he gripped the shoulder of green and gold for a time he could not find words  give her me back he said at last give her me back  what do you mean gasped the hypnotist  give her me back  give whom  elizabeth mwresthe girl  the hypnotist tried to free himself he rose to his feet dentons grip tightened  let go cried the hypnotist thrusting an arm against dentons chest  in a moment the two men were locked in a clumsy wrestle neither had the slightest trainingfor athleticism except for exhibition and to afford opportunity for betting had faded out of the earthbut denton was not only the younger but the stronger of the two they swayed across the room and then the hypnotist had gone down under his antagonist they fell together  denton leaped to his feet dismayed at his own fury but the hypnotist lay still and suddenly from a little white mark where his forehead had struck a stool shot a hurrying band of red for a space denton stood over him irresolute trembling  a fear of the consequences entered his gently nurtured mind he turned towards the door no he said aloud and came back to the middle of the room overcoming the instinctive repugnance of one who had seen no act of violence in all his life before he knelt down beside his antagonist and felt his heart then he peered at the wound he rose quietly and looked about him he began to see more of the situation  when presently the hypnotist recovered his senses his head ached severely his back was against dentons knees and denton was sponging his face  the hypnotist did not speak but presently he indicated by a gesture that in his opinion he had been sponged enough let me get up he said  not yet said denton  you have assaulted me you scoundrel  we are alone said denton and the door is secure  there was an interval of thought  unless i sponge said denton your forehead will develop a tremendous bruise  you can go on sponging said the hypnotist sulkily  there was another pause  we might be in the stone age said the hypnotist violence struggle  in the stone age no man dared to come between man and woman said denton  the hypnotist thought again  what are you going to do he asked  while you were insensible i found the girls address on your tablets i did not know it before i telephoned she will be here soon then  she will bring her chaperone  that is all right  but what i dont see what do you mean to do  i looked about for a weapon also it is an astonishing thing how few weapons there are nowadays if you consider that in the stone age men owned scarcely anything but weapons i hit at last upon this lamp i have wrenched off the wires and things and i hold it so he extended it over the hypnotists shoulders with that i can quite easily smash your skull i willunless you do as i tell you  violence is no remedy said the hypnotist quoting from the modern mans book of moral maxims  its an undesirable disease said denton  well  you will tell that chaperone you are going to order the girl to marry that knobby little brute with the red hair and ferrety eyes i believe thats how things stand  yesthats how things stand  and pretending to do that you will restore her memory of me  its unprofessional  look here if i cannot have that girl i would rather die than not i dont propose to respect your little fancies if anything goes wrong you shall not live five minutes this is a rude makeshift of a weapon and it may quite conceivably be painful to kill you but i will it is unusual i know nowadays to do things like thismainly because there is so little in life that is worth being violent about  the chaperone will see you directly she comes  i shall stand in that recess behind you  the hypnotist thought you are a determined young man he said and only half civilised i have tried to do my duty to my client but in this affair you seem likely to get your own way  you mean to deal straightly  im not going to risk having my brains scattered in a petty affair like this  and afterwards  there is nothing a hypnotist or doctor hates so much as a scandal i at least am no savage i am annoyed but in a day or so i shall bear no malice  thank you and now that we understand each other there is no necessity to keep you sitting any longer on the floor   iithe vacant country  the world they say changed more between the year 1800 and the year 1900 than it had done in the previous five hundred years that century the nineteenth century was the dawn of a new epoch in the history of mankindthe epoch of the great cities the end of the old order of country life  in the beginning of the nineteenth century the majority of mankind still lived upon the countryside as their way of life had been for countless generations all over the world they dwelt in little towns and villages then and engaged either directly in agriculture or in occupations that were of service to the agriculturist they travelled rarely and dwelt close to their work because swift means of transit had not yet come the few who travelled went either on foot or in slow sailingships or by means of jogging horses incapable of more than sixty miles a day think of itsixty miles a day here and there in those sluggish times a town grew a little larger than its neighbours as a port or as a centre of government but all the towns in the world with more than a hundred thousand inhabitants could be counted on a mans fingers so it was in the beginning of the nineteenth century by the end the invention of railways telegraphs steamships and complex agricultural machinery had changed all these things changed them beyond all hope of return the vast shops the varied pleasures the countless conveniences of the larger towns were suddenly possible and no sooner existed than they were brought into competition with the homely resources of the rural centres mankind were drawn to the cities by an overwhelming attraction the demand for labour fell with the increase of machinery the local markets were entirely superseded and there was a rapid growth of the larger centres at the expense of the open country  the flow of population townward was the constant preoccupation of victorian writers in great britain and new england in india and china the same thing was remarked everywhere a few swollen towns were visibly replacing the ancient order that this was an inevitable result of improved means of travel and transportthat given swift means of transit these things must bewas realised by few and the most puerile schemes were devised to overcome the mysterious magnetism of the urban centres and keep the people on the land  yet the developments of the nineteenth century were only the dawning of the new order the first great cities of the new time were horribly inconvenient darkened by smoky fogs insanitary and noisy but the discovery of new methods of building new methods of heating changed all this between 1900 and 2000 the march of change was still more rapid and between 2000 and 2100 the continually accelerated progress of human invention made the reign of victoria the good seem at last an almost incredible vision of idyllic tranquil days  the introduction of railways was only the first step in that development of those means of locomotion which finally revolutionised human life by the year 2000 railways and roads had vanished together the railways robbed of their rails had become weedy ridges and ditches upon the face of the world the old roads strange barbaric tracks of flint and soil hammered by hand or rolled by rough iron rollers strewn with miscellaneous filth and cut by iron hoofs and wheels into ruts and puddles often many inches deep had been replaced by patent tracks made of a substance called eadhamite this eadhamiteit was named after its patenteeranks with the invention of printing and steam as one of the epochmaking discoveries of the worlds history  when eadham discovered the substance he probably thought of it as a mere cheap substitute for india rubber it cost a few shillings a ton but you can never tell all an invention will do it was the genius of a man named warming that pointed to the possibility of using it not only for the tires of wheels but as a road substance and who organised the enormous network of public ways that speedily covered the world  these public ways were made with longitudinal divisions on the outer on either side went foot cyclists and conveyances travelling at a less speed than twentyfive miles an hour in the middle motors capable of speed up to a hundred and the inner warming in the face of enormous ridicule reserved for vehicles travelling at speeds of a hundred miles an hour and upward  for ten years his inner ways were vacant before he died they were the most crowded of all and vast light frameworks with wheels of twenty and thirty feet in diameter hurled along them at paces that year after year rose steadily towards two hundred miles an hour and by the time this revolution was accomplished a parallel revolution had transformed the evergrowing cities before the development of practical science the fogs and filth of victorian times vanished electric heating replaced fires in 2013 the lighting of a fire that did not absolutely consume its own smoke was made an indictable nuisance and all the city ways all public squares and places were covered in with a recently invented glasslike substance the roofing of london became practically continuous certain shortsighted and foolish legislation against tall buildings was abolished and london from a squat expanse of petty housesfeebly archaic in designrose steadily towards the sky to the municipal responsibility for water light and drainage was added another and that was ventilation  but to tell of all the changes in human convenience that these two hundred years brought about to tell of the long foreseen invention of flying to describe how life in households was steadily supplanted by life in interminable hotels how at last even those who were still concerned in agricultural work came to live in the towns and to go to and fro to their work every day to describe how at last in all england only four towns remained each with many millions of people and how there were left no inhabited houses in all the countryside to tell all this would take us far from our story of denton and his elizabeth they had been separated and reunited and still they could not marry for dentonit was his only faulthad no money neither had elizabeth until she was twentyone and as yet she was only eighteen at twentyone all the property of her mother would come to her for that was the custom of the time she did not know that it was possible to anticipate her fortune and denton was far too delicate a lover to suggest such a thing so things stuck hopelessly between them elizabeth said that she was very unhappy and that nobody understood her but denton and that when she was away from him she was wretched and denton said that his heart longed for her day and night and they met as often as they could to enjoy the discussion of their sorrows  they met one day at their little seat upon the flying stage the precise site of this meeting was where in victorian times the road from wimbledon came out upon the common they were however five hundred feet above that point their seat looked far over london to convey the appearance of it all to a nineteenthcentury reader would have been difficult one would have had to tell him to think of the crystal palace of the newly built mammoth hotelsas those little affairs were calledof the larger railway stations of his time and to imagine such buildings enlarged to vast proportions and run together and continuous over the whole metropolitan area if then he was told that this continuous roofspace bore a huge forest of rotating windwheels he would have begun very dimly to appreciate what to these young people was the commonest sight in their lives  to their eyes it had something of the quality of a prison and they were talking as they had talked a hundred times before of how they might escape from it and be at last happy together escape from it that is before the appointed three years were at an end it was they both agreed not only impossible but almost wicked to wait three years before that said dentonand the notes of his voice told of a splendid chestwe might both be dead  their vigorous young hands had to grip at this and then elizabeth had a still more poignant thought that brought the tears from her wholesome eyes and down her healthy cheeks one of us she said one of us might be  she choked she could not say the word that is so terrible to the young and happy  yet to marry and be very poor in the cities of that time wasfor any one who had lived pleasantlya very dreadful thing in the old agricultural days that had drawn to an end in the eighteenth century there had been a pretty proverb of love in a cottage and indeed in those days the poor of the countryside had dwelt in flowercovered diamondwindowed cottages of thatch and plaster with the sweet air and earth about them amidst tangled hedges and the song of birds and with the everchanging sky overhead but all this had changed the change was already beginning in the nineteenth century and a new sort of life was opening for the poorin the lower quarters of the city  in the nineteenth century the lower quarters were still beneath the sky they were areas of land on clay or other unsuitable soil liable to floods or exposed to the smoke of more fortunate districts insufficiently supplied with water and as insanitary as the great fear of infectious diseases felt by the wealthier classes permitted in the twentysecond century however the growth of the city storey above storey and the coalescence of buildings had led to a different arrangement the prosperous people lived in a vast series of sumptuous hotels in the upper storeys and halls of the city fabric the industrial population dwelt beneath in the tremendous groundfloor and basement so to speak of the place  in the refinement of life and manners these lower classes differed little from their ancestors the eastenders of queen victorias time but they had developed a distinct dialect of their own in these under ways they lived and died rarely ascending to the surface except when work took them there since for most of them this was the sort of life to which they had been born they found no great misery in such circumstances but for people like denton and elizabeth such a plunge would have seemed more terrible than death  and yet what else is there asked elizabeth  denton professed not to know apart from his own feeling of delicacy he was not sure how elizabeth would like the idea of borrowing on the strength of her expectations  the passage from london to paris even said elizabeth was beyond their means and in paris as in any other city in the world life would be just as costly and impossible as in london  well might denton cry aloud if only we had lived in those days dearest if only we had lived in the past for to their eyes even nineteenthcentury whitechapel was seen through a mist of romance  is there nothing cried elizabeth suddenly weeping must we really wait for those three long years fancy three yearssixandthirty months the human capacity for patience had not grown with the ages  then suddenly denton was moved to speak of something that had already flickered across his mind he had hit upon it at last it seemed to him so wild a suggestion that he made it only half seriously but to put a thing into words has ever a way of making it seem more real and possible than it seemed before and so it was with him  suppose he said we went into the country  she looked at him to see if he was serious in proposing such an adventure  the country  yesbeyond there beyond the hills  how could we live she said where could we live  it is not impossible he said people used to live in the country  but then there were houses  there are the ruins of villages and towns now on the clay lands they are gone of course but they are still left on the grazing land because it does not pay the food company to remove them i know thatfor certain besides one sees them from the flying machines you know well we might shelter in some one of these and repair it with our hands do you know the thing is not so wild as it seems some of the men who go out every day to look after the crops and herds might be paid to bring us food  she stood in front of him how strange it would be if one really could  why not  but no one dares  that is no reason  it would beoh it would be so romantic and strange if only it were possible  why not possible  there are so many things think of all the things we have things that we should miss  should we miss them after all the life we lead is very unrealvery artificial he began to expand his idea and as he warmed to his exposition the fantastic quality of his first proposal faded away  she thought but i have heard of prowlersescaped criminals  he nodded he hesitated over his answer because he thought it sounded boyish he blushed i could get some one i know to make me a sword  she looked at him with enthusiasm growing in her eyes she had heard of swords had seen one in a museum she thought of those ancient days when men wore them as a common thing his suggestion seemed an impossible dream to her and perhaps for that reason she was eager for more detail and inventing for the most part as he went along he told her how they might live in the country as the oldworld people had done with every detail her interest grew for she was one of those girls for whom romance and adventure have a fascination  his suggestion seemed i say an impossible dream to her on that day but the next day they talked about it again and it was strangely less impossible  at first we should take food said denton we could carry food for ten or twelve days it was an age of compact artificial nourishment and such a provision had none of the unwieldy suggestion it would have had in the nineteenth century  butuntil our house she askeduntil it was ready where should we sleep  it is summer  but  what do you mean  there was a time when there were no houses in the world when all mankind slept always in the open air  but for us the emptiness no wallsno ceiling  dear he said in london you have many beautiful ceilings artists paint them and stud them with lights but i have seen a ceiling more beautiful than any in london  but where  it is the ceiling under which we two would be alone  you mean  dear he said it is something the world has forgotten it is heaven and all the host of stars  each time they talked the thing seemed more possible and more desirable to them in a week or so it was quite possible another week and it was the inevitable thing they had to do a great enthusiasm for the country seized hold of them and possessed them the sordid tumult of the town they said overwhelmed them they marvelled that this simple way out of their troubles had never come upon them before  one morning near midsummerday there was a new minor official upon the flying stage and dentons place was to know him no more  our two young people had secretly married and were going forth manfully out of the city in which they and their ancestors before them had lived all their days she wore a new dress of white cut in an oldfashioned pattern and he had a bundle of provisions strapped athwart his back and in his hand he carriedrather shamefacedly it is true and under his purple cloakan implement of archaic form a crosshilted thing of tempered steel  imagine that going forth in their days the sprawling suburbs of victorian times with their vile roads petty houses foolish little gardens of shrub and geranium and all their futile pretentious privacies had disappeared the towering buildings of the new age the mechanical ways the electric and water mains all came to an end together like a wall like a cliff near four hundred feet in height abrupt and sheer all about the city spread the carrot swede and turnip fields of the food company vegetables that were the basis of a thousand varied foods and weeds and hedgerow tangles had been utterly extirpated the incessant expense of weeding that went on year after year in the petty wasteful and barbaric farming of the ancient days the food company had economised for ever more by a campaign of extermination here and there however neat rows of bramble standards and apple trees with whitewashed stems intersected the fields and at places groups of gigantic teazles reared their favoured spikes here and there huge agricultural machines hunched under waterproof covers the mingled waters of the wey and mole and wandle ran in rectangular channels and wherever a gentle elevation of the ground permitted a fountain of deodorised sewage distributed its benefits athwart the land and made a rainbow of the sunlight  by a great archway in that enormous city wall emerged the eadhamite road to portsmouth swarming in the morning sunshine with an enormous traffic bearing the blueclad servants of the food company to their toil a rushing traffic beside which they seemed two scarcemoving dots along the outer tracks hummed and rattled the tardy little oldfashioned motors of such as had duties within twenty miles or so of the city the inner ways were filled with vaster mechanismsswift monocycles bearing a score of men lank multicycles quadricycles sagging with heavy loads empty gigantic produce carts that would come back again filled before the sun was setting all with throbbing engines and noiseless wheels and a perpetual wild melody of horns and gongs  along the very verge of the outermost way our young people went in silence newly wed and oddly shy of one anothers company many were the things shouted to them as they tramped along for in 2100 a footpassenger on an english road was almost as strange a sight as a motor car would have been in 1800 but they went on with steadfast eyes into the country paying no heed to such cries  before them in the south rose the downs blue at first and as they came nearer changing to green surmounted by the row of gigantic windwheels that supplemented the windwheels upon the roofspaces of the city and broken and restless with the long morning shadows of those whirling vanes by midday they had come so near that they could see here and there little patches of pallid dotsthe sheep the meat department of the food company owned in another hour they had passed the clay and the root crops and the single fence that hedged them in and the prohibition against trespass no longer held the levelled roadway plunged into a cutting with all its traffic and they could leave it and walk over the greensward and up the open hillside  never had these children of the latter days been together in such a lonely place  they were both very hungry and footsorefor walking was a rare exerciseand presently they sat down on the weedless closecropped grass and looked back for the first time at the city from which they had come shining wide and splendid in the blue haze of the valley of the thames elizabeth was a little afraid of the unenclosed sheep away up the slopeshe had never been near big unrestrained animals beforebut denton reassured her and overhead a whitewinged bird circled in the blue  they talked but little until they had eaten and then their tongues were loosened he spoke of the happiness that was now certainly theirs of the folly of not breaking sooner out of that magnificent prison of latterday life of the old romantic days that had passed from the world for ever and then he became boastful he took up the sword that lay on the ground beside him and she took it from his hand and ran a tremulous finger along the blade  and you could she said youcould raise this and strike a man  why not if there were need  but she said it seems so horrible it would slash there would beher voice sankblood  in the old romances you have read often enough   oh i know in thoseyes but that is different one knows it is not blood but just a sort of red ink and youkilling  she looked at him doubtfully and then handed him back the sword  after they had rested and eaten they rose up and went on their way towards the hills they passed quite close to a huge flock of sheep who stared and bleated at their unaccustomed figures she had never seen sheep before and she shivered to think such gentle things must needs be slain for food a sheepdog barked from a distance and then a shepherd appeared amidst the supports of the windwheels and came down towards them  when he drew near he called out asking whither they were going  denton hesitated and told him briefly that they sought some ruined house among the downs in which they might live together he tried to speak in an offhand manner as though it was a usual thing to do the man stared incredulously  have you done anything he asked  nothing said denton only we dont want to live in a city any longer why should we live in cities  the shepherd stared more incredulously than ever you cant live here he said  we mean to try  the shepherd stared from one to the other youll go back tomorrow he said it looks pleasant enough in the sunlight are you sure youve done nothing we shepherds are not such great friends of the police  denton looked at him steadfastly no he said but we are too poor to live in the city and we cant bear the thought of wearing clothes of blue canvas and doing drudgery we are going to live a simple life here like the people of old  the shepherd was a bearded man with a thoughtful face he glanced at elizabeths fragile beauty  they had simple minds he said  so have we said denton  the shepherd smiled  if you go along here he said along the crest beneath the windwheels you will see a heap of mounds and ruins on your righthand side that was once a town called epsom there are no houses there and the bricks have been used for a sheep pen go on and another heap on the edge of the rootland is leatherhead and then the hill turns away along the border of a valley and there are woods of beech keep along the crest you will come to quite wild places in some parts in spite of all the weeding that is done ferns and bluebells and other such useless plants are growing still and through it all underneath the windwheels runs a straight lane paved with stones a roadway of the romans two thousand years old go to the right of that down into the valley and follow it along by the banks of the river you come presently to a street of houses many with the roofs still sound upon them there you may find shelter  they thanked him  but its a quiet place there is no light after dark there and i have heard tell of robbers it is lonely nothing happens there the phonographs of the storytellers the kinematograph entertainments the news machinesnone of them are to be found there if you are hungry there is no food if you are ill no doctor  he stopped  we shall try it said denton moving to go on then a thought struck him and he made an agreement with the shepherd and learnt where they might find him to buy and bring them anything of which they stood in need out of the city  and in the evening they came to the deserted village with its houses that seemed so small and odd to them they found it golden in the glory of the sunset and desolate and still they went from one deserted house to another marvelling at their quaint simplicity and debating which they should choose and at last in a sunlit corner of a room that had lost its outer wall they came upon a wild flower a little flower of blue that the weeders of the food company had overlooked  that house they decided upon but they did not remain in it long that night because they were resolved to feast upon nature and moreover the houses became very gaunt and shadowy after the sunlight had faded out of the sky so after they had rested a little time they went to the crest of the hill again to see with their own eyes the silence of heaven set with stars about which the old poets had had so many things to tell it was a wonderful sight and denton talked like the stars and when they went down the hill at last the sky was pale with dawn they slept but little and in the morning when they woke a thrush was singing in a tree  so these young people of the twentysecond century began their exile that morning they were very busy exploring the resources of this new home in which they were going to live the simple life they did not explore very fast or very far because they went everywhere handinhand but they found the beginnings of some furniture beyond the village was a store of winter fodder for the sheep of the food company and denton dragged great armfuls to the house to make a bed and in several of the houses were old funguseaten chairs and tablesrough barbaric clumsy furniture it seemed to them and made of wood they repeated many of the things they had said on the previous day and towards evening they found another flower a harebell in the late afternoon some company shepherds went down the river valley riding on a big multicycle but they hid from them because their presence elizabeth said seemed to spoil the romance of this oldworld place altogether  in this fashion they lived a week for all that week the days were cloudless and the nights nights of starry glory that were invaded each a little more by a crescent moon  yet something of the first splendour of their coming fadedfaded imperceptibly day after day dentons eloquence became fitful and lacked fresh topics of inspiration the fatigue of their long march from london told in a certain stiffness of the limbs and each suffered from a slight unaccountable cold moreover denton became aware of unoccupied time in one place among the carelessly heaped lumber of the old times he found a rusteaten spade and with this he made a fitful attack on the razed and grassgrown gardenthough he had nothing to plant or sow he returned to elizabeth with a sweatstreaming face after half an hour of such work  there were giants in those days he said not understanding what wont and training will do and their walk that day led them along the hills until they could see the city shimmering far away in the valley i wonder how things are going on there he said  and then came a change in the weather come out and see the clouds she cried and behold they were a sombre purple in the north and east streaming up to ragged edges at the zenith and as they went up the hill these hurrying streamers blotted out the sunset suddenly the wind set the beechtrees swaying and whispering and elizabeth shivered and then far away the lightning flashed flashed like a sword that is drawn suddenly and the distant thunder marched about the sky and even as they stood astonished pattering upon them came the first headlong raindrops of the storm in an instant the last streak of sunset was hidden by a falling curtain of hail and the lightning flashed again and the voice of the thunder roared louder and all about them the world scowled dark and strange  seizing hands these children of the city ran down the hill to their home in infinite astonishment and ere they reached it elizabeth was weeping with dismay and the darkling ground about them was white and brittle and active with the pelting hail  then began a strange and terrible night for them for the first time in their civilised lives they were in absolute darkness they were wet and cold and shivering all about them hissed the hail and through the long neglected ceilings of the derelict home came noisy spouts of water and formed pools and rivulets on the creaking floors as the gusts of the storm struck the wornout building it groaned and shuddered and now a mass of plaster from the wall would slide and smash and now some loosened tile would rattle down the roof and crash into the empty greenhouse below elizabeth shuddered and was still denton wrapped his gay and flimsy city cloak about her and so they crouched in the darkness and ever the thunder broke louder and nearer and ever more lurid flashed the lightning jerking into a momentary gaunt clearness the steaming dripping room in which they sheltered  never before had they been in the open air save when the sun was shining all their time had been spent in the warm and airy ways and halls and rooms of the latterday city it was to them that night as if they were in some other world some disordered chaos of stress and tumult and almost beyond hoping that they should ever see the city ways again  the storm seemed to last interminably until at last they dozed between the thunderclaps and then very swiftly it fell and ceased and as the last patter of the rain died away they heard an unfamiliar sound  what is that cried elizabeth  it came again it was the barking of dogs it drove down the desert lane and passed and through the window whitening the wall before them and throwing upon it the shadow of the windowframe and of a tree in black silhouette shone the light of the waxing moon  just as the pale dawn was drawing the things about them into sight the fitful barking of dogs came near again and stopped they listened after a pause they heard the quick pattering of feet seeking round the house and short halfsmothered barks then again everything was still  ssh whispered elizabeth and pointed to the door of their room  denton went halfway towards the door and stood listening he came back with a face of affected unconcern they must be the sheepdogs of the food company he said they will do us no harm  he sat down again beside her what a night it has been he said to hide how keenly he was listening  i dont like dogs answered elizabeth after a long silence  dogs never hurt any one said denton in the old daysin the nineteenth centuryeverybody had a dog  there was a romance i heard once a dog killed a man  not this sort of dog said denton confidently some of those romancesare exaggerated  suddenly a half bark and a pattering up the staircase the sound of panting denton sprang to his feet and drew the sword out of the damp straw upon which they had been lying then in the doorway appeared a gaunt sheepdog and halted there behind it stared another for an instant man and brute faced each other hesitating  then denton being ignorant of dogs made a sharp step forward go away he said with a clumsy motion of his sword  the dog started and growled denton stopped sharply good dog he said  the growling jerked into a bark  good dog said denton the second dog growled and barked a third out of sight down the staircase took up the barking also outside others gave tonguea large number it seemed to denton  this is annoying said denton without taking his eye off the brutes before him of course the shepherds wont come out of the city for hours yet naturally these dogs dont quite make us out  i cant hear shouted elizabeth she stood up and came to him  denton tried again but the barking still drowned his voice the sound had a curious effect upon his blood odd disused emotions began to stir his face changed as he shouted he tried again the barking seemed to mock him and one dog danced a pace forward bristling suddenly he turned and uttering certain words in the dialect of the underways words incomprehensible to elizabeth he made for the dogs there was a sudden cessation of the barking a growl and a snapping elizabeth saw the snarling head of the foremost dog its white teeth and retracted ears and the flash of the thrust blade the brute leapt into the air and was flung back  then denton with a shout was driving the dogs before him the sword flashed above his head with a sudden new freedom of gesture and then he vanished down the staircase she made six steps to follow him and on the landing there was blood she stopped and hearing the tumult of dogs and dentons shouts pass out of the house ran to the window  nine wolfish sheepdogs were scattering one writhed before the porch and denton tasting that strange delight of combat that slumbers still in the blood of even the most civilised man was shouting and running across the garden space and then she saw something that for a moment he did not see the dogs circled round this way and that and came again they had him in the open  in an instant she divined the situation she would have called to him for a moment she felt sick and helpless and then obeying a strange impulse she gathered up her white skirt and ran downstairs in the hall was the rusting spade that was it she seized it and ran out  she came none too soon one dog rolled before him wellnigh slashed in half but a second had him by the thigh a third gripped his collar behind and a fourth had the blade of the sword between its teeth tasting its own blood he parried the leap of a fifth with his left arm  it might have been the first century instead of the twentysecond so far as she was concerned all the gentleness of her eighteen years of city life vanished before this primordial need the spade smote hard and sure and cleft a dogs skull another crouching for a spring yelped with dismay at this unexpected antagonist and rushed aside two wasted precious moments on the binding of a feminine skirt  the collar of dentons cloak tore and parted as he staggered back and that dog too felt the spade and ceased to trouble him he sheathed his sword in the brute at his thigh  to the wall cried elizabeth and in three seconds the fight was at an end and our young people stood side by side while a remnant of five dogs with ears and tails of disaster fled shamefully from the stricken field  for a moment they stood panting and victorious and then elizabeth dropping her spade covered her face and sank to the ground in a paroxysm of weeping denton looked about him thrust the point of his sword into the ground so that it was at hand and stooped to comfort her                                       at last their more tumultuous emotions subsided and they could talk again she leant upon the wall and he sat upon it so that he could keep an eye open for any returning dogs two at any rate were up on the hillside and keeping up a vexatious barking  she was tearstained but not very wretched now because for half an hour he had been repeating that she was brave and had saved his life but a new fear was growing in her mind  they are the dogs of the food company she said there will be trouble  i am afraid so very likely they will prosecute us for trespass  a pause  in the old times he said this sort of thing happened day after day  last night she said i could not live through another such night  he looked at her her face was pale for want of sleep and drawn and haggard he came to a sudden resolution we must go back he said  she looked at the dead dogs and shivered we cannot stay here she said  we must go back he repeated glancing over his shoulder to see if the enemy kept their distance we have been happy for a time but the world is too civilised ours is the age of cities more of this will kill us  but what are we to do how can we live there  denton hesitated his heel kicked against the wall on which he sat its a thing i havent mentioned before he said and coughed but   yes  you could raise money on your expectations he said  could i she said eagerly  of course you could what a child you are  she stood up and her face was bright why did you not tell me before she asked and all this time we have been here  he looked at her for a moment and smiled then the smile vanished i thought it ought to come from you he said i didnt like to ask for your money and besidesat first i thought this would be rather fine  there was a pause  it has been fine he said and glanced once more over his shoulder until all this began  yes she said those first days the first three days  they looked for a space into one anothers faces and then denton slid down from the wall and took her hand  to each generation he said the life of its time i see it all plainly now in the citythat is the life to which we were born to live in any other fashion  coming here was a dream and thisis the awakening  it was a pleasant dream she saidin the beginning  for a long space neither spoke  if we would reach the city before the shepherds come here we must start said denton we must get our food out of the house and eat as we go  denton glanced about him again and giving the dead dogs a wide berth they walked across the garden space and into the house together they found the wallet with their food and descended the bloodstained stairs again in the hall elizabeth stopped one minute she said there is something here  she led the way into the room in which that one little blue flower was blooming she stooped to it she touched it with her hand  i want it she said and then i cannot take it  impulsively she stooped and kissed its petals  then silently side by side they went across the empty gardenspace into the old high road and set their faces resolutely towards the distant citytowards the complex mechanical city of those latter days the city that had swallowed up mankind   iiithe ways of the city  prominent if not paramount among worldchanging inventions in the history of man is that series of contrivances in locomotion that began with the railway and ended for a century or more with the motor and the patent road that these contrivances together with the device of limited liability joint stock companies and the supersession of agricultural labourers by skilled men with ingenious machinery would necessarily concentrate mankind in cities of unparallelled magnitude and work an entire revolution in human life became after the event a thing so obvious that it is a matter of astonishment it was not more clearly anticipated yet that any steps should be taken to anticipate the miseries such a revolution might entail does not appear even to have been suggested and the idea that the moral prohibitions and sanctions the privileges and concessions the conception of property and responsibility of comfort and beauty that had rendered the mainly agricultural states of the past prosperous and happy would fail in the rising torrent of novel opportunities and novel stimulations never seems to have entered the nineteenthcentury mind that a citizen kindly and fair in his ordinary life could as a shareholder become almost murderously greedy that commercial methods that were reasonable and honourable on the oldfashioned countryside should on an enlarged scale be deadly and overwhelming that ancient charity was modern pauperisation and ancient employment modern sweating that in fact a revision and enlargement of the duties and rights of man had become urgently necessary were things it could not entertain nourished as it was on an archaic system of education and profoundly retrospective and legal in all its habits of thought it was known that the accumulation of men in cities involved unprecedented dangers of pestilence there was an energetic development of sanitation but that the diseases of gambling and usury of luxury and tyranny should become endemic and produce horrible consequences was beyond the scope of nineteenthcentury thought and so as if it were some inorganic process practically unhindered by the creative will of man the growth of the swarming unhappy cities that mark the twentyfirst century accomplished itself  the new society was divided into three main classes at the summit slumbered the property owner enormously rich by accident rather than design potent save for the will and aim the last avatar of hamlet in the world below was the enormous multitude of workers employed by the gigantic companies that monopolised control and between these two the dwindling middle class officials of innumerable sorts foremen managers the medical legal artistic and scholastic classes and the minor rich a middle class whose members led a life of insecure luxury and precarious speculation amidst the movements of the great managers  already the love story and the marrying of two persons of this middle class have been told how they overcame the obstacles between them and how they tried the simple oldfashioned way of living on the countryside and came back speedily enough into the city of london denton had no means so elizabeth borrowed money on the securities that her father mwres held in trust for her until she was oneandtwenty  the rate of interest she paid was of course high because of the uncertainty of her security and the arithmetic of lovers is often sketchy and optimistic yet they had very glorious times after that return they determined they would not go to a pleasure city nor waste their days rushing through the air from one part of the world to the other for in spite of one disillusionment their tastes were still oldfashioned they furnished their little room with quaint old victorian furniture and found a shop on the fortysecond floor in seventh way where printed books of the old sort were still to be bought it was their pet affectation to read print instead of hearing phonographs and when presently there came a sweet little girl to unite them further if it were possible elizabeth would not send it to a creche as the custom was but insisted on nursing it at home the rent of their apartments was raised on account of this singular proceeding but that they did not mind it only meant borrowing a little more  presently elizabeth was of age and denton had a business interview with her father that was not agreeable an exceedingly disagreeable interview with their moneylender followed from which he brought home a white face on his return elizabeth had to tell him of a new and marvellous intonation of goo that their daughter had devised but denton was inattentive in the midst just as she was at the cream of her description he interrupted how much money do you think we have left now that everything is settled  she stared and stopped her appreciative swaying of the goo genius that had accompanied her description  you dont mean  yes he answered ever so much we have been wild its the interest or something and the shares you had slumped your father did not mind said it was not his business after what had happened hes going to marry again wellwe have scarcely a thousand left  only a thousand  only a thousand  and elizabeth sat down for a moment she regarded him with a white face then her eyes went about the quaint oldfashioned room with its middle victorian furniture and genuine oleographs and rested at last on the little lump of humanity within her arms  denton glanced at her and stood downcast then he swung round on his heel and walked up and down very rapidly  i must get something to do he broke out presently i am an idle scoundrel i ought to have thought of this before i have been a selfish fool i wanted to be with you all day  he stopped looking at her white face suddenly he came and kissed her and the little face that nestled against her breast  its all right dear he said standing over her you wont be lonely nownow dings is beginning to talk to you and i can soon get something to do you know soon easily its only a shock at first but it will come all right its sure to come right i will go out again as soon as i have rested and find what can be done for the present its hard to think of anything  it would be hard to leave these rooms said elizabeth but  there wont be any need of thattrust me  they are expensive  denton waved that aside he began talking of the work he could do he was not very explicit what it would be but he was quite sure that there was something to keep them comfortably in the happy middle class whose way of life was the only one they knew  there are threeandthirty million people in london he said some of them must have need of me  some must  the trouble is  wellbindon that brown little old man your father wanted you to marry hes an important person i cant go back to my flyingstage work because he is now a commissioner of the flying stage clerks  i didnt know that said elizabeth  he was made that in the last few weeks  or things would be easy enough for they liked me on the flying stage but theres dozens of other things to be donedozens dont you worry dear ill rest a little while and then well dine and then ill start on my rounds i know lots of peoplelots  so they rested and then they went to the public diningroom and dined and then he started on his search for employment but they soon realised that in the matter of one convenience the world was just as badly off as it had ever been and that was a nice secure honourable remunerative employment leaving ample leisure for the private life and demanding no special ability no violent exertion nor risk and no sacrifice of any sort for its attainment he evolved a number of brilliant projects and spent many days hurrying from one part of the enormous city to another in search of influential friends and all his influential friends were glad to see him and very sanguine until it came to definite proposals and then they became guarded and vague he would part with them coldly and think over their behaviour and get irritated on his way back and stop at some telephone office and spend money on an animated but unprofitable quarrel and as the days passed he got so worried and irritated that even to seem kind and careless before elizabeth cost him an effortas she being a loving woman perceived very clearly  after an extremely complex preface one day she helped him out with a painful suggestion he had expected her to weep and give way to despair when it came to selling all their joyfully bought early victorian treasures their quaint objects of art their antimacassars bead mats repp curtains veneered furniture goldframed steel engravings and pencil drawings wax flowers under shades stuffed birds and all sorts of choice old things but it was she who made the proposal the sacrifice seemed to fill her with pleasure and so did the idea of shifting to apartments ten or twelve floors lower in another hotel so long as dings is with us nothing matters she said its all experience so he kissed her said she was braver than when she fought the sheepdogs called her boadicea and abstained very carefully from reminding her that they would have to pay a considerably higher rent on account of the little voice with which dings greeted the perpetual uproar of the city  his idea had been to get elizabeth out of the way when it came to selling the absurd furniture about which their affections were twined and tangled but when it came to the sale it was elizabeth who haggled with the dealer while denton went about the running ways of the city white and sick with sorrow and the fear of what was still to come when they moved into their sparsely furnished pinkandwhite apartments in a cheap hotel there came an outbreak of furious energy on his part and then nearly a week of lethargy during which he sulked at home through those days elizabeth shone like a star and at the end dentons misery found a vent in tears and then he went out into the city ways again andto his utter amazementfound some work to do  his standard of employment had fallen steadily until at last it had reached the lowest level of independent workers at first he had aspired to some high official position in the great flying or wind vane or water companies or to an appointment on one of the general intelligence organisations that had replaced newspapers or to some professional partnership but those were the dreams of the beginning from that he had passed to speculation and three hundred gold lions out of elizabeths thousand had vanished one evening in the share market now he was glad his good looks secured him a trial in the position of salesman to the suzannah hat syndicate a syndicate dealing in ladies caps hair decorations and hatsfor though the city was completely covered in ladies still wore extremely elaborate and beautiful hats at the theatres and places of public worship  it would have been amusing if one could have confronted a regent street shopkeeper of the nineteenth century with the development of his establishment in which dentons duties lay nineteenth way was still sometimes called regent street but it was now a street of moving platforms and nearly eight hundred feet wide the middle space was immovable and gave access by staircases descending into subterranean ways to the houses on either side right and left were an ascending series of continuous platforms each of which travelled about five miles an hour faster than the one internal to it so that one could step from platform to platform until one reached the swiftest outer way and so go about the city the establishment of the suzannah hat syndicate projected a vast façade upon the outer way sending out overhead at either end an overlapping series of huge white glass screens on which gigantic animated pictures of the faces of wellknown beautiful living women wearing novelties in hats were thrown a dense crowd was always collected in the stationary central way watching a vast kinematograph which displayed the changing fashion the whole front of the building was in perpetual chromatic change and all down the façadefour hundred feet it measuredand all across the street of moving ways laced and winked and glittered in a thousand varieties of colour and lettering the inscription      suzanna ets suzanna ets  a broadside of gigantic phonographs drowned all conversation in the moving way and roared hats at the passerby while far down the street and up other batteries counselled the public to walk down for suzannah and queried why dont you buy the girl a hat  for the benefit of those who chanced to be deafand deafness was not uncommon in the london of that age inscriptions of all sizes were thrown from the roof above upon the moving platforms themselves and on ones hand or on the bald head of the man before one or on a ladys shoulders or in a sudden jet of flame before ones feet the moving finger wrote in unanticipated letters of fire ets r chip tde or simply ets and spite of all these efforts so high was the pitch at which the city lived so trained became ones eyes and ears to ignore all sorts of advertisement that many a citizen had passed that place thousands of times and was still unaware of the existence of the suzannah hat syndicate  to enter the building one descended the staircase in the middle way and walked through a public passage in which pretty girls promenaded girls who were willing to wear a ticketed hat for a small fee the entrance chamber was a large hall in which wax heads fashionably adorned rotated gracefully upon pedestals and from this one passed through a cash office to an interminable series of little rooms each room with its salesman its three or four hats and pins its mirrors its kinematographs telephones and hat slides in communication with the central depôt its comfortable lounge and tempting refreshments a salesman in such an apartment did denton now become it was his business to attend to any of the incessant stream of ladies who chose to stop with him to behave as winningly as possible to offer refreshment to converse on any topic the possible customer chose and to guide the conversation dexterously but not insistently towards hats he was to suggest trying on various types of hat and to show by his manner and bearing but without any coarse flattery the enhanced impression made by the hats he wished to sell he had several mirrors adapted by various subtleties of curvature and tint to different types of face and complexion and much depended on the proper use of these  denton flung himself at these curious and not very congenial duties with a good will and energy that would have amazed him a year before but all to no purpose the senior manageress who had selected him for appointment and conferred various small marks of favour upon him suddenly changed in her manner declared for no assignable cause that he was stupid and dismissed him at the end of six weeks of salesmanship so denton had to resume his ineffectual search for employment  this second search did not last very long their money was at the ebb to eke it out a little longer they resolved to part with their darling dings and took that small person to one of the public creches that abounded in the city that was the common use of the time the industrial emancipation of women the correlated disorganisation of the secluded home had rendered creches a necessity for all but very rich and exceptionallyminded people therein children encountered hygienic and educational advantages impossible without such organisation creches were of all classes and types of luxury down to those of the labour company where children were taken on credit to be redeemed in labour as they grew up  but both denton and elizabeth being as i have explained strange oldfashioned young people full of nineteenthcentury ideas hated these convenient creches exceedingly and at last took their little daughter to one with extreme reluctance they were received by a motherly person in a uniform who was very brisk and prompt in her manner until elizabeth wept at the mention of parting from her child the motherly person after a brief astonishment at this unusual emotion changed suddenly into a creature of hope and comfort and so won elizabeths gratitude for life they were conducted into a vast room presided over by several nurses and with hundreds of twoyearold girls grouped about the toycovered floor this was the twoyearold room two nurses came forward and elizabeth watched their bearing towards dings with jealous eyes they were kindit was clear they felt kind and yet   presently it was time to go by that time dings was happily established in a corner sitting on the floor with her arms filled and herself indeed for the most part hidden by an unaccustomed wealth of toys she seemed careless of all human relationships as her parents receded  they were forbidden to upset her by saying goodbye  at the door elizabeth glanced back for the last time and behold dings had dropped her new wealth and was standing with a dubious face suddenly elizabeth gasped and the motherly nurse pushed her forward and closed the door  you can come again soon dear she said with unexpected tenderness in her eyes for a moment elizabeth stared at her with a blank face you can come again soon repeated the nurse then with a swift transition elizabeth was weeping in the nurses arms so it was that dentons heart was won also  and three weeks after our young people were absolutely penniless and only one way lay open they must go to the labour company so soon as the rent was a week overdue their few remaining possessions were seized and with scant courtesy they were shown the way out of the hotel elizabeth walked along the passage towards the staircase that ascended to the motionless middle way too dulled by misery to think denton stopped behind to finish a stinging and unsatisfactory argument with the hotel porter and then came hurrying after her flushed and hot he slackened his pace as he overtook her and together they ascended to the middle way in silence there they found two seats vacant and sat down  we need not go thereyet said elizabeth  nonot till we are hungry said denton  they said no more  elizabeths eyes sought a restingplace and found none to the right roared the eastward ways to the left the ways in the opposite direction swarming with people backwards and forwards along a cable overhead rushed a string of gesticulating men dressed like clowns each marked on back and chest with one gigantic letter so that altogether they spelt out      purkinjes digestive pills  an anæmic little woman in horrible coarse blue canvas pointed a little girl to one of this string of hurrying advertisements  look said the anæmic woman theres yer father  which said the little girl  im wiv his nose coloured red said the anæmic woman  the little girl began to cry and elizabeth could have cried too  aint e kickin is legsjust said the anæmic woman in blue trying to make things bright again lookynow  on the façade to the right a huge intensely bright disc of weird colour span incessantly and letters of fire that came and went spelt out      does this make you giddy  then a pause followed by      take a purkinjes digestive pill  a vast and desolating braying began if you love swagger literature put your telephone on to bruggles the greatest author of all time the greatest thinker of all time teaches you morals up to your scalp the very image of socrates except the back of his head which is like shakspeare he has six toes dresses in red and never cleans his teeth hear him  dentons voice became audible in a gap in the uproar i never ought to have married you he was saying i have wasted your money ruined you brought you to misery i am a scoundrel oh this accursed world  she tried to speak and for some moments could not she grasped his hand no she said at last  a halfformed desire suddenly became determination she stood up will you come  he rose also we need not go there yet  not that but i want you to come to the flying stageswhere we met you know the little seat  he hesitated can you he said doubtfully  must she answered  he hesitated still for a moment then moved to obey her will  and so it was they spent their last halfday of freedom out under the open air in the little seat under the flying stages where they had been wont to meet five short years ago there she told him what she could not tell him in the tumultuous public ways that she did not repent even now of their marriagethat whatever discomfort and misery life still had for them she was content with the things that had been the weather was kind to them the seat was sunlit and warm and overhead the shining aëroplanes went and came  at last towards sunsetting their time was at an end and they made their vows to one another and clasped hands and then rose up and went back into the ways of the city a shabbylooking heavyhearted pair tired and hungry soon they came to one of the pale blue signs that marked a labour company bureau for a space they stood in the middle way regarding this and at last descended and entered the waitingroom  the labour company had originally been a charitable organisation its aim was to supply food shelter and work to all comers this it was bound to do by the conditions of its incorporation and it was also bound to supply food and shelter and medical attendance to all incapable of work who chose to demand its aid in exchange these incapables paid labour notes which they had to redeem upon recovery they signed these labour notes with thumbmarks which were photographed and indexed in such a way that this worldwide labour company could identify any one of its two or three hundred million clients at the cost of an hours inquiry the days labour was defined as two spells in a treadmill used in generating electrical force or its equivalent and its due performance could be enforced by law in practice the labour company found it advisable to add to its statutory obligations of food and shelter a few pence a day as an inducement to effort and its enterprise had not only abolished pauperisation altogether but supplied practically all but the very highest and most responsible labour throughout the world nearly a third of the population of the world were its serfs and debtors from the cradle to the grave  in this practical unsentimental way the problem of the unemployed had been most satisfactorily met and overcome no one starved in the public ways and no rags no costume less sanitary and sufficient than the labour companys hygienic but inelegant blue canvas pained the eye throughout the whole world it was the constant theme of the phonographic newspapers how much the world had progressed since nineteenthcentury days when the bodies of those killed by the vehicular traffic or dead of starvation were they alleged a common feature in all the busier streets  denton and elizabeth sat apart in the waitingroom until their turn came most of the others collected there seemed limp and taciturn but three or four young people gaudily dressed made up for the quietude of their companions they were life clients of the company born in the companys creche and destined to die in its hospital and they had been out for a spree with some shillings or so of extra pay they talked vociferously in a later development of the cockney dialect manifestly very proud of themselves  elizabeths eyes went from these to the less assertive figures one seemed exceptionally pitiful to her it was a woman of perhaps fortyfive with goldstained hair and a painted face down which abundant tears had trickled she had a pinched nose hungry eyes lean hands and shoulders and her dusty wornout finery told the story of her life another was a greybearded old man in the costume of a bishop of one of the high episcopal sectsfor religion was now also a business and had its ups and downs and beside him a sickly dissipatedlooking boy of perhaps twoandtwenty glared at fate  presently elizabeth and then denton interviewed the manageressfor the company preferred women in this capacityand found she possessed an energetic face a contemptuous manner and a particularly unpleasant voice they were given various checks including one to certify that they need not have their heads cropped and when they had given their thumbmarks learnt the number corresponding thereunto and exchanged their shabby middleclass clothes for duly numbered blue canvas suits they repaired to the huge plain diningroom for their first meal under these new conditions afterwards they were to return to her for instructions about their work  when they had made the exchange of their clothing elizabeth did not seem able to look at denton at first but he looked at her and saw with astonishment that even in blue canvas she was still beautiful and then their soup and bread came sliding on its little rail down the long table towards them and stopped with a jerk and he forgot the matter for they had had no proper meal for three days  after they had dined they rested for a time neither talkedthere was nothing to say and presently they got up and went back to the manageress to learn what they had to do  the manageress referred to a tablet yr rooms wont be here itll be in the highbury ward ninetyseventh way number two thousand and seventeen better make a note of it on yr card you nought nought nought type seven sixtyfour bcd gamma fortyone female you ave to go to the metalbeating company and try that for a dayfourpence bonus if yere satisfactory and you nought seven one type four seven hundred and nine gfb pi five and ninety male you ave to go to the photographic company on eightyfirst way and learn something or otheri dont knowthrippence eres yr cards thats all next what didnt catch it all lor so suppose i must go over it all again why dont you listen keerless unprovident people oned think these things didnt matter  their ways to their work lay together for a time and now they found they could talk curiously enough the worst of their depression seemed over now that they had actually donned the blue denton could talk with interest even of the work that lay before them whatever it is he said it cant be so hateful as that hat shop and after we have paid for dings we shall still have a whole penny a day between us even now afterwardswe may improveget more money  elizabeth was less inclined to speech i wonder why work should seem so hateful she said  its odd said denton i suppose it wouldnt be if it were not the thought of being ordered about i hope we shall have decent managers  elizabeth did not answer she was not thinking of that she was tracing out some thoughts of her own  of course she said presently we have been using up work all our lives its only fair  she stopped it was too intricate  we paid for it said denton for at that time he had not troubled himself about these complicated things  we did nothingand yet we paid for it thats what i cannot understand  perhaps we are paying said elizabeth presentlyfor her theology was oldfashioned and simple  presently it was time for them to part and each went to the appointed work dentons was to mind a complicated hydraulic press that seemed almost an intelligent thing this press worked by the seawater that was destined finally to flush the city drainsfor the world had long since abandoned the folly of pouring drinkable water into its sewers this water was brought close to the eastward edge of the city by a huge canal and then raised by an enormous battery of pumps into reservoirs at a level of four hundred feet above the sea from which it spread by a billion arterial branches over the city thence it poured down cleansing sluicing working machinery of all sorts through an infinite variety of capillary channels into the great drains the cloacae maximae and so carried the sewage out to the agricultural areas that surrounded london on every side  the press was employed in one of the processes of the photographic manufacture but the nature of the process it did not concern denton to understand the most salient fact to his mind was that it had to be conducted in ruby light and as a consequence the room in which he worked was lit by one coloured globe that poured a lurid and painful illumination about the room in the darkest corner stood the press whose servant denton had now become it was a huge dim glittering thing with a projecting hood that had a remote resemblance to a bowed head and squatting like some metal buddha in this weird light that ministered to its needs it seemed to denton in certain moods almost as if this must needs be the obscure idol to which humanity in some strange aberration had offered up his life his duties had a varied monotony such items as the following will convey an idea of the service of the press the thing worked with a busy clicking so long as things went well but if the paste that came pouring through a feeder from another room and which it was perpetually compressing into thin plates changed in quality the rhythm of its click altered and denton hastened to make certain adjustments the slightest delay involved a waste of paste and the docking of one or more of his daily pence if the supply of paste wanedthere were hand processes of a peculiar sort involved in its preparation and sometimes the workers had convulsions which deranged their outputdenton had to throw the press out of gear in the painful vigilance a multitude of such trivial attentions entailed painful because of the incessant effort its absence of natural interest required denton had now to pass onethird of his days save for an occasional visit from the manager a kindly but singularly foulmouthed man denton passed his working hours in solitude  elizabeths work was of a more social sort there was a fashion for covering the private apartments of the very wealthy with metal plates beautifully embossed with repeated patterns the taste of the time demanded however that the repetition of the patterns should not be exactnot mechanical but naturaland it was found that the most pleasing arrangement of pattern irregularity was obtained by employing women of refinement and natural taste to punch out the patterns with small dies so many square feet of plates was exacted from elizabeth as a minimum and for whatever square feet she did in excess she received a small payment the room like most rooms of women workers was under a manageress men had been found by the labour company not only less exacting but extremely liable to excuse favoured ladies from a proper share of their duties the manageress was a not unkindly taciturn person with the hardened remains of beauty of the brunette type and the other women workers who of course hated her associated her name scandalously with one of the metalwork directors in order to explain her position  only two or three of elizabeths fellowworkers were born labour serfs plain morose girls but most of them corresponded to what the nineteenth century would have called a reduced gentlewoman but the ideal of what constituted a gentlewoman had altered the faint faded negative virtue the modulated voice and restrained gesture of the oldfashioned gentlewoman had vanished from the earth most of her companions showed in discoloured hair ruined complexions and the texture of their reminiscent conversations the vanished glories of a conquering youth all of these artistic workers were much older than elizabeth and two openly expressed their surprise that any one so young and pleasant should come to share their toil but elizabeth did not trouble them with her oldworld moral conceptions  they were permitted and even encouraged to converse with each other for the directors very properly judged that anything that conduced to variations of mood made for pleasing fluctuations in their patterning and elizabeth was almost forced to hear the stories of these lives with which her own interwove garbled and distorted they were by vanity indeed and yet comprehensible enough and soon she began to appreciate the small spites and cliques the little misunderstandings and alliances that enmeshed about her one woman was excessively garrulous and descriptive about a wonderful son of hers another had cultivated a foolish coarseness of speech that she seemed to regard as the wittiest expression of originality conceivable a third mused for ever on dress and whispered to elizabeth how she saved her pence day after day and would presently have a glorious day of freedom wearing  and then followed hours of description two others sat always together and called one another pet names until one day some little thing happened and they sat apart blind and deaf as it seemed to one anothers being and always from them all came an incessant tap tap tap tap and the manageress listened always to the rhythm to mark if one fell away tap tap tap tap so their days passed so their lives must pass elizabeth sat among them kindly and quiet greyhearted marvelling at fate tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap  so there came to denton and elizabeth a long succession of laborious days that hardened their hands wove strange threads of some new and sterner substance into the soft prettiness of their lives and drew grave lines and shadows on their faces the bright convenient ways of the former life had receded to an inaccessible distance slowly they learnt the lesson of the underworldsombre and laborious vast and pregnant there were many little things happened things that would be tedious and miserable to tell things that were bitter and grievous to bearindignities tyrannies such as must ever season the bread of the poor in cities and one thing that was not little but seemed like the utter blackening of life to them which was that the child they had given life to sickened and died but that story that ancient perpetually recurring story has been told so often has been told so beautifully that there is no need to tell it over again here there was the same sharp fear the same long anxiety the deferred inevitable blow and the black silence it has always been the same it will always be the same it is one of the things that must be  and it was elizabeth who was the first to speak after an aching dull interspace of days not indeed of the foolish little name that was a name no longer but of the darkness that brooded over her soul they had come through the shrieking tumultuous ways of the city together the clamour of trade of yelling competitive religions of political appeal had beat upon deaf ears the glare of focussed lights of dancing letters and fiery advertisements had fallen upon the set miserable faces unheeded they took their dinner in the dininghall at a place apart i want said elizabeth clumsily to go out to the flying stagesto that seat here one can say nothing  denton looked at her it will be night he said  i have askedit is a fine night she stopped  he perceived she could find no words to explain herself suddenly he understood that she wished to see the stars once more the stars they had watched together from the open downland in that wild honeymoon of theirs five years ago something caught at his throat he looked away from her  there will be plenty of time to go he said in a matteroffact tone  and at last they came out to their little seat on the flying stage and sat there for a long time in silence the little seat was in shadow but the zenith was pale blue with the effulgence of the stage overhead and all the city spread below them squares and circles and patches of brilliance caught in a meshwork of light the little stars seemed very faint and small near as they had been to the oldworld watcher they had become now infinitely remote yet one could see them in the darkened patches amidst the glare and especially in the northward sky the ancient constellations gliding steadfast and patient about the pole  long our two people sat in silence and at last elizabeth sighed  if i understood she said if i could understand when one is down there the city seems everythingthe noise the hurry the voicesyou must live you must scramble hereit is nothing a thing that passes one can think in peace  yes said denton how flimsy it all is from here more than half of it is swallowed by the night it will pass  we shall pass first said elizabeth  i know said denton if life were not a moment the whole of history would seem like the happening of a day yeswe shall pass and the city will pass and all the things that are to come man and the overman and wonders unspeakable and yet   he paused and then began afresh i know what you feel at least i fancy down there one thinks of ones work ones little vexations and pleasures ones eating and drinking and ease and pain one lives and one must die down there and everydayour sorrow seemed the end of life  up here it is different for instance down there it would seem impossible almost to go on living if one were horribly disfigured horribly crippled disgraced up hereunder these starsnone of those things would matter they dont matter they are a part of something one seems just to touch that somethingunder the stars  he stopped the vague impalpable things in his mind cloudy emotions half shaped towards ideas vanished before the rough grasp of words it is hard to express he said lamely  they sat through a long stillness  it is well to come here he said at last we stopour minds are very finite after all we are just poor animals rising out of the brute each with a mind the poor beginning of a mind we are so stupid so much hurts and yet   i know i knowand some day we shall see  all this frightful stress all this discord will resolve to harmony and we shall know it nothing is but it makes for that nothing all the failuresevery little thing makes for that harmony everything is necessary to it we shall find we shall find nothing not even the most dreadful thing could be left out not even the most trivial every tap of your hammer on the brass every moment of work my idleness even  dear one every movement of our poor little one  all these things go on for ever and the faint impalpable things we sitting here togethereverything   the passion that joined us and what has come since it is not passion now more than anything else it is sorrow dear   he could say no more could follow his thoughts no further  elizabeth made no answershe was very still but presently her hand sought his and found it   ivunderneath  under the stars one may reach upward and touch resignation whatever the evil thing may be but in the heat and stress of the days work we lapse again come disgust and anger and intolerable moods how little is all our magnanimityan accident a phase the very saints of old had first to flee the world and denton and his elizabeth could not flee their world no longer were there open roads to unclaimed lands where men might live freelyhowever hardlyand keep their souls in peace the city had swallowed up mankind  for a time these two labour serfs were kept at their original occupations she at her brass stamping and denton at his press and then came a move for him that brought with it fresh and still bitterer experiences of life in the underways of the great city he was transferred to the care of a rather more elaborate press in the central factory of the london tile trust  in this new situation he had to work in a long vaulted room with a number of other men for the most part born labour serfs he came to this intercourse reluctantly his upbringing had been refined and until his ill fortune had brought him to that costume he had never spoken in his life except by way of command or some immediate necessity to the whitefaced wearers of the blue canvas now at last came contact he had to work beside them share their tools eat with them to both elizabeth and himself this seemed a further degradation  his taste would have seemed extreme to a man of the nineteenth century but slowly and inevitably in the intervening years a gulf had opened between the wearers of the blue canvas and the classes above a difference not simply of circumstances and habits of life but of habits of thoughteven of language the underways had developed a dialect of their own above too had arisen a dialect a code of thought a language of culture which aimed by a sedulous search after fresh distinction to widen perpetually the space between itself and vulgarity the bond of a common faith moreover no longer held the race together the last years of the nineteenth century were distinguished by the rapid development among the prosperous idle of esoteric perversions of the popular religion glosses and interpretations that reduced the broad teachings of the carpenter of nazareth to the exquisite narrowness of their lives and spite of their inclination towards the ancient fashion of living neither elizabeth nor denton had been sufficiently original to escape the suggestion of their surroundings in matters of common behaviour they had followed the ways of their class and so when they fell at last to be labour serfs it seemed to them almost as though they were falling among offensive inferior animals they felt as a nineteenthcentury duke and duchess might have felt who were forced to take rooms in the jago  their natural impulse was to maintain a distance but dentons first idea of a dignified isolation from his new surroundings was soon rudely dispelled he had imagined that his fall to the position of a labour serf was the end of his lesson that when their little daughter had died he had plumbed the deeps of life but indeed these things were only the beginning life demands something more from us than acquiescence and now in a roomful of machine minders he was to learn a wider lesson to make the acquaintance of another factor in life a factor as elemental as the loss of things dear to us more elemental even than toil  his quiet discouragement of conversation was an immediate cause of offencewas interpreted rightly enough i fear as disdain his ignorance of the vulgar dialect a thing upon which he had hitherto prided himself suddenly took upon itself a new aspect he failed to perceive at once that his reception of the coarse and stupid but genially intended remarks that greeted his appearance must have stung the makers of these advances like blows in their faces dont understand he said rather coldly and at hazard no thank you  the man who had addressed him stared scowled and turned away  a second who also failed at dentons unaccustomed ear took the trouble to repeat his remark and denton discovered he was being offered the use of an oil can he expressed polite thanks and this second man embarked upon a penetrating conversation denton he remarked had been a swell and he wanted to know how he had come to wear the blue he clearly expected an interesting record of vice and extravagance had denton ever been at a pleasure city denton was speedily to discover how the existence of these wonderful places of delight permeated and defiled the thought and honour of these unwilling hopeless workers of the underworld  his aristocratic temperament resented these questions he answered no curtly the man persisted with a still more personal question and this time it was denton who turned away  gorblimey said his interlocutor much astonished  it presently forced itself upon dentons mind that this remarkable conversation was being repeated in indignant tones to more sympathetic hearers and that it gave rise to astonishment and ironical laughter they looked at denton with manifestly enhanced interest a curious perception of isolation dawned upon him he tried to think of his press and its unfamiliar peculiarities  the machines kept everybody pretty busy during the first spell and then came a recess it was only an interval for refreshment too brief for any one to go out to a labour company diningroom denton followed his fellowworkers into a short gallery in which were a number of bins of refuse from the presses  each man produced a packet of food denton had no packet the manager a careless young man who held his position by influence had omitted to warn denton that it was necessary to apply for this provision he stood apart feeling hungry the others drew together in a group and talked in undertones glancing at him ever and again he became uneasy his appearance of disregard cost him an increasing effort he tried to think of the levers of his new press  presently one a man shorter but much broader and stouter than denton came forward to him denton turned to him as unconcernedly as possible here said the delegateas denton judged him to beextending a cube of bread in a not too clean hand he had a swart broadnosed face and his mouth hung down towards one corner  denton felt doubtful for the instant whether this was meant for civility or insult his impulse was to decline no thanks he said and at the mans change of expression im not hungry  there came a laugh from the group behind told you so said the man who had offered denton the loan of an oil can hes top side he is you aint good enough for im  the swart face grew a shade darker  here said its owner still extending the bread and speaking in a lower tone you got to eat this see  denton looked into the threatening face before him and odd little currents of energy seemed to be running through his limbs and body  i dont want it he said trying a pleasant smile that twitched and failed  the thickset man advanced his face and the bread became a physical threat in his hand dentons mind rushed together to the one problem of his antagonists eyes  eat it said the swart man  there came a pause and then they both moved quickly the cube of bread described a complicated path a curve that would have ended in dentons face and then his fist hit the wrist of the hand that gripped it and it flew upward and out of the conflictits part played  he stepped back quickly fists clenched and arms tense the hot dark countenance receded became an alert hostility watching its chance denton for one instant felt confident and strangely buoyant and serene his heart beat quickly he felt his body alive and glowing to the tips  scrap boys shouted some one and then the dark figure had leapt forward ducked back and sideways and come in again denton struck out and was hit one of his eyes seemed to him to be demolished and he felt a soft lip under his fist just before he was hit againthis time under the chin a huge fan of fiery needles shot open he had a momentary persuasion that his head was knocked to pieces and then something hit his head and back from behind and the fight became an uninteresting an impersonal thing  he was aware that timeseconds or minuteshad passed abstract uneventful time he was lying with his head in a heap of ashes and something wet and warm ran swiftly into his neck the first shock broke up into discrete sensations all his head throbbed his eye and his chin throbbed exceedingly and the taste of blood was in his mouth  hes all right said a voice hes opening his eyes  serve himwell right said a second  his mates were standing about him he made an effort and sat up he put his hand to the back of his head and his hair was wet and full of cinders a laugh greeted the gesture his eye was partially closed he perceived what had happened his momentary anticipation of a final victory had vanished  looks surprised said some one  ave any more said a wit and then imitating dentons refined accent  no thank you  denton perceived the swart man with a bloodstained handkerchief before his face and somewhat in the background  wheres that bit of bread hes got to eat said a little ferretfaced creature and sought with his foot in the ashes of the adjacent bin  denton had a moment of internal debate he knew the code of honour requires a man to pursue a fight he has begun to the bitter end but this was his first taste of the bitterness he was resolved to rise again but he felt no passionate impulse it occurred to himand the thought was no very violent spurthat he was perhaps after all a coward for a moment his will was heavy a lump of lead  ere it is said the little ferretfaced man and stooped to pick up a cindery cube he looked at denton then at the others  slowly unwillingly denton stood up  a dirtyfaced albino extended a hand to the ferretfaced man gimme that toke he said he advanced threateningly bread in hand to denton so you aint ad your bellyful yet he said eh  now it was coming no i havent said denton with a catching of the breath and resolved to try this brute behind the ear before he himself got stunned again he knew he would be stunned again he was astonished how ill he had judged himself beforehand a few ridiculous lunges and down he would go again he watched the albinos eyes the albino was grinning confidently like a man who plans an agreeable trick a sudden perception of impending indignities stung denton  you leave im alone jim said the swart man suddenly over the bloodstained rag he aint done nothing to you  the albinos grin vanished he stopped he looked from one to the other it seemed to denton that the swart man demanded the privilege of his destruction the albino would have been better  you leave im alone said the swart man see es ad is licks  a clattering bell lifted up its voice and solved the situation the albino hesitated lucky for you he said adding a foul metaphor and turned with the others towards the pressroom again wait for the end of the spell mate said the albino over his shoulderan afterthought the swart man waited for the albino to precede him denton realised that he had a reprieve  the men passed towards an open door denton became aware of his duties and hurried to join the tail of the queue at the doorway of the vaulted gallery of presses a yellowuniformed labour policeman stood ticking a card he had ignored the swart mans hæmorrhage  hurry up there he said to denton  hello he said at the sight of his facial disarray whos been hitting you  thats my affair said denton  not if it spiles your work it aint said the man in yellow you mind that  denton made no answer he was a rougha labourer he wore the blue canvas the laws of assault and battery he knew were not for the likes of him he went to his press  he could feel the skin of his brow and chin and head lifting themselves to noble bruises felt the throb and pain of each aspiring contusion his nervous system slid down to lethargy at each movement in his press adjustment he felt he lifted a weight and as for his honourthat too throbbed and puffed how did he stand what precisely had happened in the last ten minutes what would happen next he knew that here was enormous matter for thought and he could not think save in disordered snatches  his mood was a sort of stagnant astonishment all his conceptions were overthrown he had regarded his security from physical violence as inherent as one of the conditions of life so indeed it had been while he wore his middleclass costume had his middleclass property to serve for his defence but who would interfere among labour roughs fighting together and indeed in those days no man would in the underworld there was no law between man and man the law and machinery of the state had become for them something that held men down fended them off from much desirable property and pleasure and that was all violence that ocean in which the brutes live for ever and from which a thousand dykes and contrivances have won our hazardous civilised life had flowed in again upon the sinking underways and submerged them the fist ruled denton had come right down at last to the elementalfist and trick and the stubborn heart and fellowshipeven as it was in the beginning  the rhythm of his machine changed and his thoughts were interrupted  presently he could think again strange how quickly things had happened he bore these men who had thrashed him no very vivid illwill he was bruised and enlightened he saw with absolute fairness now the reasonableness of his unpopularity he had behaved like a fool disdain seclusion are the privilege of the strong the fallen aristocrat still clinging to his pointless distinction is surely the most pitiful creature of pretence in all this clamant universe good heavens what was there for him to despise in these men  what a pity he had not appreciated all this better five hours ago  what would happen at the end of the spell he could not tell he could not imagine he could not imagine the thoughts of these men he was sensible only of their hostility and utter want of sympathy vague possibilities of shame and violence chased one another across his mind could he devise some weapon he recalled his assault upon the hypnotist but there were no detachable lamps here he could see nothing that he could catch up in his defence  for a space he thought of a headlong bolt for the security of the public ways directly the spell was over apart from the trivial consideration of his selfrespect he perceived that this would be only a foolish postponement and aggravation of his trouble he perceived the ferretfaced man and the albino talking together with their eyes towards him presently they were talking to the swart man who stood with his broad back studiously towards denton  at last came the end of the second spell the lender of oil cans stopped his press sharply and turned round wiping his mouth with the back of his hand his eyes had the quiet expectation of one who seats himself in a theatre  now was the crisis and all the little nerves of dentons being seemed leaping and dancing he had decided to show fight if any fresh indignity was offered him he stopped his press and turned with an enormous affectation of ease he walked down the vault and entered the passage of the ash pits only to discover he had left his jacketwhich he had taken off because of the heat of the vaultbeside his press he walked back he met the albino eye to eye  he heard the ferretfaced man in expostulation e reely ought eat it said the ferretfaced man e did reely  noyou leave im alone said the swart man  apparently nothing further was to happen to him that day he passed out to the passage and staircase that led up to the moving platforms of the city  he emerged on the livid brilliance and streaming movement of the public street he became acutely aware of his disfigured face and felt his swelling bruises with a limp investigatory hand he went up to the swiftest platform and seated himself on a labour company bench  he lapsed into a pensive torpor the immediate dangers and stresses of his position he saw with a sort of static clearness what would they do tomorrow he could not tell what would elizabeth think of his brutalisation he could not tell he was exhausted he was aroused presently by a hand upon his arm  he looked up and saw the swart man seated beside him he started surely he was safe from violence in the public way  the swart mans face retained no traces of his share in the fight his expression was free from hostilityseemed almost deferential scuse me he said with a total absence of truculence denton realised that no assault was intended he stared awaiting the next development  it was evident the next sentence was premeditated whadiwasgoingto saywas this said the swart man and sought through a silence for further words  whadiwasgoingto saywas this he repeated  finally he abandoned that gambit youre aw right he cried laying a grimy hand on dentons grimy sleeve youre aw right youre a geman sorryvery sorry wanted to tell you that  denton realised that there must exist motives beyond a mere impulse to abominable proceedings in the man he meditated and swallowed an unworthy pride  i did not mean to be offensive to you he said in refusing that bit of bread  meant it friendly said the swart man recalling the scene butin front of that blarsted whitey and his sniggerwelli ad to scrap  yes said denton with sudden fervour i was a fool  ah said the swart man with great satisfaction thats aw right shake  and denton shook  the moving platform was rushing by the establishment of a face moulder and its lower front was a huge display of mirror designed to stimulate the thirst for more symmetrical features denton caught the reflection of himself and his new friend enormously twisted and broadened his own face was puffed onesided and bloodstained a grin of idiotic and insincere amiability distorted its latitude a wisp of hair occluded one eye the trick of the mirror presented the swart man as a gross expansion of lip and nostril they were linked by shaking hands then abruptly this vision passedto return to memory in the anæmic meditations of a waking dawn  as he shook the swart man made some muddled remark to the effect that he had always known he could get on with a gentleman if one came his way he prolonged the shaking until denton under the influence of the mirror withdrew his hand the swart man became pensive spat impressively on the platform and resumed his theme  whad i was going to say was this he said was gravelled and shook his head at his foot  denton became curious go on he said attentive  the swart man took the plunge he grasped dentons arm became intimate in his attitude scuse me he said fact is you done know ow to scrap done know ow to whyyou done know ow to begin youll get killed if you dont mind ouldin your andsthere  he reinforced his statement by objurgation watching the effect of each oath with a wary eye  fr instance youre tall long arms you get a longer reach than any one in the brasted vault gobblimey but i thought id got a tough on stead of which  scuse me i wouldnt have it you if id known its like fighting sacks tisn right yr arms seemed ung on ooks reglarung on ooks there  denton stared and then surprised and hurt his battered chin by a sudden laugh bitter tears came into his eyes  go on he said  the swart man reverted to his formula he was good enough to say he liked the look of denton thought he had stood up amazing plucky ony pluck aint no goodaint no brasted goodif you dont old your ands  whad i was going to say was this he said lemme show you ow to scrap jest lemme youre ignant you aint no class but you might be a very decent scrappervery decent shown thats what i meant to say  denton hesitated but he said i cant give you anything  thats the geman all over said the swart man who arst you to  but your time  if you dont get learnt scrapping youll get killeddont you make no bones of that  denton thought i dont know he said  he looked at the face beside him and all its native coarseness shouted at him he felt a quick revulsion from his transient friendliness it seemed to him incredible that it should be necessary for him to be indebted to such a creature  the chaps are always scrapping said the swart man always and of courseif one gets waxy and its you vital   by god cried denton i wish one would  of course if you feel like that  you dont understand  praps i dont said the swart man and lapsed into a fuming silence  when he spoke again his voice was less friendly and he prodded denton by way of address look see he said are you going to let me show you ow to scrap  its tremendously kind of you said denton but  there was a pause the swart man rose and bent over denton  too much geman he saideh i got a red face by gosh you areyou are a brasted fool  he turned away and instantly denton realised the truth of this remark  the swart man descended with dignity to a cross way and denton after a momentary impulse to pursuit remained on the platform for a time the things that had happened filled his mind in one day his graceful system of resignation had been shattered beyond hope brute force the final the fundamental had thrust its face through all his explanations and glosses and consolations and grinned enigmatically though he was hungry and tired he did not go on directly to the labour hotel where he would meet elizabeth he found he was beginning to think he wanted very greatly to think and so wrapped in a monstrous cloud of meditation he went the circuit of the city on his moving platform twice you figure him tearing through the glaring thundervoiced city at a pace of fifty miles an hour the city upon the planet that spins along its chartless path through space many thousands of miles an hour funking most terribly and trying to understand why the heart and will in him should suffer and keep alive  when at last he came to elizabeth she was white and anxious he might have noted she was in trouble had it not been for his own preoccupation he feared most that she would desire to know every detail of his indignities that she would be sympathetic or indignant he saw her eyebrows rise at the sight of him  ive had rough handling he said and gasped its too freshtoo hot i dont want to talk about it he sat down with an unavoidable air of sullenness  she stared at him in astonishment and as she read something of the significant hieroglyphic of his battered face her lips whitened her handit was thinner now than in the days of their prosperity and her first finger was a little altered by the metal punching she didclenched convulsively this horrible world she said and said no more  in these latter days they had become a very silent couple they said scarcely a word to each other that night but each followed a private train of thought in the small hours as elizabeth lay awake denton started up beside her suddenlyhe had been lying as still as a dead man  i cannot stand it cried denton i will not stand it  she saw him dimly sitting up saw his arm lunge as if in a furious blow at the enshrouding night then for a space he was still  it is too muchit is more than one can bear  she could say nothing to her also it seemed that this was as far as one could go she waited through a long stillness she could see that denton sat with his arms about his knees his chin almost touching them  then he laughed  no he said at last im going to stand it thats the peculiar thing there isnt a grain of suicide in usnot a grain i suppose all the people with a turn that way have gone were going through with itto the end  elizabeth thought grayly and realised that this also was true  were going through with it to think of all who have gone through with it all the generationsendlessendless little beasts that snapped and snarled snapping and snarling snapping and snarling generation after generation  his monotone ended abruptly resumed after a vast interval  there were ninety thousand years of stone age a denton somewhere in all those years apostolic succession the grace of going through let me see ninetynine hundredthree nines twentyseventhree thousand generations of menmen more or less and each fought and was bruised and shamed and somehow held his owngoing through with itpassing it on and thousands more to come perhapsthousands  passing it on i wonder if they will thank us  his voice assumed an argumentative note if one could find something definite  if one could say this is whythis is why it goes on  he became still and elizabeths eyes slowly separated him from the darkness until at last she could see how he sat with his head resting on his hand a sense of the enormous remoteness of their minds came to her that dim suggestion of another being seemed to her a figure of their mutual understanding what could he be thinking now what might he not say next another age seemed to elapse before he sighed and whispered no i dont understand it no then a long interval and he repeated this but the second time it had the tone almost of a solution  she became aware that he was preparing to lie down she marked his movements perceived with astonishment how he adjusted his pillow with a careful regard to comfort he lay down with a sigh of contentment almost his passion had passed he lay still and presently his breathing became regular and deep  but elizabeth remained with eyes wide open in the darkness until the clamour of a bell and the sudden brilliance of the electric light warned them that the labour company had need of them for yet another day  that day came a scuffle with the albino whitey and the little ferretfaced man blunt the swart artist in scrapping having first let denton grasp the bearing of his lesson intervened not without a certain quality of patronage drop is air whitey and let the man be said his gross voice through a shower of indignities cant you see e dont know ow to scrap and denton lying shamefully in the dust realised that he must accept that course of instruction after all  he made his apology straight and clean he scrambled up and walked to blunt i was a fool and you are right he said if it isnt too late   that night after the second spell denton went with blunt to certain waste and slimesoaked vaults under the port of london to learn the first beginnings of the high art of scrapping as it had been perfected in the great world of the underways how to hit or kick a man so as to hurt him excruciatingly or make him violently sick how to hit or kick vital how to use glass in ones garments as a club and to spread red ruin with various domestic implements how to anticipate and demolish your adversarys intentions in other directions all the pleasant devices in fact that had grown up among the disinherited of the great cities of the twentieth and twentyfirst centuries were spread out by a gifted exponent for dentons learning blunts bashfulness fell from him as the instruction proceeded and he developed a certain expert dignity a quality of fatherly consideration he treated denton with the utmost consideration only flicking him up a bit now and then to keep the interest hot and roaring with laughter at a happy fluke of dentons that covered his mouth with blood  im always keerless of my mouth said blunt admitting a weakness always it dont seem to matter like just getting bashed in the mouthnot if your chins all right tastin blood does me good always but i better not it you again  denton went home to fall asleep exhausted and wake in the small hours with aching limbs and all his bruises tingling was it worth while that he should go on living he listened to elizabeths breathing and remembering that he must have awaked her the previous night he lay very still he was sick with infinite disgust at the new conditions of his life he hated it all hated even the genial savage who had protected him so generously the monstrous fraud of civilisation glared stark before his eyes he saw it as a vast lunatic growth producing a deepening torrent of savagery below and above ever more flimsy gentility and silly wastefulness he could see no redeeming reason no touch of honour either in the life he had led or in this life to which he had fallen civilisation presented itself as some catastrophic product as little concerned with mensave as victimsas a cyclone or a planetary collision he and therefore all mankind seemed living utterly in vain his mind sought some strange expedients of escape if not for himself then at least for elizabeth but he meant them for himself what if he hunted up mwres and told him of their disaster it came to him as an astonishing thing how utterly mwres and bindon had passed out of his range where were they what were they doing from that he passed to thoughts of utter dishonour and finally not arising in any way out of this mental tumult but ending it as dawn ends the night came the clear and obvious conclusion of the night before the conviction that he had to go through with things that apart from any remoter view and quite sufficient for all his thought and energy he had to stand up and fight among his fellows and quit himself like a man  the second nights instruction was perhaps less dreadful than the first and the third was even endurable for blunt dealt out some praise the fourth day denton chanced upon the fact that the ferretfaced man was a coward there passed a fortnight of smouldering days and feverish instruction at night blunt with many blasphemies testified that never had he met so apt a pupil and all night long denton dreamt of kicks and counters and gouges and cunning tricks for all that time no further outrages were attempted for fear of blunt and then came the second crisis blunt did not come one dayafterwards he admitted his deliberate intentionand through the tedious morning whitey awaited the interval between the spells with an ostentatious impatience he knew nothing of the scrapping lessons and he spent the time in telling denton and the vault generally of certain disagreeable proceedings he had in mind  whitey was not popular and the vault disgorged to see him haze the new man with only a languid interest but matters changed when whiteys attempt to open the proceedings by kicking denton in the face was met by an excellently executed duck catch and throw that completed the flight of whiteys foot in its orbit and brought whiteys head into the ashheap that had once received dentons whitey arose a shade whiter and now blasphemously bent upon vital injuries there were indecisive passages foiled enterprises that deepened whiteys evidently growing perplexity and then things developed into a grouping of denton uppermost with whiteys throat in his hand his knee on whiteys chest and a tearful whitey with a black face protruding tongue and broken finger endeavouring to explain the misunderstanding by means of hoarse sounds moreover it was evident that among the bystanders there had never been a more popular person than denton  denton with proper precaution released his antagonist and stood up his blood seemed changed to some sort of fluid fire his limbs felt light and supernaturally strong the idea that he was a martyr in the civilisation machine had vanished from his mind he was a man in a world of men  the little ferretfaced man was the first in the competition to pat him on the back the lender of oil cans was a radiant sun of genial congratulation it seemed incredible to denton that he had ever thought of despair  denton was convinced that not only had he to go through with things but that he could he sat on the canvas pallet expounding this new aspect to elizabeth one side of his face was bruised she had not recently fought she had not been patted on the back there were no hot bruises upon her face only a pallor and a new line or so about the mouth she was taking the womans share she looked steadfastly at denton in his new mood of prophecy i feel that there is something he was saying something that goes on a being of life in which we live and move and have our being something that began fiftya hundred million years ago perhaps that goes onon growing spreading to things beyond usthings that will justify us all that will explain and justify my fightingthese bruises and all the pain of it its the chiselyes the chisel of the maker if only i could make you feel as i feel if i could make you you will dear i know you will  no she said in a low voice no i shall not  so i might have thought  she shook her head no she said i have thought as well what you saydoesnt convince me  she looked at his face resolutely i hate it she said and caught at her breath you do not understand you do not think there was a time when you said things and i believed them i am growing wiser you are a man you can fight force your way you do not mind bruises you can be coarse and ugly and still a man yesit makes you it makes you you are right only a woman is not like that we are different we have let ourselves get civilised too soon this underworld is not for us  she paused and began again  i hate it i hate this horrible canvas i hate it more thanmore than the worst that can happen it hurts my fingers to touch it it is horrible to the skin and the women i work with day after day i lie awake at nights and think how i may be growing like them  she stopped i am growing like them she cried passionately  denton stared at her distress but he said and stopped  you dont understand what have i what have i to save me you can fight fighting is mans work but womenwomen are different i have thought it all out i have done nothing but think night and day look at the colour of my face i cannot go on i cannot endure this life i cannot endure it  she stopped she hesitated  you do not know all she said abruptly and for an instant her lips had a bitter smile i have been asked to leave you  leave me  she made no answer save an affirmative movement of the head  denton stood up sharply they stared at one another through a long silence  suddenly she turned herself about and flung face downward upon their canvas bed she did not sob she made no sound she lay still upon her face after a vast distressful void her shoulders heaved and she began to weep silently  elizabeth he whisperedelizabeth  very softly he sat down beside her bent down put his arm across her in a doubtful caress seeking vainly for some clue to this intolerable situation  elizabeth he whispered in her ear  she thrust him from her with her hand i cannot bear a child to be a slave and broke out into loud and bitter weeping  dentons face changedbecame blank dismay presently he slipped from the bed and stood on his feet all the complacency had vanished from his face had given place to impotent rage he began to rave and curse at the intolerable forces which pressed upon him at all the accidents and hot desires and heedlessness that mock the life of man his little voice rose in that little room and he shook his fist this animalcule of the earth at all that environed him about at the millions about him at his past and future and all the insensate vastness of the overwhelming city   vbindon intervenes  in bindons younger days he had dabbled in speculation and made three brilliant flukes for the rest of his life he had the wisdom to let gambling alone and the conceit to believe himself a very clever man a certain desire for influence and reputation interested him in the business intrigues of the giant city in which his flukes were made he became at last one of the most influential shareholders in the company that owned the london flying stages to which the aëroplanes came from all parts of the world this much for his public activities in his private life he was a man of pleasure and this is the story of his heart  but before proceeding to such depths one must devote a little time to the exterior of this person its physical basis was slender and short and dark and the face which was finefeatured and assisted by pigments varied from an insecure selfcomplacency to an intelligent uneasiness his face and head had been depilated according to the cleanly and hygienic fashion of the time so that the colour and contour of his hair varied with his costume this he was constantly changing  at times he would distend himself with pneumatic vestments in the rococo vein from among the billowy developments of this style and beneath a translucent and illuminated headdress his eye watched jealously for the respect of the less fashionable world at other times he emphasised his elegant slenderness in closefitting garments of black satin for effects of dignity he would assume broad pneumatic shoulders from which hung a robe of carefully arranged folds of china silk and a classical bindon in pink tights was also a transient phenomenon in the eternal pageant of destiny in the days when he hoped to marry elizabeth he sought to impress and charm her and at the same time to take off something of his burthen of forty years by wearing the last fancy of the contemporary buck a costume of elastic material with distensible warts and horns changing in colour as he walked by an ingenious arrangement of versatile chromatophores and no doubt if elizabeths affection had not been already engaged by the worthless denton and if her tastes had not had that odd bias for oldfashioned ways this extremely chic conception would have ravished her bindon had consulted elizabeths father before presenting himself in this garbhe was one of those men who always invite criticism of their costumeand mwres had pronounced him all that the heart of woman could desire but the affair of the hypnotist proved that his knowledge of the heart of woman was incomplete  bindons idea of marrying had been formed some little time before mwres threw elizabeths budding womanhood in his way it was one of bindons most cherished secrets that he had a considerable capacity for a pure and simple life of a grossly sentimental type the thought imparted a sort of pathetic seriousness to the offensive and quite inconsequent and unmeaning excesses which he was pleased to regard as dashing wickedness and which a number of good people also were so unwise as to treat in that desirable manner as a consequence of these excesses and perhaps by reason also of an inherited tendency to early decay his liver became seriously affected and he suffered increasing inconvenience when travelling by aëroplane it was during his convalescence from a protracted bilious attack that it occurred to him that in spite of all the terrible fascinations of vice if he found a beautiful gentle good young woman of a not too violently intellectual type to devote her life to him he might yet be saved to goodness and even rear a spirited family in his likeness to solace his declining years but like so many experienced men of the world he doubted if there were any good women of such as he had heard tell he was outwardly sceptical and privately much afraid  when the aspiring mwres effected his introduction to elizabeth it seemed to him that his good fortune was complete he fell in love with her at once of course he had always been falling in love since he was sixteen in accordance with the extremely varied recipes to be found in the accumulated literature of many centuries but this was different this was real love it seemed to him to call forth all the lurking goodness in his nature he felt that for her sake he could give up a way of life that had already produced the gravest lesions on his liver and nervous system his imagination presented him with idyllic pictures of the life of the reformed rake he would never be sentimental with her or silly but always a little cynical and bitter as became the past yet he was sure she would have an intuition of his real greatness and goodness and in due course he would confess things to her pour his version of what he regarded as his wickednessshowing what a complex of goethe and benvenuto cellini and shelley and all those other chaps he really wasinto her shocked very beautiful and no doubt sympathetic ear and preparatory to these things he wooed her with infinite subtlety and respect and the reserve with which elizabeth treated him seemed nothing more nor less than an exquisite modesty touched and enhanced by an equally exquisite lack of ideas  bindon knew nothing of her wandering affections nor of the attempt made by mwres to utilise hypnotism as a corrective to this digression of her heart he conceived he was on the best of terms with elizabeth and had made her quite successfully various significant presents of jewellery and the more virtuous cosmetics when her elopement with denton threw the world out of gear for him his first aspect of the matter was rage begotten of wounded vanity and as mwres was the most convenient person he vented the first brunt of it upon him  he went immediately and insulted the desolate father grossly and then spent an active and determined day going to and fro about the city and interviewing people in a consistent and partlysuccessful attempt to ruin that matrimonial speculator the effectual nature of these activities gave him a temporary exhilaration and he went to the diningplace he had frequented in his wicked days in a devilmaycare frame of mind and dined altogether too amply and cheerfully with two other golden youths in their early forties he threw up the game no woman was worth being good for and he astonished even himself by the strain of witty cynicism he developed one of the other desperate blades warmed with wine made a facetious allusion to his disappointment but at the time this did not seem unpleasant  the next morning found his liver and temper inflamed he kicked his phonographicnews machine to pieces dismissed his valet and resolved that he would perpetrate a terrible revenge upon elizabeth or denton or somebody but anyhow it was to be a terrible revenge and the friend who had made fun at him should no longer see him in the light of a foolish girls victim he knew something of the little property that was due to her and that this would be the only support of the young couple until mwres should relent if mwres did not relent and if unpropitious things should happen to the affair in which elizabeths expectations lay they would come upon evil times and be sufficiently amenable to temptation of a sinister sort bindons imagination abandoning its beautiful idealism altogether expanded the idea of temptation of a sinister sort he figured himself as the implacable the intricate and powerful man of wealth pursuing this maiden who had scorned him and suddenly her image came upon his mind vivid and dominant and for the first time in his life bindon realised something of the real power of passion  his imagination stood aside like a respectful footman who has done his work in ushering in the emotion  my god cried bindon i will have her if i have to kill myself to get her and that other fellow  after an interview with his medical man and a penance for his overnight excesses in the form of bitter drugs a mitigated but absolutely resolute bindon sought out mwres mwres he found properly smashed and impoverished and humble in a mood of frantic selfpreservation ready to sell himself body and soul much more any interest in a disobedient daughter to recover his lost position in the world in the reasonable discussion that followed it was agreed that these misguided young people should be left to sink into distress or possibly even assisted towards that improving discipline by bindons financial influence  and then said mwres  they will come to the labour company said bindon they will wear the blue canvas  and then  she will divorce him he said and sat for a moment intent upon that prospect for in those days the austere limitations of divorce of victorian times were extraordinarily relaxed and a couple might separate on a hundred different scores  then suddenly bindon astonished himself and mwres by jumping to his feet she shall divorce him he cried i will have it soi will work it so by god it shall be so he shall be disgraced so that she must he shall be smashed and pulverised  the idea of smashing and pulverising inflamed him further he began a jovian pacing up and down the little office i will have her he cried i will have her heaven and hell shall not save her from me his passion evaporated in its expression and left him at the end simply histrionic he struck an attitude and ignored with heroic determination a sharp twinge of pain about the diaphragm and mwres sat with his pneumatic cap deflated and himself very visibly impressed  and so with a fair persistency bindon sat himself to the work of being elizabeths malignant providence using with ingenious dexterity every particle of advantage wealth in those days gave a man over his fellowcreatures a resort to the consolations of religion hindered these operations not at all he would go and talk with an interesting experienced and sympathetic father of the huysmanite sect of the isis cult about all the irrational little proceedings he was pleased to regard as his heavendismaying wickedness and the interesting experienced and sympathetic father representing heaven dismayed would with a pleasing affectation of horror suggest simple and easy penances and recommend a monastic foundation that was airy cool hygienic and not vulgarised for viscerally disordered penitent sinners of the refined and wealthy type and after these excursions bindon would come back to london quite active and passionate again he would machinate with really considerable energy and repair to a certain gallery high above the street of moving ways from which he could view the entrance to the barrack of the labour company in the ward which sheltered denton and elizabeth and at last one day he saw elizabeth go in and thereby his passion was renewed  so in the fullness of time the complicated devices of bindon ripened and he could go to mwres and tell him that the young people were near despair  its time for you he said to let your parental affections have play shes been in blue canvas some months and theyve been cooped together in one of those labour dens and the little girl is dead she knows now what his manhood is worth to her by way of protection poor girl shell see things now in a clearer light you go to heri dont want to appear in this affair yetand point out to her how necessary it is that she should get a divorce from him  shes obstinate said mwres doubtfully  spirit said bindon shes a wonderful girla wonderful girl  shell refuse  of course she will but leave it open to her leave it open to her and some dayin that stuffy den in that irksome toilsome life they cant help ittheyll have a quarrel and then  mwres meditated over the matter and did as he was told  then bindon as he had arranged with his spiritual adviser went into retreat the retreat of the huysmanite sect was a beautiful place with the sweetest air in london lit by natural sunlight and with restful quadrangles of real grass open to the sky where at the same time the penitent man of pleasure might enjoy all the pleasures of loafing and all the satisfaction of distinguished austerity and save for participation in the simple and wholesome dietary of the place and in certain magnificent chants bindon spent all his time in meditation upon the theme of elizabeth and the extreme purification his soul had undergone since he first saw her and whether he would be able to get a dispensation to marry her from the experienced and sympathetic father in spite of the approaching sin of her divorce and then  bindon would lean against a pillar of the quadrangle and lapse into reveries on the superiority of virtuous love to any other form of indulgence a curious feeling in his back and chest that was trying to attract his attention a disposition to be hot or shiver a general sense of illhealth and cutaneous discomfort he did his best to ignore all that of course belonged to the old life that he was shaking off  when he came out of retreat he went at once to mwres to ask for news of elizabeth mwres was clearly under the impression that he was an exemplary father profoundly touched about the heart by his childs unhappiness she was pale he said greatly moved she was pale when i asked her to come away and leave himand be happyshe put her head down upon the tablemwres sniffedand cried  his agitation was so great that he could say no more  ah said bindon respecting this manly grief oh said bindon quite suddenly with his hand to his side  mwres looked up sharply out of the pit of his sorrows startled whats the matter he asked visibly concerned  a most violent pain excuse me you were telling me about elizabeth  and mwres after a decent solicitude for bindons pain proceeded with his report it was even unexpectedly hopeful elizabeth in her first emotion at discovering that her father had not absolutely deserted her had been frank with him about her sorrows and disgusts  yes said bindon magnificently i shall have her yet and then that novel pain twitched him for the second time  for these lower pains the priest was comparatively ineffectual inclining rather to regard the body and them as mental illusions amenable to contemplation so bindon took it to a man of a class he loathed a medical man of extraordinary repute and incivility we must go all over you said the medical man and did so with the most disgusting frankness did you ever bring any children into the world asked this gross materialist among other impertinent questions  not that i know of said bindon too amazed to stand upon his dignity  ah said the medical man and proceeded with his punching and sounding medical science in those days was just reaching the beginnings of precision youd better go right away said the medical man and make the euthanasia the sooner the better  bindon gasped he had been trying not to understand the technical explanations and anticipations in which the medical man had indulged  i say he said but do you mean to say  your science   nothing said the medical man a few opiates the thing is your own doing you know to a certain extent  i was sorely tempted in my youth  its not that so much but you come of a bad stock even if youd have taken precautions youd have had bad times to wind up with the mistake was getting born the indiscretions of the parents and youve shirked exercise and so forth  i had no one to advise me  medical men are always willing  i was a spirited young fellow  we wont argue the mischiefs done now youve lived we cant start you again you ought never to have started at all franklythe euthanasia  bindon hated him in silence for a space every word of this brutal expert jarred upon his refinements he was so gross so impermeable to all the subtler issues of being but it is no good picking a quarrel with a doctor my religious beliefs he said i dont approve of suicide  youve been doing it all your life  well anyhow ive come to take a serious view of life now  youre bound to if you go on living youll hurt but for practical purposes its late however if you mean to do thatperhaps id better mix you a little something youll hurt a great deal these little twinges   twinges  mere preliminary notices  how long can i go on i mean before i hurtreally  youll get it hot soon perhaps three days  bindon tried to argue for an extension of time and in the midst of his pleading gasped put his hand to his side suddenly the extraordinary pathos of his life came to him clear and vivid its hard he said its infernally hard ive been no mans enemy but my own ive always treated everybody quite fairly  the medical man stared at him without any sympathy for some seconds he was reflecting how excellent it was that there were no more bindons to carry on that line of pathos he felt quite optimistic then he turned to his telephone and ordered up a prescription from the central pharmacy  he was interrupted by a voice behind him by god cried bindon ill have her yet  the physician stared over his shoulder at bindons expression and then altered the prescription  so soon as this painful interview was over bindon gave way to rage he settled that the medical man was not only an unsympathetic brute and wanting in the first beginnings of a gentleman but also highly incompetent and he went off to four other practitioners in succession with a view to the establishment of this intuition but to guard against surprises he kept that little prescription in his pocket with each he began by expressing his grave doubts of the first doctors intelligence honesty and professional knowledge and then stated his symptoms suppressing only a few more material facts in each case these were always subsequently elicited by the doctor in spite of the welcome depreciation of another practitioner none of these eminent specialists would give bindon any hope of eluding the anguish and helplessness that loomed now close upon him to the last of them he unburthened his mind of an accumulated disgust with medical science after centuries and centuries he exclaimed hotly and you can do nothingexcept admit your helplessness i say save meand what do you do  no doubt its hard on you said the doctor but you should have taken precautions  how was i to know  it wasnt our place to run after you said the medical man picking a thread of cotton from his purple sleeve why should we save you in particular you seefrom one point of viewpeople with imaginations and passions like yours have to gothey have to go  go  die out its an eddy  he was a young man with a serene face he smiled at bindon we get on with research you know we give advice when people have the sense to ask for it and we bide our time  bide your time  we hardly know enough yet to take over the management you know  the management  you neednt be anxious science is young yet its got to keep on growing for a few generations we know enough now to know we dont know enough yet but the time is coming all the same you wont see the time but between ourselves you rich men and party bosses with your natural play of the passions and patriotism and religion and so forth have made rather a mess of things havent you these underways and all that sort of thing some of us have a sort of fancy that in time we may know enough to take over a little more than the ventilation and drains knowledge keeps on piling up you know it keeps on growing and theres not the slightest hurry for a generation or so some daysome day men will live in a different way he looked at bindon and meditated therell be a lot of dying out before that day can come  bindon attempted to point out to this young man how silly and irrelevant such talk was to a sick man like himself how impertinent and uncivil it was to him an older man occupying a position in the official world of extraordinary power and influence he insisted that a doctor was paid to cure peoplehe laid great stress on paidand had no business to glance even for a moment at those other questions but we do said the young man insisting upon facts and bindon lost his temper  his indignation carried him home that these incompetent impostors who were unable to save the life of a really influential man like himself should dream of some day robbing the legitimate property owners of social control of inflicting one knew not what tyranny upon the world curse science he fumed over the intolerable prospect for some time and then the pain returned and he recalled the madeup prescription of the first doctor still happily in his pocket he took a dose forthwith  it calmed and soothed him greatly and he could sit down in his most comfortable chair beside his library of phonographic records and think over the altered aspect of affairs his indignation passed his anger and his passion crumbled under the subtle attack of that prescription pathos became his sole ruler he stared about him at his magnificent and voluptuously appointed apartment at his statuary and discreetly veiled pictures and all the evidences of a cultivated and elegant wickedness he touched a stud and the sad pipings of tristans shepherd filled the air his eye wandered from one object to another they were costly and gross and floridbut they were his they presented in concrete form his ideals his conceptions of beauty and desire his idea of all that is precious in life and nowhe must leave it all like a common man he was he felt a slender and delicate flame burning out so must all life flame up and pass he thought his eyes filled with tears  then it came into his head that he was alone nobody cared for him nobody needed him at any moment he might begin to hurt vividly he might even howl nobody would mind according to all the doctors he would have excellent reason for howling in a day or so it recalled what his spiritual adviser had said of the decline of faith and fidelity the degeneration of the age he beheld himself as a pathetic proof of this he the subtle able important voluptuous cynical complex bindon possibly howling and not one faithful simple creature in all the world to howl in sympathy not one faithful simple soul was thereno shepherd to pipe to him had all such faithful simple creatures vanished from this harsh and urgent earth he wondered whether the horrid vulgar crowd that perpetually went about the city could possibly know what he thought of them if they did he felt sure some would try to earn a better opinion surely the world went from bad to worse it was becoming impossible for bindons perhaps some day  he was quite sure that the one thing he had needed in life was sympathy for a time he regretted that he left no sonnetsno enigmatical pictures or something of that sort behind him to carry on his being until at last the sympathetic mind should come  it seemed incredible to him that this that came was extinction yet his sympathetic spiritual guide was in this matter annoyingly figurative and vague curse science it had undermined all faithall hope to go out to vanish from theatre and street from office and diningplace from the dear eyes of womankind and not to be missed on the whole to leave the world happier  he reflected that he had never worn his heart upon his sleeve had he after all been too unsympathetic few people could suspect how subtly profound he really was beneath the mask of that cynical gaiety of his they would not understand the loss they had suffered elizabeth for example had not suspected  he had reserved that his thoughts having come to elizabeth gravitated about her for some time how little elizabeth understood him  that thought became intolerable before all other things he must set that right he realised that there was still something for him to do in life his struggle against elizabeth was even yet not over he could never overcome her now as he had hoped and prayed but he might still impress her  from that idea he expanded he might impress her profoundlyhe might impress her so that she should for evermore regret her treatment of him the thing that she must realise before everything else was his magnanimity his magnanimity yes he had loved her with amazing greatness of heart he had not seen it so clearly beforebut of course he was going to leave her all his property he saw it instantly as a thing determined and inevitable she would think how good he was how spaciously generous surrounded by all that makes life tolerable from his hand she would recall with infinite regret her scorn and coldness and when she sought expression for that regret she would find that occasion gone forever she should be met by a locked door by a disdainful stillness by a white dead face he closed his eyes and remained for a space imagining himself that white dead face  from that he passed to other aspects of the matter but his determination was assured he meditated elaborately before he took action for the drug he had taken inclined him to a lethargic and dignified melancholy in certain respects he modified details if he left all his property to elizabeth it would include the voluptuously appointed room he occupied and for many reasons he did not care to leave that to her on the other hand it had to be left to some one in his clogged condition this worried him extremely  in the end he decided to leave it to the sympathetic exponent of the fashionable religious cult whose conversation had been so pleasing in the past he will understand said bindon with a sentimental sigh he knows what evil meanshe understands something of the stupendous fascination of the sphinx of sin yeshe will understand by that phrase it was that bindon was pleased to dignify certain unhealthy and undignified departures from sane conduct to which a misguided vanity and an illcontrolled curiosity had led him he sat for a space thinking how very hellenic and italian and neronic and all those things he had been even nowmight one not try a sonnet a penetrating voice to echo down the ages sensuous sinister and sad for a space he forgot elizabeth in the course of half an hour he spoilt three phonographic coils got a headache took a second dose to calm himself and reverted to magnanimity and his former design  at last he faced the unpalatable problem of denton it needed all his newborn magnanimity before he could swallow the thought of denton but at last this greatly misunderstood man assisted by his sedative and the near approach of death effected even that if he was at all exclusive about denton if he should display the slightest distrust if he attempted any specific exclusion of that young man she mightmisunderstand yesshe should have her denton still his magnanimity must go even to that he tried to think only of elizabeth in the matter  he rose with a sigh and limped across to the telephonic apparatus that communicated with his solicitor in ten minutes a will duly attested and with its proper thumbmark signature lay in the solicitors office three miles away and then for a space bindon sat very still  suddenly he started out of a vague reverie and pressed an investigatory hand to his side  then he jumped eagerly to his feet and rushed to the telephone the euthanasia company had rarely been called by a client in a greater hurry  so it came at last that denton and his elizabeth against all hope returned unseparated from the labour servitude to which they had fallen elizabeth came out from her cramped subterranean den of metalbeaters and all the sordid circumstances of blue canvas as one comes out of a nightmare back towards the sunlight their fortune took them once the bequest was known to them the bare thought of another days hammering became intolerable they went up long lifts and stairs to levels that they had not seen since the days of their disaster at first she was full of this sensation of escape even to think of the underways was intolerable only after many months could she begin to recall with sympathy the faded women who were still below there murmuring scandals and reminiscences and folly and tapping away their lives  her choice of the apartments they presently took expressed the vehemence of her release they were rooms upon the very verge of the city they had a roof space and a balcony upon the city wall wide open to the sun and wind the country and the sky  and in that balcony comes the last scene in this story it was a summer sunsetting and the hills of surrey were very blue and clear denton leant upon the balcony regarding them and elizabeth sat by his side very wide and spacious was the view for their balcony hung five hundred feet above the ancient level of the ground the oblongs of the food company broken here and there by the ruinsgrotesque little holes and shedsof the ancient suburbs and intersected by shining streams of sewage passed at last into a remote diapering at the foot of the distant hills there once had been the squattingplace of the children of uya on those further slopes gaunt machines of unknown import worked slackly at the end of their spell and the hill crest was set with stagnant wind vanes along the great south road the labour companys field workers in huge wheeled mechanical vehicles were hurrying back to their meals their last spell finished and through the air a dozen little private aëroplanes sailed down towards the city familiar scene as it was to the eyes of denton and elizabeth it would have filled the minds of their ancestors with incredulous amazement dentons thoughts fluttered towards the future in a vain attempt at what that scene might be in another two hundred years and recoiling turned towards the past  he shared something of the growing knowledge of the time he could picture the quaint smokegrimed victorian city with its narrow little roads of beaten earth its wide commonland illorganised illbuilt suburbs and irregular enclosures the old countryside of the stuart times with its little villages and its petty london the england of the monasteries the far older england of the roman dominion and then before that a wild country with here and there the huts of some warring tribe these huts must have come and gone and come again through a space of years that made the roman camp and villa seem but yesterday and before those years before even the huts there had been men in the valley even thenso recent had it all been when one judged it by the standards of geological timethis valley had been here and those hills yonder higher perhaps and snowtipped had still been yonder hills and the thames had flowed down from the cotswolds to the sea but the men had been but the shapes of men creatures of darkness and ignorance victims of beasts and floods storms and pestilence and incessant hunger they had held a precarious foothold amidst bears and lions and all the monstrous violence of the past already some at least of these enemies were overcome  for a time denton pursued the thoughts of this spacious vision trying in obedience to his instinct to find his place and proportion in the scheme  it has been chance he said it has been luck we have come through it happens we have come through not by any strength of our own  and yet  no i dont know  he was silent for a long time before he spoke again  after allthere is a long time yet there have scarcely been men for twenty thousand yearsand there has been life for twenty millions and what are generations what are generations it is enormous and we are so little yet we knowwe feel we are not dumb atoms we are part of itpart of itto the limits of our strength and will even to die is part of it whether we die or live we are in the making  as time goes onperhapsmen will be wiser wiser  will they ever understand  he became silent again elizabeth said nothing to these things but she regarded his dreaming face with infinite affection her mind was not very active that evening a great contentment possessed her after a time she laid a gentle hand on his beside her he fondled it softly still looking out upon the spacious goldwoven view so they sat as the sun went down until presently elizabeth shivered  denton recalled himself abruptly from these spacious issues of his leisure and went in to fetch her a shawl     the man who could work miracles     the man who could work miracles  a pantoum in prose   it is doubtful whether the gift was innate for my own part i think it came to him suddenly indeed until he was thirty he was a sceptic and did not believe in miraculous powers and here since it is the most convenient place i must mention that he was a little man and had eyes of a hot brown very erect red hair a moustache with ends that he twisted up and freckles his name was george mcwhirter fotheringaynot the sort of name by any means to lead to any expectation of miraclesand he was clerk at gomshotts he was greatly addicted to assertive argument it was while he was asserting the impossibility of miracles that he had his first intimation of his extraordinary powers this particular argument was being held in the bar of the long dragon and toddy beamish was conducting the opposition by a monotonous but effective so you say that drove mr fotheringay to the very limit of his patience  there were present besides these two a very dusty cyclist landlord cox and miss maybridge the perfectly respectable and rather portly barmaid of the dragon miss maybridge was standing with her back to mr fotheringay washing glasses the others were watching him more or less amused by the present ineffectiveness of the assertive method goaded by the torres vedras tactics of mr beamish mr fotheringay determined to make an unusual rhetorical effort looky here mr beamish said mr fotheringay let us clearly understand what a miracle is its something contrariwise to the course of nature done by power of will something what couldnt happen without being specially willed  so you say said mr beamish repulsing him  mr fotheringay appealed to the cyclist who had hitherto been a silent auditor and received his assentgiven with a hesitating cough and a glance at mr beamish the landlord would express no opinion and mr fotheringay returning to mr beamish received the unexpected concession of a qualified assent to his definition of a miracle  for instance said mr fotheringay greatly encouraged here would be a miracle that lamp in the natural course of nature couldnt burn like that upsydown could it beamish  you say it couldnt said beamish  and you said fotheringay you dont mean to sayeh  no said beamish reluctantly no it couldnt  very well said mr fotheringay then here comes someone as it might be me along here and stands as it might be here and says to that lamp as i might do collecting all my willturn upsydown without breaking and go on burning steady andhullo  it was enough to make anyone say hullo the impossible the incredible was visible to them all the lamp hung inverted in the air burning quietly with its flame pointing down it was as solid as indisputable as ever a lamp was the prosaic common lamp of the long dragon bar  mr fotheringay stood with an extended forefinger and the knitted brows of one anticipating a catastrophic smash the cyclist who was sitting next the lamp ducked and jumped across the bar everybody jumped more or less miss maybridge turned and screamed for nearly three seconds the lamp remained still a faint cry of mental distress came from mr fotheringay i cant keep it up he said any longer he staggered back and the inverted lamp suddenly flared fell against the corner of the bar bounced aside smashed upon the floor and went out  it was lucky it had a metal receiver or the whole place would have been in a blaze mr cox was the first to speak and his remark shorn of needless excrescences was to the effect that fotheringay was a fool fotheringay was beyond disputing even so fundamental a proposition as that he was astonished beyond measure at the thing that had occurred the subsequent conversation threw absolutely no light on the matter so far as fotheringay was concerned the general opinion not only followed mr cox very closely but very vehemently everyone accused fotheringay of a silly trick and presented him to himself as a foolish destroyer of comfort and security his mind was in a tornado of perplexity he was himself inclined to agree with them and he made a remarkably ineffectual opposition to the proposal of his departure  he went home flushed and heated coatcollar crumpled eyes smarting and ears red he watched each of the ten street lamps nervously as he passed it it was only when he found himself alone in his little bedroom in church row that he was able to grapple seriously with his memories of the occurrence and ask what on earth happened  he had removed his coat and boots and was sitting on the bed with his hands in his pockets repeating the text of his defence for the seventeenth time i didnt want the confounded thing to upset when it occurred to him that at the precise moment he had said the commanding words he had inadvertently willed the thing he said and that when he had seen the lamp in the air he had felt that it depended on him to maintain it there without being clear how this was to be done he had not a particularly complex mind or he might have stuck for a time at that inadvertently willed embracing as it does the abstrusest problems of voluntary action but as it was the idea came to him with a quite acceptable haziness and from that following as i must admit no clear logical path he came to the test of experiment  he pointed resolutely to his candle and collected his mind though he felt he did a foolish thing be raised up he said but in a second that feeling vanished the candle was raised hung in the air one giddy moment and as mr fotheringay gasped fell with a smash on his toilettable leaving him in darkness save for the expiring glow of its wick  for a time mr fotheringay sat in the darkness perfectly still it did happen after all he said and ow im to explain it i dont know he sighed heavily and began feeling in his pockets for a match he could find none and he rose and groped about the toilettable i wish i had a match he said he resorted to his coat and there was none there and then it dawned upon him that miracles were possible even with matches he extended a hand and scowled at it in the dark let there be a match in that hand he said he felt some light object fall across his palm and his fingers closed upon a match  after several ineffectual attempts to light this he discovered it was a safetymatch he threw it down and then it occurred to him that he might have willed it lit he did and perceived it burning in the midst of his toilettable mat he caught it up hastily and it went out his perception of possibilities enlarged and he felt for and replaced the candle in its candlestick here you be lit said mr fotheringay and forthwith the candle was flaring and he saw a little black hole in the toiletcover with a wisp of smoke rising from it for a time he stared from this to the little flame and back and then looked up and met his own gaze in the looking glass by this help he communed with himself in silence for a time  how about miracles now said mr fotheringay at last addressing his reflection  the subsequent meditations of mr fotheringay were of a severe but confused description so far he could see it was a case of pure willing with him the nature of his experiences so far disinclined him for any further experiments at least until he had reconsidered them but he lifted a sheet of paper and turned a glass of water pink and then green and he created a snail which he miraculously annihilated and got himself a miraculous new toothbrush somewhen in the small hours he had reached the fact that his willpower must be of a particularly rare and pungent quality a fact of which he had certainly had inklings before but no certain assurance the scare and perplexity of his first discovery was now qualified by pride in this evidence of singularity and by vague intimations of advantage he became aware that the church clock was striking one and as it did not occur to him that his daily duties at gomshotts might be miraculously dispensed with he resumed undressing in order to get to bed without further delay as he struggled to get his shirt over his head he was struck with a brilliant idea let me be in bed he said and found himself so undressed he stipulated and finding the sheets cold added hastily and in my nightshirtno in a nice soft woollen nightshirt ah he said with immense enjoyment and now let me be comfortably asleep  he awoke at his usual hour and was pensive all through breakfasttime wondering whether his overnight experience might not be a particularly vivid dream at length his mind turned again to cautious experiments for instance he had three eggs for breakfast two his landlady had supplied good but shoppy and one was a delicious fresh gooseegg laid cooked and served by his extraordinary will he hurried off to gomshotts in a state of profound but carefully concealed excitement and only remembered the shell of the third egg when his landlady spoke of it that night all day he could do no work because of this astonishingly new selfknowledge but this caused him no inconvenience because he made up for it miraculously in his last ten minutes  as the day wore on his state of mind passed from wonder to elation albeit the circumstances of his dismissal from the long dragon were still disagreeable to recall and a garbled account of the matter that had reached his colleagues led to some badinage it was evident he must be careful how he lifted frangible articles but in other ways his gift promised more and more as he turned it over in his mind he intended among other things to increase his personal property by unostentatious acts of creation he called into existence a pair of very splendid diamond studs and hastily annihilated them again as young gomshott came across the countinghouse to his desk he was afraid young gomshott might wonder how he had come by them he saw quite clearly the gift required caution and watchfulness in its exercise but so far as he could judge the difficulties attending its mastery would be no greater than those he had already faced in the study of cycling it was that analogy perhaps quite as much as the feeling that he would be unwelcome in the long dragon that drove him out after supper into the lane beyond the gasworks to rehearse a few miracles in private  there was possibly a certain want of originality in his attempts for apart from his willpower mr fotheringay was not a very exceptional man the miracle of moses rod came to his mind but the night was dark and unfavourable to the proper control of large miraculous snakes then he recollected the story of tannhäuser that he had read on the back of the philharmonic programme that seemed to him singularly attractive and harmless he stuck his walkingsticka very nice poonapenang lawyerinto the turf that edged the footpath and commanded the dry wood to blossom the air was immediately full of the scent of roses and by means of a match he saw for himself that this beautiful miracle was indeed accomplished his satisfaction was ended by advancing footsteps afraid of a premature discovery of his powers he addressed the blossoming stick hastily go back what he meant was change back but of course he was confused the stick receded at a considerable velocity and incontinently came a cry of anger and a bad word from the approaching person who are you throwing brambles at you fool cried a voice that got me on the shin  im sorry old chap said mr fotheringay and then realising the awkward nature of the explanation caught nervously at his moustache he saw winch one of the three immering constables advancing  what dyer mean by it asked the constable hullo its you is it the gent that broke the lamp at the long dragon  i dont mean anything by it said mr fotheringay nothing at all  what dyer do it for then  oh bother said mr fotheringay  bother indeed dyer know that stick hurt what dyer do it for eh  for the moment mr fotheringay could not think what he had done it for his silence seemed to irritate mr winch youve been assaulting the police young man this time thats what you done  look here mr winch said mr fotheringay annoyed and confused im very sorry the fact is  well  he could think of no way but the truth i was working a miracle he tried to speak in an offhand way but try as he would he couldnt  working a ere dont you talk rot working a miracle indeed miracle well thats downright funny why yous the chap that dont believe in miracles fact is this is another of your silly conjuring tricksthats what this is now i tell you  but mr fotheringay never heard what mr winch was going to tell him he realised he had given himself away flung his valuable secret to all the winds of heaven a violent gust of irritation swept him to action he turned on the constable swiftly and fiercely here he said ive had enough of this i have ill show you a silly conjuring trick i will go to hades go now  he was alone  mr fotheringay performed no more miracles that night nor did he trouble to see what had become of his flowering stick he returned to the town scared and very quiet and went to his bedroom lord he said its a powerful giftan extremely powerful gift i didnt hardly mean as much as that not really i wonder what hades is like  he sat on the bed taking off his boots struck by a happy thought he transferred the constable to san francisco and without any more interference with normal causation went soberly to bed in the night he dreamt of the anger of winch  the next day mr fotheringay heard two interesting items of news someone had planted a most beautiful climbing rose against the elder mr gomshotts private house in the lullaborough road and the river as far as rawlings mill was to be dragged for constable winch  mr fotheringay was abstracted and thoughtful all that day and performed no miracles except certain provisions for winch and the miracle of completing his days work with punctual perfection in spite of all the beeswarm of thoughts that hummed through his mind and the extraordinary abstraction and meekness of his manner was remarked by several people and made a matter for jesting for the most part he was thinking of winch  on sunday evening he went to chapel and oddly enough mr maydig who took a certain interest in occult matters preached about things that are not lawful mr fotheringay was not a regular chapel goer but the system of assertive scepticism to which i have already alluded was now very much shaken the tenor of the sermon threw an entirely new light on these novel gifts and he suddenly decided to consult mr maydig immediately after the service so soon as that was determined he found himself wondering why he had not done so before  mr maydig a lean excitable man with quite remarkably long wrists and neck was gratified at a request for a private conversation from a young man whose carelessness in religious matters was a subject for general remark in the town after a few necessary delays he conducted him to the study of the manse which was contiguous to the chapel seated him comfortably and standing in front of a cheerful firehis legs threw a rhodian arch of shadow on the opposite wallrequested mr fotheringay to state his business  at first mr fotheringay was a little abashed and found some difficulty in opening the matter you will scarcely believe me mr maydig i am afraidand so forth for some time he tried a question at last and asked mr maydig his opinion of miracles  mr maydig was still saying well in an extremely judicial tone when mr fotheringay interrupted again you dont believe i suppose that some common sort of personlike myself for instanceas it might be sitting here now might have some sort of twist inside him that made him able to do things by his will  its possible said mr maydig something of the sort perhaps is possible  if i might make free with something here i think i might show you by a sort of experiment said mr fotheringay now take that tobaccojar on the table for instance what i want to know is whether what i am going to do with it is a miracle or not just half a minute mr maydig please  he knitted his brows pointed to the tobaccojar and said be a bowl of vilets  the tobaccojar did as it was ordered  mr maydig started violently at the change and stood looking from the thaumaturgist to the bowl of flowers he said nothing presently he ventured to lean over the table and smell the violets they were freshpicked and very fine ones then he stared at mr fotheringay again  how did you do that he asked  mr fotheringay pulled his moustache just told itand there you are is that a miracle or is it black art or what is it and what do you thinks the matter with me thats what i want to ask  its a most extraordinary occurrence  and this day last week i knew no more that i could do things like that than you did it came quite sudden its something odd about my will i suppose and thats as far as i can see  is thatthe only thing could you do other things besides that  lord yes said mr fotheringay just anything he thought and suddenly recalled a conjuring entertainment he had seen here he pointed change into a bowl of fishno not thatchange into a glass bowl full of water with goldfish swimming in it thats better you see that mr maydig  its astonishing its incredible you are either a most extraordinary  but no  i could change it into anything said mr fotheringay just anything here be a pigeon will you  in another moment a blue pigeon was fluttering round the room and making mr maydig duck every time it came near him stop there will you said mr fotheringay and the pigeon hung motionless in the air i could change it back to a bowl of flowers he said and after replacing the pigeon on the table worked that miracle i expect you will want your pipe in a bit he said and restored the tobaccojar  mr maydig had followed all these later changes in a sort of ejaculatory silence he stared at mr fotheringay and in a very gingerly manner picked up the tobaccojar examined it replaced it on the table well was the only expression of his feelings  now after that its easier to explain what i came about said mr fotheringay and proceeded to a lengthy and involved narrative of his strange experiences beginning with the affair of the lamp in the long dragon and complicated by persistent allusions to winch as he went on the transient pride mr maydigs consternation had caused passed away he became the very ordinary mr fotheringay of everyday intercourse again mr maydig listened intently the tobaccojar in his hand and his bearing changed also with the course of the narrative presently while mr fotheringay was dealing with the miracle of the third egg the minister interrupted with a fluttering extended hand  it is possible he said it is credible it is amazing of course but it reconciles a number of amazing difficulties the power to work miracles is a gifta peculiar quality like genius or second sighthitherto it has come very rarely and to exceptional people but in this case  i have always wondered at the miracles of mahomet and at yogis miracles and the miracles of madame blavatsky but of course yes it is simply a gift it carries out so beautifully the arguments of that great thinkermr maydigs voice sankhis grace the duke of argyll here we plumb some profounder lawdeeper than the ordinary laws of nature yesyes go on go on  mr fotheringay proceeded to tell of his misadventure with winch and mr maydig no longer overawed or scared began to jerk his limbs about and interject astonishment its this what troubled me most proceeded mr fotheringay its this im most mijitly in want of advice for of course hes at san franciscowherever san francisco may bebut of course its awkward for both of us as youll see mr maydig i dont see how he can understand what has happened and i daresay hes scared and exasperated something tremendous and trying to get at me i daresay he keeps on starting off to come here i send him back by a miracle every few hours when i think of it and of course thats a thing he wont be able to understand and its bound to annoy him and of course if he takes a ticket every time it will cost him a lot of money i done the best i could for him but of course its difficult for him to put himself in my place i thought afterwards that his clothes might have got scorched you knowif hades is all its supposed to bebefore i shifted him in that case i suppose theyd have locked him up in san francisco of course i willed him a new suit of clothes on him directly i thought of it but you see im already in a deuce of a tangle  mr maydig looked serious i see you are in a tangle yes its a difficult position how you are to end it  he became diffuse and inconclusive  however well leave winch for a little and discuss the larger question i dont think this is a case of the black art or anything of the sort i dont think there is any taint of criminality about it at all mr fotheringaynone whatever unless you are suppressing material facts no its miraclespure miraclesmiracles if i may say so of the very highest class  he began to pace the hearthrug and gesticulate while mr fotheringay sat with his arm on the table and his head on his arm looking worried i dont see how im to manage about winch he said  a gift of working miraclesapparently a very powerful gift said mr maydig will find a way about winchnever fear my dear sir you are a most important mana man of the most astonishing possibilities as evidence for example and in other ways the things you may do  yes ive thought of a thing or two said mr fotheringay butsome of the things came a bit twisty you saw that fish at first wrong sort of bowl and wrong sort of fish and i thought id ask someone  a proper course said mr maydig a very proper coursealtogether the proper course he stopped and looked at mr fotheringay its practically an unlimited gift let us test your powers for instance if they really are  if they really are all they seem to be  and so incredible as it may seem in the study of the little house behind the congregational chapel on the evening of sunday nov 10 1896 mr fotheringay egged on and inspired by mr maydig began to work miracles the readers attention is specially and definitely called to the date he will object probably has already objected that certain points in this story are improbable that if any things of the sort already described had indeed occurred they would have been in all the papers a year ago the details immediately following he will find particularly hard to accept because among other things they involve the conclusion that he or she the reader in question must have been killed in a violent and unprecedented manner more than a year ago now a miracle is nothing if not improbable and as a matter of fact the reader was killed in a violent and unprecedented manner a year ago in the subsequent course of this story that will become perfectly clear and credible as every rightminded and reasonable reader will admit but this is not the place for the end of the story being but little beyond the hither side of the middle and at first the miracles worked by mr fotheringay were timid little miracleslittle things with the cups and parlour fitments as feeble as the miracles of theosophists and feeble as they were they were received with awe by his collaborator he would have preferred to settle the winch business out of hand but mr maydig would not let him but after they had worked a dozen of these domestic trivialities their sense of power grew their imagination began to show signs of stimulation and their ambition enlarged their first larger enterprise was due to hunger and the negligence of mrs minchin mr maydigs housekeeper the meal to which the minister conducted mr fotheringay was certainly illlaid and uninviting as refreshment for two industrious miracleworkers but they were seated and mr maydig was descanting in sorrow rather than in anger upon his housekeepers shortcomings before it occurred to mr fotheringay that an opportunity lay before him dont you think mr maydig he said if it isnt a liberty i  my dear mr fotheringay of course noi didnt think  mr fotheringay waved his hand what shall we have he said in a large inclusive spirit and at mr maydigs order revised the supper very thoroughly as for me he said eyeing mr maydigs selection i am always particularly fond of a tankard of stout and a nice welsh rarebit and ill order that i aint much given to burgundy and forthwith stout and welsh rarebit promptly appeared at his command they sat long at their supper talking like equals as mr fotheringay presently perceived with a glow of surprise and gratification of all the miracles they would presently do and by the bye mr maydig said mr fotheringay i might perhaps be able to help youin a domestic way  dont quite follow said mr maydig pouring out a glass of miraculous old burgundy  mr fotheringay helped himself to a second welsh rarebit out of vacancy and took a mouthful i was thinking he said i might be able chum chum to work chum chum a miracle with mrs minchin chum chummake her a better woman  mr maydig put down the glass and looked doubtful shes she strongly objects to interference you know mr fotheringay andas a matter of factits well past eleven and shes probably in bed and asleep do you think on the whole  mr fotheringay considered these objections i dont see that it shouldnt be done in her sleep  for a time mr maydig opposed the idea and then he yielded mr fotheringay issued his orders and a little less at their ease perhaps the two gentlemen proceeded with their repast mr maydig was enlarging on the changes he might expect in his housekeeper next day with an optimism that seemed even to mr fotheringays supper senses a little forced and hectic when a series of confused noises from upstairs began their eyes exchanged interrogations and mr maydig left the room hastily mr fotheringay heard him calling up to his housekeeper and then his footsteps going softly up to her  in a minute or so the minister returned his step light his face radiant wonderful he said and touching most touching  he began pacing the hearthrug a repentancea most touching repentancethrough the crack of the door poor woman a most wonderful change she had got up she must have got up at once she had got up out of her sleep to smash a private bottle of brandy in her box and to confess it too but this gives usit opensa most amazing vista of possibilities if we can work this miraculous change in her   the things unlimited seemingly said mr fotheringay and about mr winch  altogether unlimited and from the hearthrug mr maydig waving the winch difficulty aside unfolded a series of wonderful proposalsproposals he invented as he went along  now what those proposals were does not concern the essentials of this story suffice it that they were designed in a spirit of infinite benevolence the sort of benevolence that used to be called postprandial suffice it too that the problem of winch remained unsolved nor is it necessary to describe how far that series got to its fulfilment there were astonishing changes the small hours found mr maydig and mr fotheringay careering across the chilly marketsquare under the still moon in a sort of ecstasy of thaumaturgy mr maydig all flap and gesture mr fotheringay short and bristling and no longer abashed at his greatness they had reformed every drunkard in the parliamentary division changed all the beer and alcohol to water mr maydig had overruled mr fotheringay on this point they had further greatly improved the railway communication of the place drained flinders swamp improved the soil of one tree hill and cured the vicars wart and they were going to see what could be done with the injured pier at south bridge the place gasped mr maydig wont be the same place tomorrow how surprised and thankful everyone will be and just at that moment the church clock struck three  i say said mr fotheringay thats three oclock i must be getting back ive got to be at business by eight and besides mrs wimms  were only beginning said mr maydig full of the sweetness of unlimited power were only beginning think of all the good were doing when people wake  but said mr fotheringay  mr maydig gripped his arm suddenly his eyes were bright and wild my dear chap he said theres no hurry lookhe pointed to the moon at the zenithjoshua  joshua said mr fotheringay  joshua said mr maydig why not stop it  mr fotheringay looked at the moon  thats a bit tall he said after a pause  why not said mr maydig of course it doesnt stop you stop the rotation of the earth you know time stops it isnt as if we were doing harm  hm said mr fotheringay well he sighed ill try here  he buttoned up his jacket and addressed himself to the habitable globe with as good an assumption of confidence as lay in his power jest stop rotating will you said mr fotheringay  incontinently he was flying head over heels through the air at the rate of dozens of miles a minute in spite of the innumerable circles he was describing per second he thought for thought is wonderfulsometimes as sluggish as flowing pitch sometimes as instantaneous as light he thought in a second and willed let me come down safe and sound whatever else happens let me down safe and sound  he willed it only just in time for his clothes heated by his rapid flight through the air were already beginning to singe he came down with a forcible but by no means injurious bump in what appeared to be a mound of freshturned earth a large mass of metal and masonry extraordinarily like the clocktower in the middle of the marketsquare hit the earth near him ricochetted over him and flew into stonework bricks and masonry like a bursting bomb a hurtling cow hit one of the larger blocks and smashed like an egg there was a crash that made all the most violent crashes of his past life seem like the sound of falling dust and this was followed by a descending series of lesser crashes a vast wind roared throughout earth and heaven so that he could scarcely lift his head to look for a while he was too breathless and astonished even to see where he was or what had happened and his first movement was to feel his head and reassure himself that his streaming hair was still his own  lord gasped mr fotheringay scarce able to speak for the gale ive had a squeak whats gone wrong storms and thunder and only a minute ago a fine night its maydig set me on to this sort of thing what a wind if i go on fooling in this way im bound to have a thundering accident  wheres maydig  what a confounded mess everythings in  he looked about him so far as his flapping jacket would permit the appearance of things was really extremely strange the skys all right anyhow said mr fotheringay and thats about all that is all right and even there it looks like a terrific gale coming up but theres the moon overhead just as it was just now bright as midday but as for the restwheres the village whereswheres anything and what on earth set this wind ablowing i didnt order no wind  mr fotheringay struggled to get to his feet in vain and after one failure remained on all fours holding on he surveyed the moonlit world to leeward with the tails of his jacket streaming over his head theres something seriously wrong said mr fotheringay and what it isgoodness knows  far and wide nothing was visible in the white glare through the haze of dust that drove before a screaming gale but tumbled masses of earth and heaps of inchoate ruins no trees no houses no familiar shapes only a wilderness of disorder vanishing at last into the darkness beneath the whirling columns and streamers the lightnings and thunderings of a swiftly rising storm near him in the livid glare was something that might once have been an elmtree a smashed mass of splinters shivered from boughs to base and further a twisted mass of iron girdersonly too evidently the viaductrose out of the piled confusion  you see when mr fotheringay had arrested the rotation of the solid globe he had made no stipulation concerning the trifling movables upon its surface and the earth spins so fast that the surface at its equator is travelling at rather more than a thousand miles an hour and in these latitudes at more than half that pace so that the village and mr maydig and mr fotheringay and everybody and everything had been jerked violently forward at about nine miles per secondthat is to say much more violently than if they had been fired out of a cannon and every human being every living creature every house and every treeall the world as we know ithad been so jerked and smashed and utterly destroyed that was all  these things mr fotheringay did not of course fully appreciate but he perceived that his miracle had miscarried and with that a great disgust of miracles came upon him he was in darkness now for the clouds had swept together and blotted out his momentary glimpse of the moon and the air was full of fitful struggling tortured wraiths of hail a great roaring of wind and waters filled earth and sky and peering under his hand through the dust and sleet to windward he saw by the play of the lightnings a vast wall of water pouring towards him  maydig screamed mr fotheringays feeble voice amid the elemental uproar heremaydig  stop cried mr fotheringay to the advancing water oh for goodness sake stop  just a moment said mr fotheringay to the lightnings and thunder stop jest a moment while i collect my thoughts and now what shall i do he said what shall i do lord i wish maydig was about  i know said mr fotheringay and for goodness sake lets have it right this time  he remained on all fours leaning against the wind very intent to have everything right  ah he said let nothing what im going to order happen until i say off lord i wish id thought of that before  he lifted his little voice against the whirlwind shouting louder and louder in the vain desire to hear himself speak now thenhere goes mind about that what i said just now in the first place when all ive got to say is done let me lose my miraculous power let my will become just like anybody elses will and all these dangerous miracles be stopped i dont like them id rather i didnt work em ever so much thats the first thing and the second islet me be back just before the miracles begin let everything be just as it was before that blessed lamp turned up its a big job but its the last have you got it no more miracles everything as it wasme back in the long dragon just before i drank my halfpint thats it yes  he dug his fingers into the mould closed his eyes and said off  everything became perfectly still he perceived that he was standing erect  so you say said a voice  he opened his eyes he was in the bar of the long dragon arguing about miracles with toddy beamish he had a vague sense of some great thing forgotten that instantaneously passed you see that except for the loss of his miraculous powers everything was back as it had been his mind and memory therefore were now just as they had been at the time when this story began so that he knew absolutely nothing of all that is told here knows nothing of all that is told here to this day and among other things of course he still did not believe in miracles  i tell you that miracles properly speaking cant possibly happen he said whatever you like to hold and im prepared to prove it up to the hilt  thats what you think said toddy beamish and prove it if you can  looky here mr beamish said mr fotheringay let us clearly understand what a miracle is its something contrariwise to the course of nature done by power of will   the end    printed by ballantyne hanson  co          edinburgh  london                              when the                                  sleeper wakes

fanatical democrata socialist he woke a     tyrant he died fighting with the people against the tyranny he had     unconsciously fashioned while he slept surely a theme of     magnificent
