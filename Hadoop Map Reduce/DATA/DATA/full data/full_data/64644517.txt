64644517	history of friedrich ii of prussia  frederick the great  by thomas carlyle  volume xii      book xii  first silesian war awakening a general european one begins  december 1740may 1741     chapter i  of schlesien or silesia  schlesien what we call silesia lies in elliptic shape spread on the top of europe partly girt with mountains like the crown or crest to that part of the earthhighest tableland of germany or of the cisalpine countries and sending rivers into all the seas the summit or highest level of it is in the southwest longest diameter is from northwest to southeast from crossen whither friedrich is now driving to the jablunka pass which issues upon hungary is above 250 miles the axis therefore or longest diameter of our ellipse we may call 230 english milesits shortest or conjugate diameter from friedland in bohemia wallensteins old friedland by breslau across the oder to the polish frontier is about 100 the total area of schlesien is counted to be some 20000 square miles nearly the third of england proper  schlesienwill the reader learn to call it by that name on occasion for in these sad manuscripts of ours the names alternateis a fine fertile useful and beautiful country it leans sloping as we hinted to the east and to the north a long curved buttress of mountains riesengebirge giant mountains is their bestknown name in foreign countries holding it up on the south and west sides this giantmountain rangewhich is a kind of continuation of the saxonbohemian metal mountains erzgebirge and of the straggling lausitz mountains to westward of theseshapes itself like a billhook or elliptically as was said handle and hook together may be some 200 miles in length the precipitous side of this is in general turned outwards towards bohmen mahren ungarn bohemia moravia hungary in our dialects and schlesien lies inside irregularly sloping down towards the baltic and towards the utmost east from the bohemian side of these mountains there rise two rivers elbe tending for the west morawa for the southmorawa crossing moravia gets into the donau and thence into the blacksea while elbe after intricate adventures among the mountains and then prosperously across the plains is out with its many ships into the atlantic two rivers we say from the bohemian or steep side and again from the silesian side there rise other two the oder and the weichsel vistula which start pretty near one another in the southeast and after wide windings get both into the baltic at a good distance apart  for the first thirty or in parts fifty miles from the mountains silesia slopes somewhat rapidly and is still to be called a hillcountry rugged extensive elevations diversifying it but after that the slope is gentle and at length insensible or noticeable only by the way the waters run from the central part of it schlesien pictures itself to you as a plain growing ever flatter ever sandier as it abuts on the monotonous endless sandflats of poland and the brandenburg territories nothing but boundary stones with their brass inscriptions marking where the transition is and only some fortified town not far off keeping the door of the country secure in that quarter  on the other hand the mountain part of schlesien is very picturesque not of alpine height anywhere the schneekoppe itself is under 5000 feet so that verdure and forest wood fail almost nowhere among the mountains and multiplex industry besung by rushing torrents and the swift young rivers nestles itself high up and from wheat husbandry madder and maize husbandry to damaskweaving metallurgy charcoalburning tardistillery schlesien has many trades and has long been expert and busy at them to a high degree a very pretty ellipsis or irregular oval on the summit of the european continentlike the palm of a left hand well stretched out with the riesengebirge for thumb said a certain herr to me stretching out his arm in that fashion towards the northwest palm well stretched out measuring 250 miles and the crossway 100 there are still beavers in schlesien the katzbach river has gold grains in it a kind of pactolus not now worth working and in the scraggy lonesome pinewoods grimy individuals with kindled mounds of pinebranches and smoke carefully kept down by sods are sweating out a substance which they inform you is to be tar     historical epochs of schlesienafter the quads and marchmen  who first lived in schlesien or lived long since in it there is no use in asking nor in telling if one knew the quadi and the lygii says dryasdust in a groping manner quadi and consorts in the fifth or sixth century continues he with more confidence shifted romeward following the general track of contemporaneous mankind weak remnant of quadi was thereupon overpowered by slavic populations and their country became polish which the eastern rim of it still essentially is that was the end of the quadi in those parts says history but they cannot speak nor appeal for themselves history has them much at discretion rude burial urns with a handful of ashes in them have been dug up in different places these are all the archives and histories the quadi now have it appears their name signifies wicked they are those poor quadi wicked people who always go along with the marcomanni marchmen in the beadroll histories one reads and i almost guess they must have been of the same stock wickeds and borderers considered on both sides of the border to belong to the dangerous classes in those times two things are certain first quad and its derivatives have to this day in the speech of rustic germans something of that meaningnefarious at least injurious hateful and to be avoided for example quaddel a nettleburn quetschen to smash say your thumb while hammering c c and then a second thing the polish equivalent word is zle busching says zlexi hence zlezien schlesien meaning merely badland quadland what we might called damagitia or country where you get into trouble that is the etymology or what passes for such as to the history of schlesien hitherwards of these burial urns dug up in different places i notice as not yet entirely buriable three epochs  first epoch christianity ad 966 introduction of christianity to the length of founding a bishopric that year so hopeful were the aspects bishopric of schmoger schmagram dim little village still discoverable on the polish frontier not far from the town of namslau bishopric which after one removal farther inward got across the oder to wrutislav which me now call breslau and sticks there as bishopric of breslau to this day year 966 it was in adalbert our prussian saint and missionarys younger time preaching by zealous polacks must have been going on while adalbert bright in nobleness was studying at magdeburg and ripening for high things in the general estimation this was a new gift from the polacks this of christianity an infinitely more important one than that nickname of zlezien or damagitia stuck upon the poor country had been  second epoch get gradually cut loose from poland ad 11391159 twenty years of great trouble in poland which were of lasting benefit to schlesien in 1139 the polack king a very potent majesty whom we could name but do not died and left his dominions shared by punctual bequest among his five sons punctual bequest did avail but the eldest son who was king and had schlesien with much else to his share began to encroach to grasp upon which the others rose upon him flung him out into exile redivided and hoped now they might have quiet hoped but were disappointed and could come to no sure bargain for the next twenty yearsnot till the eldest brother first author of these strifes died an exile in holstein or was just about dying and had agreed to take schlesien for all claims and be quiet thenceforth  his this eldests three sons did accordingly in 1159 get schlesien instead of him their uncles proving honorable schlesien thereby was happy enough to get cut loose from poland and to continue loose steering a course of its ownparting farther and farther from poland and its habits and fortunes these three sons of the late polish majesty who died in exile in holstein are the piast dukes much talked of in silesian histories of whose merits i specify this only that they so soon as possible strove to be german they were progenitors of all the piast dukes proprietors of schlesien thenceforth till the last of them died out in 1675and a certain erbverbruderung they had entered into could not take effect at that time their merits as sovereign dukes seem to have been considerable a certain piety wisdom and nobleness of mind not rare among them and no doubt it was partly their merit if partly also their good luck that they took to germany and leant thitherward steering looser and looser from poland in their new circumstances they themselves by degrees became altogether german their countries by silent immigration introduction of the arts the composures and sobrieties became essentially so on the eastern rim there is still a polack remnant its territories very sandy its condition very bad remnant which surely ought to cease its polack jargon and learn some dialect of intelligible teutsch as the first condition of improvement in all other parts teutsch reigns and schlesien is a green abundant country full of metallurgy damaskweaving grainhusbandryinstead of gasconade gilt anarchy rags dirt and nie pozwalam  ad 1327 get completely cut loose the piast dukes who soon ceased to be polish and hung rather upon bohemia and thereby upon germany made a great step in that direction when king johann old ichdien whom we ought to recollect persuaded most of them all of them but two pretio ac prece to become feudatories quasifeudatories but of a sovereign sort to his crown of bohemia the two who stood out resisting prayer and price were the duke of jauer and the duke of schweidnitzloftyminded gentlemen perhaps a thought too lofty but these also johanns son little kaiser karl iv marrying their heiress contrived to bring inone fruitful adventure of little karls among the many wasteful he made in the german reich schlesien is henceforth a bit of the kingdom of bohemia indissolubly hooked to germany and its progress in the arts and composures under wise piasts with immigrating germans we guess to have become doubly rapid busching erdbeschreibung viii 725 hubner t 94  third epoch adopt the reformation ad 14141517 schlesien hanging to bohemia in this manner extensively adopted husss doctrines still more extensively luthers and that was a difficult element in its lot though i believe an unspeakably precious one it cost above a century of sad tumults zisca wars nay above two centuries including the sad thirtyyears warwhich miseries in bohemia proper were sometimes very sad and even horrible but schlesien the outlying country did in all this suffer less than bohemia proper and did not lose its evangelical doctrine in result as unfortunate bohemia did and sink into sluttish fanatical torpor and big crucifixes of japanned tin by the wayside though in the course of subsequent years named of peace it was near doing so here are the steps or unavailing countersteps in that latter direction  ad 1537 occurred as we know the erbverbruderung duke of liegnitz and of other extensive heritages making deed of brotherhood with kurbrandenburgdeed forbidden and so far as might be rubbed out and annihilated by the then king of bohemia subsequently kaiser ferdinand i karl vs brother duke of liegnitz had to give up his parchments and become zero in that matter kurbrandenburg entirely refused to do so kept his parchments to see if they would not turn to something  ad 1624 schlesien especially the then duke of liegnitz greatgrandson of the erbverbruderung one and poor johann george duke of jagerndorf cadet of the then kurbrandenburg went warmly ahead into the winterking project first fire of the thirtyyears war sufferings from papal encroachment in high quarters being really extreme warmly ahead and had to smart sharply for itpoor johann george with forfeiture of jagerndorf with reichesacht ban of the empire and total ruin fighting against which he soon died act of ban and forfeiture was done tyrannously said most men and it was persisted in equally so till men ceased speaking of itjagerndorf duchy fruit of the act was held by austria ever after in defiance of the laws of the reich religious oppression lay heavy on protestant schlesien thenceforth and many lukewarm individualities were brought back to orthodoxy by that method successful in the diligent skilled hands of jesuit reverend fathers with fiscals and soldiers in the rear of them  ad 1648 treaty of westphalia mended much of this and set fair limits to papist encroachmenthad said treaty been kept but how could it by orthodox authority anxious to recover lost souls or at least to have loyal subjects it was publicly kept in name and tacitly in substance it was violated more and more of the blossoming of silesian literature spoken of in books of the poet opitz poets logan hoffmannswaldau who burst into a kind of song better or worse at this period we will remember nothing but request the reader to remember it if he is tunefully given or thinks it a good symptom of schlesien  ad 1707 treaty of altranstadt between kaiser joseph i and karl xii swedish karl marching through those partsout of poland in chase of august the physically strong towards saxony there to beat him softwas waited upon by silesian deputations of a lamentable nature was entreated for the love of christ and his evangel to protect us poor protestants and get the treaty of westphalia observed on our behalf and fairplay shown which karl did kaiser joseph with such weight of french war lying on him being much struck with the tone of that dangerous swede the pope rebuked kaiser joseph for such compliance in the silesian matter holy father answered this kaiser not of distinguished orthodoxy in the house i am too glad he did not ask me to become lutheran i know not how i should have helped myself pauli

time is not the colonel borck properly majorgeneral who did the herstal operation lately still less is he the venerable old minister marlborough veteran and now fieldmarshal borck whom hotham treated with on a certain occasion there are numerous borcks always in the kings service nor are these three except by loose cousinry related to one another the borcks all come from stettin quarter a brave

moment wartensleben borck and a certain colonel von der golz whom also the king much esteems these are his company on this drive for escort or guard of honor out of berlin to the next stages there is a small body of hussars lifeguard and other cavalry perhaps 500 horse in all  they drive rapidly through the gray winter reach frankfurtonoder sixty miles or more where no doubt there is military business waiting they are forward on the morrow for dinner forty miles farther at a small town called crossen which looks over into silesia and is for the present headquarters to a prussian army standing ready there and in the environs standing ready or hourly marching in and rendezvousing now about 28000 strong horse and foot a rearguard of ten or twelve thousand will march from berlin in two days pause hereabouts and follow according to circumstances prussian army will then be some 40000 in all schwerin has been commander manager and mainspring of the business hitherto henceforth it is to be the king but schwerin under him will still have a division of his own  among the regiments we notice schulenburg horsegrenadierscome along from landsberg hither these horsegrenadiers with

artillery consists of 20 threepounders 4 twelvepounders 4 howitzers haubitzen 4 big mortars calibre fifty pounds and of artillerymen 166 in all  with this force the young king has on his own basis pretty much in spite of all the world as we find now and afterwards determined to invade silesia and lay hold of the property he has long had therenot computing for none can compute the sleeping whirlwinds he may chance to awaken thereby thus lightly does a man enter upon enterprises which prove unexpectedly momentous and shape the whole remainder of his days for him crossing the rubicon as it were in his sleep in life as on railways at certain pointswhether you know it or not there is but an inch this way or that into what tram you are shunted but try to get out of it again the man is

comparison with whet it might have been p 73 24th dec 1740     friedrich at crossen and still in his own territory 14th16th decembersteps into schlesien  at all events the man means to tryand is here dining at crossen noon of wednesday the 14th certain important personsespecially two silesian gentlemen deputed from grunberg the nearest silesian town who have come across the border on businesshaving the honor to dine with him to whom his manner is lively and affable lively in mood as if there lay no load upon his spirits the business of these two silesian gentlemen a baron von hocke one of them a baron von kestlitz the other was to present on the part of the town and amt of grunberg a solemn protest against this meditated entrance on the territory of schlesien government itself from breslau ordering them to do so protest was duly presented friedrich as his manner is and continues to be on his march glances politely into or at the protest hands it in silence to some page or secretary to deposit in the due pigeonhole or wastebasket and invites the two silesian gentlemen to dine with him as we see they have the honor to do he er lives near grunberg then mein herr von hocke close to it ihro majestat my poor mansion schloss of deutschkessel is some fifteen miles hence how infinitely at your majestys service should the march prove inevitable and go that waywell perhaps i find friedrich did dine the second day hence with one of these gentlemen and lodged with the other government at breslau has ordered such protest on the part of the frontier populations and official persons and this is all that comes of it  during these hours it chanced that the big bell of crossen dropped from its steeplefulness of time or entire rottenness of axletree being at last completed at this fateful moment perhaps an ominous thing friedrich as caesar and others have done cheerfully interprets the omen to his own advantage sign that the high is to be brought low says friedrich were the marchroutes wagontrains and multifarious adjustments perfect to the last item here at crossen he will with much cheerfulness step into silesia independent of all grunberg protests and fallen bells  on the second day he does actually cross the regiments marching in at different points some reaching as far as 25 miles in it is friday 16th december 1740 there has a game begun which will last long they went through the village of lasgen that was the first point of silesian ground circle of schwiebus our old friend is on the left near by and schwerins regiment was the foremost others cross more to the left or right marching through the village of lessen and other dim villages and little towns round and beyond grunberg all regiments and divisions bearing upon grunberg and the great road but artistically portioned outseveral miles in breadth for the sake of quarters and as is generally the rule about a days march in length this evening nearly the whole army was on silesian ground  printed patent or proclamation briefly assuring all silesians of whatever rank condition or religion that we have come as friends to them and will protect all persons in their privileges and molest no peaceable mortal is posted on churchdoors and extensively distributed by hand soldiers are forbidden under penalty of the rods officers under that of cassation with infamy to take anything without first bargaining and paying ready money for it on these terms the silesian villages cheerfully enough accept their new guests interesting to the rural mind and though the billeting was rather heavy as many as 24 soldiers to a common farmer gartner no complaints were made in one schloss where the owners had fled and no human response was to be had by the waywornsoldiery there did occur some breakages and impatient kickings about which it grieved his majesty to hear of next morningin one not in more  official persons we perceive study to be absolutely passive this was the burgermeisters course at grunberg tonight grunberg first town on the frontier sets an example of passivity which cannot be surpassed prussian troops being at the gate of grunberg burgermeister and adjuncts sitting in a tacit expectant condition in their townhall there arrives a prussian lieutenant requiring of the burgermeister the key of said gate to deliver such key would to god i durst mein herr lieutenant but how dare i there is the key lying but to give ityou are not the queen of hungarys officer i doubtthe prussian lieutenant has to put out hand and take the key which he readily does and on the morrow in returning it when the march recommences there are the same phenomena burgermeister or assistants dare not for the life of them touch that key it lay on the table and may again in the course of providence come to liethe prussian lieutenant lays it down accordingly and hurries out with a grin on his face there was much small laughter over this transaction majesty himself laughing well at it higher perfection of passivity no burgermeister could show  the march as readers understand is towards glogau a strongish garrison town now some 40 miles ahead the key of northern schlesien grunberg where my readers once slept for the night in the late kings time though they have forgotten it is the first and only considerable town on the hither side of glogau on to glogau i rather perceive the army is in good part provisioned before starting after glogauwe must see breadwagons baggagewagons ammunitionandartillery wagons all is in order army artistically portioned out that is the form of march with glogau ahead king as we said above dines with his baron von hocke at the schloss of deutschkessel short way beyond grunberg this first day but he by no means loiters therecuts across a dozen miles westward through a country where his vanguard on its various lines of march ought to be arrivingand goes to lodge at the schloss of schweinitz with his other baron the von kestlitz of wednesday at crossen heldengeschichte i 459 this is friday 16th december his first night on silesian ground     what glogau and the government at breslau did upon it  silesia in the way of resistance is not in the least prepared for him a month ago there were not above 3000 austrian foot and 600 horse in the whole province neither the military governor count wallis nor the imperial court nor any official person near or far had the least anticipation of such a visit count wallis who commands in glogau did in person nine or ten days ago as the rumors rose ever higher run over to crossen saw with his eyes the undeniable there and has been zealously endeavoring ever since what he could to take measures wallis is now shut in glogau his second the now acting governor general browne a still more reflective man is doing likewise his utmost but on forlorn terms and without the least guidance from court browne has by violent industry raked together from mahren and the neighboring countries certain fractions which raise his force to 7000 foot these he throws in small parties into the defensible points or in larger into the chief garrisons new cavalry he cannot get the old 600 horse he keeps for himself all the marching army he has particulars in heldengeschichte i 465 total of austrian force seems to be 7800 horse and foot  fain would he get possession of breslau and throw in some garrison there but cannot neither he nor wallis could compass that breslau is a city divided against itself on this matter full of emotions of expectations apprehensions for and against there is a supreme silesian government oberamt headoffice kind of austrian viceroyalty in breslau and there is on breslaus own score a townrath strictly catholic both these vienna the breath of their nostrils but then also there are fortyfour incorporated trades oppressed protestant in majority to whom vienna is not breath but rather the want of it lastly the city calls itself free and has crabbed privileges still valid a jus proesidii or right to be ones own garrison one of them and the most inconvenient just now breslau is a reichstadt in theory sovereign member of the reich and supreme over its own affairs even as austria itselfand the truth is old theory and new fact resolved not to quarrel have lapsed into one anothers arms in a quite inextricable way in breslau as elsewhere with a head government which can get no orders from vienna the very townrath has little alacrity inclines rather to passivity like grunberg and a silent population threatens to become vocal if you press upon it  breslau that is to say the oberamt there has sent courier on courier to vienna for weeks past not even an answerwhat can vienna answer with kurbaiern and others threatening war on it and only 10000 pounds in its national purse answer at last is dont bother danger is not so near why spend money on couriers and get into such a taking general wallis came to breslau after what he had seen at crossen and urged strongly in the name of selfpreservation first law of nature to get an austrian real garrison introduced wished much horrible to think of the suburbs should be burnt and better ramparts raised but could not succeed in any of these points nor even mention some of them in a public manner you shall have a protestant for commandant suggested wallis there is count von roth silesianlutheran an excellent soldierthanks answered they we can defend ourselves we had rather not have any and the breslau burghers have accordingly set to drill themselves are bringing out old cannon in quantity repairing breaches very strict in sentrywork perfectly able to defend our cityso far as we see goodtuesday last december 13th the very day friedrich left berlin as this matter of the garrison long urged by the oberamt had at last been got agreed to by the townrath on proviso of consulting the incorporated trades or at least consulting their guildmasters who are usually a silent folkthe guildmasters suddenly became in part vocal and their fortyfour guilds unusually soand there was tumult in breslau in the salzring big central square or marketplace which they call ring such as had not been idle population and guildbrethren of suspicious humor gathering in multitudes into and round the fine old townhall there questioning answering in louder and louder key at last bellowing quite in alt and on the edge of flaming into one knew not what heldengeschichte i 469till the matter of austrian garrison much more of burning the suburbs had to be dropt settled in what way we see  head government oberamt has through its northern official people sent protest strict order to the silesian population to look sour on the prussiansand we saw in consequence the two silesian gentlemen did dine with friedrich and he has returned their visits and the mayor of grunberg would not touch his keys head government is now redacting a patent or still more solemn protest of its own which likewise it will affix in the salzring here and present to king friedrich and thisexcept despatching by boat down the river a great deal of meal to glogau which was an important quiet thing of walliss enforcingis pretty much all it can do no austrian garrison can be got in perfectly able to defend ourselveslet government and wallis or browne contrive as they may and as to burning the suburbs better not whisper of that again breslau feels or would fain feel itself perfectly ablehas at any rate no wish to be bombarded and contains privately a great deal of protestant humor of all which friedrich it is not doubted has notice more or less distinct and quickens his march the more  general browne is at present in the southern parts an able active man and soldier but with such a force what can he attempt to do there are three strong places in the country glogau then brieg both on the oder river lastly neisse on the neisse river a branch of the oder one of the four neisse rivers there are in germany mostly in silesianot handy to the accurate reader of german books browne is in neisse and will start into a strange stare when the flying post reaches him prussians actually on march debate with them if debate there is to be browne himself must contrive to do from breslau from vienna no government supreme or subordinate can yield his 8000 and him the least help  glogau as we saw means to defend itself at least general wallis the commandant does in spite of the glogau public and is with his whole might digging palisading getting in meal salt meat and other provenderlikewise burning suburbs uncontrollable he in the small place and clearing down the outside edifices and shelters at a diligent rate yesterday 15th december he burnt down the three odermills which lie outside the big suburban tavern also the ziegelscheune tilemanufactory and other valuable buildings careless of public lamentationfire catching the town itself and needing to be quenched again heldengeschichte i 473475 nay he was clear for burning down or blowing up the protestant church indispensable sacred edifice which stands outside the walls prussians will make a blockhouse of it said wallis a chief protestant baron von something begged passionately for only twelve hours of respiteto lay the case before his prussian majesty respite conceded he and another chief protestant had posted off accordingly and did the next morning friday 16th short way from crossen meet his majestys carriage who graciously pulled up for a few instants and listened to their story meine herren you are the first that ask a favor of me on silesian ground it shall be done you said the king and straightway despatched in polite style his written request to wallis engaging to make no military use whatever of said church but to attack by the other side if attack were necessary thus his majesty saved the church of glogau which of course was a popular act getting to see this church himself a few days hence he said why it must come down at any rate and be rebuilt so ugly a thing  wallis is making strenuous preparation forces the inhabitants even the upper kinds of them to labor day and night by relays in his rampartings palisadings is for burning all the adjacent villagesand would have done it had not the peasants themselves turned out in a dangerous state of mind he has got together about 1000 men his powder they say is fifty years old but he has eatable provender from breslau and means to hold out to the utmost readers must admit that the austrian military graf von wallis to

avoided we come not as invasive enemies of you or of the queen of hungary but as protective friends of silesia and of her majestys rights thereher majesty once allowing us as it is presumable she will our own rights in this province no man shall meddle with hers while we continue here to that effect runs the little patent or initiatory proclamation extensively handed out and posted in public places as was said above and the practice is conformable to all men coming with protests or otherwise we perceive the young king is politeness itself giving clear answer and promise which will be kept on the above principle nothing angers him except that gentlemen should disbelieve and run away that a mansion be found deserted by its owners is the one evil omen for such mansion thus at the schloss of weichau which is still discoverable on the map across the black ochel and the white muddy streams which saunter eastward towards the oder there nothing yet running westward for the bober our other limitary river next night after schweinitz second night in silesia there was no owner to be met with and the look of his majesty grew finster dark remembering what had passed yesternight in like case at that other schloss from which the owner with his best portable furniture had vanished at which schloss as above noticed some disorders were committed by angry parties of the marchdoors burst open doors standing impudently dumb to the rational proposals made them inferior remainders of furniture smashed into firewood and the likeno doubt to his majestys vexation here at weichau stricter measures were taken and yet difficulties risks were not wanting and the amtmann steward of the place got pulled about and once even a stroke or two happily the young herr of weichau appeared in person on the morrow hearing his majesty was still there papa is old lives at another schloss could not wait upon your majesty nor till now could i have that honorwell lucky that you have come stay dinner which the young count did and drove home in the evening to reassure papa his majesty continuing there another night and the risk over heldengeschichte i 459  this day sunday 18th the army rests their first sunday in silesia while the young count pays his devoir and here in weichau as elsewhere it is in the church catholic nearly always that the heretic army does its devotions safe from weather at least such the royal order they say which is taken note of by the heterodox and by the orthodox and ever henceforth this is the example followed and in all places where there is no protestant church and the catholics have one the prussian armychaplain assembles his buffbelted audience in the latter no offence reverend fathers but there are hours for us and hours for you and such is the kings order there is regular divineservice in this prussian army and even a good deal of inarticulate religion as one may see on examining  country gentlemen town mayors and other civic authorities soon learn that on these terms they are safe with his majesty march after march he has interviews with such to regulate the supplies the necessities and accidents of the quartering of his troops clear frank open to reasonable representation correct to his promise in fact industriously conciliatory and pacificatory such is friedrich to all silesian men provincial authorities who can get no instructions from headquarters vienna saying nothing breslau nothing and deputygovernor browne being far south in neisseare naturally in difficulties how shall they act best not to act at all if one can help it and follow the mayor of grunbergs unsurpassable pattern  these silesians says an excerpt i have made are still in majority protestant especially in this northern portion of the province they have had to suffer much on that and other scores and are secretly or openly in favor of the prussians official persons all of the catholic creed have leant heavy not always conscious of doing it against protestant rights the jesuits consciously enough have been and are busy with them intent to recall a heretic population by all methods fair and unfair we heard of charles xiis interference threeandthirty years ago and how the kaiser hard bested at that time had to profess repentance and engage for complete amendment amendment did for the moment accordingly take place treaty of westphalia in all its stipulations with precautionary improvements was reenacted as treaty of altranstadt with faithful intention of keeping it too on kaiser josephs part who was not a superstitious man holy father i was too glad he did not demand my own conversion to the protestant heresy bested as i amwith louis quatorze and company upon the neck of me some improvement of performance very marked at first did ensue upon this altranstadt treaty but the sternly accurate karl of sweden soon disappeared from the scene kaiser joseph of austria soon disappeared and his brother karl vi was a much more orthodox person  the austrian government and kaiser karls in particular is not to be called an intentionally unjust one the contrary i rather find but it is beyond others ponderous based broad on such multiplex formalities old habitudes and gravitation has a great power over it in brief official human nature with the best of kaisers atop flagitated continually by jesuit confessors does throw its weight on a certain side the sad fact is in a few years the brightness of that altranstadt improvement began to wax dim and now under long jesuit manipulation silesian things are nearly at their old pass and the patience of men is heavily laden to see your chapel made a soldiers barrack your protestant school become a jesuit onemen did not then think of revolting under injuries but the poor silesian weaver trudging twenty miles for his sunday sermon and perceiving that unless their mother could teach the art of reading his boys except under souls peril would now never learn it such a silesian could not want for reflections voiceless hopeless but heavy and dwelling secretly as under nightmare in a million hearts austrian officiality wilfully unjust or not wilfully so is admitted to be in a most heavyfooted condition can administer nothing well good government in any kind is not known here possibly the prussian will be better who can say  the secret joy of these populations as friedrich advances among them becomes more and more a manifest one catholic officials do not venture on any definite hope or definite balance of hope and fear but adopt the mayor of grunbergs course and study to be passive and silent the jesuitpriest kind are clear in their minds for austria but think perhaps prussia itself will not prove very tyrannous at all events be silent it is unsafe to stir we notice generally it is only in the southern or mountain regions of silesia where the catholics are in majority that the population is not ardently on the prussian side passive if they are on the other side accurately passive at lowest this it is prescribed all prudent men to be  on the 18th while divine service went on at weichau there was at breslau another phenomenon observable provincial government in breslau had at length after intense study and across such difficulties as we have no idea of got its patent or carefully worded protestation against prussia brought to paper and does this day with considerable solemnity affix it to the rathhaus door there for the perusal of mankind despatching a copy for his prussian majesty withal by two messengers of dignity it has needed courage screwed to the stickingplace to venture on such a step without instruction from headquarters and the utmost powers of the official mind have been taxed to couch this document in language politely ambiguous and yet strong enoughtoo strong some of us now think it in any case here it now is provincial governments bolt so to speak is shot the affixing took place under dark weathersymptoms actual outburst of thunder and rain at the moment not to speak of the other surer omens so that to the common mind at breslau it did not seem there would much fruit come of this difficult performance breslau is secretly a muchagitated city and prussian hussar parties shooting forth to great distances ahead were this day for the first time observed within sight of it  and on the same sunday we remark farther what is still more important herr von gotter friedrichs special envoy to vienna has his first interview with the queen of hungary or with grandduke franz the queens husband and coregent and presents there from friedrichs own hand written we remember when brief distinct note of his prussian majestys actual proposals and real meaning in regard to this silesian affair proposals anxiously conciliatory in tone but the heavy purport of which is known to us gotter had been despatched time enough with these proposals written above a month ago but was instructed not to arrive with them till after the actual entrance into silesia and now the response to them is as good as nothing perhaps worse let that suffice us at present readers on march for glogau would grudge to pause over statepapers though we shall have to read this of friedrichs at some freer moment  monday 19th before daybreak the army is astir again simultaneously wending forward spread over wide areas like a vast cloud potential thunder in it steadily advancing on the winds length of the army artistically portioned out may be ten or fifteen miles breadth already more and growing more schwerin always on the right or western wing close by the bober river as yet through naumburg and the towns on that sideliegnitz and other important towns lying ahead for schwerin still farther apart from the main body were glogau once settled  so that the march is in two columns schwerin with the westernmost small column intending towards liegnitz and thence ever farther southward with his right leaning on the high lands which rise more and more into mountains as you advance friedrich himself commands the other column has his left upon the oder in a country mounting continually towards the south but with less irregularity of level and generally flat as yet from beginning to end the entire field of march lies between the oder and its tributary the bober climbing slowly towards the sources of both which two rivers as the reader may observe form here a rectangular or trapezoidal space ever widening as we go southward both rivers coming from the giant mountains hasten directly north but oder bulging out easterly in his sandy course is obliged to turn fairly westward again and at glogau and a good space farther flows in that directiontill once bober strikes in almost at right angles carrying oder with him though he is but a branch straight northward again northward but ever slower to the swollen pommern regions and sluggish exit into the baltic there  one of the worst features is the state of the weather on sunday at breslau we noticed thunder bursting out on an important occasion ominous some men thoughtomen for one thing that the weather was breaking at weichau that same day rain beganthe young herr of weichau driving home to papa from dinner with majesty would get his share of itand on monday 19th there was such a pour of rain as kept most wayfarers though it could not the prussian army within doors rain in plunges fallen and falling through that blessed day making roads into mere rivers of mud the prussian hosts marched on all the same headquarters with the van of the wet army that night were at milkaufrom which place we have a note of friedrichs for friend jordan perhaps producible by and by his majesty lodged in some opulent jesuit establishment there and indeed he continued there not idle under shelter for a couple of days the jesuits by their two head men had welcomed him with their choicest smiles to whom the king was very gracious asking the two to dinner as usual and styling them your reverence willing to ingratiate himself with persons of interest in this country and likes talk even with jesuits of discernment  on the morrow 20th came to him here at milkauprobably from some near stage for the rain was pouring worse than everthat breslau patent or strongish protestation by its two messengers of dignity the king looked over it without visible anger or change of countenance handed it we expressly see to a page to reposit in the proper wastebasketspoke politely to the two gentlemen asked each or one of them are you of the oberamt at breslau thenusing the style of er heno your majesty we are only of the landstande provincial parliament such as it is upon which do you mark his majesty became still more polite asked them to dinner and used the style of sie for their patent now lying safe in its wastebasket he gave them signed receipt no other answer  rain still heavier rain as of noah continued through this tuesday and for days afterwards but the prussian hosts hastening towards glogau marched still on this tuesdays march for the rearward of the army 10000 foot and 2000 horse march of ten hours long from weichau to the hamlet milkau where his majesty sits busy and affableis thought to be the wettest on record waters all out bridges down the country one wild lake of eddying mud up to the knee for many miles together up to the middle for long spaces sometimes even up to the chin or deeper where your bridge was washed away the prussians marched through it as if they had been slate or iron rank and file nobody quitted his rank nobody looked sour in the face they took the pouring of the skies and the red seas of terrestrial liquid as matters that must be cheered one another with jocosities with choral snatches tobacco i consider would not burn and swashed unweariedly forward ten hours some of them were out their march being twenty or twentyfive miles ten to fifteen was the average distance come nor singular to say did any loss occur except of almost one poor armychaplain and altogether of one poor soldiers wifesank dangerously both of them beyond redemption she taking the wrong side of some bridgeparapet poor soldiers wife she is not named to me at all and has no history save this and that she was of the regiment bredow but i perceive she washed herself away in a worldtransaction and there was one rough bredower who probably sat sad that night on getting to quarters his majesty surveyed the damp battalions on the morrow 21st not without sympathy not without satisfaction allowed them a restday here at milkau to get dry and bright again and gave them fifteen thalers a company which is about ninepence apiece with some words of praise heldengeschichte i482  next day thursday 22d his majesty and they marched on to herrendorf which is only five miles from glogau and near enough for headquarters in the now humor of the place wallis has his messenger at herrendorf sorry to warn your majesty that if there be the least hostility committed i shall have to resist it to the utmost headquarters continue six days at herrendorf army main body or left column of the army cantoned all round till we consider what to do  as to the right column or schwerins division that after a restday or two gathers itself into more complete separation here tucking in its eastern skirts and gets on march again by its own route steadily southwardand from liegnitz and the upland countries there will be news of schwerin and it before long rain ending there ensued a ringing frostnot favorable for siegeoperations on glogauand silesia became all of flinty glass with white peaks to the southwest whither schwerin is gone     chapter iii  problem of glogau  friedrich was over from herrendorf with the first daylight reconnoitring glogau and rode up to the very glacis scanning it on all sides ib i 484 since wallis is so resolute here is an intricate little problem for friedrich with plenty of corollaries and conditions hanging to it shall we besiege glogau then we have no siegecannon here time presses breslau and all things in such crisis and it will take time by what methods could glogau be besiegedreaders can consider what a blind manythreaded coil of things heaping itself here in wide welters round glogau and straggling to the worlds end friedrich has on hand probably those six days of headquarters at herrendorf were the busiest he had yet had  one thing is evident there ought to be siegecannon got straightway and still more immediate the right posts and batteringplaces should be ready against its cominglet the young dessauer with that rearguard or reserve of 10000 which is now at crossen come up and assist here orders friedrich and let him be swift for the hours are pregnant on farther reflection perhaps on new rumors from breslau friedrich perceives that there can be no besieging of glogau at this point of time that the reserve half of the reserve must be left to mask it to hold it in strict blockade with starvation daily advancing as an ally to us and with capture by bombarding possible when we like that is the ultimate decisionarrived at through a welter of dubieties counterpoisings and perilous considerations which we now take no account of a most busy week friedrich incessantly in motion now here now there and a great deal of heavy work got well and rapidly done the details of which in these exuberant manuscripts would but weary the reader choosing of the proper posts and batteringplaces post on the other side of the river on this side of it on the island in the middle of it and obstinate intrenching and preparing of the same in spite of frost wooden bridge built farther up with regulation of the

impression on the mind as of business thoroughly well done and a matter capable if left in the chaotic state of running to all manner of depths and heights compendiously forced to become cosmic in this manner  these landseldest undertake in a mildly resigned or even hopeful humor they will manage as required in their own circles will communicate with the circles farther on and everywhere the

everything on all hands quittance for everything furnished and a time is coming when such quittance presented by any silesian man will be counted money paid by him and remitted at the next taxday or otherwise made good which promise also was accurately kept the hopedfor time having come it must be owned the prussian army understands business and with brevity reduces to a minimum its own trouble

notice two million gulden 200000 pounds ready moneyinfinitely welcome this fourth proposition and indeed all the other three are welcome but they are saddled with a final condition which pulls down all again this which is studiously worded politely evasive in phrase and would fain keep old controversies asleep though in substance it is so fatally distinctwe give in the kings own words  5 for such essential services as those to which i bind myself by the above very onerous conditions i naturally require a proportionate recompense some suitable assurance as indemnity for all the dangers i risk and for the part role i am ready to play in short i require hereby the entire and complete cession of all silesia as reward for my labors and dangers which i take upon myself in this course now

are so fatally distinct preuss thronbesteigung p 451 from olenschlager geschichte des interegni frankfurt 1746 i 134  these were friedrichs proposals written down with his own hand at reinsberg five or six weeks ago november 17th is the date of it in what mood and how wrought upon by schwerin and podewils we saw above gotter has fulfilled his instructions in regard to this important little document and now the effect of it is gotter can report no good effect whatever be cautious friedrich instructs him farther modify that fifth proposal i will take less than the whole if attention is paid to my just claims on schlesien to that effect writes friedrich once or twice but it is to no purpose nor can gotter with all his industry report other than worse and worse nay he reports before long not refusal only but refusal with mockery how strange that his prussian majesty whose official post in germany as kurbrandenburg and kaisers chamberlain has been to present ewer and towel to the house of austria should now set up for prescribing rules to it a piece of wit which could not but provoke friedrich and warn him that negotiation on this matter might as well terminate such had been his own thought from the first but in compliance with schwerin and podewils he was willing to try  better for maria theresa and for all the world how much better could she have accepted this fifth proposition but how could shethe high imperial lady keystone of europe though by accident with only a few pounds of ready money at present twenty years of bitter fighting and agony to herself and all

the scultet gardenhouse that all must be ready and the rooms warmed his majesty intending to arrive here early on the morrow which happened accordingly majesty alighting duly at said gardenhouse near by the schweidnitz gatei fancy almost before break of day     chapter iv  breslau under soft pressure  the issue of this breslau transaction is known or could be stated in few words nor is the manner of it such as would for breslaus sake deserve many but we are looking into friedrich wish to know his manners and aspects and here ready to our hand a paper turns up compiled by an exact person with better leisure than ours minutely detailing every part of the affair this paper after the question burn or insert is to have the lot of appearing here with what abridgments are possible  sunday 1st january 1741 the king having established himself in herrn scultets gardenhouse not far from the schweidnitz gate there began a delicate and great operation the prussians in a soft cautious manner in the gray of the morning push out their sentries towards the three gates on this side of the oder seize any excise house or the like that may be fit for a post and softly put twenty grenadiers in it all this before sunrise breslau is rigidly shut breslau thought always it could stand upon its guard if attackedis now in official quarters dismally uncertain if it can general population becoming certain that it cannot and waiting anxious on the development of this grand drama  about 7 am a prussian subaltern advancing within cry of the schweidnitz gate requests of the townguard there to send him out a townofficer townofficer appears is informed that colonels posadowsky and borck commissioners or plenipotentiary messengers from his prussian majesty desire admittance to the chief magistrate of breslau for the purpose of signifying what his prussian majestys instructions are townofficer bows and goes upon his errand townofficer is some considerable time before he can return city authorities being as we know various partly imperial partly civic elderly and some of them gone to churchfor matins or to be out of the way however he does at last return admits the two colonels and escorts them honorably to the chief rathssyndic lordmayor old herr von gutzmars where the poor old president of the ober amt von schaffgotsch the name of this latter is likewise in attendance  prussian majestys proposals are of the mildest sort nothing demanded of breslau but the plainly indispensable and indisputable that prussia be in it what austria has been in all else status quo strict neutrality to breslau respect for its privileges as a free city of the reich protection to all its rights and privileges whatsoever shall be guarded by its own garrison no prussian soldier to enter except with sidearms only 30 guards for the kings person who will visit the city for a few daysintends to form a magazine with guard of 1000 men but only outside the city no requisitions ready money for everything chief syndic gutzmar and president schaffgotsch shall consider these points heldengeschichte i 537 syndic and president answer surely cannot however decide till they have assembled the townrath the two herren colonels will please to be guests of breslau and lodge in the city till then  and they lodged accordingly in the grosse ring called also salzring big central square where the rathhaus is and they made and received visitsvisited especially the chief presidents office the oberamt and signified there that his prussian majestys expectation was they would give some account of that rather high proclamation or patent they had published against him the other day amid thunder and lightning here and what they now thought would be expedient upon it all in grave official terms but of such a purport as was not exhilarating to everybody in those oberamt localities  monday morning 2d january the rath is assembled and consultsconsults at great length rathhouse and syndic gutzmar in such crisis would fain have advice from amthouse or president schaffgotsch but can get none considerable coming and going between them at length about 3 in the afternoon the treaty is got drawn up is signed by the due breslau hands and by the two prussian colonelswhich latter ride out with it about 4 of the clock victorious after thirty hours straight towards the scultet garden ride they townguard presenting arms at the schweidnitz gate nay townband breaking out into music which is never done but to ambassadors and high people by thirty hours of steady soft pressure they have brought it thus far  friedrich had waited patiently all sunday keeping steady guard at the gates but on monday naturally the thirty hours began to hang heavy at all events he perceived that it would be well to facilitate conclusions a little from without breslau stands on the west more strictly speaking on the south side of the oder which makes an elbow here and thus bounds it or mostly bounds it on two sides the big drabcolored river spreads out into islands of a confused sort as it passes which are partly built upon and constitute suburbs of the townstretching over here and there into straggles of farther suburb beyond the river where a road with its bridge happens to cross for the eastern parts the principal of these islands is the dom inselknown to general browne and uson which is the cathedral and the close with rich canons and their edifices island filled with strong high architecture and a superior military post  friedrich has already as good as possessed himself of the three landward gates which look to the south and to the west the riverward gates or those on the north and the east he perceives that it were good now also to have these and even perhaps something more gather all the riverboats make a bridge of them across the oder push across 400 men this is done on monday morning under the kings own eye this done march up to that riverward gate and also to that other in a mild but dangerouslooking manner hew the beams of said gate in two start the big locks fling wide open said gate and gates this too is done townguard looking mournfully on this done march forward swiftly in two halves without beat of drumwhitherward you know  those three hundred austrian dragoons we saw them leave the dom island three days ago there are at present only six men of the bishops guard walking under arms thereat the end of the chief bridge on the townward side of their dom island see prussian caps and muskets ye six men under arms the six men clutch at their drawbridge and hastily set about hoistingalas another prussian corps which has come privately by the eastern or countryward bridge king himself with it taps them on the shoulder at this instant mildly constrains the six into their guardhouse the drawbridge falls 400 prussian grenadiers take quiet possession of the dom island king may return to the scultet garden having quickened the lazy hours in this manner to such of the canons as he came upon his majesty was most polite they most submiss the six soldiers of the drawbridge having spoken a little loudstill more a too zealous beefeater of old schaffgotschs found here who had been very loudwere put under arrest but more for forms sake and were let go in a day or two  nothing could be gentler on friedrichs part and on that of his two colonels than this delicate operation throughoutand at 4 pm after thirty hours of waiting it is done and nobodys skin scratched old syndic gutzmar and the townrath urged by perils and a town population who are protestant have signed the surrender with goodwill at least with resignation and a feeling of relief the oberamt officials have likewise had to sign full of all the silent spleen and despondency which is natural to the situation spleen which in the case of old schaffgotsch weak with age becomes passionately audible here and there he will have to give account of that injurious proclamation or queens patent to this king that has now come     king enters breslaw stays there gracious and vigilant four days jan 2d6th 1741  in the royal entrance which took place next day note these points syndic gutzmar and the authorities came out in grand coaches at 8 in the morning had to wait awhile the king having ridden away to look after his manifold affairs did not get back till 10

survey of the town walls round as far as the ziegelthor tilegate extreme southeast by the riveredge he has thus made the whole circuit of breslauunwearied in picking up useful knowledge though it was

nothing to speak of heldengeschichte i 545548  dinner better and better ordered king more and more gracious so it continued all the four days of his majestys stayon the second day he had to rise suddenly from table and leave his guests with an apology something having gone awry at one of the gates awry there between the town authorities and a general jeetz of hiswho is on march across the river at this moment on what errand we shall hear and a little mistakes the terms his majesty puts jeetz right and even waits till he sees his brigade and him clear across a junior schaffgotsch

though of a family important in the province dinner falls about noon does not last above two hours or three so that there is space for a ride to the dom the first afternoon four runners always and for much indoor work before the supperhour  as the austrian authorities sat silent in their place and gave no explanation of that patent affixed amid thunder and lightningthey got orders from his majesty to go their ways next day and went in behalf of old president von schaffgotsch a chief of the silesian nobility and man much loved the breslau people and men from every guild and rank of society made petition that he should be allowed to continue in his town house here which first request of yours his majesty with much grace is sorry to be obliged to refuse the suppressed and insuppressible weak indignation of old schaffgotsch is visible on the occasion nor i think does friedrich take it ill only sends him out of the way with it for the time the austrian oberamt vanished bodily from breslau in this manner and never returned proper warcommission feldkriegscommissariat with munchow one of those skilful custrin munchows at the top of it organized itself instead which almost of necessity became supreme government in a city ungoverned otherwiseand truly there was little regret of the oberamt in breslau and ever less to a marked extent as the years went on  on the 5th of january fourth

schlegenberg i should guess a dowager lady in whose house he lodges i am not aware that his majesty danced much farther but he was very condescending and spoke and smiled up and downtill about 10 pm an officer came in with a letter which letter his majesty having read and seemingly asked a question or two in regard to put silently in his pocket as if it were a finished thing nevertheless after a few minutes his majesty was found to have silently withdrawn and did not return not even to supper perceiving which all the prussian official people gradually withdrew though the dancing and supping continued not the less to a late hour heldengeschichte i 557  open the austrian mailbag felleisen see a little what they are saying over there such order had evidently been given this night in consequence of which people wrote by dresden and not the direct way in future wishing to avoid that openable felleisen next morning january 6th his majesty had left for ohlauearly i suppose though there proved to be nothing dangerous ahead there after all     chapter v  friedrich pushes forward towards brieg and neisse  ohlau is a pleasant little town two marches southeast of breslau with the ohlau river on one side and the oder on the other capable of some defence were there a garrison brieg the important fortress still on the oder is some fifteen miles beyond ohlau after which bending straight south and quitting oder neisse the still more important may be thirty milesfrom breslau to neisse by this route which is bow not string sixtyfive or seventy miles one of my topographers yields this note if readers care for it  ohlau river an insignificant drabcolored stream rises well south of breslau about strehlen makes at first direct eastward towards the oder and then when almost close upon it breaks off to north and saunters along irregularly parallel to oder for twenty miles farther before it can fall fairly in to this circumstance both breslau and a town of ohlau owe their existence towns both of them between the waters and otherwise well seated ohlau sheltering itself in the attempted outfall of its little river breslau clustering itself about the actual outfall both very defensible places in the old rude time and good for trade in all times both oder and ohlau rivers have split and spread themselves into islands and deltas a good deal at their place of meeting and even have changed their courses and cut out new channels for themselves in the sandy country making a very intricate watery network of a site for breslau and indeed the ohlau river here for centuries back has been compelled into wide meanderings mere filling of rampartditches so that it issues quite obscurely and in an artificial engineered condition at breslau  ohlau had been expected to make some defence general browne having thrown 300 men into it and done what he could for the works and ohlau did at first threaten to make some but thought better of it overnight and in effect made none but was got morning of january 9th on the common terms by merely marching up to it in minatory posture prisoners of war if you make resistance free withdrawal liberty to march away arms shouldered and not serve against us for a year if you have made none this is the common course where there are austrian soldiers at all the course where none are and only a few syndics sit with their townkey laid on the table a prey to the stronger hand we have already seen  from ohlau proper detachment under general kleist is pushed forward to summon brieg jeetz from the other side of the river whom we saw crossing at breslau the other day interrupting his majestys dinner is to cooperate with kleist in that enterprisewere the country once cleared on his jeetzs east side of oder especially

home from his parisian embassy and got launched among the wintry mountains on a new operationwhich however proves of noneffect for the present heldengeschichte i 678 orlich geschichte der beiden schlesischen kriege i 49  indeed it is observable that southward of breslau the dispute what dispute there can be properly begins and that general browne is there and shows himself a shining man in this difficult position it must be owned no general could have made his small means go farther effective garrisons 1600 each put into brieg and neisse works repaired magazines collected there and elsewhere the rest of his poor 7000 thriftily sprinkled about in what good posts there are and capable of being got together in six hours a superior soldier this browne though with a very bad task and seems to have inspired everybody with something of his own temper so that there is marching detaching miscellaneous difficulty for friedrich in this quarter more than had been expected if the fate of brieg and neisse be inevitable browne does wonders to delay it  of the prussian marches in these parts recorded by intricate dryasdust there was no point so notable to me as this unrecorded one the stone pillar which i see the kleist detachment was sure to find just now on the march from ohlau to brieg last portion of that march between the village of briesen and brieg the oder flowing on your left hand is hereabouts agreeably clothed with woods the country originally a swamp has been drained and given to the plough in an agreeable manner and there is an excellent road paved with solid whinstonequarried in strehlen twenty miles away among the hills to the right yonder as you may guessroad very visible to the prussian soldier though he does not ask where quarried these beautiful improvements beautiful humanitieswere done by whom done in 1584 say the records by george the pious duke of liegnitz brieg and wohlau 156 years ago pious his contemporaries called this georgehe was son of the erbverbruderung duke who is so important to us he was grandfathers grandfather of the last duke of all after whom it was we that should have got these fine territories they should all have fallen to the great elector had not the austrian strong hand provided otherwise george did these plantations recoveries to the plough made this perennial whinstone road across the swamps upon which notable to the roughest prussian being twelve feet high by eight feet square rises a hewn mass with this inscription on itnot of the name or date of george but of a thought of his which is not without a pious beauty to mestraverunt alii nobis nos posteritati omnibus at christus stravit ad asra viam others have made roads for us we make them for still others christ made a road to the stars for us all zollner briefe uber schlesien i 175 hubner i t 101  i know not how many brandenburgers of general kleists detachment or whether any read this stone but they do all rustle past it there claiming the heritage of this pious george and their mute dim interview with him in this manner is a thing slightly more memorable than orders of the day at this date  it was on the 11th two days after ohlau that general kleist summoned brieg and brieg answered resolutely no there is a garrison of 1600 here and a proper magazine nothing for it but to mask brieg too kleist on this side the river jeetz on thathad jeetz once done with namslau which he has not by any means namslaus answer was likewise stiffly in the negative and jeetz cannot do namslau at least not the castle all at once having no siegecannon seeing such stiffness everywhere friedrich writes to glogau to the young dessauer siegeartillery hither swift by the oder you dont need it where you are and wishes it were arrived for behoof of neisse and these stiff humors     friedrich comes across to ottmachau sits there in survey of neisse till his cannon come  the prussians met with serious resistance for the first time 9th january same day when ohlau yielded at a place called ottmachau a considerable little town and castle on the neisse river not far west of neisse town almost at the very south of silesia it lay on the route of schwerins column long distances ahead of liegnitzsay by straight highway a hundred milesduring which to right and to left there had been nothing but submission hitherto no resistance was expected here either for there was not hope in any only that browne had been here industrious to create delay till neisse were got fully ready he is by every means girding up the loins of neisse for a tight defence has put 1600 men into it with proper stores for them with a resolute skilful captain at the top of them assiduous browne had been at ottmachau as the outpost of neisse a day or two before and they say had admonished them not to yield on any terms for he would certainly come to their relief which doubtless he would have done had it been in his power but how except by miracle could it be on the 9th of january when schwerin comes up browne is again waiting hereabouts again in defensive posture but without force to undertake anything stands on the southern uplands with bohmen and mahren and the giant mountains at his backstands so to speak defensive at his own housedoor in this manner and will have after seeing ottmachaus fate and neisses to duck in with a slam at any rate he had left these towns in the above firm humor screwed to the stickingplace and had then galloped elsewhither to screw and prepare  and so the ottmachau austrians 260 picked grenadiers 400

at grotkau well forward towards neisse halfway between brieg and it same day colonel camas returns to him out of glatz five of his men lost and reports that browne has had the roads torn up that glatz

friedrich but there is no hope of it without some kind of siege and friedrich determines to try in that way from ottmachau accordingly and from the other sides the siegeartillery being now at hand due force gathers itself round neisse schwerin taking charge and for above a week there is demonstrating and posting summoning and parleying and then for three days with pauses intervening there is extremely furious bombardment redhot at times will you yield thenwith steady negative from neisse friedrichs quarter is at ottmachau twelve miles off from which he can ride over to see and superintend the fury of his bombardment which naturally grieved him testifies the intensity of his wish but it was to no purpose the commandant colonel von roth the same who was proposed for breslau lately a wise head and a stout famed in defences had poured water on his ramparts after well repairing themmade his ramparts all ice and glassand done much else would the reader care to look for a moment here from our waste papermasses is abundance requiring only to be abridged  january 1741 monday 9thwednesday 11th monday 9th day when that sputter at ottmachau beganprussian lighttroops appeared transiently on the heights about neisse for the first time directly on sight of whom commandant roth assembled the burghers of the place took a new oath of fidelity from one and all admonished them to do their utmost as they should see him do the ablebodied and likeliest of them say about 400 he has had arranged into militia companies with what drill there could be in the interim and since his coming has employed every moment in making ready wednesday 11th he locks all the gates and stands strictly on his guard the inhabitants are mostly catholic with sumptuous bishops of breslau with kreuzherren imaginary teutsch or other ritters with some reality of money with jesuit dignitaries church and quasichurch officialities resident among them population high and low is inclined by creed to the queen of hungary commandant roth has only 1200 regular soldiers at the outside 1600 men under arms but he has gunpowder he has meal experience also and courage and hopes these may suffice him for a time one of the most determined commandants expert in the defence of strong places a born silesian not saxon as some thinkand is of the augsburg confession but that circumstance is not important here though at breslau browne thought it was  thursday 12th the prussians in regular force appear on the kaninchen berg cony hill so called from its rabbits south of the river evidently taking post there roth fires a signal shot the southern suburbs of neisse as preappointed go up in flame crackle high and far in a lamentable manner erbarmlich through the grim winter air this is the day friedrich came over to ottmachau and settled the sputter there  next day and next again the same phenomena at neisse the prussians edging ever nearer building their batteries preparing to open their cannonade whereupon roth burns the remaining suburbs with lamentable crackle on all sides now are mere ashes bishops mill franciscan cloister bishops pleasuregarden with its summerhouses bishops hospital and several churches roth can spare none of these things with the prussians nestling there surely the bishop himself respectable cardinal graf von sinzendorf had better get out of these localities while time yet is saturday 14th that was the day friedrich at ottmachau wrote as above to jordan letter no 1 while the neisse suburbs crackled lamentably twelve miles off schwerin gets order to break up in person from ottmachan tomorrow and begin actual business on the kaninchen hill yonder  sunday 15th schwerin does marches across the river takes post on the south side of neisse notable to the sunday rustics nothing but burnt villages and black walls for schwerin in that conyhill quarter and all round and roth salutes him with one twentyfour pounder which did no hurt and so the cannonade begins sunday 15th and intermittently on both sides of the river continues always bursting out again at intervals till wednesday a mere preliminary cannonade on schwerins part making noise doing little hurt intended more to terrify but without effect that way on roth or the townsfolk the poor bishop did on the second day of it come out and make application to schwerin was kindly conducted to his majesty who happened to be over there was kept to dinner and easily had leave to retire to freywalde a countryhouse he has in the safe distance heldengeschichte i 683 there let him be quiet well out of these confused batterings and burnings of property  his majestys headquarter is at ottmachau but in two hours he can be here any day and looks into everything sorry that the cannonade does not yet answer and remnants of suburbs are still crackling into flame high countryhouses of kreuzherren of jesuits a fanatic people seemingly all set against us if neisse will not yield of goodwill needs is it must be beaten to powder wrote his majesty to jordan in these circumstances as we read above roth is sorry to observe the prussians have still one good bishopsmansion in a place called the karlau karlmeadow with the bishops winter fuel all ready stacked there but strives to take order about the same  wednesday 18th this day two provocations happened first in the morning by his majestys order colonel borck the same we saw at herstal had gone with a trumpeter towards roth intending to inform roth how mild the terms would be how terrible the penalty of not accepting them but roth or roths people singularly disregard borck and his parley trumpet answer its blasts by musketry fire upon it nay again fire worse when it advances a step farther on these terms borck and trumpet had to return which much angered his majesty at ottmachau that evening as was natural same evening our fine quarters in the karlau crackled up in flame the bishops winter firewood all along with it this was provocation second roth had taken order with the karlau and got a resolute butcher to do the feat under pretext of bringing us beef it is piercing cold only blackened walls for us now in the karlau or elsewhere his majesty naturally much angered orders for the morrow a dose of bombshells and redhot balls plant a few mortars on the north side too orders his majesty  thursday 19th accordingly by 8 of the clock cannon batteries reawaken with a mighty noise and redhot balls are noticeable and at 10 the actual bombarding bursts out terrible to hear and seefirst shell falling in haubitz the clothiers shop but being happily got under roth has his city militia companies organized with waterhose for quenching of the redhot balls in which they became expert so that though the fire caught many houses they always put it out late in the night hearing no word from roth the prussians went to bed  friday 20th still no word on which about 4 pm the prussian batteries awaken again volcanic torrent of redhot shot and shells for seven hours still no word from roth about 11 at night his majesty again sends a drum parley trumpet or whatever it is to the gate formally summons roth asks him if he has well considered what this can lead to especially what he roth meant by firing on our first trumpet on wednesday last roth answered that as to the trumpet he had not heard of it before on the other hand that this mode of sieging by redhot balls seems a little unusual for the rest that he has himself no order or intention but that of resisting to the last some say the drum hereupon by order talked of pounding neisse into powder mere childsplay hitherto to which roth answered only by respectful dumbshow  saturday 21stmonday 23d midnight of fridaysaturday on this answer coming the firevolcanoes open againnine hours long shells and redhot material in terrible abundance which hit mostly the churches jesuits seminariums and collegiums but produced no change in roth from 9 am the batteries are silent silent still next morning divine service may proceed if it like but at 4 of the afternoon the batteries awaken worse than ever from seven to nine bombs going at once universal rage of noise and horrid glare making night hideous till 10 of the clock roth continuing inflexible this is the last night of the siege  friedrich perceived that roth would not yield that the utter smashingdown of neisse might more concern friedrich than roththat in fine it would be better to desist till the weather altered next day monday 23d between noon and 1 oclock the prussians drew backconverted the siege into a blockade neisse to be masked like brieg and glogau brieg only half done yet jeetz without cannon till tomorrow 24th and little namslau still gesticulating the only thing one could try upon it was bombardment a nest of priests pfaffennest not many troops in it but it cannot well be forced at present if spring were here it will cost a fortnights work friedrich to the

just coming and the vienna board of war is frequently troublesometo whose windy speculations browne replies with sagacious scepticism and here and there a touch of veiled sarcasm which was not likely to conciliate in high places had her hungarian majesty been able to retain browne in his post instead of poor neipperg who was sent instead there might have been a considerably different account to give of the sequel but neipperg was tutor wartutor to the grandduke browne is still of young standing age only thirtyfive with a touch of veiled sarcasm and things must go their course  in schlesien

arrives at berlin as the week endsmuch acclamation greeting him from the multitude except those three masked fortresses capable of no defence to speak of were winter over silesia is now all friedrichshas fallen wholly to him in the space of about seven weeks the seizure has been easy but the retaining of it perhaps he himself begins to see more clearly will have difficulties from this point the talk about gloire nearly ceases in his correspondence in those seven weeks he has with gloire or otherwise cut out for himself such a life of labor as no man of his century had     chapter vii  at versailles the most christian majesty changes his shirt and belleisle is seen with papers  while friedrich was so busy in silesia the world was not asleep around him the world never is though it often seems to be round a man and what action he does in it that sunday morning first day of the year 1741 in those same hours while friedrich with energy with caution was edging himself into breslau there went on in the court of versailles an interior phenomenon of which having by chance got access to it face to face we propose to make the reader participant before going farther  readers are languidly aware that phenomena do go on round their friedrich that their busy friedrich with his few voltaires and renowned persons are not the only population of their century by any means everybody is aware of that fact yet in practice almost everybody is as good as not aware and the world all round ones hero is a darkness a dormant vacancy how strange when as here some wastepaper spill so to speak turns up which you can kindle and by the brief flame of it bid a reader look with his own eyesfrom herr doctor busching who did the geography and about a hundred other booksa man of great worth almost of genius could he have elaborated his hundred books into ten or distilled into flasks of aquavitae what otherwise lies tumbling as tanks of mash and wort now run very sour and malodorousit is from herr busching that we gain the following rough piece illuminative if one can kindle it  the titularherr baron anton von geusau a gentleman of good parts scholastic by profession and of protestant creed was accompanying as travelling tutor in those years a young graf von reuss graf von beuss is one of those indistinct counts reuss who always call themselves henry and being now at the eightieth and farther with uncountable collateral henrys intertwisted are become in effect anonymous or of nomenclature inscrutable to mankind nor is the young one otherwise of the least interest to usexcept that herr anton the travelling tutor punctually kept a journal of everything which journal long afterwards came into the hands of busching also a punctual man and was by him abridged and set forth in print in his beitrage offering at present a singular daguerrotype glimpse of the then actual world wherever graf von reuss and his geusau happened to be ninetenths of it even in buschings abridgment are now fallen useless and wearisome but to one studying the days that then were even the effete commonplace of it occasionally becomes alive again and how interesting to catch here and there a historical figure on these conditions historical figures very self in his workday attitude eating his victuals writing receiving letters talking to his fellowcreatures unaware that posterity miraculously through some chink of the travelling tutors producing has got its eye upon him  sunday 1st january 1741 geusau and his young gentleman leave paris at 5 in the morning and drive out to versailles intending to see the ceremonies of newyears day there very wet weather it had been all wednesday and for days before see in barbier ii 283 et seqq what terrible noahlike weather it had been big houses long in soak tumbling down at last into the seine chasse of st genevieve brought out two days ago december 30th to try it by miracle c c but on this sunday newyears morning all is ice and glass and they slid about painfully by lamplightwith unroughened horses and on the hilly or meudon road having chosen that as fittest the waters being outnot arriving at court till 9 nor finding very much to comfort them except on the side of curiosity when there ushers introducteurs cabinet secretaries were indeed assiduous to oblige and the kings levee will be but if you follow it to the chapel royal to witness high mass you must kneel at elevation of the host and this as reformed christians reuss and his tutor cannot undertake to do they accept a dinner invitation 12 the hour from some good samaritan of quality and for sights will content themselves with the kings levee itself and generally with what the kings antechamber and the oeildeboeuf can exhibit to them the most christian kings levee lever literally here his getting out of bed is a daily miracle of these localities only grander on newyears day and it is to the following effect  till majesty please to awaken you saunter in the salle des ambassadeurs whole crowds jostling one another there gossiping together in a diligent insipid manner gossip all reported snatches of which have acquired a certain flavor by long keepingwhich the reader shall imagine meanwhile you keep your eye on the grate of the inner court which as yet is only ajar majesty inaccessible as yet behold at last grate opens itself wide sign that majesty is out of bed that the privileged of mankind may approach and see the miracles geusau continues abridged by busching and us  the whole assemblage passed now into the kings anteroom had to wait there about half an hour more before the kings bedroom was opened but then at last lo youthere is the king visible to geusau and everybody washing his hands which effected itself in this way the king was seated a gentlemaninwaiting knelt before him and held the ewer a square vessel silvergilt firm upon the kings breast and another gentlemaninwaiting poured water on the kings hands merely an official washing we perceive the real it is to be hoped had in a much more effectual way been going on during the halfhour just elapsed after washing the king rose for an instant had his dressinggown a grand yellow silky article with silver flowerings pulled off and flung round his loins upon which he sat down again andobserve it ye privileged of mankindthe change of shirt took place they put the clean shirt down over his head says anton and plucked up the dirty one from within so that of the naked skin you saw little or nothing here is a miracle worth getting out of bed to look at  his majesty now quitted chair and dressinggown stood up before the fire and after getting on the rest of his clothing which on account of czarina annes death readers remember that was of violet or mourning color he had the powdermantle thrown round him and sat down at the toilette to have his hair frizzled the toilette a table with white cover shoved into the middle of the room had on it a mirror a powderknife andno mortal cares what the king what all mortals note as they do the heavenly omens is somewhat talky speaks sometimes with the dutch ambassador sometimes with the popes nuncio who seems a jocose kind of gentleman sometimes with different french lords and at last with the cardinal fleury alsoto whom however he does not look particularly graciousnot particularly this time these are the omens happy who can read themmajesty then did his morningprayer assisted only by the common almonersinwaiting cardinal took no hand much less any other majesty knelt before his bed and finished the business in less than six seconds after which mankind can ebb out to the anteroom again pay their devoir to the queens majesty which all do or wait for the transit to morning chapel and see mesdames of france and the others flitting past in their sedans  queens majesty was already altogether dressed says geusau almost as if with some disappointment all in black a most affable courteous majesty stands conversing with the russian ambassador with the dutch ditto with the ladies about her and at last in a friendly and merry tone with old cardinal fleury her ladies when the queen spoke with them showed no constraint at all leant loosely with their arms on the firescreens and took things easy mesdames of francegeusau saw mesdames poor little souls they are the loque the cochon rag pig so papa would call them dear papa who become tragically visible again in the revolution timeall blooming young children as yet queens majesty some thirtyseven gone and little dreaming what lies fifty years ahead king louiss career of extraneous gallantries which ended in the parcauxcerfs is now just beginning think of that too and of her majestys fine behavior under it so affable so patient silent now and alwaysin a little while their majesties go along the great gallery to chapel whither the protestant mind cannot with comfort accompany busching beitrage ii 5978  this is the daily miracle done at versailles to the believing multitude only that on newyears day and certain supreme occasions the shirt is handed by a prince of the blood and the towel for drying the royal hands by a ditto with other improvements and the thing comes out in its highest power of effulgenceespecially if you could see high mass withal in the antechamber and oeildeboeuf geusau among hundreds of phenomena fallen dead to us saw the four following which have still some life1 many knights of the holy ghost chevaliers du saint esprit are about magnificently piebald people indistinct to us and fallen dead to us but there among the company do not we indisputably see in full cardinals costume fleury the ancient prime minister talking to her majesty blandly smiling soft as milk yet with a flavor of alcoholic wit in him here and there that is a man worth looking at had they painted him at all red hat red stockings a serenely definite old gentleman with something of prudent wisdom and a touch of imperceptible jocosity at times mildly inexpugnable in manner this king whose tutor he was twenty years ago still looks to him as his father fleury is the real king of france at present his age is eightyseven gone the kings is thirty seven years younger than his queen and the cardinal has red stockings and red hat veritably there successively in both antechambers seen by geusau january 1st 1741 that is all i know 2 the prince de clermont a prince of the blood handed the shirt teste geusau some other prince notable to geusau and to us nameless had the honor of the towel but this prince de clermont a dissolute fellow of wasted parts kind of priest kind of soldier too is seen visibly handing the shirt therewhom the reader and i if we cared about it shall again see getting beaten by prince ferdinand at crefeld within twenty years hence these are points first and second slightly noticeable slightly if at all  of the actual transit to high mass transit very visible in the great gallery or oeildeboeuf why should a human being now say anything queen poor stanislauss daughter and her ladies in their sublime sedans one flood of jewels sail first next sails king louis shirt warm on his back with thirtyfour chevaliers of the holy ghost escorting next the dauphin boy of eleven louis xvis father and mesdames of france withbut even geusau stops short protestants cannot enter that chapel without peril of idolatry wherefore geusau and pupil kept strolling in the general oeildeboeufand the dutch ambassador approved of it he for one and here now is another point slightly noticeable3 high mass over his majesty sails back from chapel in the same magnificently piebald manner and vanishes into the interior leaving his knights of the holy ghost and other courtier multitude to simmer about and ebb away as they found good geusau and his young reuss had now the honor of being introduced to various people among others to the prince de soubise prince de soubise frivolous insignificant being of whom i have no portrait that is not nearly blank and content to be sothough herr von geusau would have one with features and costume to it when he heard of the beating at rossbach long after prince de soubise is pretty much a blank to everybodyand no sooner are we loose of him than what every reader will do well to note 4 our herren travellers are introduced to a real notability monseigneur soon to be marechal the comte de belleisle whom my readers and i are to be much concerned with in time coming a tall lean man langer hagerer mann without much air of quality thinks geusau but with much swift intellect and energy and a distinguished character whatever geusau might think comte de belleisle was very civil but apologized in a courtly and kind way for the hurry he was in regretting the impossibility of doing the honors to the comte de reuss in this countryhis belleisles journey into germany which was close at hand overwhelming him with occupations and engagements at present and indeed even while he spoke to us says geusau all manner of papers were put into his hand busching ii 79 see barbier ii 282 287  journey to germany papers put into his hand there is perhaps no human figure in the world this sunday except the one figure now in those same moments over at breslau gently pressing upon the locked gates there who is so momentous for our silesian operations and indeed he will kindle all europe into delirium and produce mere thunder and lightning for seven years to comewith almost no result in it except silesia a tall lean man there stands he age now fiftysix just about setting out on such errand whom one is thankful to have seen for a moment even in that slight manner     of belleisle and his plans  charles louis auguste fouquet comte de belleisle is grandson of that intendant fouquet sumptuous financier whom louis xiv at last threw out and locked into the fortress of pignerol amid the savoy alps there to meditate for life which lasted thirty years longer it was never understood that the sumptuous fouquet had altogether stolen public moneys nor indeed rightly what he had done to merit pignerol and always though fallen somehow into such dire disfavor he was pitied and respected by a good portion of the public has angered colbert said the public dangerous rivalry to colbert that is what has brought pignerol upon him out of pignerol that fouquet never came but his family bloomed up into light again had its adventures sometimes its troubles in the regency time but was always in a rising wayand here in this tall lean man getting papers put into his hand it has risen very high indeed going as ambassador extraordinary to the germanic diet to assist good neighbors as a neighbor and most christian majesty should in choosing their new kaiser to the best advantage that is the official color his mission is to have surely a proud missionand belleisle intends to execute it in a way that will surprise the germanic diet and mankind privately belleisle intends that he by his own industries shall himself choose the right kaiser such kaiser as will suit the most christian majesty and him he intends to make a new french thing of germany in general and carries in his head plans of an amazing nature he and a brother he has called the chevalier de belleisle who is also a distinguished man and seconds m le comte with eloquent fire and zeal in all things are grandsons of that old fouquet and the most shining men in france at present france little dreams how much better it perhaps were had they also been kept safe in pignerol  the count lean and growing old is not healthy is ever and anon tormented and laid up for weeks with rheumatisms gouts and ailments but otherwise he is still a swift ardent elastic spirit with grand schemes with fiery notions and convictions which captivate and hurry off mens minds more than eloquence could so intensely true are they to the count himselfand then his brother the chevalier is always there to put them into the due language and logic where needed voltaire xxviii 74 xxix 392 c a magnanimous highflown spirit thought to be of supreme skill both in war and in diplomacy fit for many things and is still full of ambition to distinguish himself and tell the world at all moments me voila world i too am herehis plans just now which are dim even to himself except on the hither skirt of them stretch out immeasurable and lie piled up high as the skies the hither skirt of them which will suffice the reader at present is  that your grandduke franz maria theresas husband shall in no wise as the world and duke franz expect be the kaiser chosen not he but another who will suit france better kursachsen perhaps the socalled king of poland or say it were karl albert kurbaiern the hereditary friend and dependent of france we are not tied to a man only at any and at all rates not grandduke franz this is the grand essential and indispensable point alpha and omega of points very clear this one to belleisleand towards this the first steps if as yet only the first are also clear to him namely that the 27th of february nextwhich is the time set by kurmainz and the native officials for the actual meeting of their reichstag to begin election business will be too early a time and must be got postponed adelung ii 185 27th february1st march 1741 at frankfurtonmayn appointed by kurmainz archchancellor of the reich under date november 3d 1740ib 236 delay for a month or two suggests kurpfalz on january 12th seconded by others in the french interestupon which the appointment after some arguing collapsed into the vague and there ensued delay enough actual election not till january 24th 1742 postponed which will be possible perhaps for long one knows not for how long that is a first step definitely clear to belleisle towards which as preliminary to it and to all the others in a dimmer state there is a second thing clear and has even been officially settled all but the day that in the mean while and surely the sooner the better he belleisle most christian majestys ambassador extraordinary to the reichstag comingdo in his most dazzling and persuasive manner make a tour among german courts let us visit in our highest and yet in our softest splendor the accessible german courts especially the likely or welldisposed mainz koln trier these the three called spiritual lie on our very route then pfalz baiern sachsenwe will tour diligently up and down try whether by optic machinery and artmagic of the mind one cannot bring them round  in all these preliminary steps and points and even in that alpha and omega of excluding grandduke franz and getting a kaiser of his own belleisle succeeded with painful results to himself and to millions of his fellowcreatures to readers of this history among others and became in consequence the most famous of mankind and filled the whole world with rumor of belleisle in those yearsa man of such intrinsic distinction as belleisle whom friedrich afterwards deliberately called a great captain and the only frenchman with a genius for war and who for some time played in europe at large a part like that of warwick the kingmaker how has he fallen into such oblivion many of my readers never heard of him before nor in writing or otherwise is there symptom that any living memory now harbors him or has the least approach to an image of him for the times are babbly says goethe and then again the times are dumb       denn geschwatzig sind die zeiten      und sie sind auch wieder stumm   alas if a man sow only chaff in never so sublime a manner with the whole earth and the longeared populations looking on and chorally singing approval rendering night hideousit will avail him nothing and that to a lamentable extent was belleisles case his scheme of action was in most felicitously just accordance with the national sense of france but by no means so with the laws of nature and of fact his aim grandiose patriotic what you will was unluckily false and not true how could the times continue talking of him they found they had already talked too much not to say that the french revolution has since come and has blown all that into the air miles aloftwhere even the solid part of it which must be recovered one day much more the gaseous which we trust is forever irrecoverable now wanders and whirls and many things are abolished for the present of more value than belleisle  for my own share being as it were forced accidentally to look at him again i find in belleisle a really notable man far superior to the vulgar of noted men in his time or ours sad destiny for such a man but when the general lifeelement becomes so unspeakably phantasmal as under louis xv it is difficult for any man to be real to be other than a playactor more or less eminent and artistically dressed sad enough surely when the truth of your relation to the universe and the tragically earnest meaning of your life is quite lied out of you by a world sunk in lies and you can with effort attain to nothing but to be a more or less splendid lie along with it your very existence all become a vesture a hypocrisy and hearsay nothing left of you but this sad faculty of sowing chaff in the fashionable manner after friedrich and voltaire in both of whom under the given circumstances one finds a perennial reality more or lessbelleisle is next none fails to escape the mournful common lot by a nearer miss than belleisle  beyond doubt there are in this man the biggest projects any french head has carried since louis xiv with his sublime periwig first took to striking the stars how the indolent louis xv and the pacific fleury have been got into this sublimely adventurous mood by belleisle chiefly men sayand by king louiss first mistresses blown upon by belleisle poor louis having now at length left his poor queen to her reflections and taken into that sad line in which by degrees he carried it so far there are three of them it seemsthe first female souls that could ever manage to kindle into flame or into smoke in this or any other kind that poor torpid male soul those mailly sisters three in number i am shocked to hear successive nay in part simultaneous they are proud women especially the two younger with ambition in them with a bravura magnanimity of the theatrical or operatic kind of whom louis is very fond to raise france to its place your majesty the top of the universe namely well if it could be doneand quite without trouble thinks louis bravura magnanimity blown upon by belleisle prevails among these high improper females and generally in the younger circles of the court so that poor old fleury has had no choice but to obey it or retire and so belleisle stalks across the oeildeboeuf in that important manner visibly to geusau and is the shining object in paris and much the topic there at present  a few weeks hence he is farthera little out of the common turn but not beyond his military merits or capabilitiesmade marechal de france fastes de louis xv i 356 12th february 1741 by way of giving him a new splendor in the german political world and assisting in his operations there which depend much upon the laws of vision french epigrams circulate in consequence and there are witty criticisms to which belleisle such a dusky world of possibility lying ahead is grandly indifferent marechal de franceand geusau hears what is a fact that there are to be thirty young french lords in his suite his very livery or mere plush retinue to consist of 110 persons such an outfit for magnificence as was never seen before and in this equipment early in march exact day not given magnificence of outside corresponding to grandiosity of faculty and idea belleisle we shall find does practically set off towards germanylike a kind of french belus or god of the sun capable to dazzle weak german courts by optical machinery and to set much rotten thatch on fire  there are curious daguerrotype glimpses of old paris to be found in that notebook of geusaus says another excerpt which come strangely home to us like reality at firsthandand a rather unexpected paris it is to most readers many things then alive there which are now deep underground much jansenist theology afloat grand french ladies piously eager to convert a young protestant nobleman like reuss sublime dorcases who do not rouge or dress high but eschew the evil world and are thrifty for the poors sake redeeming the time there is a cardinal de polignac venerable sage and expolitical person of astonishing erudition collector of antiques with whom we dined there is the chevalier ramsay theological scotch jacobite late tutor of the young turenne so many shining persons now fallen indistinct again and then besides gossip which is of mild quality and in fair proportionwhat talk casuistic and other about the moral duties the still feasible pieties the constitution unigenitus all this alive resonant at dinnertables of conservative stamp the miracles of abbe paris much a topic thereand not a whisper of infidel philosophies the very name of voltaire not once mentioned in the reuss section of parisian things  there is rumor now and then of a comte de rothenbourg conspicuous in the parisian circles a shining military man but seemingly in want of employment who has lost in gambling within the last four years upwards of 50000 pounds 1300000 livres the exact cipher given this is the graf von rothenburg whom friedrich made acquaintance with in the rhine campaign six years ago and has ever since had in his eyewhom in a few weeks hence friedrich beckons over to him into the prussian states hither and you shall have work which rothenburg accepts with manifold advantage to both partiesone of friedrichs most distinguished friends for the rest of his life  of cardinal polignac there is much said and several dinners with him are transacted dialogue partly given a pious wise old gentleman really in his kind age now eightyfour looking mildly forth upon a world just about to overset itself and go topsyturvy as he sees it will his antilucretius was once such a poembut we mention him here because his fine cabinet of antiques came to berlin on his death friedrich purchasing and one often hears of it if one cared to hear from the prussian dryasdust in subsequent years came to charlottenburg august 1742 old polignac had died november last ten months after those geusau times cost of the polignac cabinet was 40000 thalers 6000 pounds say some 90000 livres under 4000 pounds say others cheap at either priceand by chance came opportunely a fire having just burnt down the academy edifice and destroyed much ware of that kind rodenbeck i 73 seyfarth anonymous geschichte friedrichs des andern i 236  of friedrichs unexpected invasion of silesia there are also talkings and surmisings but in a mild indifferent tone and much in the vague and in the bestinformed circles it is thought belleisle will manage to have grandduke franz the queen of hungarys husband chosen kaiser and in some mild good way put an end to all thatwhich is far indeed from belleisles intention     chapter viii  phenomena in petersburg  i know not whether major winterfeld who was sent to petersburg in december last had got back to berlin in february now while friedrich is there but for certain the good news of him had that he had been completely successful and was coming speedily to resume his soldier duties in right time as winterfeld is an important man nearly buried into darkness in the dull prussian books let us pause for a moment on this negotiation of hisand on the mad russian vicissitudes which preceded and followed so far as they concern us russia a big demisavage neighbor next door with such caprices such humors and interests is always an important rather delicate object to friedrich and fortunes mad wheel is plunging and canting in a strange headlong way there of late czarina anne we know is dead the autocrat of all the russias following the kaiser of the romans within eight days iwan her little nephew still in swaddlingclothes is now autocrat of all the russias if he knew it poor little redcolored creature and anton ulrich and his mecklenburg russian princessbut let us take up the matter where our notebooks left it in friedrich wilhelms time  czarina anne with the big cheek continues that notebook supra p 129 was extremely delighted to see little iwan but enjoyed him only two months being herself in dying circumstances she appointed little iwan her successor his mother and father to be guardians over him but one bieren who writes himself biron and duke of courland being czarinas quasihusband these many years to be guardian as it were over both them and him such had been the truculent insatiable bierens demand on his czarina you are running on your destruction said she with tears but complied as she had been wont  czarina anne died 28th october 1740 leaving a czar in his cradle little czar ivan of two months with mother and father to preside over him and to be themselves presided over by bieren in this manner mannstein pp 264267 28th october by russian or old style is 17th we translate in this and other cases russian or english into new style unless the contrary is indicated this was the first great change for anton ulrich but others greater are coming little anton readers know is friedrichs brotherinlaw much patronized by austria antons spouse is the halfrussian princess catherine of mecklenburg now wholly russian and called princess anne whom friedrich at one time thought of applying for in his distress about a wife these two will they side with prussia will they side with austria it was hardly worth inquiry had not fortunes wheel made suddenly a great cant and pitched them to the top for the time being  bieren lasted only twenty days he was very high and arbitrary upon everybody anne and anton ulrich suffering naturally most from him they took counsel with feldmarschall munnich on the matter who after study declared it a remediable case friday 18th november munnich had by invitation to dine with duke bieren munnich went accordingly that day and dined duke looking a little flurried they say and the same evening dinner being quite over and midnight come munnich had his measures all taken soldiers ready warrant in handand arrested bieren in his bed mere siberia before sunrise looming upon bieren never was such a change as this from 18th day to 19th with a supreme bieren our friend mannstein excellent punctual aidedecamp of munnich was the executor of the feat and has left punctual record of it as he does of everythingwhat bieren said and what madam bieren who was a little obstreperous on the occasion mannstein p 268 what side anton ulrich and spouse will take in a quarrel between prussia and austria is now well worth asking  anton ulrich and wife anne that is to say regent anne and generalissimo anton ulrich now ruled with munnich for righthand man and these were high times for anton ulrich generalissimo and czarsfather who indeed was modest and did not often interfere in words though grieved at the foolish ways his wife had an indolent flabby kind of creature she unfit for an autocrat sat in her private apartments all in a huddle of undress had foolish notionsespecially had soubrettes who led her about by the ear and then there was a princess elizabeth cousingerman of regent annedaughter that is to say last child there now was of peter the great and his little brown catherinewho should have been better seen to harmless foolish princess not without cunning young plump and following merely her flirtations and her orthodox devotions very orthodox and soft but capable of becoming dangerous as a centre of the disaffected as czarina elizabeth before long and ultimately as infame catin du nord she but let us not anticipate  it was in this posture of affairs about a month after it had begun that winterfeld arrived in petersburg and addressed himself to munnich on the prussian errand winterfeld was munnichs soninlaw properly stepsoninlaw having married munnichs stepdaughter a fraulein von malzahn of good prussian kin was acquainted with the latitudes and longitudes here and well equipped for the operation in hand to madam munnich once madam malzahn his motherinlaw he carried a diamond ring of 1200 pounds small testimony of his prussian majestys regard to so high a prussian lady to munnichs son and madams a present of 3000 pounds on the like score and the wheels being oiled in this way and the steam so strong son winterfeld an ardent man father munnich the like supreme in russia and the thing itself a salutary thing the diplomatic speed obtained was great winterfeld had arrived in petersburg december 19th treaty of alliance to the effect firm friends and good neighbors we two majesties of prussia and of all the russias will help each the other if attacked with 12000 menwas signed on the 27th whole transaction so important to friedrich complete in eight days austrian botta directly on the heel of those unsatisfactory dialogues about silesian roads about troops that were pretty but had never looked the wolf in the facehad rushed off full speed for petersburg in hopes of running athwart such a treaty as winterfelds and getting one for austria instead but he arrived too late and perhaps could have done nothing had he been in time botta tried his utmost for years afterwards above ground and below to obstruct and reverse this thing but it was to no purpose and even to less and only in result brought botta himself into flagrant diplomatic trouble and scandal which made noise enough in the then gazetteer world and was the finale of bottas russian efforts adelung iii ii 289 mannstein p 375 lapuschin plot of bottas raising found out august 1743botta put in arrest c though not worth mentioning now  the russian notebook continues  munnich supreme in russia since bierens removal had wise counsels for the regent anne and her husband though perhaps being a high old military gentleman he might be somewhat abrupt in his ways and there were domestic ostermanns foreign bottas la chetardies and dangerous intriguers and opposition figures to improve any grudge that might arise sure enough in march 1741 feldmarschall munnich was forbid the court some ostermann succeeding him there ever true to your two highnesses though no longer neededand withdrew in a lofty friendly strain his son continuing at court though papa had withdrawn supreme munnich had lasted about four months supreme bieren hardly three weeksand siberia is still agape  munnich being gone to his own townmansion and regent anne sitting in hers in a huddle of undress little accessible to her longheaded melancholic ostermann and too accessible to her livonian maid with poor little anton ulrich pouting and remonstrating but unable to helpthis state of matters with such intrigues undermining it could not last forever and had not princess elizabeth been of indolent luxurious nature intent upon her prayers and flirtations it would have ended sooner even than it did princess elizabeth had a surgeon called lestoc a marquis de la chetardie a highflown french excellency who used to be at berlin to our young friedrichs delight was herwhat shall i say la chetardie himself had no scruple to say it these two plotted for her these were readycould she have been got ready which was not so easy regent anne had her suspicions but the princess was so indolent so good at last when directly taxed with such a thing the princess burst into ingenuous weeping quite disarmed regent annes suspicionsbut found she had now better take lestocs advice and proceed at once which she did  and so on the morrow morning 5th december 1741 by aid of the preobrazinsky regiment and the motions usual on such occasionsin fact by merely pulling out the props from an undermined state of mattersshe reduced said state gently to ruin ready for carting to siberia like its foregoers and was hereby czarina of all the russias prosperously enough for the rest of her life twenty years or rather more an indolent orthodox plump creature disinclined to cruelty not an ounce of nuns flesh in her composition said the wits she maintained the friedrich treaty indignant at botta and his plots was well with friedrich or might have been kept so by management for there was no cause of quarrel but the reverse between the countriescould friedrich have held his witty tongue when eavesdroppers were by but he could not always though he tried and sarcastic quizzing especially if it be truth too on certain female topics what improper female czarina of all the russias could stand it the history is but a distressing one a disgusting one in human affairs elizabeth was orthodox too and friedrich not the horrid man the fact isfact dismally indubitable though it is huddled into discreet dimness and all details of it as to what friedrichs witticisms were and the like are refused us in the prussian booksindignation owing to such dismal cause became fixed hate on the czarinas part and there followed terrible results at last a czarina risen to the cannibal pitch upon a man in his extreme needinfame catin du nord thinks the man friedrichs wit cost him dear him and half a million others still dearer twenty years hencetill which time we will gladly leave the czarina and it  major von winterfeld had been in russia before this and had wooed his fair malzahn there he is the same winterfeld whom we once saw dining by the wayside with the late friedrich wilhelm on that last reviewjourney his majesty made a captain in the potsdam giants at that time always in great favor with the late king and in still greater with the presentwho finds in him we can dimly discover and pretty much in him alone a soul somewhat like his own the one real peer he had about him a man of little education bred in camps yet of a proud natural eminency and rugged nobleness of genius and mind let readers mark this fiery herospirit lying buried in those dull books like lightning among clay here is another anecdote of his russian business  winterfeld had gone in friedrich wilhelms time with a party of prussian drillsergeants for petersburg year not given and duly delivered them there he naturally saw much of feldmarschall munnich naturally saw the stepdaughter of the feldmarschall a shining beauty in petersburg winterfeld himself a man of shining gifts and character and one of the handsomest tall men in the world mutual love between the fraulein and him was the rapid result but how to obtain marriage winterfeld cannot marry without leave had of his superiors you fair malzahn are hofdame of princess elizabeth all your fortune the jewels you wear and it is too possible she will not let you go  they agreed to be patient to be silent to watch warily till winterfeld got home to prussia till the fraulein malzahn could also contrive to get home winterfeld once home and the kings consent had the fraulein applied to princess elizabeth for leave of absence a few months to see my friends in deutschland your highness princess elizabeth looked hard at her answered evasively this and that at last being often importuned she answered plainly i almost feel convinced thou wilt never come back protestations from the fraulein were not wantingwell then said elizabeth if thou art so sure of it leave me thy jewels in pledge why not the poor fraulein could not say why had to leave her jewels which were her whole fine fortune worth 100000 rubles 20000 pounds and is now the brave wife of winterfeldbut could never by direct entreaty or circuitous interest and negotiation get back the least item of her jewels elizabeth as princess and as czarina was alike deaf on that subject now or henceforth that proved an impossible private enterprise for winterfeld though he had so easily succeeded in the public one retzow charakteristik des siebenjahrigen krieges berlin 1802 i 45 n  the new czarina was not unmerciful munnich and company were tried for life were condemned to die and did appear on the scaffold 29th january 1742 ready for that extreme penalty but were there on the sudden pardoned or halfpardoned by a merciful new czarina and sent to siberia and outer darkness whither bieren had preceded them to outer darkness also though a milder destiny had been intended them at first went anton ulrich and his household towards native germany at first they had got as far as riga on the way to germany but were detained there for a long while owing to suspicions to botta

this is the chetardielestoc conspiracy of 5th december 1741 the pitching up of princess elizabeth and the pitching down of anton ulrich and his munnichs who had before pitched bieren down after which matters remained more stationary at petersburg czarina elizabeth fat indolent soul floated with a certain native buoyancy with something of bulky steadiness in the turbid plunge of things and did not sink on the contrary her reign so called was prosperous though stupid her big dark countries kindled already into growth went on growing rather and for certain she herself went on growing in orthodox devotions of spiritual type and in strangely heterodox ditto of nonspiritual in indolent mansuetudes fell rages if you cut on the raws at all in perpetual incongruity and alas at last in brandyandwatertill as infame catin du nord she became terribly important to some persons  at her accession and for two years following czarina elizabeth in spite of real disinclination that way had a war on her hands the swedish war august 1741august 1743 which after long threatening on the swedish side had broken out into unwelcome actuality in anton ulrichs time and which could not with all the czarinas industry be got rid of or staved off sweden being bent upon the thing reason or no reason war not to be spoken of except on compulsion in the most voluminous history it was the unwisest of wars we should say and in practice probably the contemptiblest if there were not one other swedish war coming which vies with it in these particulars of which we shall be obliged to speak more or less at a future stage of this present russianswedish war having happily almost nothing to do with it we can except in the way of transient chronology refrain altogether from speaking or thinking  poor sweden since it shot karl xii in the trenches at fredericshall could not get a king again and is very anarchic under its phantasm king and free national palaversenate with subaltern houseswhich generally has french gold in its pocket and noise instead of wisdom in its head scandalous to think of or behold the french desirous to keep russia in play during these high belleisle adventures now on foot had after much egging bribing flattering persuaded vain sweden into this war with russia at narva they were 80000 we 8000 and what became of them cry the swedes always yes my friends but you had a captain at narva you had not yet shot your captain when you did narva faction of hats faction of caps that is nightcaps as being somnolent and disinclined to france and war seldom did a oncevaliant farshining nation sink to such depths since they shot their captain and said to anarchy thou art captaincy we see and the divine thing of the wars and businesses of such a set of mortals let us shun speaking where possible  mannstein gives impartial account pleasantly clear and compact to such as may be curious about this swedishrussian war and in the didactic point of view it is not without value to us the interesting circumstance is that it does not interfere with our silesian operations at all and may be figured as a mere accompaniment of rumbling discord or vacant faroff noise going on in those northern partsto which therefore we hope to be strangers in time coming here are some dates which the reader may take with him should they chance to illustrate anything  august 4th 1741 the swedes declare war will recover their lost portions of finland will c c they had long been meditating it they had turk negotiations going on diligent emissaries to the turk a certain major sinclair for one whom the russians waylaid and assassinated to get sight of his papers during the late turkrussian war but could conclude nothing while that was in activity concluded only after that was donestriking the iron when grown cold a chief point in their manifesto was the assassination of this sinclair scandal and atrocity of which there is no doubt now the russians were guilty various pretexts for the warprime movers to it practically were the french intent on keeping russia employed while their belleisle german adventure went on and who had even bargained with third parties to get up a war there as we shall see  september 3d 1741 at wilmanstrandkey of wyborg their frontier stronghold in finland which was under siegethe swedes about 5000 of them for they had nothing to live upon and lay scattered about in fractions made fight or skirmish against a russian attacking party swedes rather victorious on their hilltop rushed down and totally lost their bit of victory their wilmanstrand their wyborg and even the war itselffor this was in literal truth the only fighting done by them in the entire course of it which lasted near two years more the rest of it was retreat capitulation loss on loss without stroke struck till they had lost all finland and were like to lose sweden itselfdalecarlian mutiny bursting out ye traitors misgovernors worthy of death with invasive danes to rear of itand had to call in the very russians to save them from worse czarina elizabeth at the time of her accession six months after wilmanstrand had made truce was eager to make peace by no means answered sweden taking arms again or rather taking legs again and rushing ruinward at the old rate still without stroke  june 28th 1743 they did halt made peace of abo truce and preliminaries signed there that day peace itself august 17th czarina magnanimously restoring most of their finland thinking to herself not done enough for me yet cook it a little yetand settling who their next king

keith whom we saw at oczakow under munnich some time ago had a great deal of the work and management which was of a highly miscellaneous kind commanding fleets of gunboats and much else and readers of mannstein can still judgemuch more could king friedrich earnestly watching the affair itself as it went onwhether keith did not do it in a solid and quietly eminent and valiant manner sagacious skilful imperturbable without fear and without noise a man quietly ever ready he had quelled once walking direct into the heart of it a ferocious russian mutiny or uproar from below which would have ruined everything in few minutes more mannstein p 130 no date aprilmay 1742 he suffered with excellent silence now and afterwards much illusage from above withaltill friedrich himself in the third year hence was lucky enough to get him as general friedrichs sister ulrique the marriage of princess ulriquethat also as it chanced had something to do with this peace of abo but we anticipate too far     chapter ix  friedrich returns to silesia  friedrich stayed only three weeks at home moving about from berlin to potsdam to reinsberg and back all the gay world is in berlin at this carnival time but friedrich has more to do with business of a manifold and overearnest nature than with carnival gayeties french valori is here my fat valori who is beginning to be rather a favorite of friedrichs with excellency valori and with the other foreign excellencies there was diplomatic passaging in these weeks and we gather from valori in the inverse way valori fallen sulky that it was not ill done on friedrichs part he had some private consultation with the old dessauer too probably on military points thinks valori at least there was noticed more of the drillsergeant than before in his handling of the army when he returned to silesia continues the sulky one troops and generals did not know him againso excessively strict was he grown on the sudden and truly he got into details which were beneath not only a prince who has great views but even a simple captain of infantryaccording to my valoris military notions and experiences valori i 99  the truth is friedrich begins to see more clearly than he did with gloire dazzling him that his position is an exceedingly grave one full of risk in the then mood and condition of the world that he in the whole world has no sure friend but his army and that in regard to it he cannot be too vigilant the world is ominous to this youngest of the kings more than to another sounds as of general political earthquake grumble audibly to him from the deeps all europe likely in any event to get to loggerheads on this austrian pragmatic matter the nations all watching him to see what he will make of itfugleman he to the european nations just about bursting up on such an adventure it may be a glorious position or a not glorious but for certain it is a dangerous one and awfully solitary  fuglemen the world and its nations always have when simultaneously bent anywhither wisely or unwisely and it is natural that the most adventurous spirit take that post friedrich has not sought the post but following his own objects has got it and will be ignominiously lost and trampled to annihilation under the hoofs of the world if he do not mind to keep well aheadto be rapid as possible that were goodto step aside were still better and friedrich we find is very anxious for that would be content with the duchy of glogau and join austria but there is not the least chance that way his special envoy to vienna gotter and along with him borck the regular minister are come home all negotiation hopeless at vienna and nothing but indignant warpreparation going on there with the most animated diligence and more success than had seemed possible that is the law of friedrichs silesian adventure forward therefore on these terms others there are not waste no words friedrich recognizes to himself what the law is pushes stiffly forward with a fine silence on all that is not practical really with a fine steadiness of hope and audacity against discouragements of his anxieties which could not well be wanting but which it is royal to keep strictly under lock and key of these there is no hint to jordan or to anybody and only through accidental chinks on close scrutiny can we discover that they exist symptom of despondency of misgiving or repenting about his enterprise there is none anywhere friedrichs fine gifts of silence which go deeper than the lips are noticeable here as always and highly they availed friedrich in leading his life though now inconvenient to biographers writing of the same  it was not on matters of drill as valori supposes that friedrich had been consulting with the old dessauer this time it was on another matter friedrich has two next neighbors greatly interested none more so in the pragmatic question kursachsen polish king a foolish greedy creature who is extremely uncertain about his course in it and indeed always continued so now against friedrich now for him and again against and kurhanover our little george of england whose course is certain as that of the very stars and direct against friedrich at this time as indeed at all times not exceptional it is apt to be both these potentates must be attended to in ones absence method to be gentle but effectual the old dessauer to do itand this is what these consultings had turned upon and in a month or two readers and an astonished gazetteer world will see what comes of them  it was february 19th when friedrich left berlin the 21st he spends at glogau inspecting the blockade there and not ill content with the measures taken press that wallis all you can enjoins he hunger seems to be slow about it summon him again were your new artillery come up threaten with bombardment but spare the town if possible artillery is coming let us have done here and soon next day he arrives not at breslau as some had expected but at schweidnitz sidewards a strong little town at least an elaborately fortified of which we shall hear much in time coming it lies a days ride west of breslau and will be quieter for business than a big gazing capital would bewere breslau even ones own city which it is not though perhaps tending to be breslau is in transition circumstances at present a little uncertain whose it is under its munchows and new managers breslau he did not visit at all on this occasion to schweidnitz certain new regiments had been ordered there to be disposed of in reinforcing there in the count hobergs mansion he principally lodges for six weeks to come shooting out on continual excursions but always returning to schweidnitz as the centre again  algarotti home from turin not much of a success there but always melodious for talk had travelled with him algarotti and not long after jordan and maupertuis bear him company that the vacant moments too be beautiful we can fancy he has a very busy very anxious but not an unpleasant time he goes rapidly about visiting his postschiefly about the neisse valley neisse being the prime object were the weather once come for siegework he is in many towns specified in rodenbeck and the books but which may be anonymous here doubtless on many steeples and hilltops questioning intelligent natives diligently using his own eyes intent to make personal acquaintance with this new countrywhere little as he yet dreams of it the deadly struggles of his life lie waiting him and which he will know to great perfection before all is done  neisse lies deep enough in prussian environment like brieg like glogau strictly blockaded our posts thereabouts among the mountains thought to be impregnable nevertheless what new thing is this here are swarms of loose hussarpandour people wild austrian irregulars who come pouring out of glatz country disturbing the prussian posts towards that quarter and do not let us want for small war kleine krieg so called general browne it appears is got back to glatz at this early season he and a general lentulus busy there and these are the compliments they send a very troublesome set of fellows infesting ones purlieus in winged predatory fashion swooping down like a cloud of vulturous harpies on the sudden fierce enough if the chance favor then to wing again if it do not communication especially reconnoitring is not safe in their neighborhood prussian infantry even in small parties generally beats them prussian horse not but is oftener beatennot drilled for this rabble and their ways in pitched fight they are not dangerous rather are despicable to the disciplined man but can on occasion do a great deal of mischief  thus it was not long after friedrichs coming into these parts when he learnt with sorrow that a body of 500 horse and 500 foot or say it were only 300 of each kind which is the fact orlich i 79 oeuvres de frederic ii 68 had eluded our posts in the mountains and actually got into neisse the foot will be of little consequence writes friedrich but the horse which will disturb our communications are a considerable mischief this was on the 5th of march and about a week before on the 27th of february there had wellnigh a far graver thing befallennamely the capture of friedrich himself and the sudden end of all these operations     skirmish of baumgarten 27th february 1741  in most of the anecdotebooks there used to figure and still does insisting on some belief from simple persons a wonderful story in very vague condition how once in the silesian wars the king in those upper neisse regions in the wartha district between glatz and neisse was one day within an inch of being takenclouds of hussars suddenly rising round him as he rode reconnoitring with next to no escort only an adjutant or so in attendance how he shot away keeping well in the shade and erelong whisked into a convent or abbey the beautiful abbey of kamenz in those parts and found tobias stusche excellent abbot of the place to whom he candidly disclosed his situation how the excellent tobias thereupon instantly ordered the bells to be rung for a mass extraordinary monks not knowing why and after bells made his appearance in high costume much to the wonder of his monks with a second abbot also in high costume but of shortish stature whom they never saw before or after which two abbots or at least tobias proceeded to do the socalled divine office there and then letting loose the big chant especially and the growl of organs in a singularly expressive manner how the pandours arrived in clouds meanwhile entered in searching parties more or less reverent of the mass searched high and low but found nothing and were obliged to take tobiass blessing at last and go their ways how the second abbot thereupon swore eternal friendship with tobias in the private apartments and rode off asas a rescued majesty determined to be more cautious in pandour countries for the future hildebrandt anekdoten i 17 pandour proper is a footsoldier tall rawboned illwashed biped in copious turk breeches rather barish in the top parts of him carries a very long musket and has several pistols and butchersknives stuck in his girdle specifically a footman but readers will permit me to use him withal as here in the generic sensewhich story as to the body of it is all myth though as is oftenest the case there lies in it some soul of fact too the historybooks which had not much heeded the little fact would have nothing to do with this account of it nevertheless the people stuck to their myth so that dryasdust in punishment for his sinful blindness to the human and divine significance of facts was driven to investigate the business and did at last victoriously bring it home to the small occurrence now called skirmish of baumgarten which had nearly become so great in the history of the worldto the following effect  there are two valleys with roads that lead from that southwest quarter of silesia towards glatz each with a little town at the end of it looking up into it wartha the name of the one silberberg that of the other through the wartha valley which is southernmost young neisse river comes rushing downthe blue mountains thereabouts very pretty on a clear spring day says my touring friend both at wartha and at silberberg the little town which looks into the mouth of the northernmost valley the prussians have a post old derschau malplaquet derschau with headquarters at frankenstein some seven or eight miles nearer schweidnitz has not failed in that precaution friedrich wished to visit silberberg and wartha set out accordingly 27th february with small escort carelessly as usual the pandour people had wind of it knew his habits on such occasions and gliding through other roadless valleys under an adventurous captain had determined to whirl him off and they were in fact not far from succeeding had not a mistake happened  silberberg and wartha the southernmost which stands upon the neisse river rushing out there into the plainer country are each about seven or eight miles from frankenstein the headquarters and there are relays of posts capable of supporting one another all the way from frankenstein to each friedrich rode to silberberg first examined the post found it right then rode across to wartha seven or eight miles southward examined wartha likewise after which he sat down to dinner in that little town with an officer or two for companyhaving i suppose found all right in both the posts in the way hither he had made some change in the relay arrangements which at first involved some diminution of his own escort and then some marching about and redistributing so that externally it seemed as if the principal relayparty were now marching on baumgarten an intermediate villageat least so the pandour captain understands the movements going on and crouches into the due thickets in consequence not doubting but the king himself is for baumgarten and will be at hand presently principal relayparty a squadron of schulenburgs dragoons with a stupid major over them is not quite got into baumgarten when with horrible cries the pandour captain with about 500 horse plunges out of cover direct upon the throat of it and friedrich at wartha is but just begun dining when tumult of distant musketry breaks in upon him with friedrich himself at this time as i count there might be 150 horse in wartha post itself are at least forty hussars and fifty foot by no means nothing but a single adjutant as the myth bears  the stupid major ought to have beaten this rabble though above two to one of him but he could not though he tried considerably on the contrary he was himself beaten obliged to make off leaving ten dragoons killed sixteen prisoners one standard and two kettledrumsvictory and all this plunder ye pandour gentry but evidently no king the pandour gentry on the instant made off too alarm being abroad got into some sidevalley with their prisoners and drumandstandard honors and vanished from view of mankind  friedrich had started from dinner got his escort under way with the forty hussars and the fifty foot and what small force was attainable and hurried towards the scene he did see by the road another strongish party of pandours dashed them across the neisse river out of sightbut getting to

favors in coming years a worthy abbot deserving promotion on general grounds and master of a convent very picturesque but twelve miles from the present scene of action     aspects of breslau  friedrich avoided visiting breslau probably for the reasons above given though there are important interests of his there especially his chief magazine and issues of moment are silently working forward here are contemporary excerpts in abridged form which are authentic and of significance to a lively reader  breslau middle of january 1741 the prussian envoy herr von gotter had appeared here returning from vienna gotter and then borck who made no secret in breslau society that not the slightest hope of a peaceable result existed as society might have flattered itself but that war and battle would have to decide this matter a saxon ambassador was also here waiting some time message thought to be insignificantprobably some vague admonitory stuff again from kursachsen polish king son of august the strong a very insignificant man who acts as reichsvicarius in those northern parts for the reader is to know there are reichsvicars more than one nay more than two on this occasion with considerable jarring going on about them and i could say much about their dignities limits duties adelung ii 143 c kohler reichshistorie pp 585589if indeed there were any duties except dramatic ones but the reich itself and vicarship along with it are fallen into a nearly imaginary condition and the regensburg diet not princes now but mere delegates of princes mostly bombazine people which ever since 1663 has sat continual instead of now and then is become an enchanted piggery strange to look upon under those earnest stars as king friedrich did not call at greslau after those neisse bombardments but rolled past straight homewards the three excellencies all departedborck and gotter to berlin the saxon home again with his insignificant message  january 19th schwerin too was here in the course of the winter to see how the magazines and other warpreparations were going on breslau outwardly and inwardly is whirling with business and offers phenomena for instance it is known that the armychest heaps of silver and gold in it lies in the scultet gardenhouse where the king lodged and that only one sentry walks there and that in the guardhouse itself which is some way off there

said gardenhouse and armychest perhaps this rumor sprang of its own accordor perhaps not quite it had been very rife and ran high not without remonstrances in townhall and the like which we can imagine issue was the officer on post at scultets loaded his treasure in carts conveyed it that same night to the interior of the city in fact to the oberamtshaus governmenthouse that waswhich doubtless was a step in the right direction for now the two feldkriegscommissariat gentlemen one of whom is the expert munchow son of our old custrin friend supreme prussian authorities here do likewise shift out of their inns and take old schaffgotschs apartments in the same oberamtshaus mutely symbolling that perhaps they are likely to become a kind of government and the reader can conceive how in such an element the function of governing would of itself fall more and more into their hands they were consummately polite discreet friendly towards all people and did in effect manage their business taxgatherings in money and in kind with a perfection and precision which made the evil a minimum  february 17th this day also there arrived at breslau by boat up the oder ten heavy cannon three mortars and ammunition of powder bombshells balls as much as loaded fifty wagons the whole of which were in like manner forwarded to ohlau this day as on other days before and after

necessity as being outside the walls especially as the reverend fathers have mostly glided into corners and left the place vacant in the domisland it certainly is and such a stockall bought for money

avoidance of harsh manner  februarymarch considerable recruiting in schlesien six hundred recruits have enlisted in breslau alone also his prussian majesty has sent a supply of protestant preachers ordained for the occasion to minister where neededwhich is piously acknowledged as a godsend in various parts of silesia twelve came first all berliners soon afterwards others from different parts till in the end there were about sixty in all rigorous punctilious avoidance of offence to the catholic minorities or of whatever least thing silesian law does not permit is enjoined upon them to preach in barns or townhalls where by law you have no church their salary is about 30 pounds a year they are all put under supervision of the chaplain of margraf karls regiment a judicious chaplain i have no doubt and fit to be a bishop and so far as appears mere benefit is got of them by schlesien as well as by friedrich in this function friedrich is careful to keep the balance level between catholic and protestant but it has hung at such an angle for a long while past in general we observe the catholic dignitaries and the zealous or fanatic of that creed especially the jesuits are apt to be against him as for the nonfanatic they expect better government secular advantage these latter weigh doubtfully and with less weight whichever way in the general population who are protestant he recognizes friendsand has sent them sixty preachers which by law was their due long since here follow two little traits comic or tragicomic with which we can conclude  detached jesuit parties here and there seem to have mischief in hand in a small way encouraging deserters and the likeand we keep an eye on them no discontent elsewhere at least none audible on the contrary much enlisting on the part of the silesian youth with other good symptoms but in the dom there is singular to say a goblin found walking one nightadvancing not with airs from heaven upon the prussian sentry there the prussian

petersburg of a detestable project orlich i 83 scrap of note to old dessauer no date allowed us early in marchproject for partitioning the prussian kingdom no less for fairly cutting into friedrich and paring him down to the safe pitch as an enemy to pragmatic and mankind they say a treaty draught of a treaty for that express object is now ready and lies at petersburg only waiting signature here

majesty calculating cause and effect had despatched to her with that view in the dead of winter lately to whom she has given eardismissing her munnich as we saw aboveand is ready for signing or perhaps has signed oeuvres de frederic ii 68 friedrichs astonishment on hearing of this detestable project was great however he takes his measures on itright lucky that he has the old dessauer and machinery for acting on kursachsen and the britannic majesty get your machinery in gear is naturally his first order and the old dessauer does it with effect of which by and by  never did i hear before or since of such a plunge into the muddy unfathomable on the part of little george who was an honorable creature and dubitative to excess and truly this rash plunge might have cost him dear had not he directly scrambled out again or did friedrich exaggerate to himself his uncles real share in the matter i always guess there had been more of loose talk of hypothesis and fond hope in regard to georges share than of determinate fact or procedure on his own part the transaction having had to be dropped on the sudden remains somewhat dark but in substance it is not doubtful tindal xx 497 and

too likely but even in that case the poor english would have gone upon their necessary spanish war by the direct road and with their eyes open instead of somnambulating and stumbling over the chimneytops and the settlement might have come far sooner and far cheaper to mankindnay we are to admit that the new place for silesia was likewise the place appointed it by just heaven and friedrichs

the other day had accident favoredand have thrown reinforcement of 600 into neisse friedrich is not insensible to these things and amid such alarms from far and from near is becoming eager to have at least glogau in his hand glogau he is of opinion could now and should straightway be done  glogau is not a strong place after all the repairing it could stand little siege were we careless of hurting it but wallis is obstinate refuses free withdrawal will hold out to the uttermost though his meal is running low he pretends there is relief coming relief just at hand and once in midnight time lets off a rocket and fires six guns alarming prince leopold as if relief were just in the neighborhood a tough industrious military man stiff to his purpose and not without shift  friedrich thinks the place might be had by assault open trenches set your batteries going which need not injure the town need only alarm wallis and terrify it then under cover of this noise and feint of cannonading storm with vigor leopold the young dessauer is cautious wants petards if he must storm wants two new battalions if he must open trencheshe gets these requisites and is still cunctatory friedrich has himself got the notion from clear intelligence true or not that relief to glogau is actually on way and under such imminences russian and other in so ticklish a state of the world he becomes more and more impatient that this thing were done in the first week of march still hurrying about on inspectionbusiness he writes from four or five different places mollwitz near brieg is one of them a village we

5th march the third or fourth impatient note he has sent and adds just while quitting mollwitz for ohlau this postscript in his own hand  ps i am sorry you have not understood me they have in bohmen a regular enterprise on hand for the rescue of glogau i have infantry enough to meet them but cavalry is quite wanting you must therefore without delay begin the siege let us finish there i pray you

vocal on leopolds part will answer  ohlau 6th march as i am certainly informed that the enemy will make some attempt i hereby with all distinctness command that so soon as the petards are come which

blame of all the mischief that might arise out of longer delay must lie on you alone ib i 71  goltz arrived with this emphatic piece tuesday evening after his course of seventy miles this did at last rouse our cautious young dessauer and so there is next obtainable on much compression the following authentic excerpt  glogau 8th march 1741 his durchlaucht the prince leopold summoned all the generals at noon and informed them that this very night glogau must be won he gave them their instructions in writing where each was to post himself with what detachments how to proceed there are to

ensigncy one of them or what else they were fit for grenadiers of glasenapp these are the men friedrich heard swearingin under his window one memorable morning when he burst into tears at halfpast

even is generally glad prussian discipline being so perfect and ingress now free for the necessaries of life there was no plundering not the least insult no townsman was hurt not even in houses where soldiers had tried firing from windows the prussian battalions rendezvous in the marketplace and go peaceably about their patrolling and other business and meddle with nothing else they lost in killed

but was notin retaliation for some severity of general brownes in the interim picking up of two silesian noblemen suspected of prussian tendency and locking them in brunn over the hillsand had to go to berlin till that was repaired to the wounded artillerygeneral there was every tenderness shown but he died in few daysthe other prisoners were marched to the custrinstettin quarter and many of them took prussian service  and this is the scalade of glogau a shining feat of those days which had great rumor in the gazettes and over all the then feverish nations though it has now fallen dim again as feats do its importance at that time its utility to friedrichs affairs was undeniable and it filled friedrich with the highest satisfaction and with admiration to overflowing done 9th march 1741 in one hour the very earliest of the day  goltz posted back to schweidnitz with the news got thither about 5 pm and was received naturally with open arms friedrich in person marched out next morning to make feudejoie and tedeumingthere was royal letter to leopold which flamed through all the newspapers and can still be read in innumerable books letter omissible in this place we remark only how punctual the king is to reward in money as well as praise and not the high only but the low that had deserved to prince leopold he presents 2000 pounds to each private soldier who had been of the storm say half a guineadoubling and quadrupling in the special cases to as high as twenty guineas of our present money to the old gazetteers and their readers everywhere this of glogau is a very effulgent business bursting out on them like sudden budelight in the uncertain stagnancy and expectancy of mankind friedrich himself writes of it to the old dessauer  the more i think of the glogau business the more important i find it prince leopold has achieved the prettiest military stroke die schonste action that has been done in this century from my heart i congratulate you on having such a son in boldness of resolution in plan in execution it is alike admirable and quite gives a turn to my affairs date 13th march 1741 orlich i 77  and indeed it is a perfect example of prussian discipline and military quality in all kinds such as it would be difficult to match elsewhere most potently correct coming out everywhere with the completeness and exactitude of mathematics and has in it such a fund of martial fire not only ready to blaze out which can be exampled elsewhere but capable of bottling itself in and of lying silently ready which is much rarer and very essential in soldiering due a little to the old dessauer may we not say as well as to the young friedrich wilhelm is fallen silent but his heavy labors and military and other drillings to prussian mankind still speak with an audible voice  about three weeks after this of glogau leopold the old dessauer over in brandenburg does another thing which is important to friedrich and of great rumor in the world steps out namely with a force of 36000 men horse foot and artillery completely equipped in all points and takes camp at this early season at a place called gottin not far from magdeburg handy at once for saxony and for hanover and continues there encampedmerely for review purposes readers can figure what an astonishment it was to kursachsen and british george and how it struck the wind out of their russian partitiondream and awoke them to a sense of the awful factcapable of being slit in pieces and themselves partitioned at a days warning as it were it was on april 2d that leopold with the first division of the 36000 planted his flag near gottin no doubt it was the detestable project that had brought him out at so early a season for tentlife and nobody could then guess why he steadily paraded here all summer keeping his 36000 well in drill since there was nothing else needed of him  the camp at gottin flamed greatly abroad through the timorous imaginations of mankind that year and in the newspapers are many details of it and besides the important general fact there is still one little point worth special mention namely that old fieldmarshal katte father of poor lieutenant katte whom we knew was of it and perhaps even got his death by it chief commander of the cavalry here such honor had he but died at his post in a couple of months at rekahn may 31st militairlexikon ii 254 poor old gentleman perhaps unequal to the hardships of fieldlife at so early a season of the year     friedrich takes the field with some pomp goes into the mountainsbut comes fast back  at glogau there was homaging on the very morrow after the storm on the second day the superfluous regiments marched off no want of vigorous activity to settle matters on their new footing there general kalkstein friedrichs old tutor whom readers have forgotten again is to be commandant of glogau an office of honor which can be done by deputy except in cases of real stress the place is to be thoroughly newfortifiedwhich important point they commit to engineer wallrave a strongheaded heavybuilt dutch officer long since acquired to the service on account of his excellence in that line who did now and afterwards a great deal of excellent engineering for friedrich but for himself being of deep stomach withal and of life too dissolute made a tragic thing of it ultimately as will be seen if we have leisure  in seven or eight days prince leopold having wound up his glogau affairs and completed the new preliminaries there joins the king at schweidnitz in the highest favor as was natural kalkstein is to take a main hand in the siege of neisse for which operation it is hoped there will soon be weather if not favorable yet supportable what of the force was superfluous at glogau had at once marched off as we observed and is now getting redistributed where needful there is much shifting about strengthening of posts giving up of posts the whole of which readers shall imagine for themselvesexcept only two points that are worth remembering first that kalkstein with about 12000 takes post at grotkau some twentyfive miles north of neisse ready to move on and open trenches when required and second that holsteinbeck gets posted at frankenstein chief place of that baumgarten skirmish say thirtyfive miles westbynorth of neisse and has some 8 or 10000 horse and foot thereabouts spread up and downwho will be much wanted and not procurable on an occasion that is coming  friedrich has given up the jablunka pass called in the jablunka and remoter posts anxious to concentrate before the enemy get nigh that is the kings notion and surely a reasonable one the area of the prussian army as i guess it from the maps being above 2000 square miles beginning at breslau only and leaving out glogau schwerin thinks differently but without good basis both are agreed the austrian army cannot take the field till the forage come till the new grass spring which its cavalry find convenient that is the fair supposition but in that both are mistaken and schwerin the more dangerously of the twomeanwhile the pandour swarms are observably getting rifer and of stormier quality and they seem to harbor farther to the east than formerly and not to come all out of glatz which perhaps are symptomatic circumstances the worst effect of these preliminary pandour clouds is your scoutservice cannot live among them they hinder reconnoitring and keep the enemy veiled from you of that sore mischief friedrich had first and last ample experience at their hands this is but the first instalment of pandours to friedrich and the mere foretaste of what they can do in the veiling way  behind the mountains in this manner all is inane darkness to friedrich and schwerin they know only that neipperg is rendezvousing at olmutz and judge that he will still spend many weeks upon it the real facts being that neippergwho arrived in olmutz on the 10th of march the very day while glogau was homaginghas been he and those above him and those under him driving preparations forward at a furious rate that neipperg heldi think at steinberg his hithermost post some twenty miles hither of olmutza council of war all the generals and even lentulus from glatz present at it day not given where the unanimous decision was march straightway save neisse since glogau is goneand in fine that on the 26th neipperg took the road accordingly in spite of furious snow blowing in his face and is ever since 30000 strong says rumor but perhaps 10000 of them mere pandours unweariedly climbing the mountains laboriously jingling forward with his heavy guns and ammunitionwagons contending with the steep snowy icy roads intent upon saving neisse this is the fact profoundly unknown to friedrich and schwerin who will be much surprised when it becomes patent to them at the wrong time  schweidnitz 27th march this day friedrich with considerable apparatus pomp and processional cymballing greatly the reverse of his ulterior use and wont in such cases quitted schweidnitz and his algarottis solemnly opening campaign in this manner and drove off for ottmachau having work there for tomorrow  the siege of neisse is now to proceed forthwith trenches to be opened april 4th friedrich is still of opinion that his posts lie too wide apart that especially schwerin who is spread among the hills in jagerndorf country ought to come down and take closer order for covering the siege oeuvres de frederic ii 70 schwerin answers that if the king will spare him a reinforcement of eight squadrons and nine battalions say 1200 horse 9000 foot he will maintain himself where he is and no enemy shall get across the mountains at all that is schwerins notion who surely is something of a judge friedrich assents will himself conduct the reinforcement to schwerin and survey matters with his own eyes up yonder friedrich marches from ottmachau accordingly 29th marchkalkstein holsteinbeck and others are to be rendezvoused before neisse in the interim trenches ready for opening on the sixth day henceand in this manner climbs these mountains and sees jagerndorf country for the first time  beautiful blue world of hills ridge piled on ridge behind that neisse region fruitful valleys lapped in them with grim stone castles and busy little towns disclosing themselves as we advance that is jagerndorf countrywhich uncle george of anspach hundreds of years ago purchased with his own money which we have now come to lay hold of as his heir friedrich i believe thinks little of all this and does not remember uncle george at all but such are the facts and the country regarded or not is very blue and beautiful with the spring sun shining on it or with the sudden spring storms gathering wildly on the peaks as if for permanent investiture but vanishing again straightway leaving only a powdering of snow  he met schwerin at neustadt halfway to jagerndorf whither they proceeded next day what news have you of the enemy was friedrichs first question schwerin has no news whatever only that the enemy is far off hanging in long thin straggle from olmutz westward i have a spy out said schwerin but he has not returned yetnor ever will he might have added if diligent readers will now take to their map and attend day by day an invincible predecessor has compelled what next follows into human intelligibility and into the diary form for their behoofreaders of an idler turn can skip but this confused hurryscurry of marches issues in something which all will have to attend to  jagerndorf 2d april 1741 this is the day when the old dessauer makes appearance with the first brigades of his camp at gottin friedrich is satisfied with what he has seen of jagerndorf matters and intends returning towards neisse there to commence on the 4th he is giving his final orders and on the point of setting off whenseven austrian deserters dragoons of lichtenstein come in and report that neippergs army is within a few miles and scarcely had they done answering and explaining when sounds rise of musketry and cannon from our outposts on that side intimating that here is neippergs army itself seldom in his life was friedrich in an uglier situation in jagerndorf an open town are only some three or four thousand men with three fieldpieces and as much powder as will charge them forty times happily these proved only the pandour outskirts of neippergs army scouring about to reconnoitre and not difficult to beat the real body of it is ascertained to be at freudenthal fifteen miles to westward southwestward making towards neisse it is guessed by the other or western road which is the nearer to glatz and to the austrian force there  had neipperg known what was in jagerndorf but he does not know he marches on next morning at his usual slow rate wide clouds of pandours accompanying and preceding him skirmishing in upon all places upon jagerndorf for instance though fifteen miles wide of their road to ascertain if prussians are there one can judge whether friedrich and schwerin were thankful when the huge alarm produced nothing the mountain as friedrich says gave birth to a mousenay it was a mouse of essential vital use to friedrich and schwerin a warning that they must instantly collect themselves men and goods and begone one and all out of these parts doublequick towards neisse not now with the hope of besieging neissefar from thatbut of getting their widescattered posts together thereabouts and escaping destruction in detail  april 4th headquarters neustadt by violent exertion with the sacrifice only of some remote little storehouses all is rendezvoused at jagerndorf within two days and this day they march king and vanguard reaching neustadt some twentyfive miles forward some twenty still from neisse at neustadt the posts that had stood in that neighborhood are all assembled and march with the king tomorrow of neipperg except by transitory contact with his pandour clouds they have seen nothing his road is pretty much parallel to theirs and some fifteen miles leftward glatzward goes through zuckmantel ziegenhals

twitchings of your cloak with standanddeliver as you cross those wild mountain spaces zeiller beschreibung des konigreichs boheim frankfurt 1650a rather worthless old book like the rest of zeillers in that kind neippergs men are wearied with the long climb out of mahren and he struggles towards neisse as the first objectholding upon glatz and lentulus with his left numerous orders have been speeded from the kings quarters at jagerndorf and here at neustadt order especially to holsteinbeck at frankenstein and to kalkstein at grotkau how they are to unite first with one another and then to cross neisse river and unite with the kingto which end there is already a bridge laid for them or about to be laid in good time  april 5th headquarters steinau steinau is a little town twenty miles east of neisse on the road to kosel strongish place on the oder some forty miles farther east here friedrich with the main body take their quarters rearguard being still at neustadt temporary bridge there is ready or all but ready at sorgau twelve miles to north of us on our left by this kalkstein with his 10000 comes punctually across while other brigades from the kosel side are also punctual in getting in which is a great comfort but of holsteinbeck there is no vestige nor did there ever appear any holstein whom none of the repeated orders sent him could reach says friedrich remained comfortably in his quarters and looked at the enemy rushing past him to right and left without troubling his head with them oeuvres de frederic ii 70 the too easyminded holstein austrian deserters inform us that general neipperg arrived today with his army in neisse and has there been joined by lentulus with the glatz force chiefly cavalry a good many thousands we may be attacked then this very night if they are diligent friedrich marks out ground and plan in such case and how and where each is to rank himself there came nothing of attack but the poor little village of steinau with so many troops in it and baggagedrivers stumbling about takes fire burns to ashes and we had great difficulty in saving the artillery and powder through the narrow streets with the houses all burning on each hand fancy itand the poor shrieking inhabitants gone to silence long since with their shrieks not the least whisper left of them the prussians bivouac on the field each in the place that has been marked out night extremely cold  in this poor steinau was a schloss which also went up in fire disclosing certain mysteries of an almost mythical nature to the german public it was the schloss of a grafin von callenberg a dreadful old dowager of medeamessalina type who always wore pistols about her pistols and latterly with more and more constancy a brandybottlewho has been much on the tongues of men for a generation back herr nussler readers recollect shifty nussler knew her in the way of business at one time with pity if also with horror some weeks ago she was by the austrian commandant at neisse summoned out of this schloss as in correspondence with prussian officers peasants breaking in tied her with ropes to the bed where she was put bed and her into a farmcart and in that scandalous manner delivered her at neisse to the commandant by which adventure and its rages and unspeakabilities the poor old callenberg is since dead and now the very schloss is dead and there is finis to a human dustvortex such as is sometimes noisy for a time perhaps nussler may again pass that way if we wait busching beitrage ii273 et seqq  april 6th headquarters friedland to friedland on the 6thand do not as expected get away next morning friedland is ten miles down the neisse which makes a bend of near ninety degrees opposite steinau and runs thence straight north for the oder which it reaches some dozen miles or more above brieg both steinau and friedland are a good distance from the river friedland the nearer of the two with sorgau bridge direct west of it is perhaps eight miles from that important structure there being now tolerably rendezvoused and in strength for action friedrich purposes to cross neisse river tomorrow hoping perhaps to meet holsteinbeck and incorporate him anxious at any rate to get between the austrians and ohlau where his heavy artillery his ammunition not to mention other indispensables are lying the peculiarity of neipperg at this time is that the ground he occupies bears no proportion to the ground he commands his regular horse are supposed to be the best in the world and of the pandour kind who live horse and man mainly upon nothing which means upon theft his supplies are unlimited he sits like a volcanic reservoir therefore not like a common fire of such and such intensity and power to burncasts the ashes of him on all sides to many miles distance  friday 7th april friedland still headquarters unluckily on trying there is no passage to be had at sorgau the officer on charge there still holds the bridge but has been obliged to break away the farther end of it lentulus and dragoons several thousands strong such is the report having taken post there friedrich commands that the bridge be reinstated fieldpieces to defend it prince leopold to cross and clear the ways all friday friedrich waiting at friedland was spent in these details leopold in due force started for sorgau himself with cavalry in the van leopold did storm across and go charging and fencing some space on the other side but seeing that it was in truth lentulus and dragoons without limit had to send report accordingly and then to wind himself to this side again on new order from the king what is to be done then here is no crossing friedrich decides to go down the river he himself to lowen perhaps near twenty miles farther down but where there is a bridge and highway leading over prince leopold with the heavier divisions and baggages to michelau some miles nearer and there to build his pontoons and cross which was effected with success and so  saturday 8th april with great punctuality the king and leopold met at michelau both well across the neisse here on pontoons leopold had got across about noon and precisely as he was finishing the kings column which had crossed at lowen and come up the left bank again arrived the king much content with leopolds behavior nominates him general of infantry a stage higher in promotion there and then brieg blockade is as natural given up the blockading body joining with the king this morning while he passed that way from holsteinbeck not the least whispernor to him if we knew it  neipperg has quitted neisse but walks invisible within clouds of pandours nothing but guessing as to neippergs motions rightly swift and awake to his business neipperg might have done might still do a stroke upon us here but he takes it easy marches hardly five miles a day since he quitted neisse again from michelau friedrich for his part turns southwestward in quest of holstein and other interests marches towards grotkau not intending much farther that night thick snow blowing in their faces nothing to be seen ahead the prussian column tramps along oeuvres de frederic ii 156 in leipe a little hamlet sidewards of the road short way from grotkau our hussar vanguard had found austrian hussars captured forty and from them learned that the austrian army is in grotkau that they took grotkau half an hour before and are there a poor lieutenant mitschepfal whom i think friedrich used to know in reinsberg lay in grotkau with some sixty recruits and deserters says friedrichand with several hundreds of camplaborers intended for the trenches which will not now be openedmitschepfal made a stout defence but after three hours of it had to give in and there is nothing now for us at grotkau halt therefore neipperg is evidently pushing towards ohlau towards breslau though in a leisurely way there it will behoove us to get the start of him if humanly possible to the right about therefore without delay the prussians repass leipe much to the wonder of its simple people get along some seven miles farther on the road for ohlau and quarter that night in what handy villages there are the kings corps in two villages which he calls pogrel and alsenwhich are to be found still on the map as pogarell and alzenau on the road from lowen towards ohlau  this is the end of that march into the mountains with neisse siege hanging triumphant ahead these are the kings quarters this wintry spring night saturday 8th april 1741 and it is to be guessed there is more of care than of sleep provided for him there seldom in his life was friedrich in a more critical position and he well knows it none better and could have his remorses upon itwere these of the least use in present circumstances here

nothing for it but to sit quiet the king makes all his dispositions sketches out punctually to the last item where each is to station himself how the army is to advance in four columns ready for neipperg wherever he may betowards ohlau at any rate whither it is not doubted neipperg is bent these snowy sixandthirty hours at pogarell were probably since the custrin time the most anxious of friedrichs life  neipperg for his part struggles forward a few miles this sunday april 9th the prussians rest under shelter in the wild weather neippergs headquarters this night are a small village or hamlet called mollwitz there and in the adjacent hamlets chiefly in laugwitz and gruningen his army lodges itselfhe is now fairly got between us and ohlauif in the blowing drift we knew it or he knew it but in this confusion of the elements neither party knows of the other neipperg has appointed that tomorrow monday 10th shall be a restdayappointment which could by no means be kept as it turned out  friedrich had despatched messengers to ohlau that the force there should join him messengers are all captured the like message had already gone to brieg some days before and the blockading body a

modest brief effective from private diaries and the like many of them given also in seyfarth well worth perusal by the studious military man and creditably characteristic of the prussian writers of them and actors in them  of the battle of mollwitz as indeed of all friedrichs battles there are ample accounts new and old of perfect authenticity and scientific exactitude so that in regard to military points the due clearness is on study completely attainable but as to personal or human details we are driven back upon a miscellany of sources most of which indeed all of which except nicolai when he sparingly gives us anything are of questionable nature and without intending to be dishonest do run out into the mythical and require to be used with caution the latest and notablest of these in regard to mollwitz is the pamphlet of a dr fuchs from which in spite of its amazing quality we expect to glean a serviceable item here and there jubelschrift zur feier centenary der schlacht bei mollwitz 10 april 1741 von dr medicinae fuchs brieg 10th april 1841 it is definable as probably the most chaotic pamphlet ever written and in many places by dint of uncorrected printing bad grammar bad spelling bad sense and in short of intrinsic darkness in so vivacious a humor it has become abstruse as sanscrit and really is a sharp test of what knowledge you otherwise have of the subject might perhaps be used in that way by the examining military boards in prussia and elsewhere if no other use lie in it fuchss own contributions mere ignorance folly and credulity are not worth interpreting but he has printed and in the same abstruse form one or two curious parish manuscripts particularly a history of this war privately jotted down by the then schoolmaster of mollwitz a good simple accurate old fellowcreature through whose eyes it is here and there worth while to look in regard to fuchs himself a late tourist says  this centenarycelebration pamphlet celebration itself so obtuse was the country did not take effect was by a zealous noisy but not wise old medical gentleman of these parts called dr fuchs fox who had set his heart on raising by subscription a proper national monument on the field of mollwitz and so closing his old career subscriptions did not take in that april 1841 nor in the following months or twelvemonths the zealous doctor therefore indignantly drew his own purse got a big obelisk of granite hewn ready with suitable inscription on it carted his big obelisk from the quarries of strehlen assembled the country round it on mollwitz field and passionately discoursed and pleaded that at least the country should bring blockandtackle with proper framework and set up this obelisk on the pedestal he had there built for it the country listened cheerfully for the old doctor was a popular man clever though flighty but the country was again obtuse in the way of active furtherance and would not even bring blockandtackle the old doctor had to answer well then and go on his way on more serious errands the cattle have much undermined and rubbed down his poor pedestal which is of rubblework his obelisk still lies mournfully horizontal uninjuredand really ought to be set up by some parishrate or effort of the community otherwise tourists note brieg 1858  from the old mollwitz schoolmaster we distil the following  mollwitz sunday 9th april country for two days back was in new alarm by the austrian garrison of brieg now left at liberty who sallied out upon the villages about and plundered blackcattle sheep grain and whatever they could come at but this day sunday in mollwitz the whole austrian army was upon us first there went 300 hussars through the village to gruningen who quartered themselves there and rushed hither and thither into houses robbing and plundering from one they took his best horses from another they took linen clothes and other furnitures and victual general neuburg neipperg halted here at mollwitz with the whole army before the village in mind to quarter and quarter was settled so that a bauer ploughfarmer got four to five companies to lodge and a gartner spadefarmer two or three hundred cavalrythe houses were full of officers the garte garths and the fields full of horsemen and baggage and all round you saw nothing but fires burning the zaune wooden railings were instantly torn down for firewood the hay straw barley and haver were eaten away and brought to nothing and everything from the barns was carried out and as the whole army could not lodge itself with us 1100 infantry quartered at laugwitz barzdorf got 400 cavalry and this day nobody knew what would come of it extract in fuchs p 6  monday morning the prussians are up betimes king friedrich as above noted had not or had hardly at all slept during those two nights such his anxieties this morning all is calm sleeked out into spotless white pogarell and the world are wrapt as in a windingsheet near two feet of snow

old schoolmasters account of a small thing  austrian dragoon of the regiment althan native of kriesewitz in this neighborhood who was billeted in christopher schonwitzs had been much in want of a clean shirt and other interior outfit and had last night imperatively despatched the man scholzke a farmservant of the said christophers off to his the dragoons father in kriesewitz to procure such shirt or outfit and to return early with the same under penalty ofscholzke and his master dare not think under what penalty scholzke floundering homewards with the outfit from kriesewitz flounders at

his majesty  at break of day the ranking and arranging began pogarell clock is near striking ten when the last squadron or battalion quits pogarell and the four columns punctiliously correct are all under way two on each side of ohlau highway steadily advancing with pioneers ahead to clear any obstacle there may be few obstacles here and there a little ditch where ploschkes advice may be good

dusty fractions of villages more than one two miles or more from mollwitz we come to pampitz on our left the next considerable if any of them can be counted considerable  all these dorfs and indeed most german ones says my tourist are made on one type an agglomerate of dusty farmyards with their stalls and barns all the farmyards huddled together in two rows a broad negligent road between seldom mended never swept except by the elements generally there is nothing to be seen on each hand but thatched roofs dead clay walls and rude wooden gates sometimes a poor publichouse with probable beer in it never any shop nowhere any patch of swept pavement or trim gatheringplace for natives of a social gossipy turn the road lies sleepy littery good only for utilitarian purposes in the middle of the village stands church and churchyard with probably some gnarled trees around it church often larger than you expected the churchyard always fenced with high stoneandmortar wall is usually the principal military post of the place mollwitz at the present day has something of whitewash here and there one of the farmer people or more wearing a civilized prosperous look the belfry offers you a

and successive anxious sputterings from the steepletops of brieg are hastily reported what can it mean means little perhapsneipperg sends out a hussar party to ascertain and composedly sets himself to

forward at their swiftest the austrian army might have been cut in pieces here and never have got together to try battle at all but rothenburg had no orders nay had orders not to get into fightingnor had friedrich himself in this his first battle learned that feline or leonine promptitude of spring which he subsequently manifested far from it indeed this punctilious deliberation and slow exactitude as on the reviewground is wonderful and noteworthy at the first start of friedrichthe faithful apprenticehand still rigorous to the rules of the old shop ten years hence twenty years hence

accounts a superior soldier and excellent general of horse commands this austrian left wing general goldlein anonymous maria theresa already cited p 8 n a swiss veteran of good parts presiding over the infantry in that quarter neipperg himself were he once complete will command the right wing  neipperg is to be in two lines as the prussians are with horse on each wing which is orthodox military order his length of front i should guess must have been something better than two english miles a sluggish brook called of laugwitz from the village of that name which lies some way across is on his right hand sluggish boggy stagnating towards the oder in those partsimproved farming has in our time mostly dried the strip of bog and made it into coarse meadow which is rather a relief amid the dry sandy element neippergs right is covered by that his left rests on the hamlet of gruningen a mileandhalf northeast of mollwitzmeant to have rested on hermsdorf nearly east but the prussians have already taken that up the sun coming more and more round to west of south for it is now past noon shines right in neippergs face and is against him how the wind is nobody mentionsprobably there was no wind his regular cavalry 8600 outnumbers twice or more that of the prussians not to mention their quality and he has fewer infantry somewhat in proportionthe entire force on each side is scarcely above 20000 the prussians slightly in majority by count in fieldpieces neipperg is greatly outnumbered the prussians having about threescore he only eighteen kausler atlas der merkwurdigsten schlachten p 232 and now here are the prussians close upon our left wing not yet in contact with the rightwhich in fact is not yet got into existencethank heaven they have not come before our left got into existence as our right if you knew it has not yet quite finished doing  the prussians though so ready for deploying have had their own difficulties and delays between the boggy brook of laugwitz on their left and the village of hermsdorf two miles distant on which their right wing is to lean there proves not to be room enough oeuvres de frederic ii 73 and then owing to mistake of schulenburg our old pipeclay friend who commands the right wing of horse here and is not up in time there is too much room not room enough for all the infantry we say the last three battalions of the front line therefore the three on the utmost right wheel round and stand athwart en potence as soldiers say or at right angles to the first line hanging to it like a kind of lid in that partbetween schulenburg and themhad schulenburg come up thus are the three battalions got rid of at least they cap the first prussian line rectangularly like a lid says my authoritylid which does not reach to the second line by a good way this accidental arrangement had material effects on the right wing unfortunate schulenburg did at last come uphad he miscalculated the distances then once on the ground he will find he does not reach to hermsdorf after all and that there is now too much room what his degree of fault was i know not friedrich has long been dissatisfied with these dragoons of schulenburg good for nothing i always told you at that skirmish of baumgarten and now here is the general himself fallen blunderingin respect of horse the austrians are more than two to one to make out our deficiency the king imitating something he had read about gustavus adolphus intercalates the horsesquadrons on each wing with two battalions of grenadiers and so lengthens thema manoeuvre not likely to be again imitated he admits  all these movements and arrangements are effected above a mile from mollwitz no enemy yet visible once effected we advance again with music sounding sixty pieces of artillery well in frontsteady steadyacross the floor of snow which is soon beaten smooth enough the stage this day of a great adventure and now there is the enemys left wing romer and his horse their right wing wider away and not yet by a good space within cannonrange of us it is towards two of the afternoon schulenburg now on his ground laments that he will not reach to hermsdorfbut it may be dangerous now to attempt repairing that error at two of the clock being now fairly within distance we salute romer and the austrian left with all our sixty cannon and the sound of drums and clarinets is drowned in universal artillery thunder incessant for they take by order to swiftshooting which is almost of the swiftness of musketry in our prussian practice and from sixty cannon going at that rate we may fancy some effect the austrian horse of the left wing do not like it all the less as the austrians rather short of artillery have nothing yet to reply with  no cavalry can stand long there getting shivered in that way in such a noise were there nothing more are we to stand here like milestones then and be all shot without a stroke struck steady answers romer but nothing can keep them steady to

orders neipperg is on the extreme right many things still to settle there and here is the cannonthunder going and soon their very musketry will open andand there is schulenburg for one thing stretching himself out eastwards rightwards to get hold of hermsdorf thinking this an opportunity for the manoeuvre forward cries romer and his thirty squadrons like bottled whirlwind now at last let loose dash upon schulenburgs poor ten five of them of schulenburgs own regimentwho are turned sideways too trotting towards hermsdorf at the wrong momentand dash them into wild ruin that must have been a charge that was the beginning of hours of chaos seemingly irretrievable in that prussian right wing  for the prussian horse fly wildly and it is in vain to rally the king is among them has come in hot haste conjuring and commanding poor schulenburg addresses his own regiment oh shame shame shall it be told then rallies his own regiment and some others charges fiercely in with them again gets

regiment going to the winds again and his care of it and of other things concluding in this honorable manner nothing can rally that right wing or the more you rally the worse it fares they are clearly no match for romer these prussian horse they fly along the front of their own first line of infantry they fly between the two lines romer chasingtill the fire of the infantry intolerable to our enemies and hitting some even of our fugitive friends repels him for the notable point in all this was the conduct of the infantry and how it stood in these wild vortexes of ruin impregnable immovable as if every man of it were stone and steadily poured out deluges of firefive prussian shots for two austriansuch is perfect discipline against imperfect and the iron ramrod against the wooden  the intolerable fire repels romer when he trenches on the infantry however he captures nine of the prussian sixty guns has scattered their horse to the winds and charges again and again hoping to break the infantry tootill a bullet kills him the gallant romer and some other has to charge and try it was thought had goldlein with his austrian infantry advanced to support romer at this juncture the battle had been gained five times before romer fell and after the austrians charged here tried the second line too tried once to take prince leopold in rear there but prince leopold faced round gave intolerable fire on one face as on the other he or the prussian infantry anywhere is not to be broken prince friedrich one of the margraves of schwedt kings cousin whom we did not know before fell in these wild rallyings and wrestlings by a cannonball at the kings hand not said otherwise where he had come as volunteer few weeks ago out of holland where he was a rising general he has met his fate hereand margraf karl his brother who also gets wounded will be a mournful man tonight  the prussian horse this right wing of it is a ruined body boiling in wild disorder flooding rapidly away to rearwardwhich is the safest direction to retreat upon they sweep away the kings person with them say some cautious people others say what is the fact that schwerin entreated and as it were commanded the king to go the battle being to all appearance irretrievable go he did with small escort and on a long rideto oppeln a prussian post thirtyfive miles rearward where there is a bridge over the oder and a safe country beyond so much is indubitable and that he despatched an aidedecamp to gallop into brandenburg and tell the old dessauer bestir yourself here all seems lostand vanished from the field doubtless in very desperate humor upon which the extraneous world has babbled a good deal cowardice wanted courage haha in its usual foolish way not worth answer from him or from us friedrichs demeanor in that disaster of his right wing was furious despair rather and neither schulenburg nor margraf friedrich nor any of the captains killed or left living was supposed to have sinned by cowardice in a visible degree  indisputable it is though there is deep mystery upon it the king vanishes from mollwitz field at this point for sixteen hours into the regions of myth into fairyland as would once have been said but reappears unharmed in tomorrows daylight at which time not sooner readers shall hear what little is to be said of this obscure and muchdisfigured small affair for the present we hasten back to mollwitzwhere the murderous thunder rages unabated all this while the very noise of it alarming mankind for thirty miles round at breslau which is thirty good miles off horrible dull grumble was heard from the southern quarter still better if you put a staff in the ground and set your ear to it and from the steepletops there was dim cloudland of powdersmoke discernible in the horizon there at liegnitz which is twice the distance the earth sensibly shook heldengeschichte and jordans letter infraat least the air did and the nerves of men  had goldlein but advanced with his foot in support of gallant romer say the austrian books but goldlein did not advance nor is it certain he would have found advantage in so doing goldlein where he stands has difficulty enough to hold his own for the notable circumstance miraculous to military men still is how the prussian foot men who had never been in fire but whom friedrich wilhelm had drilled for twenty years stand their ground in this distraction of the horse not even the two outlying grenadier battalions will give way those poor intercalated grenadiers when their horse fled on the right and on the left they stand there like a fixed stonedam in that wild whirlpool of ruin they fix bayonets bring their two fieldpieces to flank winterfeld was captain there and from small arms and big deliver such a fire as was very unexpected nothing to be made of winterfeld and them they invincibly hurl back charge after charge and with dogged steadiness manoeuvre themselves into the general line again or into contact with the three superfluous battalions arranged en potence whom we heard of those three ranked athwart in this right wing like a lid between first line and second maintained themselves in like impregnable fashionwinterfeld commandingand proved unexpectedly thinks friedrich the saving of the whole for they also stood their ground immovable like rocks steadily spouting firetorrents five successive charges storm upon them fruitless steady meine kinder fix bayonets handle ramrods there is the horsedeluge thundering in upon you reserve your fire till you see the whites of their eyes and get the word then give it them and again give it them see whether any man or any horse can stand it  neipperg soon after romer fell had ordered goldlein forward goldlein with his infantry did advance gallantly enough but to no purpose goldlein was soon shot dead and his infantry had to fall back again ineffectual or worse iron ramrods against wooden five shots to two what is there but falling back neipperg sent fresh horse from his right wing with berlichingen a new famed general of horse neipperg is furiously bent to improve his advantage to break those prussians who are mere musketeers left bare and thinks that will settle the account but it could in no wise be done the austrian horse after their fifth trial renounce charging fairly refuse to charge any more and withdraw dispirited out of ballrange or in search of things not impracticable the hussar part of them did something of plunder to rearwardand besides poor maupertuiss adventure of which by and by and an attempt on the prussian baggage and knapsacks which proved to be too well guardedburnt the church of pampitz as some small consolation the prussians had stript their knapsacks and left them in pampitz the austrians it was noticed stript theirs in the field built walls of them and fired behind the same in a kneeling more or less protected posturewhich did not avail them much  in fact the austrian infantry too all austrians hour after hour are getting wearier of it neither infantry nor cavalry can stand being riddled by swift shot in that manner in spite of their knapsack walls various regiments have shrunk out of ballrange and several cannot by any persuasion be got to come into it again others who do reluctantly advancesee what a figure they make man after man edging away as he

be gained we can expect by fighting of this kind in an honest cause but here is something already gained which is considerable and about which there is no doubt a new military power it would appear

almost as the very swedes did and is led on by its king toowho may prove in his way a very charles xii or small macedonias madman for aught one knows in which latter branch of their prognostic the gazetteers were much out  the fame of this battle which is now so sunk out of memory was great in europe and struck like a huge wargong with long resonance through the general ear m de voltaire had

and meand one could at last see mahomet after five years of struggling get upon the boards if not yet in paris by a great way yet in lille which is something mahomet is getting upon the boards on those terms and has proceeded not amiss through an act or two when a note from the king of prussia was handed to voltaire announcing the victory of mollwitz which delightful note voltaire stopt the performance till he read to the audience bravissimo answered the audience you will see said m de voltaire to the friends about him this piece at mollwitz will make mine succeed which proved to be the fact voltaire oeuvres vie privee ii 74 for the french are antiaustrian and smell great things in the wind that man is mad your most christian majesty not quite or at any rate not mad only think louis and his belleisles now  dimly poring in those old books and squeezing ones way into facetoface view of the extinct time we begin to notice what a clangorous rumor was in mollwitz to the then generation of mankindbetokening many things universal european war as the first thing which duly came to pass as did at a slower rate the ulterior thing not yet so apparent that indeed a new hour had struck on the time horologe that a new epoch had risen yes my friends new charles xii or not here truly has a new man and king come upon the scene capable perhaps of doing something slumberous europe rotting amid its blind pedantries its lazy hypocrisies conscious and unconscious this man is capable of shaking it a little out of its stupid refuges of lies and ignominious wrappages and bedclothes which will be its graveclothes otherwise and of intimating to it afar off that there is still a veracity in things and a mendacity in shamthings and that the difference of the two is infinitely more considerable than was supposed  this mollwitz is a most deliberate regulated ponderously impressive gravitatisch feat of arms as the reader sees done all by regulation methods with orthodox exactitude in a slow weighty almost pedantic but highly irrefragable manner it is the triumph of prussian discipline of military orthodoxy well put in practice the honest outcome of good natural stuff in those brandenburgers and of the supreme virtues of drill neipperg and his austrians had much despised prussian soldiering keep our soup hot cried they on running out this day to rank themselves hot a little till we drive these fellows to the devil that was their opinion about noon this day but that is an opinion they have renounced for all remaining days and yearsit is a victory due properly to friedrich wilhelm and the old dessauer who are far away from it friedrich wilhelm though dead fights here and the others only do his bidding on this occasion his son as yet adds nothing of his own though he will ever henceforth begin largely addingright careful withal to lose nothing for the friedrich wilhelm contribution is invaluable and the basis of everythingbut it is curious to see in what contrast this first battle of friedrichs is with his latter and last ones  considering the battle of mollwitz and then in contrast the intricate pragmatic sanction and what their consequences were and their antecedents it is curious once more this then is what the pragmatic sanction has come to twenty years of worldwide diplomacy cunningly devised spiderthreads overnetting all the world have issued here your congresses of cambray of soissons your grumkowseckendorf machiavelisms all these might as well have lain in their bed real pragmatic sanction would have been a welltrained army and your treasury full your treasury is empty nothing in it but those foolish 200000 english guineas and the passionate cry for more and your army is not trained as this prussian one cannot keep its ground against this one of all those longheaded potentates simple friedrich wilhelm son of nature who had the honesty to do what nature taught him has come out gainer you all laughed at him as a fool do you begin to see now who was wise who fool he has an army that advances on you with glittering musketry steady as on the paradeground and pours out fire like one continuous thunderpeal so that strange as it seems you find there will actually be nothing for you buttaking to your heels shall we sayrolling off with despatch as secondbest these things are of singular omen here stands one that will avenge friedrich wilhelmif friedrich wilhelm were not already sufficiently avenged by the mere verdict of facts which is palpably coming out as time peels the wiggeries away from them more and more mollwitz and such places are full of veracity and no head is so thick as to resist conviction in that kind     of friedrichs disappearance into fairyland in the interim and of maupertuiss similar adventure  of the kings flight or sudden disappearance into fairyland during this first battle the king himself who alone could have told us fully maintained always rigorous silence and nowhere drops the least hint so that the small fact has come down to us involved in a great bulk of fabulous cobwebs mostly of an illnatured character set agoing by voltaire valori and others which fabulous process in the goodnatured form still continues itself and except for nicolais good industry in his anekdotenbook we should have difficulty even in guessing not to say understanding as is now partly possible the few real particularsand those do verify themselves and hang perfectly together when the big globe of fable is burnt off from themare to the following effect  battle lost said schwerin but what is the loss

ohlau upon breslau and save the magazines this side the oder all will be movements a whirlpool of hussars but beyond the oder all is quiet open to ohlau to glogau nay home to brandenburg and the old dessauer with his camp at gottin the road is free by the other side of the oderschwerin and prince leopold urging him the king did ride away at what hour with what suite or with what adventures not mostly fabulous is not knownbut it was towards lowen fifteen miles off where he crossed neisse river the other day and thence towards oppeln on the oder eighteen miles farther and the pace was swift leopold on reflection ordered off a squadron of gensdarmes to overtake his majesty at lowen or sooner which they never did passing pampitz the king threw fredersdorf a word who was among the baggage there to oppeln bring the purse the privy writings which fredersdorf and the clerks and another herr who became nicolais fatherinlaw in after years did and joined the king at lowen but i hope stopped there  the kings suite was small names not given but by the time he got to lowen being joined by cavalry fugitives and the like it had got to be seventy persons too many for the king he selected what was his of them ordered the gates to be shut behind him on all others and again rode away the leopold squadron of gensdarmes did not arrive till after his departure and having here lost trace of him called halt and billeted for the night the king speeds silently to oppeln on his excellent bay horse the worsemounted gradually giving in at oppeln is a bridge over the oder a free country beyond regiment la motte lay and as the king thinks still lies in oppelnbut in that he is mistaken regiment la motte is with the baggage at pampitz all this day and a wandering hussar party some sixty austrians have taken possession of oppeln the king and the few who had not yet broken down arrive at the gate of oppeln late under cloud of night who goes cried the sentry from within prussians a prussian courier answer theyand are fired upon through the gratings and immediately draw back and vanish unhurt into night again had those hussars only let him in said austria afterwards but they had not such luck it was at this point according to valori that the king burst forth into audible ejaculations of a lamentable nature there is no getting over then even to brandenburg and in an insolvent condition not open insolvency and bankrupt disgrace no ruin and an austrian jail is the one outlook o mon dieu o god it is too much cen est trop with other the like snatches of lamentation valori i 104 which are not inconceivable in a young man sleepless for the third night in these circumstances but which valori knows nothing of except by malicious rumor from the valet classwho have misinformed valori about several other points  the king riding diligently with or without ejaculations back towards lowen comes at an early hour to the mill of hilbersdorf within a mileandhalf of that place he alights at the mill sends one of his attendants almost the only one now left to inquire what is in lowen the answer we know is a squadron of gensdarmes there furthermore a prussian adjutant come to say victory at mollwitz upon which the king mounts againissues into daylight and concludes these mythical adventures that in lowen in the shop at the corner of the marketplace widow panzern subsequently wife somethingelse made his majesty a cup of coffee and served a roast fowl along with it cannot but be welcome news if true and that his majesty got to mollwitz again before dark that same day fuchs p 11 is liable to no controversy  in this way was friedrich snatched by morgante into fairyland carried by diana to the top of pindus or even by proserpine to tartarus through a bad sixteen hours till the battle whirlwind subsided friendly imaginative spirits would in the antique time have so construed it but these moderns were maliciousvaletish not friendly and wrapped the matter in mere stupid worlds of cobweb which require burning friedrich himself was stonesilent on this matter all his life after but is understood never quite to have pardoned schwerin for the illluck

indubitablewhich will remain obscure halfmythical to the end of the world the truth is that right wing of the prussian army was fallen chaotic ruined and no man not even one who had seen it can give account of what went on there the sage maupertuis for example had climbed some tree or place of impregnability tree voltaire calls it though that is hardly probable hoping to see the battle there and he did see it much too clearly at last in such a tide of charging and chasing on that right wing and round all the field in the prussian rear in such wide bickering and boiling of horsecurrentswhich

of philosophy or even who could speak french such officer is at last found humanely advances him money a shirt and suit of clothes but can in nowise dispense with his going to vienna as prisoner

fallen back on neisse taken up a strong encampment in that neighborhood he lies thereabouts all summer stretched out as it were in a kind of vigilant dogsleep on the threshold keeping watch over neisse and tries fighting no more at this time or indeed ever after to speak of and always i think with disadvantage when he does try a little he had been grandduke franzs tutor in warmatters had got into trouble at belgrade once before and was almost hanged by the turks george ii had occasionally the benefit of him in coming years be not too severe on the poor man as the vienna public was he had some faculty though not enough governor of luxemburg before long there for most part let him peacefully drill and spend the remainder of his poor life friedrich says neither neipperg nor himself at this time knew the least of war and that it would be hard to settle which of them made the more blunders in their silesian tussle  friedrich in about three weeks hence was fully ready for opening trenches upon brieg did open trenches accordingly by moonlight in a grand nocturnal manner as readers shall see anon and by vigorous cannonadingmarechal de belleisle having come by this time to enjoy the fine spectaclesoon got possession of brieg and held it thenceforth neisse now alone remained with neipperg vigilantly stretched upon the threshold of it but the marechal de belleisle we say had come that was the weighty circumstance and before neisse can be thought of there is a whole europe bickering aloft into conflict embattling itself from end to end in sequel of mollwitz battle and such

but they cannot  map on page 75 goes hereaboutsmissing     chapter xi  the bursting forth of bedlams belleisle and the breakers of pragmatic sanction  the battle of mollwitz went off like a signalshot among the nations intimating that they were one and all to go battling which they did with a witness making a terrible thing of it over all the world for above seven years to come foolish nations doomed to settle their jarring accounts in that terrible manner nay the fewest of them had any accounts except imaginary ones to settle there at all and they went into the adventure gratis spurred on by spectralities of the sick brain by phantasms of hope phantasms of terror and had strictly speaking no actual business in it whatever  not that mollwitz kindled europe europe was already kindled for some two years pastespecially since the late kaiser died and his pragmatic sanction was superadded to the other troubles afoot but ever since that image of jenkinss ear had at last blazed up in the slow english brain like a fiery constellation or sign in the heavens symbolic of such injustices and unendurabilities and had lighted the spanishenglish war europe was slowly but pretty surely taking fire france could not see spain humbled she said england in its own dim feeling and also in the fact of things could not do at all without considerably humbling spain france endlessly interested in that spanishenglish matter was already sending out fleets firing shotsalmost or altogether putting forth her hand in it in which case will not must not austria help us thought englandand was asking daily at vienna with intense earnestness but without the least result through excellency robinson there when the late kaiser died died poor gentlemanand left his big austrian heritages lying as it were in the open marketplace elaborately tied by diplomatic packthread and pragmatic sanction but not otherwise protected against the assembled cupidities of mankind independently of mollwitz or of silesia altogether it was next to impossible that europe could long avoid blazing out especially unless the spanishenglish quarrel got quenched of which there was no likelihood  but if not as cause then as signal or as signal and cause together which it properly was the battle of mollwitz gave the finishing stroke and set all in motion this was the little stone broken loose from the mountain this rather than the late kaisers death which friedrich defined in that manner or at least this was the first leap it took hitting other stones big and little which again hit others with their leaping and rollingtill the whole mountainside is in motion under law of gravity and you behold one wide stonetorrent thundering towards the valleys shivering woods farms habitations clean away with it fatal to any image of composite clay and brass which it may meet  there is accordingly from this point a change in friedrichs silesian adventure which becomes infinitely more complicated for himand for those that write of him no less friedrichs business henceforth is not to be done by direct fighting but rather by waiting to see how and on what side others will fight nor can we describe or understand friedrichs business except as in connection with the immense obsolete and indeed delirious phenomenon called austriansuccession war upon which it is difficult to say any human word if history driven upon dismal swamp with its horrors and perils can get across unsunk she will be lucky  for directly on the back of mollwitz there ensued first an explosion of diplomatic activity such as was never seen before excellencies from the four winds taking wing towards friedrich and talking and insinuating and fencing and fugling after their sort in that silesian camp of his the centre being there a universal rookery of diplomatistswhose loud cackle and cawing is now as if gone mad to us their work wholly fallen putrescent and avoidable dead to all creatures and secondly in the train of that there ensued a universal european war the french and the english being chief parties in it which abounds in battles and feats of arms spirited but delirious and cannot be got stilled for seven or eight years to come and in which friedrich and his war swim only as an intermittent episode henceforth what to do with such a war how extricate the episode and leave the war lying the war was at first a good deal mad and is now to mens imagination fallen wholly so who indeed have managed mostly to forget it only the episode reduced thereby to an unintelligible state retaining still some claims on them  it is singular into what oblivion the huge phenomenon called austriansuccession war has fallen which within a hundred years ago or little more filled all mortal hearts the english were principals on one side did themselves fight in it with their customary fire and their customary guidance courageous wooden pole with cocked hat as our friend called it and paid all the expenses which were extremely considerable and are felt in mens pockets to this day but the english have more completely forgotten it than any other people battle of dettingen battle of fontenaywhat in the devils name were we ever doing there the impatient englishman asks and can give no answer except the general one fit of insanity delirium tremens perhaps furensdont think of it of philippi and arbela educated englishmen can render account and i am told young gentlemen entering the army are pointedly required to say who commanded at aigospotamos and wrecked the peloponnesian war but of dettingen and fontenoy where is the living englishman that has the least notion or seeks for any the austriansuccession war did veritably rage for eight years at a terrific rate deforming the face of earth and heaven the english paying the piper always and founding their national debt therebybut not even that could prove mnemonic to them and they have dropped the austriansuccession war with one accord into the general dustbin and are content it should lie there they have not in their language the least approach to an intelligible account of it how it went on whitherward whence why it was there at allare points dark to the english and on which they do not wish to be informed they have quitted the matter as an unintelligible huge englishandforeign delirium which in good part it was delirium unintelligible to them tedious not to say in parts as those of the austrian subsidies hideous and disgusting to them happily now fallen extinct and capable of being skipped in ones inquiries into the wonders of this england and this world which in fact is a practical conclusion not so unwise as it looks  wars are not memorable says sauerteig however big they may have been whatever rages and miseries they may have occasioned or however many hundreds of thousands they may have been the death ofexcept when they have something of worldhistory in them withal if they are found to have been the travailthroes of great or considerable changes which continue permanent in the world men of some curiosity cannot but inquire into them keep memory of them but if they were travailthroes that had no birth who of mortals would remember them unless perhaps the feats of prowess virtue valor and endurance they might accidentally give rise to were very great indeed much greater than the most were which came out in that austriansuccession case wars otherwise are mere futile transitory dustwhirlwinds stilled in blood extensive fits of human insanity such as we know are too apt to break outsuch as it rather beseems a faithful son of the house of adam not to speak about again as in houses where the grandfather was hanged the topic of ropes is fitly avoided  never again will that war with its deliriums mad outlays of blood treasure and of hope and terror and farspread human destruction rise into visual life in any imagination of living man in vain shall dryasdust strive things mad chaotic and without ascertainable purpose or result cannot be fixed into human memories fix them there by never so many documentary histories elaborate longeared pedantries and cunning threads the poor human memory has an alchemy against such ill usageit forgets them again grows to know them as a mere torpor a stupidity and horror and instinctively flies from dryasdust and them  alive to any considerable degree in the poor human imagination this editor does not expect or even wish the austriansuccession war to be enough for him if it could be understood sufficiently to render his poor history of friedrich intelligible for it enwraps friedrich like a worldvortex henceforth modifies every step of his existence henceforth and apart from it there is no understanding of his business or him so much as sticks to friedrich that was our original bargain assist loyally o reader and we will try to make the indispensable a minimum for you     who was to blame for the austriansuccession war  the first point to be noted is where did it originate to which the answer mainly is with that lean gentleman whom we saw with papers in the oeildeboeuf on newyears day last with monseigneur the marechal de belleisle principally with the ambitious cupidities and baseless vanities of the french court and nation as represented by belleisle george iis spanish war if you will examine had a real necessity in it jenkinss ear was the ridiculous outside figure this matter had jenkinss ear was one final item of it but the poor english people in their wrath and bellowings about that small item were intrinsically meaning settle the account let us have that account cleared up and liquidated it has lain too long and seldom were a people more in the right as readers shall yet see  the englishspanish war had a basis to stand on in this universe the like had the prussianaustrian one so all men now admit if friedrich had not business there what man ever had in an enterprise he ventured on friedrich after such trial and proof as has seldom been got his claims on schlesien allowed by the destinies his claims on schlesienand on infinitely higher things which were found to be his and his nations though he had not been consciously thinking of them in making that adventure for as my poor friend insists there are laws valid in earth and in heaven and the great soul of the world is just friedrich had business in this war and maria theresa versus friedrich had likewise cause to appear in court and do her utmost pleading against him  but if we ask what belleisle or france and louis xv had to do there the answer is rigorously nothing their own windy vanities ambitions sanctioned not by fact and the almighty powers but by phantasm and the babble of versailles transcendent selfconceit intrinsically insane pretensions over their fellowcreatures which were without basis anywhere in nature except in the french brain alone it was this that brought belleisle and france into a german war and belleisle and france having gone into an antipragmatic war the unlucky george and his england were dragged into a pragmatic onequitting their own business on the spanish main and hurrying to germanyin terror as at doomsday and zeal to save the keystone of nature these that is the notable point in regard to this war that france is to be called the author of it who alone of all the parties had no business there whatever and the wages due to france for such a piece of industrythe reader will yet see what wages france and the other parties got at the tail of the affair for that too is apparent in our day  we have often said the spanishenglish war was itself likely to have kindled europe and again friedrichs silesian war was itself likelyfrance being nearly sure to interfere but if both these wars were necessary ones and if france interfered in either of them on the wrong side the blame will be to france not to the necessary wars france could in no way have interfered in a more barefacedly unjust and gratuitous manner than she now did nor on any terms have so palpably made herself the author of the conflagration of deliriums that ensued for above seven years henceforth nay for above twenty yearsthe settlement of this silesian pragmaticantipragmatic matter and of jenkinss ear incidentally along with this not having fairly completed itself till 1763     how belleisle made visit to teutschland and there was no fit henry the fowler to welcome him  it is very wrong to keep enchanted wiggeries sitting in this world as if they were things still alive by a species of conservatism which gets praised in our time but which is only a slothful cowardice base indifference to truth and hatred to trouble in comparison with lies that sit quiet men now extensively practise this method of procedurelittle dreaming how bad and fatal it at all times is when the brains are out things really ought to dieno matter what lovely things they were and still affect to be the brains being out they actually ought in all cases to die and with their best speed get buried men had noses at one time and smelt the horror of a deceased reality fallen putrid of a once dear verity become mendacious phantasmal but they have to an immense degree lost that organ since and are now living comfortably cheekbyjowl with lies lies of that sad conservative kindand indeed of all kinds whatsoever for that kind is a general mother and breeds with a fecundity that is appalling did you heed it much  it was pity that the holy romish reich teutsch by nation had not got itself buried some ages before once it had brains and life but now they were out under the sway of barbarossa under our old antichaotic friend henry the fowler how different had it been no field for a belleisle to come and sow tares in no rotten thatch for a french sungod to go sailing about in the middle of and set fire to henry when the hungarian panslavonic savagery came upon him had got ready in the interim and a mangy dog was the tribute he gave them followed by the due extent of broken crowns since they would not be content with that that was the due of belleisle toohad there been a henry to meet him with it on his crossing the marches in trier country in spring 1741 there you anarchic upholsterybelus fancying yourself god of the sun there is what teutschland owes you go home with that and mind your own business which i am told is plentiful if you had eye for it  but the sad truth is for above four centuries nowand especially for three since little kaiser karl iv gave away all the moneys of it in his pressing occasions this holy romish reich teutsch by nation has been more and ever more becoming an imaginary quantity the kaisership of it not capable of being worn by anybody except a hapsburger who had resources otherwise his own the fact is palpable and austria and antireformation entity conservative in that bad sense of slothfully abhorring trouble in comparison with lies had not found the poison more malodorous in this particular than in many others and had cherished its holy romish reich grown unholy phantasmal like so much else in austrian things and had held firm grip of it these three hundred years and found it a furthersome and suitable thing though sensible it was more and more becoming an enchanted wiggery pure and simple nor have the consequences failed they never do belleisle louis xiv henri ii francois i it is long since the french have known this state of matters and been in the habit of breaking in upon it fomenting internal discontents getting up unjust warswith or without advantage to france but with endless disadvantage to germany schmalkaldic war thirtyyears war louis xivs wars which brought alsace and the other fine cuttings late polishelection war and its lorraine austriansuccession war many are the wars kindled on poor teutschland by neighbor france and large is the sum of woes to europe and to it chargeable to that score which appears even yet not to be completedperhaps not even yet for it is the penalty of being loyal to enchanted wiggeries of living cheekbyjowl with lies of a peaceable quality and stuffing your nostrils and searing your soul against the accursed odor they all havefor i can assure you the curse of heaven does dwell in one and all of them and the son of adam cannot too soon get quit of their bad partnership cost him what it may  belleisles journey as sungod began in marchend of march 1741 no date of a day to be had for that memorable thingand he went gyrating about through the german courts for almost a year afterwards his course rather erratic but always in a splendor as of belus with those hundred and thirty french lords and valets and the glory of most christian king irradiating him very diligent for the first six months till september or october next which we may call his seedtime and by no means resting after nine or twelve months while the harrowing and hoeing went on in january 1742 he had the great satisfaction to see a bavarian kaiser got instead of an austrian and everywhere the fruit of his diligent husbandry begin to beard fairly above ground into a crop of facts like armed men from dragons teeth and the pleasure of thewhom was it the pleasure ofprosper in his hands belleisle was a pretty man but i doubt it was not the lord he was doing the pleasure of on this occasion but a very different personage disguised to resemble him in poor belleisles eyes  austria was not dangerous to france in late times and now least of all how far from ithumbled by the loss of lorraine and now as it were bankrupt itself in danger from all the world and france so far as express treaties could bind a nation was bound to maintain austria in its present possessions the bitter loss of lorraine had been sweetened to the late kaiser by that solitary drop of consolationas his failure of a life had been poor man failure the most of me has been but i have got pragmatic sanction thanks to heaven and even france has signed it loss of lorraine loss of elsass loss of the three bishoprics since karl vs times not to speak of earlier there has been mere loss on lossand now is the time to consummate it think belleisle and france in spite of treaties  towards humbling or extinguishing austria belleisle has two preliminary things to do first break the pragmatic sanction and get everybody to break it second guide the kaiserwahl election of a kaiser so that it issue not in grandduke franz maria theresas husband as all expect it will but in another party friendly to francesay in karl albert of bavaria whose family have long been good clients of ours dependent on us for a living in the political world belleisle there is little doubt had from the first cast his eye on this unlucky karl albert for kaiser but is uncertain as to carrying him belleisle will take another if he must kursachsen for exampleany other and all others only not the grandduke that is a point already fixed with belleisle though he keeps it well in the background and is careful not to hint it till the time come  in regard to pragmatic sanction belleisle and france found no difficultyor the difficulty only which we hope must have been considerable of eating their own covenant in behalf of pragmatic sanction and declaring which they did without visible blush that it was a covenant including if not expressly then tacitly as all human covenants do this clause salvo jure tertii saving the rights of third partiesthat is of electors of bavaria and others who may object against it o soul of honor o first nation of the universe was there ever such a subterfuge here is a field of flowering corn the biggest in the world begirt with elaborate ringfence many miles of firm oakpaling pitched and buttressedthe poor gentleman now dead gave you his lorraine and almost his life for swearing to keep up said paling and you do keep it upall except six yards through which the biggest team on the highway can drive freely and the paltriest cadgers ass can step in for a bellyful  it appears the first nation of the universe had at an early period of their consultations hit upon this of salvo jure tertii as the method of eating their covenant before an enlightened public 20th january 1741 in their note of ceremony recognizing maria theresa as queen of hungary note which had been due so very long adelung ii 206 there is ominous silence on pragmatic sanction beginning of march there is virtual avowal of salvo jure ib 279open avowal on belleisles advent ib 305 and they persisted in it there being no other for them an enlightened public grinned sardonically and was not taken in but as so many others were eating their covenants under equally poor subterfuges the enlightened public could not grin long on any individualcould only gape mutely with astonishment on all a glorious example of veracity and human nobleness set by the gods of this lower world to their gazing populations who could read in the gazettes what is truth falsity human kingship human swindlership are the ten commandments only a figure of speech then and it was some beggarly attorneydevil that built this sublunary world and us questions might rise had long been risingbut now there was about enough and the response to them was falling due and belleisle himself what is very notable had been appointed to get ready the response belleisle little as belleisle dreamt of it in these high enterprises was ushering in by way of response a ragnarok or twilight of the gods which as french revolution or apotheosis of sansculottism is now well knownand that is something to consider of     downbreak of pragmatic sanction manner of the chief artists in handling their covenants  the operation once accomplished on its own pragmatic covenant france found no difficulty with the others everybody was disposed to eat his covenant who could see advantage in so doing after that admirable example the difficulty of france and belleisle rather was to keep the hungry parties back dont eat your covenant till the proper time patience we say a most sad miscellany of royalties coming all to the point will you eat your covenant will you keep itand eating nearly all in fact wholly all that needed to eat  on the first invasion of silesia maria theresa had indignantly complained in every court and pointing to pragmatic sanction had demanded that such law of nature be complied with according to covenant what maria theresa got by this circuit of the courts everybody still knows except england which was willing and holland which was unwilling all courts had answered more or less uneasily law of naturehumph yesand far from doing anything not one of them would with certainty promise to do anything from england alone and her little king to whom pragmatic sanction is the palladium of human freedoms and the keystone of nature could she get the least help the rest hung back would not open heart or pocket waited till they saw they do now see now that belleisle has done his feat of covenanteating  eleven great powers some count thirteen some twelve scholl ii 286 adelung list ii 127but no two agree and hardly one agrees with himselfenough the powers of europe from naples and madrid to russia and sweden have all signed it let us say a dozen or a bakersdozen of them and except our little english paladin alone whose interest and indeed salvation seemed to him to lie that way and who needed no pragmatic covenant to guide him nobody whatever distinguished himself by keeping it between december 1740 when maria theresa set up her cries in all courts on to april 1741 england painfully dragging holland with her had alone of the bakersdozen spoken word of disapproval much less done act of hindrance two especially france and bavaria not to mention spain had done the reverse and disowned and declared against pragmatic sanction and after the battle of mollwitz when the little stone took its first leap and set all thundering then came like the inrush of a fashion throughout that high miscellany or bakersdozen the general eating of covenants which was again quickened in august for a reason we shall see and before november of that year there was no covenant left to eat of the bakersdozen nobody remained but little george the paladin dragging holland painfully along with himand pragmatic sanction had gone to water like ice in a june day and its beautiful crystalline qualities and prismatic colors were forever vanished from the world will the reader note a point or two a personage or two in this sordid processnot for the processs sake which is very sordid and smells badly but for his own sake to elucidate his own course a little in the intricacies now coming or come upon him and me  1 elector of bavariakarl albert of baiern is by some counted as a signer of the pragmatic sanction and by others not which occasions that discrepancy of sumtotal in the books and he did once in a sense sign it he and his brother of koln but before the late kaisers death he had openly drawn back from it again and counted himself a nonsigner signer or not he for his part lost no moment but rather the contrary in openly protesting against it and signifying that he never would acknowledge it of this the reader saw something at the time of her hungarian majestys accession date and circumstances of it which deserve remembering are more precisely these october 20th 1740 karl alberts ambassador perusa by name wrote to karl from vienna announcing that the kaiser was just dead from munchen on the 21st karl albert anticipating such an event but not yet knowing it orders perusa in case of the kaisers decease which was considered probable at munchen to demand instant audience of the proper party kanzler sinzendorf and there openly lodge his protest which perusa did punctually in all pointsno moment lost but rather the contrary as we said let poor karl albert have what benefit there is in that fact he was of all the antipragmatic covenantbreakers if he ever fairly were such the only one that proceeded honorably openly and at once in the matter and he was of them all by far the most unfortunate  this is the poor gentleman whom belleisle had settled on for being kaiser and kaiser he became to his frightful sorrow as it proved his crown like a crown of burning iron or little better there is little of him in the books nor does one desire much a tall aquiline type of man much the gentleman in aspect and in reality of decorous serious deportment and the wish to be high and dignified he had a kind of right too in the antipragmatic sense and was come of imperial kindredkaiser ludwig the bavarian and kaiser rupert of the pfalz called rupert klemm or rupert smithsvice if any reader now remember him were both of his ancestors he might fairly pretend to kaisership and to austrian ownershiphad he otherwise been equal to such enterprises but in all ambitions and attempts howsoever grounded otherwise there is this strict question on the threshold are you of weight for the adventure are not you far too light for it ambitious persons often slur this question and get squelched to pieces by bringing the twelve labors of hercules on unherculean backs not every one is so lucky as our friedrich in that particularwhose back though with difficulty held out which poor karl alberts never had much likelihood to do few mortals in any age have offered such an example of the tragedies which ambition has in store for her votaries and what a matter hope fulfilled may be to the unreflecting son of adam  we said he had a kind of right to austria withal he descended by the female line from kaiser ferdinand i as did kursachsen though by a younger daughter than karl alberts ancestress and he appealed to kaiser ferdinands settlement of the succession as a higher than any subsequent pragmatic could be upon which there hangs an incident still famous to german readers karl albert getting into public argument in this way naturally instructed perusa to demand sight of kaiser ferdinands last will the tenor of which was known by authentic copy in munchen if not elsewhere among the kindred after some delay perusa 4th november 1740 summoning the other excellencies to witness got sight of the will to his horror there stood in the cardinal passage instead of munnliche male descendants eheliche lawfully begotten descendantsfatal to karl alberts claim nor could he prove that the parchment had been scraped or altered though he kept trying and examining for some days he withdrew thereupon by order straightway from vienna testifying in dumbshow what he thought it is your copy that is false cried the vienna people it has been foisted on you with this wrong word in it done by somebody your friend the excellency herr von hartmann shall we guess wishing to curry favor with ambitious foolish persons such was the austrian story perhaps in munchen itself their copyist was not knownfor aught i learn the copy was made long since and the copyist dead hartmann named as copyist by the vienna people made emphatic public answer never did i copy it or see it and there rose great argument which is not yet quite ended as to the question original falsified or copy falsifiedand the modern vote i believe rather clearly is that the austrian officials had done

you will lose your soul madamtush what signifies my poor silly soul compared with the honor of the family  2 king friedrichking friedrich may be taken as the antipragmatic next in order of time he too lost not a moment and proceeded openly no quirking to be charged upon him his account of himself in this matter always was by the treaty of wusterhausen 1726 unquestionably prussia undertook to guarantee pragmatic sanction the late kaiser undertaking in return by the same treaty to secure berg and julich to prussia and to have some progress made in it within six months from signing and unquestionably also the late kaiser did thereupon or even had already done precisely the reverse namely secured so far as in him was possible berg and julich to kurpfalz such treaty having in this way done suicide is dead and become zero and i am free in respect of pragmatic sanction to do whatever shall seem good to me my wish was and would still be to maintain pragmatic sanction and even to support it by 100000 men and secure the election of the grandduke to the kaisershipwere my claims on silesia once liquidated but these have no concern with pragmatic sanction for or against these are good against whoever may fall heir to the house of austria or to silesia and my intention is that the strong hand so long clenched upon my rights shall open itself by this favorable opportunity and give them out that is friedrichs case and in truth the jury everywhere has to findso soon as instructed which is a long process in some sections of it in england for examplethat pragmatic sanction has not except helpless lamentations alas that you should be here to insist upon your rights and to open fists long closedthe least word to say to friedrich  3 termagant of spainperhaps the most distracted of the antipragmatic subterfuges was that used by spain when the shedragon or termagant saw good to eat her covenant which was at a very early stage the termagants poor husband is a bourbon not a hapsburg at all but has not he fallen heir to the spanish hapsburgs become all one as they an alterego of the spanish hapsburgs asks she and the austrian hapsburgs being out do not the spanish hapsburgs come in he i say this bourbonhapsburg he is the real hapsburg now that the austrian branch is gone president he of the golden fleece which a certain archduchess maria theresa had been meddling with proprietor he of austrian italy and of all or most things austrianand produces documentary covenants of philip ii with his austrian cousins to which philip said the termagant we bourbons surely if you consider it are heir and alterego is not this a curious case of testamentary right human greed obliterating personal identity itself  belleisle had a great deal of difficulty keeping the termagant back till things were ripe her hope practically was baby carlos being prosperous king of naples this long while to get the milanese for another baby she hasbaby philip whom she once thought of making popeand she is eager beyond measure to have a stroke at the milanese wait hoarsely whispers belleisle to her and she can scarcely wait maria theresas note of announcement new queen of hungary may it please you the french as we saw were very long in answering the termagant did not answer it at all complained on the contrary what is this madam golden fleece youand early in march informed mankind that she was spanish hapsburg the genuine article and sent off excellency montijos a little man of great expense to assist at the election of a proper kaiser and be useful to belleisle in the great things now ahead spains goldenfleece pretensions 17th january 1741 adelung ii 233 234 publishes at paris in march ib 293 and on the 23d march accredits montijos ib 293 italian war held back by belleisle and the english fleets cannot get begun till october following  4 king of polandthe most ticklish card in belleisles game and probably the greatest fool of these antipragmatic dozen was kursachsen king of poland he like karl albert kurbaiern derives from kaiser ferdinand though by a younger daughter and has a like claim on the austrian succession claim nullified however by that small circumstance itself but which he would fain mend by one makeshift or another and thinks always it must surely be good for something this is august iii this king of poland as readers know son of august the strong papa made him change to the catholic religion so calledfor the sake of getting poland which proves a very poor possession to him who knows what damage the poor creature may have got by that sad operationwhich all saxony sighed to the heart on hearing of for it was always hoped he had some real religion and would deliver them from that babylonish captivity again he married kaiser joseph is daughtermaria theresas cousin and by an elder brotherthis too ought surely to be something in the antipragmatic line it is true kurbaiern has to wife another daughter of kaiser josephs but she is the younger i am senior there at least thinks the foolish man  too true he had finally in past years to sign pragmatic sanction no help for it no hope without it in that polishelection time he will have to eat his covenant therefore as the first step in antipragmatism and he is extremely in doubt as to the how sometimes as to the whether and shifts and whirls accordingly at a great rate in these months and years now on maria theresas side deluded by shadows from vienna and getting into russian partitiontreaties anon tickled by belleisle into the reverse posture then again reversing an idle easytempered yet greedy creature who what with religious apostasy in early manhood what with flaccid ambitions since and idle gapings after shadows has lost helm in this world and will make a very bad voyage for self and country  his palinurus and chief counsellor at present and afterwards is a count von bruhl once page to august the strong now risen to such height bruhl of the three hundred and sixtyfive suits of clothes whom it has grown wearisome even to laugh at a cunning little wretch they say and of deft tongue but surely among the unwisest of all the sons of adam in that day and such a palinurus as seldom steered before kursachsen being reichsvicar in the northern partskurbaiern and kurpfalz as friends and good wittelsbacher cousins surely ought in a crisis like this have agreed to be jointvicars in the southern parts and no longer quarrel upon itkursachsen has a good deal to do in the election preludings formalities and prearrangements and is capable as kurpfalz and cousin always are of serving as chisel to belleisles mallet in such points which will plentifully turn up  5 king of sardiniareichsvicar in the italian parts is charles amadeus king of sardinia tough old victors son whom we have heard of an office mostly honorary suitable to the important individual who keeps the door of the alps charles amadeus had signed the pragmatic sanction but eats his covenant like the others on example of francehaving as he now bethinks himself claims on the milanese there are two claimants on the milanese then the spanish termagant and he yes and they will have their difficulties their extensive tusslings in italian war and otherwise to make an adjustment of it and will give belleisle at least the doorkeeper will an immensity of trouble in years coming  in this way do the pragmatic people eat their own covenant one after the other and are not ashamedtill all have eaten or as good as eaten and almost within year and day pragmatic sanction is a vanished quantity and poor kaiser karls lifelabor is not worth the sheepskin and stationery it cost him history reports in sum that nobody kept the pragmatic sanction that the few strictly speaking the one who acted by it would have done precisely the same though there had never been such a document in existence to george ii it is was and will be the keystone of nature the true antifrench palladium of mankind and he dragging the unwilling dutch after him will do great things for it but nobody else does anything at all might we hope to bid adieu to it in this manner and never to mention it again  document more futile there had not been in nature nor will be friedrich had not yet fought at mollwitz in assertion of his silesian claim when the poor popepoor soul who had no covenant to eat but took pattern by othersclaimed in solemn allocution parma and piacenza for the holy see adelung ii 376 5th april 1741 all the world is claiming of the court of wurtemberg and its protestings and extensive deduction about nothing at all we do not speak ib ii 195 403 nor of montmorency claiming luxemburg of which he is titular duke nor of monsignore di guastalla claiming mantua nor ofin brief the fences are now down a broad french gap in those miles of elaborate paling which are good only as firewood henceforth and any ass may rush in and claim a bellyful great are the works of belleisle     concerning the imperial election kaiserwahl that is to be candidates for kaisership  at equal step with the ruining of pragmatic sanction goes on that spoiling of grandduke franzs election to the kaisership these two operations run parallel or rather under different forms they are one and the same operation to assist as a most christian neighbor ought in picking out the fit kaiser was belleisles ostensible mission and indeed this does include virtually his whole errand till three months after belleisles appearance in the business grandduke franz never doubted but he should be kaiser friedrichs offers to help him in it he had scorned as the offer of a fifth wheel to his chariot already rushing on with four here is kurbohmen austrias own vote counts the grandduke kursachsen doing prussianpartition treaties for us kurtrier our fat little schonborn austrian to the bone kurmainz important chairman regulator of the conclave

resources a little jackthegiantkiller greater than all giants paladin of the pragmatic and us here are six electors of the nine let brandenburg and the bavarian couple kurbaiern and kurkoln do their pleasure this was grandduke franzs calculation  by the time belleisle had been three months in germany the granddukes notion had changed and he began applying to the seapowers to russia and all round in belleisles sixth month the grandduke after such demolition of pragmatic and such disasters and contradictions as had been saw his case to be desperate though he still stuck to it austrianlikeor rather austria for him stuck to it the grandduke being careless of such thingsand indeed privately never did give in even after the election as we shall have to note  the reich itself being mainly a phantasm or enchanted wiggery its kaiserchoosing kaiserwahlnow getting under way at frankfurt with preliminary outskirts at regensburg and in the chancery of mainzis very phantasmal not to say ghastly and forbidding not inviting to the human eye nine kurfursts choosers of teutschlands real captain in none of whom is there much thought for teutschland or its interestsand indeed in hardly more than one of whom prussian friedrich if readers will know it is there the least thought that way but in general much indifference to things divine or diabolic and thought for ones own paltry profits and losses only so it has long been and so it now is more than usualconsider again are enchanted wiggeries a beautiful thing in this extremely earnest world  the kaiserwahl is an affair depending much on processions proclamations on delusions optical acoustic on palaverings manoeuvrings holdings back then hasty pushings forward and indeed is mainly in more senses than one under guidance of the prince of the power of the air unbeautiful like a worldparliament of nightmares if the reader could conceive such a thing huge formless tongueless monsters of that species doing their three readingsunder presidency or chiefpipership as above belleisle for his part is consummately skilful and manages as only himself could keeps his game well hidden not a hint or whisper of it except in studied proportions spreads out his lines his birdlime tickles entices astonishes goes his rounds like a subtle fowler taking captive the minds of men a phoebusapollo god of melody and of the sun filling his net with birds  i believe old kurpfalz for the sake of french neighborhood and bergandjulich were there nothing more was very helpful to himin march past when the election was to have been when it would have gone at once in favor of the grandduke kurpfalz got the election postponed a little postponing procrastinating then again pushing violently on when things are ripe belleisle has only to give signal to a fit kurpfalz in all kurfurst courts the french ambassadors sing diligently to the tune belleisle sets them and courts give ear or will do when the charmer himself arrives  kursachsen as above hinted was his most delicate operation in the charming or trouttickling way and kursachsenand poor saxony ever sinceknows if he did not do it well deduct this kursachsen from the austrian side calculates belleisle add him to ours it is almost an equality of votes kurbaiern our own imperial candidate kurkoln his brother kurpfalz by genealogy his cousin not to mention bergjulich matters here are three wittelsbachers knit together three sure votes king friedrich kurbrandenburg there is a fourth and if kursachsen would join but who knows if kursachsen will the poor soul has himself thoughts of being kaiser then no thoughts and again some thoughts which belleisle knows how to handle yes kaiser you your majesty excellent and sets to consider the methods hm ha hm think your majesty ought not that bohemian vote to be excluded for one thing kurbohmen is fallen into the distaff maria theresa herself cannot vote surely question will rise whether distaff can validly hand it over to distaffs husband as they are about doing whether in fact kurbohmen is not in abeyance for this time so answered kursachsen reichsvicarius and thereupon meetings were summoned nightmare committees sat on this matter under the reichsvicar slowly hatching it and at length brought out kurbohmen not transferable by the distaff kurbohmen in abeyance for this time greatly to the joy of belleisle infinitely to the chagrin of her hungarian majestywho declared it a crying injustice though i believe legally done in every point and by and by even made it a plea of nullity destructive to the election altogether when her hungarian majestys affairs looked up again and the world would listen to austrian sophistries and obstinacies this was an essential service from kursachsen began

kaisership died away into hm ha hm again with a grateful belleisle who nevertheless dexterously retained kursachsen as ally tickling the poor wretch with other baits of the kaiser he had really meant all along there was dead silence except between the parties no whisper heard for six months after it had been agreed upon none for two or near three months after formal settlement and signing and sealing karl alberts treaty with belleisle was 18th may 1741 and he did not declare himself a candidate till 1st4th july following adelung ii 357 421 belleisle understands the nightmare parliaments the electioneering art and how to deal with enchanted wiggeries more perfect master in that sad art has not turned up on record to ones afflicted mind such a sungod and doing such a scavengerism belleisle in the sixth month end of august 1741 feels sure of a majority how belleisle managed after that to checkmate george of england and make even george vote for him and the kaiserwahl to be unanimous against grandduke franz will be seen great are belleisles doings in this world if they were useful either to god or man or to belleisle himself first of all     teutschland to be carved into something of symmetry should the belleisle enterprises succeed  belleisles schemes in the rear of all this labor are grandiose to a degree men wonder at the first napoleons mad notions in that kind but no napoleon in the fire of the revolutionary element no shamnapoleon in the ashes of it hardly a parisian journalist of imaginative turn speculating on the first nation of the universe and what its place iscould go higher than did this grandiose belleisle a man with clear thoughts in his head under a torpid louis xv let me see thinks belleisle germany with our bavarian for kaiser germany to be cut into say four little kingdoms 1 bavaria with the lean kaiserhood 2 saxony fattened by its share of austria 3 prussia the like 4 austria itself shorn down as above and shoved out to the remote hungarian parts voila these not reckoning hanover which perhaps we cannot get just yet are four pretty sovereignties three or two of these hireable by gold it is to be hoped and will not france have a glorious time of it playing master of the revels there egging one against the other yes germany is then what nature designed it a province of france little george of hanover himself and who knows but england after him may one day find their fate inevitable like the others o louis o my king is not this an outlook louis le grand was great but you are likely to be louis the grandest and here is a world shaped at last after the real pattern  such are in sad truth belleisles schemes not yet entirely hatched into daylight or articulation but becoming articulate to himself and others more and more reader keep them well in mind i had rather not speak of them again they are essential to our story but they are afflictively vain contrary to the laws of fact and can now or henceforth in nowise be my friend it was not beelzebub nor mephistopheles nor autolyeusapollo that built this world and us it was another and you will get your crown well rapped m le marechal for so forgetting that fact france is an extremely pretty creature but this of making france the supreme governor and godsvicegerent of nations is was and remains one of the maddest notions france at its ideal best and with a demigod for king over it were by no means fit for such function nay of many nations is eminently the unfittest for it and france at its worst or nearly so with a louis xv over it by way of demigodo belleisle what kind of france is this shining in your grandiose imagination in such contrast to the stingy fact like a creature consisting of two enormous wings five hundred yards in potential extent and no body bigger than that of a common cock weighing three pounds avoirdupois cock with his own gizzard much out of sorts too  it was early in march adelung ii 305 when belleisle the artificial sungod quitted paris on this errand he came by the moselle road called on the rhine kurfursts koln trier mainz dazzling them so far as possible with his splendor for the mind and for the eye he proceeded next to dresden which is a main card and where there is immense manipulation needed and the most delicate trouttickling this being a skittish fish and an important though a foolish belleisle was at dresden when the battle of mollwitz fell out what a windfall into belleisles game he ran across to friedrich at mollwitz to congratulate to consultas we shall see anon  belleisle i am informed in this preliminary tour of his speaks only or hints only except in the proper quarters of election business of the need there perhaps is on the part of an age growing in liberal ideas to exclude the austrian grandduke to curb that ponderous harsh ungenerous house of austria too long lording it over generous germany and to set up some better housebavaria for example saxony for example of his plans in the rear of this he is silent speaks only by hints by innuendoes to the proper parties but ripening or ripe plans do lie to rear farstretching highsoaring in part dark even at versailles darkly fermenting not yet developed in belleisles own head only the future kaiser a luminous fixed point shooting beams across the grandiose creationprocess going on there  by the end of august 1741 belleisle had become certain of his game 24th january 1742 he saw himself as if winner before august 1741 he had got his electors manipulated tickled to his purpose by the witchery of a phoebusautolycus or diplomatic sungod majority secured for a bavarian kaiser and against an austrian one and in the course of that monthwhat was still more considerablehe was getting under mild pretexts about a hundred thousand armed frenchmen gently wafted over upon the soil of germany two complete french armies 40000 each plus their reserves one over the upper rhine one over the lower about which we shall hear a great deal in time coming under mild pretexts peaceable as lambs dont you observe merely to protect freedom of election in this fine neighbor country and as allies to our friend of bavaria should he chance to be new kaiser and to persist in his modest claims otherwise this was his crowning stroke which finished straightway the remnants of pragmatic sanction and of every obstacle and in a shining manner swept the roads clear and so on january 24th following the election long held back by belleisles manoeuvrings actually takes effectin favor of karl albert our invaluable bavarian friend austria is left solitary in the reich pragmatic sanction keystone of nature which belleisle and france had sworn to keep in is openly torn out by belleisle and by france and the majority of mankind and belleisle sees himself to all appearance winner  this was the harvest reaped by belleisle within year and day after endless manoeuvring such as only a belleisle in the character of diplomatic sungod could do beyond question the distracted ambitions of several german princes have been kindled by belleisle what we called the rotten thatch of germany is well on fire this diligent sowing in the reichto judge by the 100000 armed men here and the counter hundreds of thousands arminghas been a pretty stroke of dragonsteeth husbandry on belleisles part     belleisle on visit to friedrich sees friedrich besiege brieg with effect  it was april 26th when marechal de belleisle with his brother the chevalier with valori and other bright accompaniment arrived in friedrichs camp camp of mollwitz so named between mollwitz and brieg where friedrich is still resting in a vigilant expectant condition and except it be the taking of brieg has nothing military on hand wednesday 26th april the distinguished excellencyescorted for the last three miles by 120 horse and the other customary ceremoniesmakes his appearance no doubt an interesting one to friedrich for this and the days next following their talk is not reported anywhere nor is it said with exactitude how far whether wholly now or only in part now belleisle expounded his sublime ideas to friedrich or what precise reception they got friedrich himself writes long afterwards of the event but as usual without precision except in general effect now or some time after friedrich says he found belleisle one morning with brow clouded knit into intense meditation have you had bad news m le marechal asks friedrich no oh no i am considering what we shall make of that moraviamoravia hm friedrich suppresses the glance that is rising to his eyes cant you give it to saxony then buy saxony into the plan with it excellent answers belleisle and unpuckers his stern brow again  friedrich thinks highly and about this time often says so of the man belleisle but as to the mans effulgencies and widewinged plans none is less seduced by them than friedrich your chickens are not hatched m le marechal some of us hope they never will bethough the incubationprocess may have uses for some of us friedrich knows that the kaisership given to any other than grandduke franz will be mostly an imaginary quantity a grand symbolic cloak in the eyes of the vulgar but empty of all things empty even of cash for the last two hundred years austria can wear it to advantage no other mortal hang it on austria which is a solid human figureso and friedrich wishes and hopes always maria theresa will agree with him and get it for her husband but to hang it on bavaria which is a lean bare pole oh m le marechaland those four kingdoms of yours what a brood of poultry those chickens happily yet unhatchedeggs addle i should venture to hopeonly do go on incubating m le marechal that is friedrichs notion of the thing belleisle stayed with friedrich a few days say the books after which friedrich finding belleisle too winged a creature corresponded in preference with fleury and the head sourceswho are always intensely enough concerned about those aces falling to him and how the same are to be shared details in heldengeschichte i 912 962 916 in oeuvres de frederic ii 79 80 c  instead of parade or review in honor of belleisle there happened to be a far grander military show of the practical kind the siege of brieg the opening of the trenches before brieg chanced to be just ready on belleisles arrivaland would have taken effect we find that very night april 26th had not a sudden wintry outburst or tempest of extraordinary violence prevented next night night of the 27th28th under shine of the full moon in the open champaign country on both sides of the river it did take effect an uncommonly fine thing of its sort as one can still see by reading friedrichs strict program for ita most minute precise and allanticipating program which still interests military men as friedrichs first piece in that kindand comparing therewith the narratives of the performance which ensued ordre und dispositiones sic wornach sich der

in position with a proper set of mortars other side the riverready to astonish piccolomini and his austrians who had not had the least whisper of them all night though it was full moon graf von piccolomini an active gallant person had refused terms some time before and was hopefully intent on doing his best and now suddenly there rose round piccolomini such a tornado of cannonading and bombardment day after day always three guns of ours playing against one of theirs that his guns got ruined that his haymagazines took fireand the schloss itself which was adjacent to them took fire a sad thing to friedrich who commanded pause that they might try quenching but in vainand that in short piccolomini could not stand it but on the 4th of may precisely after one weeks experience hung out the white flag and beat chamade at 3 of the afternoon he was allowed to march out next morning with escort to neisse parole pledged not to serve against us for two years coming  friedrich in person i rather guess belleisle not now at his side saw the garrison march outkept piccolomini to dinner a gallant piccolomini who had hoped to do better but could not this was a pretty enough piece of siegepractice torstenson with his swedes had furiously besieged brieg in 1642 a hundred years ago and could do nothing to it nothing but withdraw again futile leaving 1400 of his people dead friedrich the austrian garrison once out set instantly about repairing the works and improving them into impregnabilityour ugly friend walrave presiding over that operation too  belleisle we may believe so long as he continued was full of polite wonder over these things perhaps had critical advices here and there which would be politely received it is certain he came out extremely brilliant gifted and agreeable in the eyes of friedrich who often afterwards not in the very strictest language calls him a great man great soldier and by far the considerablest person you french have it is no less certain belleisle displayed so far as displayable his magnificent diplomatic ware to the best advantage to which we perceive the young king answered magnificent indeed but would not bite all at once and rather preferred corresponding with fleury on business points keeping the matter dexterously hanging in an illuminated element of hope and contingency for the present  belleisle after we know not how many days returned to dresden perfected his work at dresden or shoved it well forward with that moravia as bait yes king of moravia you your polish majesty shall beand it is said the simple creature did so style himself by and by in certain rare manifestoes which still exist in the cabinets of the curious belleisle next after only a few days went to munchen to operate on karl albert kurbaiern a willing subject and in short belleisle whirled along incessantly torch in hand making his circuit of the german courtsdetails of said circuit not to be followed by us farther one small thing only i have found rememberable probably true though vague at munchen still more out at nymphenburg the fine countrypalace not far off there was of course long conferencing long consulting secret and intense between belleisle with his people and karl albert with his karl albert as we know was himself willing but a certain baron von unertlheavybuilt bavarian of the old type an old stager in the bavarian ministrieswas of far other disposition one day out at nymphenburg unertl got to the councilroom while belleisle and company were there unertl found the apartment locked absolutely no admittance and heard voices the kurfursts and french voices eagerly at work inside admit me gracious herr um gottes willen me no admission unertl in despair rushed round to the garden side of the apartment desperately snatched a ladder set it up to the window and conjured the gracious highness for the love of heaven my allergnadigster dont have no trade with those french remember your illustrious father kurfurst max in the eugenemarlborough time what a job he made of it building actual architecture on their big promises which proved mere acres of gilt balloon hormayr anemonen cited above ii 152 words terribly prophetic but they were without effect on karl albert  the rest of belleisles inflammatory circuitings and extensive travellings for he had many first and last in this matter shall be left to the fancy of the reader may 18th he made formal treaty with karl albert treaty of nymphenburg karl albert to be kaiser bavaria with austria proper added to it a kingdom french armies french moneys and other fine items given in adelung ii 359 treaty to be kept dead secret king friedrich for the present would not accede given in adelung ii 421 june 25th after some preliminary survey of the place belleisle made his entry into frankfurt magnificent in the extreme and still did not rest there but had to rush about back to versailles to dresden hither thither it was not till the last day of july that he fairly took up his abode in frankfurt andthe election eggs so to speak being now all laidset himself to hatch the same a process which lasted him six months longer with curious phenomena to mankind not till the middle of august did he bring those 80000 armed frenchmen across the rhine to secure peace in those parts and freedom of voting not till november 4th had kursachsen with the nightmares finished that important problem of the bohemian vote bohemian vote excluded for this timeafter which all was ready though still not in the least hurry november 20th came the first actual electionconference wahlconferenz in the romer at frankfurt to which succeeded two months more of conferrings upon almost nothing at all and finally 24th january 1742 came the election itself karl albert the man poor wretch who never saw another good day in this world  belleisle during those six months was rather high and airy extremely magnificent but did not want discretion more like a kurfurst than an ambassador capable of visiting kurmainz with servants purposely in old liverieswhere the case needed old where kurmainz needed snubbing not otherwise buchholz ii 57 n the marechal de belleisle says an eyewitness of some fame in those days comes out in a variety of parts among us here plays now the general now the philosopher now the minister of state now the french marquisand does them all to perfection surely a master in his art his brother the chevalier is one of the sensiblest and besttrained persons you can see he has a penetrating intellect is always occupied and full of great schemes and has nevertheless a staid kind of manner he is one of the most important personages here and in all things his brothers right hand von loen kleine schriften cited in adelung ii 400 in frankfurt both belleisle and his brother were much respected the brother especially as men of dignified behavior and shining qualities but as to their hundred and thirty french lords and other valetry these by their extravagances and excesses ausschweifungen made themselves extremely detestable it would appear buchholz ii 54 in adelung ii 398 n a french brocard on the

ii had seen all along with natural manifold aversion and indignation these high attempts of his nephew who is this new little king that will not let himself be snubbed and laughed at and led by the nose as his father did but seems to be taking a road of his own and tacitly defying us all a very high conduct indeed for a sovereign of that magnitude aspires seemingly to be the leader among german princes to reduce hanover and usus with the gold of england in our breechespocketto the second place a reverend old bishop of liege twitched by the rochet and shaken hither and thither like a reverend old clothesscreen till he agree to stand still and conform and now a silesia seized upon a pragmatic sanction kicked to the winds the whole world to be turned topsyturvy and hanover and us with our breechespocket reduced to  the emotions the prognosticatings and distracted procedures of his britannic majesty of which we have ourselves seen somewhat in this fermentation of the elements are copiously set down for us by the english dryasdust mostly in unintelligible form but except for sane purposes one must be careful not to dwell on them to the sorrow of readers seldom was there such a feat of somnambulism as that by the english and their king in the next twenty years to extract the particle of sanity from it and see how the poor english did get their own errand done withal and jenkinss ear avengedthat is the one interesting point dryasdust and the nightmares shall to all time be welcome to the others here are some excerpts a select few which will perhaps be our readiest expedient these do under certain main aspects shadow forth the intricate posture of king george and his nation when belleisle as protagonistes or chief bully stept down into the ring in that manner asking is there an antagonistes then or chief defender i will label them number them and with the minimum of needful commentary leave them to imaginative readers     no 1 snatch of parliamentary eloquence by mr viner 19th april 1741  the fuliginous explosions more or less volcanic which went on in parliament and in english society against friedrichs silesian enterprise for long years from this date are now all dead and avoidablethough they have left their effects among us to this day perhaps readers would like to see the one reasonable word i have fallen in with of opposite tendency mr viners word at the first starting of that question plainly sensible word which had it been attended to as it was not might have saved us so much nonsense not of idle talk only but of extremely serious deed which ensued thereupon  london 19th april 1741 this day mollwitz not yet known camp of gottin too well known king george in his own high person comes down to the house of lordswhich like the other house is sunk painfully in walpole controversies spanishwar controversies of a merely domestic natureand informs both honorable houses with extreme caution naming nobody that he much wishes they would think of helping him in these alarming circumstances of the celestial balance ready apparently to go heels uppermost to which the general answer is yes surelywith a vote of 300000 pounds for her hungarian majesty a few days hence from those continents of parliamentary tufa now fallen so waste and mournful here is one little piece which ought to be extricated into daylight  mr viner on his legs if i mistake not the true intention of the address proposed in answer to his majestys most gracious speech from the throne we are invited to declare that we will oppose the king of prussia in his attempts upon silesia a declaration in which i see not how any man can concur who knows not the nature of his prussian majestys claim and the laws of the german empire nor do i mr v it ought therefore sir to have been the first endeavor of those by whom this address has been so zealously supported to show that his prussian majestys claim so publicly explained by kauzler ludwig of halle who it seems has staggered or convinced mr viner so firmly urged and so strongly supported is without foundation and reason and is only one of those imaginary titles which ambition may always find to the dominions of another hear mr viner tindal xx 491 gives the royal speech date in a very slobbery condition see also coxe house of austria iii 365 viners fragment of a speech is in thackeray life of chatham i 87  a most indispensable thing surely which was never done nor can ever be done but was assumed as either unnecessary or else done of its own accord by that collective wisdom of england with a sage george ii at the head of it who plunged into dettingen fontenoy austrian subsidies aixlachapelle and foundation of the english national debt among other strange things in consequence  upon that of kanzler ludwig and the so public explanation which we slightly heard of long since here is another noteunless readers prefer to skip it  that the diplomatic and political world is universally in travail at this time no reader need be told europe everywhere in dim anxiety heavyladen expectation which to us has fallen so vacant looking towards inevitable changes and the huge inane all in travailand already uttering printed manifestoes patents deductions and other public travailshrieks of that kind printed not to speak of the unprinted of the oral which vanished on the spot or even of the written which were shot forth by breathless estafettes and unhappily did not vanish but lie in archives still humming upon us wont you read me thenalas except on compulsion no life being precious and time which is the stuff of life no  at reinsberg as elsewhere at reinsberg first of all it had been felt in october last that there would be manifestoes needed learned proof the more irrefragable the better of our right to silesia it was settled there let ludwig kanzler of the university of halle do it herr kanzler ludwig monster of antiquarian legal and other learning there wealthy too and closefisted whom we have seen obliged to open his closed fist and to do building in the friedrich strasse before now nussler his soninlaw having no moneyas careless readers have perhaps forgotten ludwig set about his new task with a proud joy ludwig knows that story if he know anything long years ago he put forth a chapter upon it weighty chapter in a book of weight said judgesbook weighing in pounds avoirdupois and otherwise none of us now knows what title of this weighty performance see preuss thronbesteigung p 432 is or was size not given germania princeps halae 1702 preuss says farther that book ii c 3 handles the prussian claims jagerndorf being 13 liegnitz 14 oppeln and ratibor 16and that ludwig had sent a copy of this argument weighty performance altogether or book ii c 3 of it which would have had a better chance to king friedrich on the death of kaiser karl vibut in after years it used to be said by flatterers of the kanzler herr kanzler see the effect of learning it was you it was your weighty book that caused all this worldtumult and flung the nations into one anothers hair upon which the old kanzler would blush you do me too much honor  ludwig directly on order given gathered out his documents again in the kings name this time and promised something weighty by newyears day at latest doubtless to the joy of nussler who has still no regular appointment though well deserving one and sure enough on january 7th at berlin in three languages ludwigs deduction had come out an eager public waiting for it title is rechtsgegrundetes eigenthum in the latin copies patrimonium and propriete fondee en droit in the french copies des cthat is to say legal right of property in the royalelectoral house of brandenburg to the duchies and principalities of jagerndorf liegnitz brieg wohlau berlin 7th january 1741and at berlin it was generally thought to be conclusive i have looked into ludwigs deduction stern duty urging in this instance for one such portions as i read are nothing like so stupid as was expected and in fact are not to be called stupid at all but fit for their purpose and moderately intelligible to those who need themwhich happily we do not in this place  judicious mr viner availed nothing against the proposed address any more than he would against the atlantic tide coming in unanimous under influence of the moon itselfas indeed this address and the triumphant subsidy which was voted in the rear of it may be said to have done coxe iii 265 subsidy of 300000 pounds to her hungarian majesty which with the 200000 pounds already gone that road makes a handsome halfmillion for the present year the first gush of the britannia fountainwhich flowed like an amaltheas horn for seven years to come refreshing austria and all thirsty pragmatic nations to defend the keystone of this universe unluckily every guinea of it went at the same time to encourage austria in scorning king friedrichs offers to it which perhaps are just offers thinks mr viner which once listened to pragmatic sanction would be safe mr viner was of pupham or pupholm in lincolnshire for which county he sat then and for many years before and afterfrom about 1713 till 1761 when he died a solid instructed man say his contemporaries he was a friend of bolingbrokes and had a house near bolingbrokes battersea one he is great greatgrandfather to the present mr viner and to the countess de grey and ripon which is an interesting little fact  this parliament is strong for pragmatic sanction and has high resentments against walpole in both which points the new parliament just getting elected will rival and surpass itespecially in the latter point that of uprooting walpole which the nation is bent on with a singular fury pragmatic sanction like to be ruined and walpole furiously thrown out what a pair of sorrows for poor george during his late carolines time all went peaceably and that of governing was a mere pleasure walpole and caroline cunningly doing that for him and making him believe he was doing it but now has come the crisis the collapse and his poor majesty left alone to deal with it     no 2 constitutional historian on the phenomenon of walpole in england  for above ten years walpole himself says my constitutional historian unpublished for almost twenty years walpole virtually and through others has what they call governed england that is to say has adjusted the conflicting parliamentary chaos into counterpoise by what methods he had and allowed england with walpole atop to jumble whither it would and could of crooked things made straight by walpole of heroic performance or intention legislative or administrative by walpole nobody ever heard never of the least handbreadth gained from the nightrealm in england on walpoles part enough if he could manage to keep the parish constable walking and himself float atop which task though intrinsically zero for the community but allimportant to the walpole of constitutional countries is a task almost beyond the faculty of man if the careless reader knew it  this task walpole didin a sturdy deepbellied longheaded johnbull fashion not unworthy of recognition a man of very forcible natural eyesight strong natural heartcourage in him to all lengths a very block of oak or of oakroot for natural strength he was always very quiet with it too given to digest his victuals and be peaceable with everybody he had one rule that stood in place of many to keep out of every business which it was possible for human wisdom to stave aside what good will you get of going into that parliamentary criticism argument and botheration leave well alone and even leave ill aloneare you the tradesman to tinker leaky vessels in england you will not want for work mind your pudding and say little at home and abroad that was the safe secret for in foreign politics his rule was analogous mind your own affairs you are an island you can do without foreign politics peace keep peace with everybody what in the devils name have you to do with those dogworryings over seas once more mind your pudding not so bad a rule indeed it is the better part of an extremely good oneand you might reckon it the real rule for a pious rritannic island reverent of god and contemptuous of the devil in times of general downbreak and spiritual bankruptcy when quarrellings of sovereigns are apt to be mere dogworryings and devils work not good to interfere in  in this manner walpole by solid johnbull faculty and methods of his own had balanced the parliamentary swaggings and clashings for a great while and england had jumbled whither it could always in a stupid but also in a peaceable way as to those same methods of his own they werein fact they were bribery actual purchase of votes by money slipt into the hand go straight to the point the direct real method this thinks walpole is there in reality any other a terrible question to constitutional countries which i hear has never been resolved in the negative by the modern improvements of science changes of form have introduced themselves the outward process i hear is now quite different according as the fashions and conditions alteraccording as you have a fourth estate developed or a fourth estate still in the grub stage and only developingmuch variation of outward process is conceivable  but votes under pain of death official are necessary to your poor walpole and votes i hear are still bidden for and bought you may buy them by money down which is felony and theft simple against the poor nation or by preferments and appointments of the unmeritorious manwhich is felony doubledistilled far deadlier though more refined and theft most compound theft not of the poor nations money but of its soul and body so far and of all its moneys and temporal and spiritual interests whatsoever theft you may say of collops cut from its side and poison put into its heart poor nation or again you may buy not of the third estate in such ways but of the fourth or of the fourth and third together in other still more felonious and deadly though refined ways by doing claptraps namely letting off parliamentary bluelights to awaken the sleeping swineries and charm them into diapason for youwhat a music or without claptrap or previous felony of your own you may feloniously in the pinch of things make truce with the evident demagogos and son of nox and of perdition who has got within those walls of yours and is grown important to you by the awakened swineries risen into alt that follow him him you may in your dire hunger of votes consent to comply with his anarchies you will pass for him into laws as you are pleased to term theminstead of pointing to the whippingpost and to his wicked long ears which are so fit to be nailed there and of sternly recommending silence which were the salutary thingbuying may be done in a great variety of ways the question how you buy is not on the moral side an important one nay as there is a beauty in going straight to the point and by that course there is likely to be the minimum of mendacity for you perhaps the direct moneymethod is a shade less damnable than any of the others since discoveredwhile in regard to practical damage resulting it is of childlike harmlessness in comparison  that was walpoles method with this to aid his great natural faculty longheaded deepbellied suitable to the english parliament and nation he went along with perfect success for ten or twenty years and it might have been for longerhad not the english nation accidentally come to wish that it should cease jumbling nowhither and try to jumble somewhither at least for a little while on important business that had risen for england in a certain quarter had it not been for jenkinss ear blazing out in the dark english brain walpole might have lasted still a long while but his fate lay therethe first business vital to england which might turn up and this chanced to be the spanish war how vital readers shall see anon walpole knowing well enough in what state his warapparatus was and that of all his apparatuses there was none in a working state but the parliamentary oneresisted the spanish war stood in the door against it with a rhinoceros determination nay almost something of a mastiffs resolute not to admit it to admit death as soon doubtless he had a feeling it would be death the sagacious manand such it is now proving the walpole ministry dying by inches from it dying hard but irremediably  the english nation was immensely astonished which walpole was not any more than at the other laws of nature to find walpoles warapparatus in such a condition all his apparatuses walpole guesses are in no better if it be not the parliamentary one the english nation is immensely astonished which walpole again is not to find that his parliamentary apparatus has been kept in gear and smoothgoing by the use of oil miraculous scandal of scandals thinks the english nation miracle law of nature you fools thinks walpole and in fact there is such a storm roaring in england in those and in the late and the coming months as threatens to be dangerous to high roofsdangerous to walpoles head at one time storm such as had not been witnessed in mens memory all manner of counties and constituencies with solemn indignation charging their representatives to search into that miraculous scandal of scandals law of nature or whatever it may be and abate the same at their peril  to the now reader there is something almost pathetic in these solemn indignations and high resolves to have purity of parliament and thorough administrative reform in spite of nature and the constitutional starsand nothing i have met with not even the prussian dryasdust is so unsufferably wearisome or can pretend to equal in depth of dull inanity to ingenuous living readers our poor english dryasdusts interminable oftenrepeated narratives volume after volume of the debatings and colleaguings the tossings and tumults fruitless and endless in nation and national palaver which ensued thereupon walpole in about a year hence february 13th 2d 1742 quitting the house after bad usage there said he would never enter it again nor did february 22d resigned in favor of pulteney and company tindal xx 530 thackeray i 45 though he struck to the ground like a rhinoceros was got rolled out and a successor and series of successors in the bright brandnew state was got rolled in with immense shouting from mankindbut up to this date we have no reason to believe that the laws of nature were got abrogated on that occasion or that the constitutional stars have much altered their courses since  that walpole will probably be lost goes much home to the royal bosom in these troublous spring months of 1741 as it has done and will do and here emerging from the spanish main just now is a second sorrow which might quite transfix the royal bosom and drive majesty itself to despair awakening such insoluble questionsfurnishing such proof that walpole and a good few other persons persons and also things and ideas and practices deeprooted in the country stand much in need of being lost if england is to go a good road  the spanish war being of moment to us here we will let our constitutional historian explain in his own dialect how it was so vital to england and shall even subjoin what he gives as history of it such being so admirably succinct for one quality     no 3 of the spanish war or the jenkinssear question  there was real cause for a war with spain it is one of the few cases this of a war from necessity spain by decree of the popesome pope long ago whose name we will not remember in solemn conclave drawing accurately his meridian line on i know not what telluric or uranic principles no doubt with great accuracy between portugal and spainwas proprietor of all those seas and continents and now england in the interim by decree of the eternal destinies had clearly come to have property there too and to be practically much concerned in that theoretic question of the popes meridian there was no reconciling of theory with fact ours indisputably said spain with loud articulate voice holiness the pope made it ourswhile fact and the english by decree of the eternal destinies had been grumbling inarticulately the other way for almost two hundred years past and no result had  in oliver cromwells time it used to be said with spain in europe there may be peace or war but between the tropics it is always war a state of things well recognized by oliver and acted on according to his opportunities no settlement was had in olivers brief time nor could any be got since when it was becoming yearly more pressing bucaniers desperate naval gentlemen living on boucan or hung beef who are also called flibustiers flibutiers freebooters in french pronunciation which is since grown strangely into filibusters fillibustiers and other mad forms in the yankee newspapers now current readers have heard of those dumb methods of protest dumb and furious which could bring no settlement but which did astonish the popes decree slashing it with cutlasses and seacannon in that manner and circuitously forwarded a settlement settlement was becoming yearly more needful and ever since the treaty of utrecht especially there had been an incessant haggle going on to produce one without the least effect hitherto what embassyings bargainings bargainbreakings what galloping of estafettes acres of diplomatic paper now fallen to the spiders who always privately were the real owners not in the treaty of utrecht not in the congresses of cambray of soissons convention of pardo by ripperda horace walpole or the wagging of wigs could this matter be settled at all near two hundred years of chronic miseryand had there been under any of those wigs a head capable of reading the heavenly mandates with heart capable of following them the misery might have been briefly ended by a direct method with what immense saving in all kinds compared with the oblique method gone upon in quantity of bloodshed needed of money of idle talk and estafettes not to speak of higher considerations the saving had been incalculable for it was englands one cause of war during the century we are now upon and poor englands course when at last driven into it went ambiguously circling round the whole universe instead of straight to the mark had oliver cromwell lived ten years longerbut oliver cromwell did not live and instead of heroic heads there came in constitutional wigs which makes a great difference  the pretensions of spain to keep half the world locked up in embargo were entirely chimerical plainly contradictory to the laws of nature and no amount of popes donation acts or ceremonial in rota or propaganda could redeem them from untenability in the modern days to lie like a dog in the manger over south america and say snarling none of you shall trade here though i cannotwhat pope or body of popes can sanction such a procedure had england had a head instead of wigs amid its diplomatists england as the chief party interested would have long since intimated gently to such dog in the manger dog will you be so obliging as rise i am grieved to say we shall have to do unpleasant things otherwise dogs have doors for their hutches but to pretend barring the tropic of cancerthat is too big a door for any dog can nobody but you have business here then which is not displeasing to the gods we bid you rise and in this mode there is no doubt the dog bark and bite as he might would have ended by rising not only england but all the universe being against him and furthermore i compute with certainty the quantity of fighting needed to obtain such result would by this mode have been a minimum the clear right being there and now also the clear might why take refuge in diplomatic wiggeries in assiento treaties and arrangements which are not analogous to the facts which are but wigged mendacities therefore and will but aggravate in quantity and in quality the fighting yet needed fighting is but as has been well said a battering out of the mendacities pretences and imaginary elements well batteredout these like dust and chaff fly torrentwise along the winds and darken all the sky but these once gone there remain the facts and their visible relation to one another and peace is sure  the assiento treaty being fixed upon the english ought to have kept it but the english did not in any measure nor could pretend to have done they were entitled to supply negroes in such and such number annually to the spanish plantations and besides this delightful branch of trade to have the privilege of selling certain quantities of their manufactured articles on those coasts quantities regulated briefly by this stipulation that their assiento ship was to be of 600 tons burden so many and no more the assiento ship was duly of 600 tons accordingly promise kept faithfully to the eye but the assiento ship was attended and escorted by provisionsloops small craft said to be of the most indispensable nature to it which provisionsloops and indispensable small craft not only carried merchandise as well but went and came to jamaica and back under various pretexts with ever new supplies of merchandise converting the assiento ship into a floating shop the tons burden and tons sale of which set arithmetic at defiance this was the fact perfectly well known in england veiled over by mere smuggler pretences and obstinately persisted in so profitable was it perfectly well known in spain also and to the spanish guardacostas and seacaptains in those parts who were naturally kept in a perennial state of rage by itand disposed to fly out into flame upon it when a bad case turned up such a case that of jenkins had seemed to them and their mode of treating it by tearing off mr jenkinss ear proved to bebad shall we say or goodintolerable to englands thick skin and brought matters to a crisis in the ways we saw  the jenkinssear question which then looked so mad to everybody how sane has it now grown to my constitutional friend in abstruse ludicrous form there lay immense questions involved in it which were serious enough certain enough though invisible to everybody half the world lay hidden in embryo under it colonialempire whose is it to be shall half the world be englands for industrial purposes which is innocent laudable conformable to the multiplicationtable at least and other plain laws or shall it be spains for arroganttorpid shamdevotional purposes contradictory to every law the incalculable yankee nation itself biggest phenomenon once thought beautifulest of these agesthis too little as careless readers on either side of the sea now know it lay involved shall there be a yankee nation shall there not be shall the new world be of spanish type shall it be of english issues which we may call immense among the then extant sons of adam where was he who could in the faintest degree surmise what issues lay in the jenkinssear question and it is curious to consider now with what fierce deepbreathed doggedness the poor english nation drawn by their instincts held fast upon it and would take no denial as if they had surmised and seen for the instincts of simple guileless persons liable to be counted stupid by the unwary are sometimes of prophetic nature and spring from the deep places of this universemy constitutional friend entitles his next section carthagena but might more fitly have headed it for such in reality it is carthagena proving the evanescent point of that sad business     succinct history of the spanish war which began in 1739 and

towns like a kind of christmas when it came round nature having deigned to produce such a man for a poor nation in difficulties invincible vernon it is thought by gazetteers will look in at carthagena shortly much more important place where a certain governor don blas has been insolent withal and written vernon letters  2 preliminaries to carthagena marchnovember 1740monday 14th march 1740 vernon did accordingly look in on carthagena gentlemans magazine x 350 cast anchor in the shallow waste of surfs there that monday and tried some bombarding with bombketches and the like from thursday till saturday following vernon hopes he did hit the jesuits college south bastion customhouse and other principal edifices but found that there was no getting near enough on that seaward side found that you must force the interior harbora big inland gulf or lake which gushes in by what they call littlemouth bocachica and has its booms castles and defences which are numerous and strongishand that for this end you must have seven or eight thousand land forces as well as an addition of ships on saturday evening therefore vernon calls in his bombketches sails past examining these things and goes forth on other small adventures for example  sunday 3d april 1740 about 10 at night opens cannonade on chagres place often enough taken by cutlass and pistol in the bucanier times and on tuesday 5th gets surrender of chagres customhouse crammed with goods which we set fire to on news of which there is again in england joy over the day of small things the poor english people are set on this business of avenging jenkinss ear and of having the ocean highway unbarred and hope always it can be done by the walpole apparatuses which ought to be in working order and are not support this hero you walpole and company in his carthagena views it will be better for you  walpole and company aware of that fact do take some trouble about it and now may not we say paullo majora canamus all through that summer 1740while king friedrich went rushing about to strasburg to wesel doing his herstals and practicalities with a light high hand in almost an entertaining manner and intent still more on his voltaires and a life to the musesthere was in england serious heavy tumult of activity secret and public in the dockyards on the drillgrounds what a stir camp in the isle of wight not to mention portsmouth and the seaindustries 6000 marines are to be embarked as well as land regimentscan anybody guess whither america itself is to furnish one regiment with scotch officers to discipline it if they can  here is real haste and effort but by no means such speed as could be wished multiplex confusions and contradictions occurring as is usual when your machinery runs foul nor are the gazetteers without their guesses though they study to be discreet here is something considerable in the wind a grand idea for certainand to men of discernment it points surely towards carthagena and heroic vernon out yonder government is dumb altogether and lays occasional embargo trying hard without success in the delays that occurred to keep it secret from don blas and others the outcome of all which

through endless sorrows contradictions toils and confusions you will do your errand in some measure and that will be something  five weeks before 29th september 1740 which was also several months beyond time set there had sailed strictly hidden by embargoes which were little effectual another expedition all naval intended to be subsidiary to this one commodore ansons of three inconsiderable ships who is to go round cape horn if he can to bombard spanish america from the other side and stretch out a hand to vernon in his grand carthagena or ulterior views together they may do some execution if we judge by the old bucanier and queenelizabeth experiences ansons expedition has become famous in the world though vernon got no good of it  well here truly was a business not so illcontrived somebody of head must have been at the centre of this and it might in result have astonished the spaniard and tumbled him much topsyturvy in those latitudeshad the machinery for executing it been well in gear under friedrich wilhelms captaincy and management every person every item correct to its time to its place to its function what a thing but with mere walpole machinery alas it was far too wide a plan for machinery of that kind habitually out of order and only used to be as correct asas it could those delays themselves first to anson then to ogle since the tropical almanac would not delay along with them had thrown both enterprises into weather such as all but meant impossibility in those latitudes this was irremediablehad not been remediable by efforts and pushings here and there the best of management as under anson could not get the better of this worst of management as in the other case was likely to make a fine thing of it let us hasten on  january 20th 1741 we arrive through much rough weather and other confused hardships at port royal in jamaica find vernon waiting on the slip the american regiment tolerably drilled by the scotch lieutenants in full readiness and equipment a body of negroes superadded by way of pioneer laborers fit for those hot climates one sad loss there had been on the voyage hither land forces had lost their commander and did not find another general cathcart had died of sickness on the voyage a charles lord cathcart who was understood to possess some knowledge of his business and his successor one wentworth did not happen to have any which was reckoned unlucky by the more observant vernon though in haste for carthagena is in some anxiety about a powerful french fleet which has been manoeuvring in those waters for some time intent on no good that vernon can imagine the first thing now is see into that french fleet french fleet on our going to look in the proper island is found to be all off for home men mostly starved or otherwise dead we hear so that now after this last short delayto carthagena with all sail  wednesday evening 15th march 1741 we anchor in the playa grande the waste surfy shallow which washes carthagena seaward 124 sail of us big and little we find don blas in a very prepared posture don blas has been doing his best this twelvemonth past plugging up that bocachica little mouth ingate with batteries booms great ships and has castles not a few thereabouts and in the interior lake or harbor all which he has put in tolerable defence so far as can be judged not an inactive if an insolent don we spend the next five days in considering and surveying these performances of his what is to be done with them how in the first place we may force bocachica and get in upon his interior castles and him after consideration and plan fixed  monday 20th march sir chaloner with broadsides sweeps away some small defences which lie to left of bocachica to our left to bocachicas right if anybody cares to be particular whereupon the troops land some of them that same evening and within the next two days are all ashore implements negroes and the rest building batteries felling wood intent to capture bocachica castle and demolish the warships booms and fry of fascine and other batteries and thereby to get in upon don blas and have a stroke at his interior castles and carthagena itself till april 5th here are sixteen days of furious intricate work not ill donethe physical labor itself the building of batteries with bocachica firing on you over the woods is scarcely doable by europeans in that season and the negroes who are able for it fling down their burdens and scamper whenever a gun goes off furious fighting too there was by seamen and landsmen not ill done considering circumstances  on the sixteenth day april 5th king friedrich hurrying from the mountains that same day towards steinau which took fire with him at night bocachica castle and the intricate warships booms and castles thereabouts don blas running off when the push became intense are at last got so that now through bocachica we enter the interior harbor or harbors harbors which are of wide extent and deep enough being in fact a lake or rather pair of lakes with castles castillo grande castle grand the chief of them with warships sunk or afloat and miscellaneous obstructions beyond all which at the farther shore some five miles off carthagena itself does at last lie potentially accessible and we hope to get in upon don blas and it there ensue five days of intricate seawork not much of broadsiding mainly tugging out of sunk warships and the like to get alongside of castle grand which is the chief obstruction  april 10 castle grand itself is got nobody found in it when we storm don blas and the spaniards seem much in terror burning any ships they still have near carthagena as if there were no chance now left this is the very day of mollwitz battle near about the hour when schwerin broke into fieldmusic and advanced with thunderous glitter against the evening sun carthagena expedition is at length fairly in contact with its problemthe question rising do you understand it then  up to this point mistakes of management had been made good by obstinate energy of execution clear victory had gone on so far the capture of carthagena now seemingly at hand one thing was unfortunate the able mr moor meritorious captain of foot who by accident had spent some study on his business the one real engineer we had got killed in that bocachica struggle an end to poor moor so that the siege of carthagena will have to go on without engineer science henceforth may be important thatwho knows another thing was still more palpably important seageneral vernon had an undisguised contempt for landgeneral wentworth a mere blockhead whose brother has a borough thinks vernon himself an opposition member of highsniffing angry not too magnanimous turnand withdraws now to his ships intimating do your problem then i have set you down beside it which was my part of the affairlet us give the attack of fort lazar and end this sad business  sunday 16th april wentworth once master of the uppermost lake or harbor what the natives call the surgidero or anchorage proper had disembarked high up to the right a good way south of carthagena meaning to attack therefrom a certain fort lazar which stands on a hill between carthagena and him this hill and fort once his he has carthagena under his cannon carthagena in his pocket as it were fort not to be had without batteries thinks wentworth though the sickly rainy season has set in batteries scalingladders you mean answers vernon with undisguised contempt for the two are by this time almost in open quarrel wentworth starts building batteries in spite of the raindeluges then stops buildingdecides to do it by scalade after all and at two in the morning of this sunday april 16th sets forth in certain columnsby roads illknown with arrangements that do not fit like clockworkto storm said hill and fort the english are an obstinate people and strenuous execution will sometimes amend defects of plansometimes not  the obstinate english nothing in them but sullen fire of valor which has to burn unluminous did after mistake on mistake climb the rocks or heights of lazar hill in spite of the world and don blass cannonading but found when atop that fort lazar raining cannonshot was still divided from them by chasms that the scalingladders had not come never did come owing to indiscipline somewhereand that without wings as of eagles they could not reach fort lazar at all for about four hours they struggled with a desperate doggedness to overcome the chasms to wrench aside the laws of nature and do something useful for themselves patiently though sulkily regardless of the storm of shot which killed 600 of them the while at length finding the laws of nature too strong for them they descended gloomily in gloomy silence marched home to their tents againin a humor too deep for words  yes and we find they fell sick in multitudes that night and in two days more were reduced from 6645 to 3200 effective vernon from the sea looking disdainfully onand it became evident that the big project had gone to water and that nothing would remain but to return straightway to jamaica in bankrupt condition which accordingly was set about and ten days hence april 26th the final party of them did get on boardpunctual to take three tents their last rag of siegefurniture along with them lest don blas have trophies thinks poor wentworth and sailed away with their sad siege finished in such fashion strenuous siege which had the warsciences been foolishness and the laws of nature and the rigors of arithmetic and geometry been stretchable entities might have succeeded better smolletts account miscellaneous works edinburgh 1806 iv 445469 is that of a highly intelligent eyewitness credible and intelligible in every particular  evening of april 26thi perceive it was in the very hours while belleisle arrived in friedrichs camp at mollwitz eve of that siege of brieg which we saw performing itself with punctual regard to said laws and rigors and issuing in so different a manner nothing that my constitutional historian has said equals in pungent enormity the matteroffact picture left by tobias smollett of the sick and wounded in the interim which followd that attempt on fort lazar and the laws of nature  as for the sick and wounded says tobias they were next day sent on board of the transports and vessels called hospitalships where they languished in want of every necessary comfort and accommodation they were destitute of surgeons nurses cooks and proper provision they were pent up between decks in small vessels where they had not room to sit upright they wallowed in filth myriads of maggots were hatched in the putrefaction of their sores which had no other dressing than that of being washed by themselves with their own allowance of brandy and nothing was heard but groans lamentations and the language of despair invoking death to deliver them from their miseries what served to encourage this despondence was the prospect of those poor wretches who had strength and opportunity to look around them for there they beheld the naked bodies of their fellowsoldiers and comrades floating up and down the harbor affording prey to the carrioncrows and sharks which tore them in pieces without interruption and contributing by their stench to the mortality that prevailed  this picture cannot fail to be shocking to the humane reader especially when he is informed that while those miserable objects cried in vain for assistance and actually perished for want of proper attendance every ship of war in the fleet could have spared a couple of surgeons for their relief and many young gentlemen of that profession solicited their captains in pain for leave to go and administer help to the sick and wounded the necessities of the poor people were well known the remedy was easy and apparent but the discord between the chiefs was inflamed to such a degree of diabolical rancor that the one chose rather to see his men perish than ask help of the other who disdained to offer his assistance unasked though it might have saved the lives of his fellowsubjects

he did on his own score a series of things ending in beautiful finis of the acapulco ship which were of considerable detriment and of highly considerable disgrace to spainand were and are long likely to be memorable among the seaheroisms of the world giving proof that real captains taciturn sons of anak are still born in england and seakings equal to any that were luckily too he had some chaplain

pleasantest little books in the worlds library at this date anson sheds some tincture of heroic beauty over that otherwise altogether hideous puddle of mismanagement platitude disaster and vindicates in a pathetically potential way the honor of his poor nation a little  apart from official anson the spanish war fell mainly we may say into the hands ofof mr jenkins himself and such friends of his
