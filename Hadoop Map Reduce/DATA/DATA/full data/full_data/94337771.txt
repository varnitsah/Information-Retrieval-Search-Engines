94337771	the leatherwood god  by  william dean howells  with illustrations by henry raleigh        illustration he was now towering over those near him with his head thrown back and his hair tossed like a mane on his shoulders  publishers note  the author thinks it well to apprise the reader that the historical outline of this story is largely taken from the admirable narrative of judge taneyhill in the ohio valley series robert clarke co cincinnati the details are often invented and the characters are all invented as to their psychological evolution though some are based upon those of real persons easily identifiable in that narrative the drama is that of the actual events in its main development but the vital incidents or the vital uses of them are the authors at times he has enlarged them at times he has paraphrased the accounts of the witnesses in one instance he has frankly reproduced the words of the imposter as reported by one who heard dylkss last address in the temple at leatherwood and as given in the taneyhill narrative otherwise the story is effectively fiction     list of illustrations   he was now towering over those near him with his head thrown back and his hair tossed like a mane on his shoulders  nancy stood staring at her with words beyond saying in her heartwords that rose in her throat and choked her  you believe maybe that you would be struck dead if you said the things that i do but why aint i struck dead  its my cloth i spun it i wove it every thread its all weve got for our clothes this winter  now you can see how it feels to have your own husband slap you  she had begun to wash his wound very gently though she spoke so roughly while he murmured with the pain and with the comfort of the pain  they swarmed forward to the altarplace and flung themselves on the ground and heaped the pulpitsteps with their bodies  and he went down agin and when he come up agin his face was all soakin wet like hed been crying under the water     the leatherwood god   already in the third decade of the nineteenth century the settlers in the valley of leatherwood creek had opened the primeval forest to their fields of corn and tobacco on the fertile slopes and rich bottomlands the stream had its name from the bush growing on its banks which with its tough and pliable bark served many uses of leather among the pioneers they made parts of their harness with it and the thongs which lifted their doorlatches or tied their shoes or held their working clothes together the name passed to the settlement and then it passed to the man who came and went there in mystery and obloquy and remained lastingly famed in the annals of the region as the leatherwood god  at the time he appeared the community had become a center of influence spiritual as well as material after a manner unknown to later conditions it was still housed for the most part in the log cabins which the farmers built when they ceased to be pioneers but in the older clearings and along the creek a good many frame dwellings stood and even some of brick the population woven of the varied strains from the north east and south which have mixed to form the midwestern people enjoyed an ease of circumstance not so great as to tempt their thoughts from the other world and fix them on this in their remoteness from the political centers of the young republic they seldom spoke of the civic questions stirring the towns of the east the commercial and industrial problems which vex modern society were unknown to them religion was their chief interest and the seriousness which they had inherited from their presbyterian methodist lutheran and moravian ancestry was expressed in their orderly and diligent lives but the general prosperity had so far relaxed the stringency of their several creeds that their distinctive public rite had come to express a mutual toleration the different sects had their different services their ceremonies of public baptism their revivals their campmeetings but they gathered as one christian people under the roof of the logbuilt edifice thrice the size of their largest dwelling which they called the temple    i   a storm of the afternoon before had cleared the midaugust air the early sun was hot but the wind had carried away the sultry mists and infused fresh life into the day where matthew braile sat smoking his corncob pipe in the covered porchway between the rooms of his doublelog cabin he insensibly shared the common exhilaration and waited comfortably for the breakfast of bacon and coffee which his wife was getting within as he smoked on he inhaled with the odors from her cooking the dense rich smell of the ripening corn that stirred in the morning breeze on three sides of the cabin and the fumes of the yellow tobacco which he had grown and cured and was now burning his serenity was a somewhat hawklike repose but the light that came into his narrowed eyes was of rather amused liking as a man on a claybank horse rode up before the cabin in the space where alone it was not hidden by the ranks of the tall corn the man sat astride a sack with a grist of corn in one end balanced by a large stone in the other and he made as if he were going on to the mill without stopping but he yielded apparently to a temptation from within since none had come from without whoa he shouted at the claybank which the slightest whisper would have stayed and then he called to the old man on the porch fine mornun squire  braile took out his pipe and spat over the edge of the porch before he called back wont you light and have some breakfast  well no thank you squire the man said and at the same time he roused the claybank from an instant repose and pushed her to the cabin steps im just on my way down to brother hingstons mill and i reckon sally dont want me to have any breakfast till i bring back the meal for her to git it with anyway thats what she said when i left braile answered nothing and the rider of the claybank added with a certain uneasiness as if for the effect of what he was going to say i was up putty late last night and i reckon i overslep he parleyed then as braile remained silent he went on briskly i was wonderin if you hearn about the curious douns last night at the campmeetun  braile said without ceasing to smoke youre the first one ive seen this morning except my wife she wasnt at the campmeeting his aquiline profile which met close at the lips from the loss of his teeth compressed itself further in leaving the whole burden of the affair to the man on the claybank and his narrowed eyes were a line of mocking under the thick gray brows that stuck out like feathers above them  well sir it was great douns the other said wincing a little under the old mans indifference braile relented so far as to ask who was at the bellows  the other answered with a certain inward deprecation of the grin that spread over his face and the responsive levity of his phrase there was a change of hands but the one that kep the fire goun the hardes and the hottes was elder grove  braile made hoonck in the scornful guttural which no english spelling can represent  yes sir the man on the claybank went on carried forward by his own interest but helpless to deny himself the guilty pleasure of falling in with brailes humor he had em goun lively about midnight now i tell you whoopun and yellun and rippun and stavun and fallun down with the jerks and pullun and haulun at the sinners to git em up to the mourners bench and hurrahun over em as fast as they was knocked down and drug out i never seen the beat of it in all my born days  you dont make out anything very strange abel reverdy braile said putting his pipe back into his mouth and beginning to smoke it again into a lost activity  well i haint come to it yit reverdy apologized i reckon there never was a bigger meetun in leatherwood bottom anywhere folks there from twenty mile round just slathers i reckon there was a thousand if there was one  hoonch braile would not trouble to take out his pipe in making the sound now the smoke got into his lungs and he coughed  reverdy gained courage to go on but he went on in the same strain whether in spite of himself or not there was as many as four exhorters keepun her up at once to diffrent tunes and prayun and singun everywhere so you couldnt hear yourself think every exhorter had a mourners bench in front of him and i counted as many as eighty mourners on em at one time the most of em was settun under elder grove and he was poundun the kingdom into em good and strong when the spirit took him he roared so that he had the hounds just flaxed out you couldnt ketch a yelp from em  many hounds braile asked in a sort of cold sympathy with the riotous outlaws known to the religious by that name  mought been fore i got there but by that time i reckon they was most of em on the mourners benches they ought to tar and feather some of them fellers or ride em on a rail anyway comun round and makun trouble on the edge of campmeetuns i didnt hear but one toot from their horns last night and either because the elder had shamed em back into the shadder of the woods or brought em forwards into the light there wasnt a hound not to call a hound anywheres i tell you it was a sight squire you ought to a been there yourself reverdy grinned at his notion they had eight campfires goun instead o four on top of the highest stageuns yit so the whole place was lit up as bright as day and when the elder stopped short and sudden and the other exhorters held back their tommyhawks and all the saints and sinners left off their groanun and jerkun to see what was comun now it was a great sight i tell you squire the elder he put up his hand and says he let us pray and the blaze from all them stageuns seemed to turn itself right onto him and the smoke and the leaves hung like a big red cloud over him and everybody had their eyes fastened tight on his face like they couldnt turn em anywhere else if they tried but he didnt begin prayun straight off he seemed to stop and then says he what shall we pray for and just then there came a kind of a snort and a big voice shouted out salvation and then there come another snort hoofflike there was a scared horse got loose right in there among the people and some of em jumped up from their seats and tumbled over the benches and some of em bounced off and fell into fits and the women screeched and fainted thick as flies it give me about the worst feelun i ever had in my life went through me like a ax and others said the same some of em said it was like beun scared in the dark or more like when you think youre just goun to die  abel reverdy stopped for the effect on braile who had been smoking tranquilly throughout and who now asked quietly and what was it  what was it a man a stranger that nobody seen before and nobody suspicioned was there till they hearn him give that kind of snort and they seen him standun right in front of the mourners bench under elder groves pulpit he was in his bare head and he had a suit of long glossy jetblack hair hengun down back of his ears clean to his shoulders he was kind of pale like and sadlookun and he had a roman nose some like yourn and eyes like two coals just black fire kind of he was putty thickset round the shoulders but he slimmed down towards his legs and he stood about six feet high but the thing of it reverdy urged seeing that braile remained outwardly unmoved was the way he was dressed i spose the rest beun all in brown jeans and linsey woolsey made us notice it more he was dressed in the slickest kind of black broadcloth with a long frockcoat and a white cravat he had on a ruffled shirt and a tall beaver hat the color of the fur and a pair of these here high boots with his breeches strapped down under em  braile limbered himself from his splintbottom chair and came forward to the edge of the porch as if to be sure of spitting quite under the claybanks body not until he had folded himself down into his seat again and tilted it back did he ask goin to order a suit  oh well said reverdy with a mingling of disappointed hope hurt vanity and involuntary pleasure  if he had been deeply moved by the incident which he had tried to make braile see with his own sense of its impressiveness it could not have been wholly with the hope of impressing braile that he had stopped to tell it his notion might have been that braile would ridicule it and so help him throw off the lingering hold which it had upon him his pain and his pleasure both came from brailes leaving the incident alone and turning the ridicule upon him that was cruel and yet funny reverdy had inwardly to own as it touched the remoteness from a full suit of black broadcloth represented by his hickory shirt and his butternut trousers held up by a single suspender passing over his shoulder and fastened before and behind with wooden pegs his straw hat which he had braided himself and his wife had sewed into shape the summer before was ragged round the brim and a tuft of his yellow hair escaped through a break in the crown it was as far from a tall hat of furcolored beaver as his bare feet were from a pair of high boots such as the stranger at the campmeeting had worn though his ankles were richly shaded in three colors from the road the field and the barnyard he liked the joke so well that the hurt of it could hardly keep him from laughing as he thumped his mares ribs with his naked heels and bade her get up  she fetched a deep sigh but she did not move  better light braile said you wouldnt get that corn ground in time for breakfast now  i reckon reverdy said aloud but to himself rather than braile and with his mind on his wife in the log cabin where he had left her in high rebellion which she promised him nothing but a bag of cornmeal could reduce she dont need to wait for me exactly she could grate herself some o the new corn and shes got some bacon anyway  better light braile said again  the sound of frying which had risen above their voices within had ceased and after a few quick movements of feet over the puncheon floor with some clicking of knives and dishes the feet came to the door opening on the porch and a handsome elderly woman looked out  she was neatly dressed in a homewoven linseywoolsey gown with a blue check apron reaching to its hem in front and a white cloth passed round her neck and crossed over her breast she had a cap on her iron gray hair  braile did not visibly note her presence in saying the woman will want to hear about it  hear about what his wife asked and then she said to reverdy good morning abel wont you light and have breakfast with us its just ready i reckon sally will excuse you  well she will if you say so mrs braile reverdy made one action of throwing his leg over the claybanks back to the ground and slipping the bridle over the smooth peg left from the limb of the young treetrunk which formed one of the posts of the porch my he said as he followed his hostess indoors you do have things nice i never come here without wantun to have my old shanty whitewashed inside like yourn is and the logs plastered outside the mud and moss of that chinkun and daubun keeps fallun out and lettun all the kinds of weather there is in on us and sally shes at me about it too shes wussn i am if anything i reckon if she had her say wed have a tworoom cabin too and a loft over both parts like you have mis braile or a frame house even but i dont believe anybody but you could keep this floor so clean them knots in the puncheons just shine and that chimblypiece with that plaster of paris samuel prayin in it well if sallys ast me for a samuel once i reckon she has a hundred times and that clock its a pictur he looked about the interior as he took the seat offered him at the table and praised the details of the furnishing with a reference to the effect of each at home in this he satisfied that obscure fealty of the husband who feels that such a connection of the absent wife with some actual experience of his is equivalent to their joint presence it was not so much to praise mrs brailes belongings to her as to propitiate the idea of mrs reverdy that he continued his flatteries in the meantime braile who came in behind him stood easing himself from one foot to the other with an ironical eye slanted at reverdy from under his shaggy brows he dropped his head now and began walking up and down the room while he listened in a sort of sarcastic patience  aint you goin to have anything to eat mr braile his wife demanded with plaintive severity  braile pulled at his cobpipe which muttered responsively not so long as ive got anything to smoke gets up he explained to reverdy and jerks it out of my mouth when we havent got company  i reckon abel knows how much to believe of that mrs braile commented and reverdy gave the pleased chuckle of a social inferior raised above his level by amiable condescension but as if he thought it safest to refuse any share in this intimacy he ended his adulations with the opinion i should say that if these here two rooms was thowed together theyd make half as much as the temple  braile stopped in his walk and bent his frown on reverdy but not in anger this is the temple temple of justicejustice of the peace do you people think theres only one kind of temple in leatherwood  reverdy gave his chuckle again well squire i ought to know anyway all the logrollin i done for you last lection time i didnt hardly believe youd git in because they said you was a infidel  well you couldnt deny it could you braile asked with increasing friendliness in his frown  no i couldnt deny it squire but the way i told em to look at it was mis braile was christian enough for the whole family said you knowed more law and she knowed more gospel than all the rest of leatherwood put together  and that was what elected the family was it braile asked well i hope mrs braile wont refuse to serve he said and he began his walk again tell her about that horse that broke into the meetin last night and tried to play man  reverdy laughed shaking his head over his plate of bacon and reaching for the cornpone which mrs braile passed him you do beat all squire the way you take the shine off of religious experience why he addressed himself to mrs braile it wasnt much as fur as anybody could make out it was just the queerness of the whole thing reverdy went over the facts again beginning with deprecation for the squire but gathering respect for them in the interest they seemed to have for mrs braile  she listened silently and then she asked and what became of him  well thats where you got me mrs braile dont anybody know what become of him just kind of went out like a fire when the power was workun the hardest and wasnt there next time you looked where he been kind o thowed cold water on the meetun and folks begun goun home and breakun up and turnun in well it was pretty nigh sunup anyway by that time i dont know made me feel alloverish seemed like id been dreamun and that man was a vision reverdy had lifted an enraptured face but at sight of braile pausing in sarcastic pleasure he dropped his head with a snicker i know the squirell laugh but thats the way it was  hell laugh the other side of his mouth some day if he keeps on mrs braile said with apparent reproof and latent pride was sally at the meetin with you  well no she wasnt reverdy began and braile asked  and did you wake her up and tell her about it  well no i didnt squire thats a fact she woke me up i just crep in quiet and felt out the soft side of a puncheon for a nap and the firs thing i know was sally havin me by the shoulder and wantun to know about gittun that corn groun for breakfas my i dont know what shell say when i do git back reverdy laughed a fearful pleasure but his gaiety was clouded by a shadow projected from the cabin door  well i mought a knowed it a voice at once fond and threatening called to reverdys quailing figure the owner of the voice was a young woman unkempt as to the pale hair which escaped from the knot at her neck and stuck out there and dangled about her face in spite of the attempts made to gather it under the control of the high horn comb holding its main strands together the lankness of her long figure showed in the calico wrapper which seemed her sole garment and her large features were respectively lank in their way nose and chin and high cheek bones her eyes wabbled in their sockets with the sort of inquiring laughter that spread her wide loose mouth she was barefooted like reverdy on whom her eyes rested with a sort of burlesque menace so that she could not turn them to mrs braile in the attention which manners required of her even when she added i just spicioned that hed a turned in here soons i smelt your breakfas mrs braile and the dear knows whether i blame him so much nuther  then youd better draw up too sally mrs braile said without troubling herself to rise from her own chair in glancing toward another for mrs reverdy  oh no i couldnt mrs braile i ony just meant how nice it smelt i got me somepin at home before i left and i aint a bit hungry  well then you eat breakfast for me im hungry the squire said sit down you couldnt get abel away now not if you went on an hour dont separate families  well just as you say squire mrs reverdy snickered and she submitted to pull up the chair which mrs brailes glance had suggested it beats all what a excitement there is in this town about the gouns on at the campmeetun last night if ive heard it from one ive heard it from a dozen i spose abels tol youshe addressed herself impartially to mrs braile across the table and to the squire tilted against the wall in his chair smoking behind his wife  not a word the squire said and his wife did not trouble herself to protest reverdy opened his mouth in a soundless laugh at the squires humor and then filled it with bacon and cornpone and ducked his head in silence over his plate what goings on  why that man that came in while elder grove was snatchun the brands from the burnun and snorted like a horsebut i know abels tol you its just like one of your jokes squire braile aint it mrs braile sally referred herself to one and the other  you wont get either of us to say sally mrs braile let the squire answer for both youd better go on i couldnt hear too often about a man that snorted like a horse if abel did tell what did the horses hitched back of the tents think about it any of em try to shout like a man  well you may laugh squire braile sally said with a toss of her head for the dignity she failed of she slumped forward with a laugh and when she lifted her head she said through the victual that filled her mouth i dunno what the horses thought but the folks believe it was a apostle or somepin  who said so abel oh pshaw dyou suppose i blieve anythin abel reverdy says and this gave reverdy a joy which she shared with him he tried to impart it to mrs braile impassively pouring him a third cup of coffee i jes met mis leonard comun up the crossroad and she tol me she saw our claybank hitched here and i spicioned abel wasnt fur off and thats why i stopped  the husband and wife looked across the table in feigned fear and threat that gave them pleasure beyond speech  she didnt say it was your claybank that snorted the squire gravely inquired  squire braile you surely will kill me and the husband joined the wife in a shout of laughter now i cant hardly git back to what she did say but i can tell you it wasnt nawthun to laugh at plenty of em keeled over where they sot and a lot bounced up and down like it was a earthquake and pretty near all the women screamed but he stood there straight as a ramrod and never moved a eyewinker she said his face was somepin awful just as solemn and still he never spoke after that one word salvation but every once in a while he snorted nobody seen him come in or ever seen him before till he first snorted and then they didnt see anybody else the preacher he preached along and tried to act like as if nowthun had happened but it was no use nobody didnt hardly pay no attention to him ceptun the stranger himself he never took his eyes off elder grove some thought he was tryun to charm him like a snake does a bird but it didnt faze the elder  elder too old a bird the squire suggested  yes i reckon he mought been sally innocently assented  and when he gave the benediction the snorter disappeared in a flash with a strong smell of brimstone i suppose  why that was the thing of it squire he just stayed and shuck hands with everybody pleasant as a basket of chips and he went home with david gillespie he was just as polite to the poorest person there but it was the big bugs that tuck the most to him  well the squire summed up i dont see but what your reports agree and i reckon there must be some truth in em whos that up there at the pikecrossing he did not trouble himself to do more than frown heavily in the attempt to make out the passer mrs reverdy jumped from her chair and ran out to look  well as sure as im alive if it aint that gillespie girl i bet shell know all about it ill just ketch up with her and git the news out of her if there is any say say jane she called to the girl as she ran up the road with the cowlike gait which her swirling skirt gave her the girl stopped for her then in apparent haste she moved on again and sally moved with her out of sight her voice still made itself heard in uncouth cries and laughter  braile called into the kitchen where reverdy had remained in the enjoyment of mrs brailes patient hospitality heres your chance abel  chance reverdy questioned back with a full mouth  to get that corn of yours ground and beat sally home  well squire reverdy said i reckon youre right he came out into the open space where braile sat well i wont fergit this breakfast very soon he offered his gratitude to mrs braile over his shoulder as he passed through the door  youre welcome abel she answered kindly and when he had made his manners to the impassive squire and mounted his claybank and thumped the horse into motion with his naked heels she came out into the porch and said to her husband i dont know as i liked your hinting him out of the house that way  braile did not take the point up but remained thoughtfully smiling in the direction his guest had taken the idea is that most people marry their opposites he remarked and that gives the children the advantage of inheriting their folly from two kinds of fools but abel and sally are a perfect pair mental and moral twins the only thing they dont agree in is their account of what became of that snorting exhorter but the difference there isnt important if an allwise providence has kept them from transmitting a double dose of the same brand of folly to posterity thats one thing in favor of providence he took up his wifes point now if i hadnt hinted him away hed have stayed to dinner you wouldnt have hinted him away if hed stayed to supper  well are you going to have some breakfast his wife asked ill get you some fresh coffee  well i would like a littlewith the head onmartha thats a fact have i got time for another pipe  no i dont reckon you have his wife said and she passed into the kitchen again where she continued to make such short replies as brailes discourse required of her  he knocked his pipe out on the edge of his still uptilted chair as he talked one fool like abel i can stand and i was just going to come in when sally came in sight and then i knew that two fools like abel would make me sick so i waited till the creator of heaven and earth could get a minute off and help me out but he seemed pretty busy with the solar system this morning and i had about given up when he sent that gillespie girl in sight i knew that would fetch sally but it was an inspiration of my own to suggest abels chance to him i dont want to put that on your maker martha  it was your inspiration to get him to stay in the first place mrs braile said within  no martha that was my unfailing obedience to the sacred laws of hospitality i didnt expect to fall under their condemnation a second time though mrs braile did not answer and by the familiar scent from within braile knew that his coffee must be nearly ready as he dropped his chair forward he heard a sound of frying and pshaw martha he called youre not getting me some fresh bacon  did you suppose thered be some left she demanded while she stepped to and fro at her labors her steps ceased and she called well come in now matthew if you dont want everything to get cold like the pone is  braile obeyed saying oh i can stand cold pone and at sight of the table with the coffee and bacon renewed upon it he mocked tenderly now just to reward you martha ive got half a mind to go with you to the next meeting in the temple  i dont know as im goin myself she said pouring the coffee  i wish you would just to please me he teased    ii   no one could say quite how it happened that the stranger went home from the campmeeting with old david gillespie and his girl many had come forward with hospitable offers and the stranger had been affable with all but he had slipped through the hands he shook and had parried the invitations made him gillespie had not seemed to invite him and his shy daughter had shrunk aside when the chief citizens urged their claims yet the stranger went with them to their outlying farm and spent all the next day there alone in the tall woods that shut its corn fields in  sally reverdy had failed to get any light from the gillespie girl when she ran out from squire brailes cabin the girl seemed still under the spell that had fallen upon many at the meeting and it appeared to sally that she did not want to talk at any rate she did not talk to any satisfactory end a squirrel hunter believed he had caught a glimpse of the stranger in the chestnut woods behind the gillespie springhouse but he was not a man whose oath was acceptable in the community and his belief was not generally shared it was thought that the stranger would reappear at the last night of the campmeeting but the gillespies came without him and reported that they had expected he would come by himself  the campmeeting broke up after the sunday morning service and most of the worshipers sated with their devotional experience went home praising the power in song as they rode away in the wagons laden with their camp furniture and their children strewn over the bedding but for others the fire of the revival burned through the hot long august sabbath day and a devout congregation crowded the temple  the impulse of the week past held over to the night unabated the spacious logbuilt house was packed from wall to wall the men stood dense the seats were filled with women only a narrow path was left below the pulpit for those who might wish to rise and confess christ before the congregation the people waited in a silence broken by their deep breathing their devout whispering the scraping of their feet now and then a babe whose mother could not leave it at home wailed pitifully or spitefully till it was coaxed or scolded still now and then some one coughed the air was thick a bat scandalized the assemblage by flying in at the open door and wavering round the tallow candles on the pulpit one of the men beat it down with his hat and then picked it up and crowded his way down the aisle out into the night with it when he came back it was as if he had found the stranger whom they were all consciously expecting and had brought him in with david gillespie and his girl she was tall and straight like her father and her hair was red like his her eyes were gray blue and the look in them was both wilful and dreamy  the stranger smiled and took the hands stretched out to him in passing by several of the different sectarians who used the temple gillespie seemed not to notice or to care for the greetings to his guest and his girl wore her wonted look of vague aloofness  matthew braile had been given a seat at the front perhaps in deference to his age and dignity perhaps in confusion at his presence he glanced up at the stranger with a keen glint through his branching eyebrows and made a guttural sound his wife pushed him and he said what and oh quite audibly and she pushed him again for answer  the gillespies sat down with the stranger in the foremost bench he wore the black broadcloth coat of the friday night before his long hair combed back from his forehead fell down his shoulders almost to his middle the glances of his black eyes roved round the room but were devoutly lowered at the prayer which opened the service it was a methodist who preached but somehow tonight he had not the fervor of his sect his sermon was cold and addressed itself to the faith rather than the hope of his hearers he spoke as from the hold of an oppressive spell at times he was perplexed and lost his place in his exhortation in the close heat some drowsed and the preacher was distracted by snoring from a corner near the door he lifted his voice as if to rouse the sleeper or to drown the noise but he could not he came to the blessing at last and the disappointed congregation rose to go out suddenly the loud snort that had dismayed the campmeeting sounded through the heavy air and then there came the thrilling shout of salvation  the people did not need to look where the stranger had been sitting he had done what they hoped what they expected and he was now towering over those near him with his head thrown back and his hair tossed like a mane on his shoulders the people stopped some who had gone out crowded in again no one knew quite what to do the minister halted on the pulpit stairs he had done his part for the night and he did not apparently resent the action of the man who now took it on him to speak  a tall stout man among those who had lingered spoke from the aisle he was the owner of the largest farm in the neighborhood and he had one of the mills on the creek in his quality of miller everybody knew him and he had the authority of a public character now he said  we want to hear something more than a snort and a shout from our brother here we heard them friday night and weve been talkin about it ever since  the appeal was half joking half entreating the minister was still hesitating on the pulpit stairs and he looked at the stranger will you come up brother  call me dylksfor the present the stranger answered with a full voice  brother dylks the minister repeated and he came down and gave him the right hand of fellowship  the gillespies looked on with their different indifference dylks turned to them shall i speak  speak the girl said but her father said nothing  dylks ran quickly up the pulpit steps we will join in prayer he called out and he held the congregation now returned to their places in the spell of a quick short supplication he ended it with the lords prayer then he said let us sing and line after line he gave out the hymn    plunged in a gulf of dark despair    we wretched sinners lay  he expounded each stanza as to the religious sense and the poetic meaning before he led the singing he gave out a passage of scripture as a sort of text but he did not keep to it he followed with other passages and his discourse was a rehearsal of these rather than a sermon his memory in them was unerring women who knew their bibles by heart sighed their satisfaction in his perfectness they did not care for the relevance or irrelevance of the passages all was scripture all was the one inseparable word of god dreadful blissful divine promising heaven threatening hell groans began to go up from the people held in the strong witchery of the mans voice they did not know whether he spoke long or not before they knew he was as if sweeping them to their feet with a repetition of his opening hymn and they were singing with him    plunged in a gulf of dark despair    we wretched sinners lay  it ended and he gave his wild brutish snort and then his heartshaking cry of salvation  some of the chief men remained to speak with him to contend for him as their guest but old david gillespie did not contend with them you can have him he said to the miller peter hingston if he wants to go with you he was almost rude and his daughter was not opener with the women who crowded about her trying to make her say something that would feed their hunger to know more she remained hard and cold almost dumb it seemed to them that she was not worthy to have had him under her fathers roof as for her father they had no patience with him for not putting in a word to claim the stranger while the others were pressing him to come home with them in spite of the indifference of gillespie and his girl dylks elected to remain with them and when he could pull himself from the crowd he went away into the night between them  when matthew braile made his escape with his wife from the crowd and began to walk home through the dim hot night he said is jane gillespie any particular hand at fried chicken  now you stop matthew his wife said  because that would account for it i reckon it was fried chicken the ravens brought to elijah all men of god are fond of fried chicken  his wife would not dispute directly with his perversity she knew that in this mood of his it would be useless trying to make him partake the wonder she shared with her neighbors that the stranger had chosen david gillespie again for his host out of the many leading men who had pressed their hospitality upon him and that he should have preferred his apathy to their eagerness  i wish he had worn his yellow beaver hat in the pulpit braile went on it must have been a disappointment to abe reverdy but perhaps he consoled himself with a full sight of the fellows long hair he ought to part it in the middle like thomas jefferson and do it up in a knot like a woman well we cant have everything even in a man of god but maybe he isnt really a man of god that would account for a good many things but i think he shows taste in preferring old gillespie to peter hingston next to abe reverdy hes the biggest fool in leatherwood maybe the prophet knew by instinct that there would be better fried chicken at gillespies  his wife disdained to make a direct answer you may be sure they give him of their best whatever it is and the gillespies may be poor but when it comes to respectability and good works theyve got a right to hold their heads up with the best in this settlement that girl has done all the work of the house since her mother died when she wasnt a little thing half grown and old david has slaved off his mortgage till his farms free and clear and he dont owe anybody a cent  oh i dont say anything against gillespie all i say is that brother dylks knows which side his bread is buttered on inspired probably  what makes you so bitter tonight matthew his wife halted him a little with her question  well the temple always leaves a bad taste in my mouth i hate to see brethren agreeing together in unity you oughtnt to have taken me martha  ill never take you again she said  and that mans a rascal if ever there was one real men of god dont wear their hair down to their waists and come snorting and shouting in black broadcloth to a settlement like this for the good of folks souls  youve got no right to say that matthew and if you go round talking that way youll make yourself more unpopular than you are already  oh ill be careful martha ill just think it and perhaps put two or three of the leading intellects like abe and sally on their guard but come come martha you know as well as i do hes a rascal dont you believe it  i believe in giving everybody a chance dont your own law books say a mans innocent till hes proved guilty  something like that and im not trying brother dylks in open court at present ill give him the benefit of the doubt if hes ever brought before my judgment seat but youve got to allow that his long hair and black broadcloth and his snort and shout are against him  i dont believe in them any more than you do she owned but dont you persecute him because hes religious matthew  oh i dont object to him because hes religious though i think theres more religion in leatherwood already than any ten towns would know what to do with hes got to do more than preach his brand of religion before id want to trouble him  they were at the hewn log which formed the step to the porch between the rooms of their cabin a lank hound rose from the floor and pulled himself back from his forwardplanted paws and whimpered a welcome to them a captive coon rattled his chain from his corner under the porch roof  why dont you let that poor thing go matthew mrs braile asked  well i will some day but the little chap that brought it to me was like our  he stopped both were thinking the same thing and knew they were i saw the likeness from the first too the wife said    iii   the gillespies arrived at their simpler log cabin half an hour later than the brailes at theirs it was on the border of the settlement and beyond it for a mile there was nothing but woods walnut and chestnut and hickory not growing thickly as the primeval forest grew to the northward along the lake but standing openly about in the pleasant parklike freedom of the woodspastures of that gentler latitude beyond the wide stretch of trees and meadow lands the cornfields and tobacco patches opened to the sky again on their farther border stood a new log cabin defined by its fresh barked logs in the hovering dark  gillespie pulled the leatherwood latchstring which lifted the catch of his door and pushed it open go in jane he said to his daughter and the girl vanished slimly through with a glance over her shoulder at dylks where he stood aloof a few steps from her father  gillespie turned to his guest did you see her he asked  yes i walked over to her house this morning  did any one see you  no her man was away  gillespie turned with an effect of helplessness and looked down at the woodpile where he stood i dont know he said what keeps me from spliting your head open with that ax  i do dylks said  man the old man threatened dont go too far  it wasnt the fear of god which you pretend is in your heart but the fear of man dylks added with a vulgar drop from the solemn words you would hang for it i havent put myself in your power without counting all the costs to both of us  gillespie waved his answer off with an impatient hand  did she know you  why not it hasnt been so long i havent changed so much i wear my hair differently and i dress better since ive been in philadelphia she knew me in a minute as well as i knew her i didnt ask for her present husband i thought one at a time was enough  what are you going to do  nothingfirst i might have told her she had been in a hurry but if she dont bother me i wont her we got as far as that and i reckon she wont but i thought wed better have a clear understanding and she knows now its bigamy in her case and bigamys a penitentiary offense i made that clear and now see here david im going to stay here in this settlement and i dont want any trouble from you no matter what you think of my doings past present or future i dont want you to say anything or look anything dont you let on even to that girl of yours that you ever saw me before in your life if you do youll wish you had split my head open with that ax but im not afraid ive got you safe and ive got your sister safe  gillespie groaned then he said desperately listen here joseph dylks i know what youre after here because you always was other peoples money ive got three hundred dollars saved up since i paid off the mortgage if youll take it and go  three hundred dollars no no keep your money old man i dont rob the poor dylks lifted himself and said with that air of mysterious mastery which afterwards won so many to his obedience i work my work let no man gainsay me or hinder me he walked to and fro in the starlight swelling with his head up and his mane of black hair cloudily flying over his shoulders as he turned i come from god  gillespie looked at him as he paced back and forth if i didnt know you for a common scoundrel that married my sister against my will and lived on her money till it was gone and then left her and let her believe he was dead i might believe you did come from godor the devil you you turkey cock you stallion but you cant prance me down or snort me down i dont agree to anything i dont say i wont tell who you are when it suits me i wont promise to keep it from this one or that one or any one ill let you go just so far and then  all right david ill trust you as i trust your sister between you im safe and now you lay low thats my advice he dropped from his mystery and his mastery to a level of colloquial teasing im going to rest under your humble roof tonight and tomorrow im going to the mansion of peter hingston his gates will be set wide for me and all the double logcabin palaces and frame houses of this royal city of leatherwood will hunger for my presence you could always hold your tongue david and you can easily leave all the whys and wherefores to me i wont go from your hospitality with an ungrateful tongue i will proclaim before the assembled multitudes in your temple that i left you secure in the faith and that i turned to others because they needed me more i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance they will understand that so good night david and good morning i shall be gone before even you are up  gillespie made no answer as he followed his guest indoors long before he slept he heard the mans powerful breathing like that of some strong animal in its sleep an ox lying in the field or a horse standing in its stall at times it broke chokingly and then he snorted it smooth and regular again at daybreak gillespie thought of rising but he drowsed and he was asleep when his daughter came to the foot of the ladder which climbed to his chamber in the cabin loft and called to him that his breakfast was ready    iv   the figure of a woman who held her hooded shawl under her chin stole with steps often checked through the limp dewladen grass of the woodspasture and slipped on the rotting logs but she caught herself from tumbling and safely gained the border of gillespies corn field there she sat down trembling on the stone doorstep of the springhouse and waited rather than rested in the shelter of the chestnut boughs that overhung the roof she was aware of the spring gurgling under the stone on its way into the sunshine from the crocks of creamcovered milk and of butter in the cool dark of the hut she sensed the thick august heat of the sun already smiting its honeyed odors from the corn she heard the scamper of the squirrels preying upon the ripening ears and whisking in and out of the woods or dropping into the field from the tips of the boughs overhanging the nearer rows but it all came blurred to her consciousness  she was recognizably gillespies sister but her eyes and hair were black she was wondering how she could get to speak with him when jane was not by he would send the girl away at a sign from her but she could not have that the thing must be kept from the girl but not seem to be kept  she let her arms rest on her knees her helpless hands hung heavy from them her head was bowed and her whole body drooped under the burden of her heart as if it physically dragged her down jane would be coming soon with the mornings milk to pour into the crocks she heard a step the girl was coming but she must rest a moment  what are you doing here nancy her brothers voice asked  oh is it you david oh blessed be the name of the lord maybe hes going to be good to me after all david is he gone  hes gone nancy  in anger  hes gone i dont care whether hes gone in anger or not  did he tell you he saw me  yes  and did you promise him not to tell on him to jane to any one  no gillespie stood holding a bucket of milk in his hand she sat gathering her shawl under her chin as if she were still coming through the suncleft shadows of the woods pasture  oh david  what do you want me to do nancy  i dont know i dont know i havent slept all night  you mustnt give way like this dont you see any duty for you in this matter  duty oh david her heart forboded the impossible demand upon it  gillespie set his bucket of milk down beside the spring nancy he said a woman cannot have two husbands its a crime against the state its a sin against god  but i havent got two husbands what do you mean david didnt i believe he was dead didnt you oh david whatdo you think ive done wrong you let me do it  i dont think youve done wrong but look out you dont do it you are doing it now i cant let you do it i cant let you live in sin  in sin me  you every minute you live now with laban you live in sin your first husband that was dead is alive he cant claim you unless you allow it but neither can your second husband now if you live on with laban a day longeran houra minuteyou live in deadly sin i thought of it all night but i had not thought it out till this minute when i first saw you sitting there and i knew how miserable you were and my heart seemed to bleed at the sight of you  you may well say that david the woman answered with a certain pride in the vastness of her calamity if it was another woman i couldnt bear to think of it why does he do it why does he set such traps for us  nancy her brother called sternly  oh yes its easy enough for you but if rachel was here shed see it different  woman her brother said dont try to hide behind the dead in your sin  its no sin i was as innocent as the babe unborn when i married labanas innocent as he was poor boy when he would have me and we all thought he was dead oh why couldnt he have been dead  this is murder you have in your heart now nancy the old man said with who knows what awful pleasure in his casuistry so pitilessly unerring if the life of that wicked man could buy you safety in your sin you could wish it taken  oh oh oh what shall i do what shall i do she wailed out the words with her head fallen forward on her knees and her loose hair dripping over them  do go home and bring your little one and come to me i will deal with laban when he gets back tonight  she started erect and let him think ive left him and the neighbors let them think weve quarreled and i couldnt live with him  it wont matter what the world thinks gillespie said and he spoke of the small backwoods settlement as if it were some great center of opinion such as in great communities dispenses fame and infamy and makes its judgments supremely dreaded besides he faltered no one is knowing but ourselves to his coming back it can seem as if he left you  and i live such a lie as that is this you david  it was she who rose highest now as literally she did in standing on the stone where she had crouched above the level of his footing  ii say it to spare you nancy i dont wish it but i wish to make it easyor a little bit easiersomething you can bear better  oh i know david i know you would save me if you could but maybe maybe it aint what we think it is maybe he was outlawed by staying away so long  neither of them named dylks but each knew whom the other meant throughout their talk  a lawyer might let you think so till he got all your money  matthew braile wouldnt  that infidel  she drooped again oh well i must do it i must do it ill go and get ready and ill come to you what will jane think  ill take care of what jane thinks when do you expect laban back  not before sundown ill not come till i see him  well be ready for you he moved now to open the springhouse door she turned and was lost to him in the lights and shadows of the woodspasture on its further border her cabin stood and from it came the sound of a pitiful wail at the back door a little child stood staying itself by the slats let into grooves in the jambs she had left it in its low cradle asleep and it must have waked and clambered out and crept to the barrier and been crying for her there its small face was soaked with tears  she ran forward with long leaps out of the cornfield and caught it to her neck and mumbled its wet cheeks with hungry kisses oh my honey my honey did it think its mother had left  she stopped at the word with a pang and began to go about the rude place that was the simple home where after years of hell she had found an earthly heaven often she stopped and wondered at herself it seemed impossible she could be thinking it be doing it but she was thinking and doing it and at sundown when she knew by the eager shadow of a man in the doorway pausing to listen if the baby were awake all had been thought and done    v   the emotional frenzies recurring through the day were past and she could speak steadily to the man in the absence of greeting which often emphasizes the selfforgetfulness of love as well as marks the formlessness of common life your suppers waitin for you laban ive had mine you must be hungry its out in the shed its cooler there go round babys asleep  the man obeyed and she heard him drop the bucket into the well and lift it by the groaning sweep and pour the water into the basin and then splash himself with murmurs of comfort presently muffled in the towel her hearing followed him through his supper and she knew he was obediently eating it and patiently waiting for her to account for whatever was unwonted in her greeting she loved him most of all for his boylike submission to her will and every caprice of it but now she hardly knew how to deny his tacit question as he ventured in from the shed  dont come near me laban she said with a stony quiet dont touch me i aint your wife any more  he could not speak at first then it was like him to ask whywhywhat have i done nancy  you you poor soul she answered nothing but good all your days hes come back  he knew whom she meant but he had to ask joseph dylks why i thought he was  dont say it its murder i dont want you to have his blood on you too oh if he was only dead yes yes i have a right to wish it oh god be merciful to me a sinner  whenwhenhow did you know it nancy  yesterday morning or day beforejust after you left i reckon he was waitin for you to go im glad you went first the man looked up at the rifle resting on the pegs above the fireplace laban dont she cried i looked at it when he was walkin away and i know what youre thinkin  what is he goin to do the man asked from his daze  nothing he said he wouldnt do nothing if i didnt if he hadnt said it i might believe it  laban shifted his weight where he stood from one foot to the other  he passed the night at davids hes passed two nights there  was it the snorting man  i reckon  i heard about him at the cross roads why didnt david tell us yesterday  maybe he hadnt thought it out david thinks slow he likes to be sure before he speaks he was sure enough this morning the woman ended bitterly  what did he say  he said it was living in sin for us to keep together if he was alive  laban pondered it i reckon if we come together without knowing he was alive it aint no sin  yes it is she shrieked  we was married just like anybody we didnt make no secret of it weve lived together four years are you goin to unlive them years by stoppin now  dont you spose i been over all that a million times my minds sore workin with it there aint a thought in me that dont ache from it but davids right weve got to part i put your things in this poke here she said and she gave him a bag made from an old pillow tick with a few clothes lumping it half full ill carry the baby laban she pulled back from him with the child in her arms or no you can carry her youll have to leave her too and youve got a right to all the good you can get of her now dont touch anything ill stay at davids tonight but ill come back in the morning and then ill see what ill dostay or go and live with david come  and what about joey laban asked half turning with the child when they were outside  i declare i forgot about joey ill see tomorrow it seems as if my very soul was tired now  joey will just think weve gone over to davids for a minute hell go to bed when he comes hell have had his supper at peter hingstons anyway  as they walked away she said youre a good man laban billings to feel the way you always do about joey youve been a true father to him i wonder what his own fatherd have been  no truer father to him than ive been a husband to you nancy the man said and as they walked along together so far apart his speech came to him and he began to plead their case with her as before an adverse judge worn as she was with the arguments for and against them after the long day of iteration she could not refuse to let him plead she scarcely answered him but he knew when they reached gillespies cabin that she had seen them in the fierce light of her conscience where there was no shadow of turning  david was alone jane he said had gone to the reverdys and was going with the woman to the temple  nancy did not seem to hear him she took the sleeping baby from its fathers arms laban has come with me to say goodby before you david i hope youll be satisfied  i hope your conscience will be satisfied nancy it doesnt matter about me laban do you see this thing like i do  i see it like nancy does  god will bless your effort for righteousness your path is dark before you now but his light will shine upon it  the old man paused helplessly and nancy asked does jane know  not yet and i will confess im not certain what to do about her and about the neighbors this is a cross to me too nancy i have lived a proud life here there has never been talk about me or mine now when you and laban are parted there will be talk  theres no need to be laban said not at once they want me back at the cross roads the wilkinses do i can go now as well as in the morning i forgot to tell you he added to his wife it was drove out of my mind  oh i dont blame you she answered  i can have work there all the fall  david gillespie rubbed his forehead and said tremulously i dont know what to say i suppose i am weak itll be one kind of a lie but labani thank you  i can come back here sundays and see nancy and the baby laban suggested  the old mans voice shook youll be making it harder for yourself was all he could say  but perhapsperhaps therell be lightthat light you saidby and by  let us pray that therell be no light from the pit i am a sinful man laban to let you do this thing i ought to have strength for all of us but i am older now im not what i wasthe day has tried me nancy  goodby then laban the woman said and dont you think hard of david i dont and im not sure ill ever let you come say goodby as if it was for life she turned to her brother we can kiss i reckon  oh i reckon he lamented and went indoors  laban opened his arms as if to take her in them but she interposed the baby  kiss her first me last just once now go i wont be weak with you like david is and dont you be afraid for me i can get along im not a man she went into the cabin with her baby over her shoulder but in a little while she came back without it and stared after the figure of laban losing itself in the night then she sat down on the doorstep and cried it seemed as if she never could stop but the tears helped her  when she lifted her head she caught the sounds of singing from the village below the upland where the cabin stood it was the tune that carried not the words but she knew them from the tune as well as if she were in the temple with them she knew what the people were singing while she followed the lines helplessly almost singing them herself she was startled by the presence of a boy who had come silently round the cabin in his bare feet and stood beside her  oh she cried out  why did i scare you mom he asked tenderly i didnt mean to  no joey i didnt know any one was there thats all i didnt expect you why aint you at home in bed you must be tired enough poor boy  oh no i aint tired mr hingston is real good to me he lets me rest plenty and he says ill make a first rate miller i helped to dress the burrs this morningthe millstones you know the boy explained proud of the technicality oh i tell you i just like it there he said and he laughed out his joy in it  you always was a glad boy joey his mother said ruefully  well you wouldnt thought so if you seen me over at our house it seemed like there was somebody dead i dasnt hardly go in it was so dark and still whynt you there didnt pop come home  yes but he had to go back to the cross roads hes got work there all the fall  well we do seem to be gittin along he laughed again i reckon you come over here because it seemed kind o lonesome goin to stay all night with uncle  yes you wont mind being there alone  oh no not much i reckon  you can stay here too if you want to  oh no mom he confessed shyly i brung benny hingston with me i thought youd let him stay all night with me  why certainly joey  hes just behind the house i wanted to ask first  you know you can always bring benny theres plenty of room for both of you in your bed but now when you go back with him be careful of the lamp i put a fresh piece of rag in and theres plenty of grease you can blow up a coal on the hearth i covered the fire only be careful  oh well be careful bennys about the carefullest boy the is in leatherwood oh i do like being in the mill with mr hingston he laughed out his joy again and then he asked doubtfully mom  yes joey  benny and me was wonderinwed go straight back home and not light any lamp at allif youd let us go to the temple theres a big meetin there tonight the mother hesitated and the boy urged they say that strange manwell some calls him the snorter and some the exhorteris goin to preach the mother was still silent and the boy faltered on he dresses like the people do overthemountains and he wears his hair down his back  the mother gasped i dont like your being out late joey id feel better if you and benny was safe in bed  oh well the boys voice sank to the level of his disappointment but after a silent interval he caught it up again cheerily oh well i reckon benny wont care much well go right back home we can have a piece before we go to bed  yes  benny thinks our applebutter is the best they is can we have some on bread with sugar on top  his mother did not answer at once and he said again as if relinquishing another ideal oh well  nancy rose up and kissed him yes go to the temple you might as well  truly mom oh benny hurrah shes let me come along  he ran round the cabin to his comrade and she heard them shouting and laughing together and then the muted scamper of their bare feet on the soft road toward the settlement  the mother said to herself hed get to see him sooner or later she drew her breath in a long sigh and went into the cabin what a day what a day it seems a thousand years she said aloud  are you talking to me nancy her brother asked from somewhere in the dark  no no only to myself david where did i put the baby oh i know ive let joey go to the temple to hear his father preach lord have mercy    vi   the discourse of dylks the second night was a chain of biblical passages as it had been the first night but an apparent intention which had been wanting before ran through the incoherent texts leaping as it were from one to another and there binding them in an intimation of a divine mission he did not say that he had been sent of god but he made the texts which he gave swiftly and unerringly say something like that for him to such as were prepared to believe it not all were prepared many denied the most doubted but those who accepted that meaning of the inspired words were of the principal people respected for their higher intelligence and their greater wealth  he had come to the temple with peter hingston and he went with him from it hingstons quarter section of the richest farmland in the bottom bordered his mill privilege with barns and corncribs and tobacco sheds and his brick house behind the mill was the largest and finest dwelling in the place his flocks and herds abounded his state was patriarchal and in the neighborhood which loved and honored him for some favor and kindness done nearly every man there for money when the crops failed for the storage of their wheat and corn in the deep bins of his mill when the yield was too great for their barns for the use of his sheds in drying their tobacco before their own were ready his growing sons and daughters until they were grown men and women obeyed his counsel as they had obeyed his will while children but he was severe with no one since his wife had died his natural gentleness was his manner as it had always been his make and it tempered the piety which in many was forbidding and compelling to a wistful kindness his faith admitted no misgiving for himself but his toleration of doubts and differences in others extended to the worst of skeptics he believed that revelation had never ceased he was of those who looked for a sign because if god had ever given himself in communion with his creatures it was not reasonable that he should afterwards always withhold himself a friendly humor looked from his dull eyes and in never quite coming to a formulated joke stayed his utterance as if he were hopeful of some such event in time he stood large in bulk as well as height and drew his breath in slow audible respirations  the first people of the community tacitly recognized him as the first man in it though none would have compared him in education with his nearest friend richard enraghty who had been the schoolmaster and was now the foremost of the united brethren he led their services in the temple and sometimes preached for them when it came their turn to occupy the house which they shared with the other sects hingston was a methodist but perhaps because their sects were so akin in doctrine and polity their difference made no division between the friends enraghty little and fierce and restless hingston large and kind and calm what they joined in saying prevailed in questions of public interest those who yielded to their wisdom liked to believe that enraghtys opinion ruled with hingston matthew braile alone had the courage to disable their judgment which he liked to say was no more infallible than so much scripture but the hardy infidel who knew so much law and was inexpugnable in his office owned that he could not make head against their gospel he could darken their counsel with citations from common sense and the age of reason but the piety of the community remained safe from his mockery  the large charity of hingston covered the multitude of the squires sins he would have argued that he had not been understood perhaps in the worst things he said but the fiercer godliness of enraghty was proof against the talk of a man whose conversation was an exhalation from the pit he had bitterly opposed matthew brailes successive elections he had made the pulpit of the temple an engine of political warfare and had launched its terrors against the invulnerable heathen he was like hingston in looking for a sign in that day of remoteness from any greater world the people of the backwoods longed to feel themselves near the greatest world of all and well within the radius of its mysteries they talked mostly of these when they met together and in the solitude of their fields they dwelt upon them on their week days and work days they turned over the threats and promises of the sabbath and expected a light or a voice from on high which should burst their darkness and silence  to most of them there was nothing sacrilegious in the pretensions which could be read into the closely scriptured discourse of dylks when he preached the second time in the temple the affability which he used in descending from the pulpit among them and shaking hands and hailing them brother and sister and personally bidding each come to the mercy seat convinced them of his authority no common man would so fearlessly trust his dignity among those who had little of their own they thronged upon him gladly and the women old and young alike trembled before him with a strange joy  where is your father sister gillespie he demanded of the girl who wavered in his strong voice like a plant in the wind  i dont knowhes at home she said  see that he comes another time i send him my peace and tell him that it will not return to me say that i said he needs me  he went out between enraghty and hingston and as they walked away he sank his voice back in words of scripture farther away he began his hymn    plunged in a gulf of dark despair    we wretched sinners lay  and ended with his shout of salvation    vii   the cabin of the reverdys stood on a byway beyond the gillespies sally had joined the girl on her way out of the temple and was prancing beside her as they went homeward together oh aint it just great i feel like as if i could fly i never seen the power in leatherwood like it was tonight hes sent you can tell that as plain as the nose on your face how happy i do feel i believe in my heart i got

here where the woods comes so closet aint it say janey i wisht youd come a little piece with me though i dont suppose the bad spirits would dast to come around a body right on the way home from the temple this way  they had reached the point where sally must part with the girl who stopped to lift the top rail of the bars to the lane leading from the road to her fathers cabin she let it drop again why ill go the whole way with you sally  will you well i declare to gracious youre the best girl i ever seen i believe in my heart ill rout abel out and make him go back home with you  you neednt the girl said im not afraid to go alone in the dark  well just as you say janey what do you do to keep from beun afraid  oh i dont know i just think i suppose  well i just want to squeal sally

well good night ive got half a mind to go back with you myself sally called as she lifted her hand to pull the latchstring of her door  jane gillespie found her father standing at the bars when she went back he mechanically let them down for her  i thought you would be in bed father she said gently but coldly  ive had things to keep me awake and its hot indoors he answered and then he demanded well  if it was his way of bidding her tell him of her evenings experience she did not obey him and he had to make another attempt on her silence was hughey there  hughey i dont know  didnt he ask to come home with you  i didnt see him sally reverdy came with me  yes i knew that  she was silent for another moment and then she said father i have a message for you he said i send my peace to him and it will not return unto me he said you needed him  gillespie knew that she meant dylks and he knew that she kept out of her voice whatever feeling she had in delivering his message  in the dark she could not see her fathers frown but she was aware of it in his answer you went there against my will well  i believe  you believe what do you believe  him that he is sent  why  i cant tell you he made me he made all the people there  her father was standing between her and the door he stood aside go to bed now but be quiet your aunt nancy is there  aunt nancy  laban came but he went back to the cross roads and shes over for the night with the baby  the baby oh ill be careful a joy came into her voice and the strain left it in something like a laugh  early in the morning she crept down the ladder from the loft her father had looped his cot up against the cabin wall and gone out nancy was sitting up in the bed she had made for herself on the floor coiling a rope of her black hair into a knot at her neck the baby lay cooing and kicking in her lap the morning air came in fresh and sweet at the open door  oh aunt nancy may i take her  yes ill get the breakfast your fatherll be hungry hes been up a good while i reckon  ill make the fire first and then ill take the baby  the girl uncovered the embers on the hearth and blew them into life then she ran out into the cornfield and gathered her apron full of the milky ears and grated them for the cakes which her aunt molded to fry for breakfast she took the baby and washed its hands and face talking and laughing with it  you talk to it a sight more than you do to anybody else jane the mother said dont put anything but its little shimmy on its goin to be another hot day  i believe the girl said ill get some water in the tub and wash her all over therell be time enough  itd be a good thing i reckon but you mustnt forget your milkin i dunno what our cowd do this morning if it wasnt for joey but hell milk her him and benny hingston between them somehow benny stayed with him last night  i did forget the milking the girl said putting the babys little chemise on but ill do it now sissy will have to wait till after breakfast for her washing she got the tin bucket from where it blazed atilt in the sun beside the back door of the cabin and took her deep bonnet from its peg she did not ask why the boys slept alone in the cabin but her aunt felt that she must explain  labans got work for the whole fall at the cross roads he went straight back last night i come here she had got through without telling the lie which she feared she must im goin home after breakfast  jane asked nothing further but called from the open door sukey sukey suk suk suk a plaintive lowing responded then the snapping sound of a cows eager hoofs the hoarse drumming of the milk in the bucket followed subduing itself to the soft final murmur of the strippings in the foam jane carried the milk to the spring house before she reappeared in the cabin with a cup of it for the baby  its so good for her to have it warm from the cow she said as she tilted the tin for the last drop on the little ones lips i wish youd leave her here with me aunt nancy  its about time she was weaned the mother said i reckon you better call your father now he must be ready for his breakfast bendin over that tobacco ever since sunup  jane took down the tin dinner horn from its peg and went to the back door with it and blew a long loud blast crumbling away in broken sounds  the baby was beating the air with its hands up and down and gurgling its delight in the noise when she came back oh honey honey honey she cooed catching it up and hugging it to her  the mother looked at them over her shoulder as she put the cakes of grated corn in the skillet and set it among the coals on the hearth its a pity you hant got one of your own  i dont want one of my own the girl said  i thought a spell backthe woman took up the subject again after a decent intervalthat you and hughey blake was goin to make a match the girl said nothing and her aunt pursued was he there last night  i didnt notice  many folks her aunt asked with whatever change or fulfilment of a first intent  from kneeling over to play with the baby the girl sank back on her heels with her hands fallen before her  i dont know  what did he preach  the word of god gods own words all scripture but it was like as if it was the first time you ever heard it  the girl was looking at the woman but seemed rapt from the sight of her in a vision of the night before  i reckon satan could make it sound that way nancy said but her niece seemed not to hear her nancy stood staring at her with words bitter beyond saying in her heart words that rose in her throat and choked her when she spoke she only said get up jane your fatherll be here in a minute  im not going to eat anything im going into the woods she staggered to her feet and dashed from the door the child looked after her with outstretched arms and whimpered pitifully but she did not mind its call  wheres jane her father said coming in at the back door  gone into the woods she said  illustration nancy stood staring at her with words beyond saying in her heartwords that rose in her throat and choked her  to pray i reckon  he sat down at the tableleaf lifted from the wall and his sister served him his breakfast he ate greedily but his hand trembled so in lifting his cup that the coffee spilled from it  when he had ended and sat leaning back from the board she asked him what are you going to do  the old man cleared his throat nothing yet let the lord work his will  and let joseph dylks work his will too ill have something to say about that  be careful woman be careful  oh ill be careful he has as much to lose as i have  no not half so much    viii   where matthew braile sat smoking most of the hot forenoon away on the porch of his cabin there came to him rumor of the swift spread of the superstition running from mind to mind in the neighborhood and catching like fire in dry grass the rumor came in different voices some piously meant to shake him with fear in the scorners seat which he held so stubbornly some in their doubt seeking the help of his powerful unfaith but he required their news from them all with the same mocking they were not of the scribes and pharisees the pillars of the temple the wise and rich and proud who had been the first to follow dylks but the poorer and lowlier sort who wavered before the example of their betters and were willing to submit it to the searching of the old sadducees scrutiny  the morning after abel reverdy had finished his work at the cross roads and had returned to the cares patiently awaiting him at home he rode his claybank so hesitantly toward the squires cabin that his desire to stop and talk was plain and braile called to him well abel what do they think of the prophet over at wilkinss many converts many dipped or sprinkled as the case required  reverdy drew rein and faced the squire with a solemnity presently yielding to his natural desire to grin at any form of joke and his belief that when the squire indulged such flagrant irreverence as this he must be joking yet he answered evasively you hearnt he says now he haint never gon to die  no but im not surprised to hear it about the next thing on the docket did he say that at the cross roads  said it right here in leatherwood sally told me the first thing when i got home you wasnt at the temple last night i reckon  well not last night braile said with an implication that he had been at the temple all the other nights which made reverdy laugh with guilty joy  one o the houndsno it was jim redfield hisselfstopped on the way out and he says whats this i hear you say you aint goin to die and dylks he lifts his hands up over his head and he says this shell will fall off and jim he says ive got half a mind to crack your shell and the believers they got round and begun to hustle jim off but dylks he told them to let him alone and he says i can endure strong meat but i must be fed on milk for a while what you spose he meant squire  braile took his pipe out and cackled toothlessly im almost afraid to think abel something awful though you say sally told you  yes  i should think sally would know what he meant if anybody he looked at abel and sallys husband joined him in safe derision tell you anything else  well no not just in so many words but it pears hes been teachun round all sorts of things in private like who do you reckon he says he is  not john the baptist i hope i dont know where we should get the locusts and wild honey for him in this settlement might try grasshoppers but the last beetree in the bottom was cut down when i was a boy i got a piece of the comb  i dont know if he said john the baptist but it was john anyway and they sayor thats what sally hearn tellthat when he was off with enraghty and hingston on some pointments down round seneca there was douns that uld make your hair stand up  you dont happen to know just what the doings were  well no i dont squire but they was douns to deceive the very elec from all i hearn  thats just what hingston and enraghty both arethe very elect what deceived them  oh pshaw now squire you know i dont mean they were deceived thats just a bible sayin you see brother briggs was sick and brother enraghty went along with dylks and brother hingston to preach in his place  couldnt dylks have done the preaching  i reckon he could but there was three pintments and may be dylks couldnt fill em all and may be he didnt want to fust brother enraghty preached in the temple at seneca and then at brother christhavens house off south of that and then at david masons the local preacher but brother mason has got the consumption and he couldnt preach so brother enraghty had to do all the preachun  i see well  well that wasnt anything out o the common but what dylks done to the devil beat all the preachun i reckon  howd it get out devil tell  no brother enraghty told and sally she got it putty straight from the wife of the man that he told it to  go on braile said i can hardly wait to hear  well sir they had just got acrost the leatherwood and brother enraghty felt as if he was lifted all at once into heaven air diffent and full of joy dylkss face got brighter and brighter and his voice sounded like music when they got to the top of the hill where you can look back and see the temple dylks turned his horse and stretched out his hands and says he how ignorant them people is of my true natur but time will show em well not just them words you know more dictionary and they preached with a great outpourun at seneca they didnt go to bed that night at all accordun to the womans tell that enraghty told her man sot up tell mornun prayun and singun hymns and readun the bible next mornun when they started out brother enraghty seen a bright ring round dylkss head and whenever dylks got down to pray the ring just stayed in the air over the saddle tell he got back and then it dropped round his head agin  reverdy stopped for the effect but braile only said go on go on  well sir so they kep on all that day and all the next night prayun and singun and readun the bible the next mornun when they started brother enraghty felt kind o cold all over and his teeth chattered and dylks looked at him hard in the face and says he time is precious now this is the time for work i now reveal unto you that you are paul the apostle  and what did paul the apostle say did he own up that he was paul  reverdy halted in his tale look here squire i dont feel just right havun you say such things it soundswell like profane swearun  any worse than dylks or enraghty you go right ahead abel ill take the responsibility before the law  well reverdy continued with a reluctance that passed as he went on what dylks told him was that he would increase his faith sot he could see the sights of his power and glorify him among men and then enraghty he commenced to git warm agin and dylks he turned up his eyes and kep still and it was so bright all round him that it made the daylight like dusk and dylks made him hark if he didnt hear a kind of rush in the air and dylks said it was the adversary of souls but he would conquer him they came into a deep holler in the woods and there they see the devil standun in their way and dylks he lights and hollers out fear not paul this day my work is done and he went towards satan and satan he raised his burnun wings and bristled his scales and stuck out his forked tongue and dropped melted fire from it and he rolled his eyes in his head hissun and bubblun like sinners boilun in hells kittles then dylks he got down on his knees and prayed and got up and give his shout of salvation and the devils wings fell and he took in his tongue and his eyes stood still and dylks he blowed his breath at him and satan he turned and jumped and every jump he give the ground shook and dylks and the balance of em follered him till the devil come to brother masons house and then he jumped through the shut winder out of sight they found brother masons son david in bed sick but he got up and took dylks in his arms and called him his savior and everybody got down on their knees and prayed and their faces was shinun beautiful and dylks he walks round david mason and rubs his hands over him and says i bind the devil for a thousand years and he hugged david and said the work is done and he wouldnt stay to preach there but told em they must come back with him to the temple here in leatherwood on the way back he wouldnt talk at all hardly but just kep sayun the perfect work is done and he didnt give his shout any more just snorted  brailes pipe had gone out but he pulled at it two or three times before he said well abel i dont wonder sally is excited i suppose you would be if you believed a word of this yarn  well its poorty curous douns squire reverdy said daunted between his natural bent and his wish to be of the squires thinking dont you believe it  oh yes i believe it but you know i believe anything if dylks did it and enraghty says he did it why there weve got the gospel for itright from st paul himself  he said no more and reverdy lingered a moment in vague disappointment then he sighed out well i must be goun i reckon and thumped his bare heels into the claybanks ribs and rode away  day by day the faith in dylks spread with circumstance which strengthened it in the converts they accepted the differences which parted husband and wife parent and child and set strife between brothers and neighbors as proof of his divine authority to bring a sword they knew by the hate and dissension which followed from his claim that it was of supernatural force and when the pillars of the old spiritual temple fell one after another under his blows they exalted in the ruin as the foundation of a new sanctuary they drove the worshipers out of the material temple methodists and moravians and baptists who had used it in common they met to dedicate it solely to the doctrine of the prophet who came teaching that neither he nor they should ever die but should enter in the flesh into the new jerusalem which should come down to them at leatherwood his steps in passing from teacher to prophet and to messiah were contested by a few with bitter and strenuous dissent but on the night when dylks proclaimed before the thronging assembly in the stolen temple i am god and there is none else they pressed round him men and women and children and worshiped him i am god and the christ in one he proclaimed in me father son and holy ghost are met there is no salvation except by faith in me they who put their faith in me shall never taste death but shall be translated into the new jerusalem which i am going to bring down from heaven he snorted the few unbelievers protested in abhorrence but the sisters in the faith shrieked and the brothers shouted we shall never die dylks came down from the pulpit among them and enraghty called out behold our god and they fell on their knees before him as it had been from the beginning the wisest and best the first in prayer and counsel were foremost in the idolatry and young girls and wives and mothers joined in hailing dylks as their creator and savior and besought him to bless and keep them  the believers were in such force that none of the hounds veteran disturbers of campmeetings and revivals who were there dared molest them the few members of the sects expelled from the temple of their common worship held aloof from the tumult in dismay and made no attempt to reclaim the sanctuary one man not of any church but of standing in the community tried to incite the sectarians to assert their rights but found no following among them they left the temple together with certain others who had been trembling toward belief in dylks but whom the profanation repelled when they were gone the tumult sank enough to let enraghty announce another meeting a week hence and then dismiss the congregation  an afore that were goin to have a murricle sally reverdy told squire braile sitting early the next morning at the receipt of gossip on his cabin porch with his pipe between his teeth her cow had not come up the night before and abel had not found her in the woodspasture when he went to look an i couldnt wait all day an i just slipped over to git some milk of mis braile she explained to the squire as she paused with the bucket in her hand i told her id bring it back the first chancet i git at our cow i reckon abel will find her some time or nuther and i lowed you had plenty  braile had already heard her explaining all this to his wife but now he kept her for the full personal detail of the last nights event at the temple she ended an unsparing report of the wonders seen with a prophecy of wonders to come  why braile said i dont see what you want of a miracle more than what youve had already the fact that your cow didnt come up last night and abel couldnt find her in the woodspasture this morning is miracle enough to prove that dylks is god besides didnt he say it himself and didnt enraghty say it  well yes they did sally assented overborne for the moment by his logic  and didnt you all believe them  well we all did sally said but look here squire braile what about them that didnt believe it  oh then there were some there that didnt believe it well i suppose nothing less than more miracles will do for them who were they  well of course there was jim redfield hes been aginst him from the first and there was old george nixon and there was hughey blake and a passel of the hounds that i dont count  why certainly not the hounds would doubt anything but im surprised at redfield and nixon and hughey blake what reason did they give for the faith that wasnt in them when a man stood up and snorted like a horse and said he was god why didnt they believe him or the other fellows that didnt snort but said they knew it was god from a sound that he made  oh pshaw now squire braile sally gurgled she did not yield quite with abels helplessness at a joke but the squires blasphemous irony had its force with her too though she felt it right to bring herself back to her religious conviction with the warning some day youll go too fur  yes im always expecting the lightning to strike in the wrong place didnt nixon or redfield or hughey blake say anything or did they just look ashamed of you down there on your knees before a man that you worshiped for a god because he snorted like a horse didnt anybody in their senses say anything or couldnt those that were out of their senses hear anything but their own ravings  the old man had pleased himself with his mockeries but now he let the scorn which his irony had hidden blaze out wasnt anybody ashamed of it all werent you ashamed yourself sally  well i dunno sally said easing herself from one foot to another and shifting the milkbucket from her right hand to her left where everybody is goun one way you dont know what to think exactly jane gillespie was there and she went on as bad as the best  jane gillespie  yes she come with me and she was goun to come home with me as furs the door and she would ha done it if it hadnt ha been for her father he bruk through the believers and drug her up from the floor where she was kneelun and stoopun her forehead over to the ground and pulled her out through the crowd you come home with me says he kind o harsh like and if it hadnt ha been for nancy billunss joey id ha had to git through the woods alone and the dear knows im always skeered enough but joey and benny hingston they come with me or i dont feel as if id been here to tell it  youd have been safe from the devil though he stayed with dylks didnt david say anything to the girl  just you come home with me and he looked so black that hughey blake he kind o started from where he was standun with the unbelievers and he says oh dont mr gillespielike thatand jane she said its my father hugh and she went along with him kind o wild lookun like she was walkun in her sleep i noticed it at the time  didnt dylks do anythingsay anything  well not that i seen or hearn but some o them that was standun nigh him was talkun about it when we all got out and they was sayun he said go with your earthly father your heavenly father will keep you safe i dont know whether he did or not but thats what they was sayun  and did gillespie say anything back  nott anybody heared just give dylks a look like he wanted to kill him and then dylks snorted and yelled salvation squire sally broke off some of us believers was talkun it over when we started home and wonderun what ought we to call him jest dylks dont sound quite right and you cant say almighty to a body exactly and you cant say lord what should you think was the right way  braile got back to his irony well thats an important question sally i should call him beelzebub myself but then im not a believer that night when he first came didnt he tell the people to call him just dylks  yes he did but that was for the present he said  has he given himself any other name  well no  then i should let it go at dylks  just plain dylks mr dylks wouldnt do or brother dylks wouldnt father dylks dont sound quite the thing  might try uncle dylks braile said cackling round his pipestem and now sally perceived that it was in vain to attempt serious discussion of the point with him  she said oh pshaw squire braile and lankly let herself down sidewise from the porch and flopped away on the road then she stopped and called back say squire what do you think of the good old man  what good old man  why dylks for a name thats what most of em wants to call him  sounds like a good name for them that like a name like it  he calls us the little flock  well well geese or sheep  oh pshaw now i wouldnt belong to the herd of the lost anyway thats what he calls the unbelievers  you dont tell me well now i will be scared in the dark  failing of any retort sally now flopped definitively beyond calling back  braile watched her going with a sardonic smile but when his wife after waiting for her to be quite gone came out to him he was serious enough  did that fool tell you of the goings on at the temple last night  as much as i would let her i suppose it had to come to something like that it seems as if the people had gone crazy  yes the squire sighed heavily theres no doubt about that and its a pity for such a religious community leatherwood creek used to be a very decent place to live in they were a lot of zealots but they got on well with one another that temple of theirs kept them together and they didnt quarrel much about doctrine now with the dylksites driving the oldfashioned believers out of the sanctuary and dedicating it to the exclusive worship of dylks the other denominations are going to fight among themselves and therell be no living with them and that isnt the worst of it this new deity isnt going to be satisfied with worship merely money of course hell want and get and hell wear purple and fine linen and feed upon fried chicken every day still the superstition might die out and no great harm done if the faith was confined to men but you know what women are martha  theyre what men make em mrs braile said sadly  its six of one and half a dozen of another im afraid but this god of theirs is a handsome devil and some poor fool of a girl or some bigger fool of a married woman is going to fall in love with him and then  did you just think of that well you cant help it by lettin your coffee get cold  braile tilted his chair down and rose from its rebound to follow his wife stiffly indoors the question is who will it be which poor girl which bigger fool and nothing can be done to prevent it the real god put it into human nature and all hell couldnt stop it well i suppose its for some wise purpose he ended in parody of the pious resignation prevailing on the tongues of the preachers    ix   david gillespie woke later than his daughter and when he had put away the shadows of his unhappy dreams he took up the burden of waking thoughts which weighed more heavily on him the sight of his child groveling at the feet of that blasphemous impostor and adoring him as her god pitilessly realized itself to him as a thing shameful past experience and beyond credence and yet as undeniable as his pulse his breath his seeing and hearing the dread which a less primitive spirit would have forbidden itself as something too abominable possessed him as wholly possible he had lived righteously and he had kept evil from those dear to him both the dead and the quick by the force of his strong unselfish will now he had seen his will without power upon the one who was dearest and whom he seemed to hold from evil only by the force of his right hand but his hand could not be everywhere and at all times and then  the breakfast which the girl had got for him and left on the hearth was warm yet when he put it on the table and she could not have been gone more than a few minutes but she had gone he did not know where without waiting to speak with him after the threats and defiances which they had slept upon when he had poured the coffee after the mouthfuls he forced down he acted on the only hope he had and crossed the woodspasture to his sisters cabin  she understood the glance he gave within from the threshold where he paused and said she aint here david nancy had cleared her breakfast away and was ironing at the shelf where she had eaten the baby was playing on the floor  gillespie looked down at it i didnt know but what shed come over to dress it she cares so much for it  it cares for her too but what brings you after her  shes gone somewhere without her breakfast we had high words last night after i brought her home  im afraid youll have higher words yet david joey was at the temple  nancy i dont know what to do about her  you knew what to do about me david she gave her stab and then she pitied him not for the pain she was willing he should feel from it but for the pain he was feeling before i know it isnt like that im sorry for you both you havent come to the end of your troubles  i cant understand the girl he said desolately up to a year ago she was like she had always been as biddable as a child and meek and yielding every way all at once shes got stiffnecked and wilful  she couldnt tell you why herself david we are all that waygood little girlsand then all of a sudden wilful women i dont know what changes us its harder on us than it is on you it came on me like a thief in the night and stole away my sense it gave joseph dylks his chance over me if it had been sooner or later i should have known he was a power of darkness as far as i could see him but my eyes were holden by my selfconceit and i thought he was an angel of light  hes got past being an angel now gillespie said forcing himself to the real matter of his errand far from the question of his daughters estrangement from her old self did joey tell you aboutlast night  nancy did not quit the psychological question at once up to that time we think our fathers and brothers are something above the human then we think theyre not even up to the common run of men we think other men are different because we dont know them yes she returned to his question with a sigh joey told me something about itenough about it i suppose it isnt right to let him be a spy on his father but i have to if i didnt he might want to go from the talk of those fools and get to believin with them he said there was boys and girls kneelin with the restlittle children almost and shoutin and prayin to joseph did you see em  yes it was dreadful nancy but it was worse to see the women the grownup girls and the mothers of the children it looked like they had been drinking it fairly turned me sick and my own daughter groveling on her knees with the worst if i didnt know dylks for the thing he is without an idea beyond victuals and clothes i might ha thought he had thrown a spell on em just for deviltry but they done it all themselves he just gave them the chance to play the fool  nancy resumed from her own more immediate interest well i let joey go and i dont know whether it helps or hurts to have him come home feelin about him and all the goings on just like i would myself he always says hes glad i wasnt there and he pities the poor fool women more than he despises his father or i ortnt to say despise joey dont despise anybody hes all good through and through i dont know where he gets it hes like laban and yet he aint any kin to laban  it must be hard on you nancy i dont know how you can bear up the way you do it is like a living streak of fire in me  thats because theres some hope left in you i can bear what ive got to because the feeling is all burnt out of me its like as if my soul was dead  you mustnt say that nancy  i say anything i please now anything i think im not afraid any more i haint got anything left to be afraid of  well i have david returned something im ashamed to be afraid of it his hold on jane i dont understand it weve always thought alike and believed alike and now to see her gone crazy after a thief and liar like that its enough to drive me mad the other way i dont only want to kill him i want to kill  david she stopped him and in his pause she added youre worse than what i ever was where is your religion  where is her religion i raised her to fear god the bible god that ive prayed to for her since she was a little babe but now since shes turned to this heathen image i begin to turn from him whats he been about if hes all seeing and all powerful to let loose such a devil on a harmless settlement like this where we were all brethren and dwelt together in unity no matter whether we believed in dipping or sprinkling we loved one anotherin the scripture senseand now look families broken up brothers not speaking wives and husbands parting parents cursing the day their children were born and children flying in the face of their parents did you hear about christopher mills how he come crying to his father and mother and tried to make them believe in dylks and when his father said it was all a snare and a delusion christopher went away telling them their damnation was sealed  no the woman said with bitter pleasure in the mockery but i heard how our new saint paul enraghty went over to his uncles the other day and said he should never see corruption and should never die and told his uncle he couldnt shoot him them that was there say the old man just reached for his rifle and was going to shoot saint paul in the legs and then paul begged off and pretended that he was only in fun  she laughed but david gillespie looked sadly at her i dont believe i like to hear you laugh nancy  why are you turning believer too david itll be time for me next she mocked i couldnt laugh at joseph may be but saint paul enraghty is a bigger rascal or a bigger fool than he is some say that joseph is just crazy and some that hes after money and that enraghtys put him up to everything  yes david moodily assented to the general tenor of her talk the way theyve roped in between em that poor fool davis whod been preaching for the united brethren and now preaches dylks first he wouldnt hardly go into the same house and then he wouldnt leave it till he could come with dylks i dont know how they do it sometimes i think the decentest man left in the place is that redmouthed infidel matthew braile sometimes im a mind to go to his house and get him to tell me what tom paine would do in my place  you are pretty far gone david but i dont wonder at it and i dont believe i think so badly of matthew braile either he may be an infidel but he believes in some kind of a god that wants people to do right he dont believe in mortal sin and may be thats where hes out and i hear tell he dont think theres going to be any raisin of the body or any last day or any hell but he keeps it to himself unless folks pester him i was afraid once to have joey talk with him before the plow went over me but now i let joey go to him all he wants to he lets joey come and pet the coon joey give him because he heard that the squires little boy used to want one from all i can make out they dont do much but talk about the little boy he seems to take comfort in joey because joeys like him or the squire thinks so  if jane had died when she was his little boys age i wouldnt feel as if i had lost her half as much as i do now  nancy lifted herself from her ironingboard and looked at her brother you told me what the duty of a woman was that found out she had two husbands dont you know what the duty of a man is that has a daughter turned idolater  no i dont nancy david answered doggedly  then why dont you wrestle with the lord in prayer perhaps hed make you some sign  oh prayer the thought of it makes me sick since i saw them fools wallowing round at dylkss feet and beseeching that heathen image to save them  then if you haint got any light of yourself and you dont believe the lord can give you any what do you expect me to do for you  i dont expect anything nancy if she was a child i could whip it out of her but when your child has got to be a woman you cant whip her  they left the hopeless case and began to talk of the things they had heard especially the miracle which dylks had promised to work hes appointed it for tonight gillespie said but i dont believe but what hell put it off if the coast aint clear when the time comes he always had the knack of leaving the back door open when he saw trouble coming up to the front gate  you cant tell me anything about joseph dylks nancy said she was ironing and at the last word she brought the iron down with the heavy thump that women give with it at an emphatic word in their talk what i wonder is that a man like you david could care what people in such a place as this would say if they found out that i was livin with laban when i knowed dylks was alive there wouldnt be any trouble with his followers i reckon hed just tell em he never saw me in his life before and that would do them  nancy her brother turned solemnly upon her as sure as im standing here i dont care for that any more if you say the word ill go and tell laban to come back to you  youre safe there david if youve parted with your conscience ive got it from you i wonder you dont go and follow after joseph dylks too all the best and smartest men in the place believe in him just look at mr enraghty a man with more brains and book learnin than all the rest put together willin to be the apostle paul because joseph dylks called him it and gets up in the temple where he used to preach christ jesus and him crucified and tells the people to behold their god in joseph dylks theres just one excuse for him hes crazy if he aint hes the wickedest man in leatherwood the wickedest man in the whole world hes worse than joseph dylks because he knows better joseph is such a liar that he could always make himself believe what he said but its no use your stayin here david she suddenly broke off to turn on her brother if youre a mind to let jane come ill try what i can do with her  the old man faltered at the door are you going to tell her nancy  im not going to tell you whether i am or not david  her words began harshly but ended with his name tenderly pitifully uttered  she called after him as he moved from her door heavily weakly more like an old man than she had noted him yet ill talk to jane and whatever i say will be for her good she watched him out of sight from where she was working then she went to the door with some mind to call more kindly yet to him but he was not to be seen and she went back to her ironing and ironed more swiftly than before moving her lips in a sort of wrathful revery from time to time she changed her iron for one at the hearth which she touched with her wetted finger to test its heat and returned to her table with an unconscious smile of satisfaction in its quick responsive hiss in her movements to and fro she spoke to the baby which babbled inarticulately up to her from the floor then she seemed to forget it and it was in one of these moments of oblivion that she was startled by a sharp cry of terror from it a man was looking in at the door    x   the man stood with one foot on the log doorstep outside and the other planted on the threshold of the cabin  nancy came toward him with her iron held at arms length before her what do you want she demanded fiercely  give me to drink he said with a grin  go round to the well she answered  the man bent his body a little forward and looked in but he did not venture to lift his other foot to the threshold where is your husband he asked  i have no husband what is it to you  thou sayest well  for him whom thou now hast is not thy husband you dont look a bit older and youre as handsome as ever nancy i suppose thats his he said turning his eye towards the little one on the floor lifted by her hands half upright and peering at him in conditional alarm  its mine she retorted  oh anybody could see that its the image of you and so is our joey you dont let your young ones favor your husbands much nancy and yet you was not always so set against me whats your notion letting joey come to the temple  to see for himself what you are  thats what i thought maybe well he dont seem to take to me much if i can judge from his face when he looks my way i haint been able to give him all the attention i may later but you neednt be troubled about him i wont do anything to make you anxious nancy i wish you could feel as friendly to me as i do to you will you let me have something to drink out of  go round she said and ill bring the gourd to you  dylks laughed but he obeyed and found his way to the well where he lowered the bucket at the end of the swoop and stood waiting for nancy to follow him with the dipper fashioned from a longnecked gourd as the drinking cup oftenest was in the western country of those days she held it out to him with her head turned and he carried it to his lips from the brimming bucket  he drank it empty and then turned it over with a long deep ahhh of satisfaction that was good good as the buttermilk would have been that you didnt think to offer me well i thank you for the water anyway you woman of samaria he held the gourd toward her but she did not take it and he laughed again if you could have had your way without sin youd have made it poison i reckon dont you know i could drink poison the same as water  you dont she said and as he swung the gourd in tacit question what to do with it since she did not offer to take it she bade him put it down  he did so and she set her foot on the thin bowl and crushed it like an egg shell he laughed is that the way you feel about me nancy pity for the gourd but dont you believe that if i was to will it so it would come good and whole again  you dont believe it she said  its not for me to believe or to unbelieve he answered i am that i am  oh yes she taunted him youve tried saying such things and youre not afraid because it hant killed you yet you think if you was just a man it would kill you  who can tell what i think perhaps something like what you say has gone through my mind why nancy if you would listen once i could convince you of it too come now look at it in this light if god lets a man say and do what the man pleasesand he has to do it every now and then according to what the book tellswhy aint the man equal with god you believe maybe that you would be struck dead if you said the things that i do but why aint i struck dead why either because it aint so at all or because im god it stands to reason dont it what is god anyway if he was so mighty and terrible wouldnt he have ways of showing it in these times just as much as in those old times that we read about in the book  dont you know that if there was anything besides you and me here now it would have sent the lightning out of this clear sky and blasted me when i said i was god well now well try it again listen i am god jehovah ruler of heaven and earth he stood a moment smiling there you see im safe and sound as ever may be you think it would be worse if you said i was god lots have said it last night all leatherwood was hanging to my arms and legs down there in the temple worshiping me if i hadnt been god it would have made me sick no mere man could stand the praising god gets in the churches all the time why that proves im what i say i am if nothing else does i saw it from the first i felt it i knew it he ended with his laugh  she stayed herself by the trunk of the tree overhanging the well yes youve got all leatherwood with you or as good as all and i dont wonder its made you crazy but dont you be so sure some day theres going to be a reckoning with you and youre going to wake up from this dream of yours she seemed to gather force as she faced him i could feel to be glad it was a dream i could feel to pity you but dont you believe but what its going to turn against you some day sooner or later some mans going to show the people what you are some woman  illustration you believe maybe that you would be struck dead if you said the things that i do but why aint i struck dead  there youve said it he broke in thats what ive come for youre the only woman that could hurt me not because you think you know me the best but because youre the bravest woman that ever was thats why ive got to have you with me in my dispensation male and female created he them in his image i can swing all leatherwood by myself but leatherwoods nothing if i had you with me we could swing the world nancy why dont you come to me he flung his arms wide and bent his stalwart shape toward her leatherwoods nothing i tell you why you ought to see the towns overthemountains you ought to see philadelphia where i came from the last thing everywhere the people are waiting for a sign just as theyve always been and we would come with a signplenty of signs the perfect godhead male and female for the greatest sign of all why i wonder theres a christian woman living with the slur that the idea of just one male god throws on women dont you know that the egyptians and the greeks and the romans and everybody but the hebrews had a married god and that the godhead was husband and wife if you had ever read anything at all you would know that  the bad vulgar beauty of his face set in its flowing beard and hair glowed on her  you neednt look that way at me joseph dylks she answered i dont want any booklarning to know what you are youre what you always was a lazy goodfornothingoh i dont say you wasnt handsome that was what done it for me when i made you my god but i wont make you my god now though youre as handsome as ever you was handsomer if thats any comfort to you  nothing to what youre coming to me would be nancy  youll have to do without then you think you can twist me round your finger like you used to if you willed it but ive outlived you you and your will now i want you to go and not ever come near me again or ill have laban here the next time  laban laban oh the man who is not thy husband im not afraid of your having laban here let him come ive converted worse sinners than laban he had remained bent forward with his gaze still on her now he lifted himself and said as if it were another word of his spell come nancy  she answered if i thought there was any mercy in you  why im allmerciful as well as allmighty nancy he jeered  noas if concluding her thought she said its no use you couldnt do a right thing if you wanted to you can only do wrong things i see that  what is right and what is wrong when you stand by my side in your half of the godhead you will know that there is no difference why even a poor human being can make wrong right by wanting it enough and with god there is nothing but one kind of thing the thing that god allows it dont matter whether its letting the serpent tempt that fool woman in eden or josephs brethren selling him into egypt or samuel hewing agag in pieces or the israelites smiting the heathen or david setting uriah in the forefront of the battle or solomon having hundreds of wives its all right if god wills it youll say its put right by what happens to them that do wrong be god yourself and the right and the wrong will take care of themselves i want you to come and help me why with the sister and daughter of old david gillespie both following me  she suddenly shrank from the grandeur of judging of him to the measure of her need of his forbearance oh why cant you let david alone whats he ever done to you  what have i ever done to him dylks demanded temporizing on her ground  why cant you let jane alone  he gave his equine snort as if the sense of his power could best vent itself so why cant she let me alone that girl bothers me worse than all the other women in leatherwood put together she wont let me let her alone  she was all right before you came why cant you let her go back to hughey blake  hughey blake oh then it wasnt a light of malign intelligence shone in his eyes well i havent got anything against hughey blake  oh if youd only let her go back to hughey if youd only let her alone id  youd what he bounded toward her and at her recoil he laughed and said i didnt mean to scare you  i wasnt scared you cant scare me joseph dylks its past that long ago with you and me but if i only knowed what you was up to what you would really take to let david alone to let her go back to hughey blakebut there aint any pity in you  dont i tell you im full of pity look here nancy i dont ask you to come with me to be one with me to go halves in the godhead all at once its been step by step with me first exhorter then prophet then disciple then the son then the father but its been as easy you dont know how faith the faith of the elect helps along and you would have that from the beginning they would take you on my word you wouldnt have to say or do anything but thats not what im expecting now he hurried to add smiling at the cloud of refusal in her face im not fooling all i ask now is to have you come and see me do a miracle at brother hingstons tonight ill do two miracles if youll come and one will be sending jane gillespie away from me and back to hughey blake youll want to see that even if you dont want to see me turn a bolt of cloth into seamless raiment by the touch of my hand  you are a wicked man joseph dylks the woman solemnly answered and im sorry i asked you anything you couldnt do good if you tried she pulled her sunbonnet across her face as if to hide it for shame and went back slowly toward the cabin  salvation dylks shouted after her and gave his equine snort he began to sing as he took his way through the woods    plunged in a gulf of dark despair    we wretched sinners lay  at first he sang boldly filling the woods with the mocking of his hymn but at the sound of footsteps crackling over the dry falling twigs toward him intermittently as if they paused in question and then resumed their course toward him his voice fell brokenly silencing itself till at the encounter of a man glimpsed through the trees and pausing in a common arrest it ceased altogether  who are you dylks demanded of the slight workworn figure before him  laban billings the man faltered  well then laban billings make way for the lord thy god dylks powerfully returned and as if he had borne the man down before him he strode over the place where he had stood and lost himself in the shadows beyond  laban hurried on stumbling and looking back over his shoulder till he found himself face to face with nancy at the door of the shed behind the cabin she was looking too in the direction dylks had ceased from their sight in the woods they started from each other in mutual fright  nancy he entreated i didnt see you ii wasnt comin to see you indeed indeed i wasnt i just thought i might ketch sight of the baby its pretty hard to do without you both and i was just passinwell theyve knocked off work at the corners sos to come to the miracle at hingstons mill tonightbut ill go right away again nancy  you neednt laban come in and see the baby  nancy he uttered joyfully then he faltered do you think it will be right  oh who knows whats right she retorted then at his stare she demanded didnt you run across anybody in the woods  yes  what did he look like  like what they tell the leatherwood god looks like theyre half crazy about him at the corners they dont hardly talk about anything else  did you think he looked like god  more like satan i should say hes handsome enough for satan  it was joseph dylks  yes i spicioned that  and hes been here wanting me to go away with himoverthemountains  laban made a dry sound in his throat and it was by a succession of efforts that he could say andandand  oh could you ask laban she lamented youre my husband dont you know it at the sound of her lament a little voice of fear and hope answered from the cabin the fatherhunger came into the mans weak face making it strong come in and see our baby laban  she put out her hand to him innocently like a little girl to a little boy and he took it i know its just for the baby and i feel to thank you nancy he said and together they went into the cabin  at sight of him the baby crowed recognition she knowed you in a minute the mother said and she straightened the skirt of the little one which the father had deranged in lifting the child from the floor i dont believe shell ever forget you i reckon she wont if i have any say in it me and joey talks about you every night when were gettin her to sleep she gurgled out a halfsob halflaugh as the little one pulled and pushed at his face which he twisted this way and that to get her hand in his mouth she always cared more for you than she did for me ill set you a piece laban i was just going to get me a bite of something i dont take my meals very regular with you not here  well i am a little hungry with the walk from the corners after such an early breakfast  well you just keep her  oh ill keep her he exulted  she hustled about the hearth getting the simple meal which she made more than she had meant and they had a joyous strange time together at the leaf she stayed from the well  he kept the baby in his lap while he ate then he walked the floor till she fell asleep in his arms when he lifted himself from laying her in the rough cradle which he had himself made for her he said without looking at the mother now i must be going nancy  dont go on account of me laban she said with the same fierce courage she had shown in driving him from her before if its for me  nancy ive thought it all out since i been away and i reckon i aint your husband in the sight of god you was right about that and i wont ever come back again tillas long as he glanced wistfully at the little one in the cradle and then he turned to go out of the door and andgoodby nancy  she followed him to the door kiss me laban  he put away the arms she lifted toward him no he said i reckon it wouldnt be right and he turned and walked swiftly away without looking back    xi   the woman stood watching the man as long as she could see him and long after with her left hand lifted to the jamb of the door higher than her head then from the distance where he passed from sight over the brow of the hill another figure of a man appeared and slowly made its way down to the cabin as she knew while he was still far off it was matthew braile who as long as he sat in the seat of the scorner with his chair tilted against the wall seemed a strong middleaged man but when he descended from his habitual place with the crook of his stick worn smooth by use in his hard palm one saw that he was elderly and stiff almost to lameness he carried himself with a forward droop and his gaze bent ponderingly on the ground as if he were not meaning to look her way and would pass without seeing her  squire braile she called to him and as he straightened himself and turned round toward her she besought him do you believe theres any god  oh he answered and he smiled at the challenge from the somewhat lonely elevation which he knew the thoughts of his neighbors kept aloof from the sordid levels of politics and business why nancy havent we got one right here in leatherwood  thats what makes me think there aint any squire braile if youre not in too much of a hurry i wish youd stop and talk to me a minute im in trouble  most women are or men for the matter of that what is it nancy im rather stronger on law than gospel but if i can be any help why you know your joeys an old friend of mine and ill be glad to help you  he came toward her where she had stepped from the threshold and sat crouched on the hewn log and stood looking down at her before he sank at her side  you may think its pretty strange my asking you for help wont you set i cant let you come inside because the babys just got to sleep  well he assented if youre not afraid to be seen with such an infidel in the full light of day he jested confronting her from the log where he sank what would brother gillespie say  she ignored his kindly mockery and again she began what makes you believe theres a god you dont believe in the bible  not altogether nancy  do you believe in the bible god  as much as the biblell let me  then do you believe in the miracles  what are you after nancy billings  if you saw a miracle would you believe it  that would depend on who did it now i want you to let me do a little of the catechizing ive liked you and laban ever since you came to leatherwood and you know how your joey has all but brought my boy back to me well do you believe in god  no  why dont you  a god that would let joseph dylks claim to be him and let them poor fools kneel down to him and worship him would an allwise and allpowerful god do that  what makes you say allpowerful havent you seen time and time again when good didnt prevail against evil and dont you suppose hed have helped it if he could and why do you call him allwise is it because men are nowise that wouldnt prove it would it and about the miracles what does a miracle prove does it prove that the person who does it is of god or just that faith is stronger than reason in those who think its happened  but sin do you think theres such a thing nancy pursued  there you are catechizing me again yes i think theres sin because ive known it in myself if i havent in others  and what is itsin  well nancy it seems to vary according to the time and place but i should say it was going against what you knew was right at the time being  and do you always know  always the old man answered solemnly i never was mistaken in my life whether i went for or against it and ive done both  the woman drew a hapless sigh yes i reckon its so  braile was putting out his stick to help himself in rising after the silence she let follow she came from it and reached a staying hand toward him and supposinsupposinthere was a womanthat there was a woman and her husband left her and he kept away years and years till she thought he was dead and she married somebody else and then he come back would it be a sin for her to keep on with the other one when she knowed the first one was alive  i reckon thats what would be called a sin nancy not that id be very quick to condemn her  and supposin that the first one hadnt claimed her yet and shed made the other one leave her and then the first one come and wanted her to join him in the wickedest thing that ever was and she wasnt as strong as she had been and she felt to need the protectionlike of the other one would it be a sin for her to take him back  braile made again as if to rise i reckon youd better talk to mis braile about a thing like that you see a man  she stayed him again with a beseeching gesture  squire braile do you believe that god is good  ah now im more at home in a question like that you might say that if he lets evil prevail its either because he cant help it or because he dont care or even because he thinks its best for mankind to let them have their swing when they choose to do evil i incline to think thats my idea hes made man well say made him in his own image and hes put him here in a world of his own to do the best or the worst with it the way i look at it he doesnt want to keep interfering with man but lets him play the fool or play the devil just as hes a mind to but every now and then he sends him word if were going to take what the book says he sent him word made flesh once and i reckon he sends him word made spirit whenever theres a human creature comes into the world all loving and all unselfishlike your joey ormymy jimmy  the old mans voice died in his throat and the woman laid her hand on his knee he trembled to his feet now when i think of such spirits coming into this world im not afraid of all the devils out of hell dylksing round  he walked on down the road and nancy went indoors and went about her household work she cleaned the dishes and trimmed the hearth she spun the flax which tufted her wheel then she took the rags of some garments past repair and in the afternoon shadow of her threshold she cut them into ribbons and sewed them end to end and wound them into balls for weaving into carpets  people as the evening drew on went by singly in twos in groups silent for the most part but some talking seriously these looked at nancy without speaking but some asked aint you goin to the miracle and she shook her head for answer  she had brushed her hair and put it up neatly after her indoors work was done but she was in what she would have called her everyday clothes and the passers had on their sunday clothes the girls wore their newest plaids of linseywoolsy and the young men wore tall beaver hats and long highcollared coats with tight pantaloons which some pretenders to the latest fashions had strapped under their boots they had on their sunday faces too some severe some sly some simple and kind but all with an effect of condition for whatever might be going to happen they went as the people of leatherwood went to the temple on the sabbaths before their meetings had been turned from the orderly worship of the most high to the riot of emotions raised by the strange man who proclaimed himself god in their expectations of the sign which he had promised to give them both those who believed and those who denied him found themselves in a sort of truce they were as if remanded to the peace of the time before the difference which had rent the community into warring fragments in this truce brothers were speaking who had not spoken since they accepted or refused the new god families walked together in the harmony which he had lately counseled children honored their believing or disbelieving parents fathers and mothers ceased to abhor their children as limbs of satan according to their faith or unfaith let everybody come to the sign he had exhorted them when he promised them the miracle just as if they had never seen or heard me before and let his creatures judge their creator with love for one another in their hearts  in all there was an air of release and the young people looked as if they were going to one of the social gatherings they would have called a frolic in the backwoods phrase nancy heard a girl titter in response to her companions daring whisper wonder if mis hingstons going to pass round the apples and cider they walked in couples openly or demurely glad of being together for the time and as if the miracle before them were the wonder of coming home through the woods with their arms around each other whether the miracle of the seamless raiment was wrought or not  it was their elders who were more singly set upon the fulfilment of the sign and who went with a more passionate expectation in the doubt or the faith which differenced them children were more bent upon the affair of the evening than the young girls and the young men they had been privileged in being allowed to go with their fathers and mothers when they had not been punished in being left at home and they subdued themselves as they could to the terms of keeping step beside them with the bare feet that felt winged and ached to fly old and young they passed nancys cabin thinly or at intervals but sometimes in close groups they glanced kindly or unkindly askance at her when they did not question her and very possibly they read in her sitting there boldly aloof from them a defiance of the question which had begun to gather about her in the common mind since laban had left her for his work at the cross roads with none of those saturday night returns which it had at first expected it was known that laban was of the same opposition to dylks as nancy and her brother and it could not be that dylks had caused the break between her and laban which no one would have noticed if it had been an effect of religion it could only be that laban had left her or that her temper had driven him away  with the last came a crowd of boys whose lagging she understood when her own boy jumped down from the cabin door beside her  did i scare you mother he asked at her start  no i was expecting you and you always come in at the back youll want your supper ill be bound what made you so late and all out of breath so  i been running we just got the last of the tobacco in this evening and mis hingston made me stay and eat with benny she said shed excuse me to you i just left the other boys up over the hill and run through the woods to get here in time and ask you  to ask me what joey dear she put her arms fondly round the boys knees and pulled him down to her  the boys said you let me go to the temple all i want to but i told them the miracle was different and id have to ask you first i told mis hingston and i told the boys me n benny got them to come round kin i mother mis hingston thought may bemay beyou might come yourself but i told her i didnt believe you would  no i wont go joey what makes you want to go  oh i dont know all the boys are goin and i never seen a miracle yet  do you believe he can do a miracle  well it would be some fun to see what he would do if he didnt id like to hear what hed say  and what would you think if he did do it that he wasgod  oh no mother he couldnt be mr dylks couldnt i aint ever thought for a minute that he was that  and if he failedif he tried and put himself to shame before everybody how would you feel  well mother nobody ast him to nancy was silent for so long that the boy said discouragedly but if you dont want me to go  her face hardened from the pity of her inward vision of the mans humiliation as if his own son had judged him justly yes you can go joey but be careful be careful and dont stay too late and if anything happens  oh surely mother nothing will happen he exulted and he broke from her hold and ran down the road where the group of boys had waited for him and as he ran he leaped into the air and called to them shes let me shes let me and the boys leaped up in response and called back hurrah hurrah and when he had come up with them they all tried to get their arms round him and trod on his heels and toes in pushing one another from him  in the august twilight which now began to pale the hot sunset glow as if she had waited to come alone in her pride or in her shame the woman who was bearing the body of the miracle to the place where the wonder was to be wrought came last of all to pass nancy where she sat at her door she was that strong believer who in her utter trust when she heard that cloth would be needed for the seamless raiment of his miracle had offered to provide it and now neither in pride nor in shame but in defiance of her unbelieving husband she was bearing away from her house the bolt of linseywoolsey newly home from the weaver which was to have been cut into the winters clothing of her children she had spun the threads herself and dyed them and they had become as if they were of her own flesh and blood she carried the bolt wrapped about with her shawl bearing it tenderly in her arms as if it were indeed her flesh and blood her babe which she was going to lay upon an altar of sacrifice    xii   the crowd at hingstons mill grew with the arrival of the unbelievers as well as the believers in dylks they came from all sides sometimes singly and sometimes in groups and the groups came disputing as often as agreeing among themselves when a group was altogether believing they exchanged defiances with a party of those religious outcasts the hounds disturbers of campmeetings and baptisms and notorious mockers now of the leatherwood god in his services at the temple but the invitation given to see the promised miracle had been to all the hounds had felt in it the tenor of a challenge and they had accepted it defiantly they jeered at the believers as these arrived sometimes hailing them by name they neighed and whinnied and shouted salvation and in the intervals of silence they burst out with the first lines of the believers hymn  there were those who mocked i am god almighty the father and the son are one and i am both of em put together and oh dylks save us dont leave us dylks make the devil jump joseph make him rattle his scales for us fetch on your miracle the believing women turned away some of the younger tittered hysterically at a droll profanation of their idols name and then one of the ruffians applauded thats right sisters we like to have you enjoy yourselves promised to let anybody in particular see you home tonight the girls tried to control themselves and laughed the more and the hound called say girls lets have a dancea dance before the lord  jane gillespie had come with her father in the family pride which forbade them to reject each other publicly the girl stood a little apart from her father and near her hung wistfully fearfully the young farmer whom the neighborhood gossip had assigned her for an acceptable if not accepted lover she looked steadfastly away from hughey blake with her head lifted and her cheeks coldly flushed under the flame of her vivid hair she was taller than the other girls and showed above the young man  say hughey one of the hounds spoke across the space they had left between them and the decent unbelievers cant you gimme a light reach up he held out a cigar in the joke of kindling it at the girls hair  hughey blake turned and his helpless retort you ought to be ashamed of yourself redoubled the joy of the hounds the girl glanced quickly at him with what meaning he could not have made out and it might have been fear of her which kept him hesitating whether to cross over and fall upon his tormentor he looked at her as if for a sign but she made as if she had heard nothing then while he still hesitated a slender sinewy young fellow came down the open ground with a soft jolt in his gait like that of a rangy young horse he wore high boots with his trousers pushed carelessly into their tops and for a sign of weekday indifference to the occasion a checked shirt of the sort called hickory he struck up the brim of his platted straw hat in front with one hand and with the other on his hip stood a figure of backwoods bravery such as has descended to the romance of later times from the reality of the indianfighting pioneers  you fellows keep still he called out if you dont ill make you  retorts of varied sense and nonsense came from the hounds but without malice in their note one voice answered id like to see you try jim redfield  the other jolted closer toward the line of the hounds and leaned over did i hear somebody speak he asked  i reckon not jim the voice of his challenger returned come to join the band  i didnt come to worry helpless women redfield said  thats right jim theres where were with you dyou reckon apostle hingstonll let us in to see the miracle if well keep the believers straight while the almighty is at it  i cant say for mr hingston redfield returned but if i was in his place id want to keep my jug out of sight when you fellows were on duty  redfield passed the gillespies as he lounged back to his place with a covert glance at the girl who made no sign of seeing her champion  the woman who was bringing the body of the miracle came round the corner of the mill and showed herself in the open space with the bolt of cloth borne carefully in her arms  why its a baby came from that merriest of the hounds whom redfield had turned from an enemy into a troublesome friend of the believers reckon the womenll have something to say to that if he tries to turn eer a baby into seamless raiment  the fellow got the laugh he had tried for and when redfield looked toward him again he said all right jim im keepin em quiet the best i can but the elect will make a noise sometimes  the woman with her bundle passed through the open door of the house behind the mill the public entrance was at the front where by day the bags of grain were lifted by rope and tackle to the upper story and the farmers who brought them climbed up by the inner stairways the believers had expected that they were to come in by way of the dwelling but now the burly figure of the miller with the light of a candle behind it showed black in the doorway and he spoke up in his friendly voice neighbors we want you all to go round to the front of the mill and come in there the miracle is going to be done on the boltingcloth floor where there will be room for all that wants to see we dont mean to keep anybody out whether they believe or dont believe the only thing we want is for you all to be quiet and not make trouble and now come in as quick as you can so you can be sure we havent had time to do anything to the cloth that the seamless raiment is going to be made out of  hounds and everybody called that gayest voice among the outcasts  hounds and everybody the miller humorously assented and his black bulk melted into the dark as the candle disappeared within  the dim light from tin lanterns threw the pattern of their perforations on the walls and roofs of the interior and showed the tracery of the floury cobwebs the people could scarcely see their way to the stairs by the glimmer and there was more talking with nervous laughter than there had been outside one of the hounds called out i dont want any of you girls to kiss me and gave the relief of indignation to the hysterical emotion of the believers the more serious of the unbelievers found escape in their helpless laughter from their tense expectation of triumph in the failure of the promised miracle  the wide space on the boltingcloth floor before the bins mounded high with new wheat and the rows of millstones motionless under their empty hoppers was lighted by candles in tin sconces but these were so few that they shone only on the foremost faces and left those behind a gleam of eyes or teeth the familiar machinery had put on a grewsome strangeness which had its final touch from the roll lying on the table like something dead a table had been set in front of the barrels under the bolting cloths and the muslin funnels empty of flour hung down into the barrels with the effect of colossal legs standing in them the air of the hot night was close within a damp odor from the water flowing under the motionless mill wheels seemed to cool it but did not the perspiration shone on the faces where the light fell on them  the miller and his family had places in the front line of the spectators and with them was the woman who had given the cloth for the miracle and who stood staring at the stuff which she had known so intimately in every thread and fiber with an air of estrangement  when the stumbling feet of the last arrivals ceased on the stairs the miller stood out facing the crowd and told them that he expected the good old man now any minute together with the apostle paul whom they all knew by his earthly name as their neighbor mr enraghty he asked them to be as still as they could and especially after the good old man came to be perfectly silent not to whisper and not to move if they could help it there was nothing though he said to hinder the believers from joining in their favorite hymn and at once the wailing of it began to fill the place when it ended the deepdrawn breath of some wearied expectant made itself heard with the shifting of tired feet easing themselves the minutes grew into an hour with no sign of dylks or enraghty and the miller was again forced to ask the patience of his neighbors but there began to be murmurs from the unbelievers and more articulate protests from the hounds some children whom the believers had brought with them to see the divine power manifest itself whimpered and were suffered to lie down at the feet of their fathers and mothers and forget their disappointment in sleep a babe too young to be left at home woke and cried and was suckled to rest again with ironical applause from the hounds  at the end of two hours of waiting relieved with pleas and promises from the miller there was no word from dylks and no token of his bodily presence with the scoffing of the unbelievers the prayers of the faithful rose come soon oh lord send thy power remember thy little flock upon these at last broke falteringly stragglingly a familiar voice the voice of abel reverdy kindly and uncouth as himself and expressive like his presence of an impartial interest in the feelings of both the faithful and the unfaithful he was there in the company of his wife who held a steadfast place among the believers while abel ranged freely from one party to the other and could not well have known himself of either though friendly with both he was of a sort of disapproving friendship even with the hounds and now his voice said in impartial suggestion why not somebody go and fetch him  good for you abel came from the hound who was oftenest spokesman for the others why dont you go yourself abel  other voices applauded and abel was beginning to share a general confidence in his fitness for the mission when his wife spoke up deed and deed i can tell you he aint agoun to do no such a thing not if we stay here all night murricle or no murricle i aint agoun to have him put his head into the lion of judahs mouth and have it bit off like as not i cant tell from one minute to another whether hes a believer or not and if anybody is to go for the good old man its got to be a studdy believer and not a turncoat of many colors like abel  if sally had satisfied her need of chastizing her husband for his variableness and found a comfort in her scriptural language not qualified by its wandering application abel loyally accepted her open criticism thats so sally i aint the one to send i misdoubted it myself or id a gone without sayin nothin in the first place but as sally says he addressed the crowd it ought to be a believer  then why not sally a scorner suggested she did not refuse and there was a whispering between her and those next her in debate of the question but it was closed by the loud austere voice of one of the believing matrons in the apostolic mandate let your women keep silence in the churches the text was not closely apt it was not a precept obeyed in the revivals of any of the sects in leatherwood it was especially ignored in the meetings of the dylks believers but its proclamation now satisfied the yearning always rife in them to affiliate their dispensation with the scriptural tradition  well that settles it sister coombs sally promptly assented i wasnt agoun to anyway and i aint agoun to now if i stay here all night or the good old man dont ever come  why not jim redfield a hound demanded and the miller tried to be stern in calling out no trifling but lost effect by gently adding friends the unbelievers laughed but the millers retreat from the bold stand he had taken was covered by redfields threat that if those fellows kept on he would give them something to laugh about  as he stepped into the neutral space between the friends and enemies of dylks he had a sort of double fearfulness for the women because he was not only not of their faith but because he was of no religious sect in a community where every one but an open infidel like matthew braile was of some profession he came to the baptist services with his mother but he had not been baptized and he was not seen at the house to house prayer meetings where the young people came with the old or at the frolics where dancing was forbidden but not kissing in their games or in their walks home through the woods he was not supposed to be in love with any one and he lived alone on a rich bottomland farm with his mother in a house which his father had built where his grandfathers log cabin had stood he was of a tradition which held him closer to the wilderness than most of the people of leatherwood in the two generations before him the redfields had won and held their lands against the indians and had fought them in the duels from tree to tree which the pioneers taught the savages or learned from them risking their lives and scalps in the same chances he was of the sort of standing which old family gives even where all families are new and he was now making his way politically in spite of his irreligion he meant to go to the legislature eventually and in a leisurely sort he was reading law and reciting his blackstone to matthew braile as he came and went from the old infidels house he was apt to stop at the tavern porch where the few citizens who could detach their minds from the things of another world gave them in cloudy conjecture to the political affairs of this or to scrutiny of the real motives actuating the occasional travelers who apparently arrived for a meals victuals or a nights lodging with these redfield had scarcely a social life but he could talk with them almost to the point of haranguing them for they were men at the store where his mothers errands sometimes took him he shrank from the women as timid as they when they dismounted from their saddles or wagons and slipped in with their butter and eggs and passed out again deeply obscured in their sunbonnets  they were mostly women past the time of life when men look at them curiously but once redfield was startled by meeting a young girl as he was trying to go out and began losing himself with her in that hopeless encounter of people who try to give way to each other and keep passing to the same side at once her face and her red hair burned one fire but at last she stopped stone still and let him go by with a sort of angry challenge in her blue eyes he knew that it was jane gillespie without knowing her to speak with as he would have said and he knew that against her fathers will she was one of the followers of dylks the idolatry was not yet open and scandalous but since then he had heard his mother denouncing her as a worthless hussy with the other women who had worshiped dylks in that frenzy at the temple he walked up and down passing near where she stood with her father and hughey blake and lost his breath at each approach and caught it again at each remove it so vividly seemed that he must speak to her though he did not know what he wished to say that it was as if he really had done so when he heard one of the hounds saying well and what are you goin to do about it jim  then he heard himself boasting im going after dylks myself and if hell come peaceably and do his miracle ill take him for my god and if he wont god have mercy on him  he was answering his jeering questioner in his words but his eyes were on the girl her own eyes were lowered after a glance at her father and hughey blake and his vow remained in his ears a foolish vaunt while he stood unable to return to his place a voice which no one knew came from the darkness outside  behold it said i am the presence of the most high and i come to you with my peace the miracle that ye wait to see has been wrought already unseen of you the cloth before you has been touched by my power and turned into the seamless raiment which ye seek as a sign but it shall not be shown to you now ye shall see it seven days and seven nights hence on the eighth night at the temple till then have patience have faith thus saith the lord  the voice died from the medley of scriptural phrase and a shiver of awe passed over those who had heard one of the believing women called out praise ye the lord then a yell of mockery broke from the hounds and some one shouted lets have a look and the crowd rushed upon the roll of cloth which lay on the table where the woman who had brought it in her arms had put it and had stood patiently anxiously trustfully waiting  she spread her arms out over it with a piteous gesture like a mother trying to keep her child from harm oh dont oh dont she implored its my cloth i spun it i wove it every thread its all weve got for our clothes this winter dont touch it dont tear it  illustration its my cloth i spun it i wove it every thread its all weve got for our clothes this winter  her prayer was like a signal for its denial one of the hounds pushed her away and caught the cloth up we wont hurt it sister bladen we just want to see what a seamless garment looks like anyway maybe itll fit some of us here boys take a hold  he held by the outer edge of the cloth and flung the bolt unfurling itself toward his fellows over the heads of the believing men who had crowded forward to save it from the desecration while the woman tried to seize it from him beseeching imploring oh dont hurt it bill murray oh be careful dont let it drop oh dont dont dont  we cant do it any hurt sister bladen if its got a miracle inside of it one of the ruffians mocked you tell her we wont hurt it jim redfield shell trust you  the women believers were sobbing the men gathered themselves for a struggle with the surprise sprung upon them but held back as if in a superstitious hope of help from the god whom the women seemed not to trust in his failure of them  here you fellows redfield shouted over the tossing heads before him what do you want to spoil her cloth for  his look and voice had their effect with the angry pushing shuffling elbowing wailing weeping crowd in a pause like the arrest of curiosity  let go that cloth bill he said not with authority but in a tone of good fellowship  the miller interposed with his friendly voice and it seemed as if the unbelievers would give way in pity of the poor woman who had brought the cloth suddenly the bolt of stuff which murray had conditionally yielded was twitched from redfield in boisterous fun and then in the frenzy more of mischief than malice it was seized by the hounds and torn into shreds find the seamless raiment they yelled to one another the unbelievers stood aside the believers did nothing in a palsy of amaze the poor woman to whom her toil and pride in it had hallowed the stuff sank down staying herself on her hands from the floor in hapless despair her moaning and sobbing filled the place after the tumult of destruction had been stricken silent oh i dont care for the miracle she kept lamenting but what are my children going to wear this winter oh what will he say to me it was her husband she meant    xiii   the riot in hingstons mill after the failure of dylks to appear personally and work the promised miracle left the question of his divinity where it had been with no evident change in their numbers on either side the believers assented the unbelievers denied the faithful held that the miracle had been wrought and the seamless raiment torn to pieces by the mob some declared that they had seen the garments and tried to keep them from the sacrilege but had been overpowered the unfaithful laughed at the pretense and defied the faithful to show any scrap of the cloth having the form of clothing the pieces remained with the poor woman who had brought the cloth for the miracle she carried them weeping home and she and her husband remained like the rest believing and unbelieving as before but at every chance she scanned the dishonored fragments in secret and pieced them together trying to follow the lines of imaginary garments in them  throughout the week the excitement raged silently for the most part in the breasts of the two parties but sometimes breaking out in furious affirmation and denial at such points of common meeting as the store the tavern and the postoffice there the unbelievers outnumbered the believers who met for mutual support and comfort at one anothers houses but appeared nowhere in force until the sunday night following then they came three to one of the enemy and filled the temple to overflowing dylks was expected to meet them from the concealment or the absence in which he had passed the days the unbelievers said that he was hiding in fear and shame the believers that he was preaching to the heathen in other neighborhoods and would come in power and glory with a great multitude of the converted following him but the meeting in the temple was opened by enraghty who in front of the pulpit rose saying the good old man will not be here tonight but i will fill his place a thrill of exultation and disappointment ran through the congregation according as they believed or denied but they all waited patiently  among the many families which had come in internecine enmity gillespie and his daughter strained in the unlove which was like hate up to the door of the temple he had taunted her with dylkss failure to work the miracle and with his absence during the week if i could get my hands on him i would pull him out of his hole and make him face the people hes deceived i would show him whether he was god or not  if you touched him your hands would be withered she said in an ecstasy of faith if you will bring me a single hair of his head i will deny him  ill remember that he threatened bitterly and in the loss of all the dignity of their relation as parent and child he cast a look of contemptuous triumph on her when enraghty rose and said that he would take the place of dylks for the night  bring me one hair of his head she said again  the people of both sides had supposed that dylks was sitting behind the pulpit as his habit was with his head out of sight bowed in meditation but when enraghty after a few words sat down to await the coming of the spirit suddenly the minister whose turn to preach would have come that night sprang to his full height in the pulpit and denounced enraghtys pretense the believers rose shouting to their feet and crying he is my god stormed out of the temple in the night where their voices were heard repeating he is my god till they swelled together in the hymn which was their confession of dylks a few of the unbelievers remained in the temple amazed but the greater part followed the believers into the night  they had the courage of their triumph through dylkss failure to work the miracle he had promised and then his failure to show himself in the temple but they pushed on with no definite purpose except perhaps to break up some meeting of his followers when one of the hounds yelping and baying in acceptance of their nickname broke upon them from the woods they were passing with word that they had found dylks in enraghtys house where the believers were already gathering  weve treed him he said the whole packs round the place and theres no limb in reach for him to jump to i reckon itll be the best coon hunt weve ever had in leatherwood yit  redfield put himself in touch rather than in sight amidst the darkness which the disembodied voices broke upon enraghtys house then weve got him come on  the women of the unbelievers had fallen behind and finally gone home but all the believers the women as well as the men had followed their apostle and now their voices in praying and singing came from the house still hidden by a strip of woodland in the bewilderment which had fallen upon david gillespie amid the tumultuous rush from the temple he had been parted from his daughter now he fumbled forward on the feet of an old man and found himself beside redfield i want you to let me at him first jim i just want one hair of his head  why dont you know its death to touch him redfield jeered  i know that gillespie assented in the same mood but ill risk dying for that one hair  what do you want with one hair ill get you a handful redfield said  onell do to work the miracle im after  what miracle none o your seamless raiment is it  its bringing a crazy girl to her senses shes said if i fetched her a single hair of his shed renounce him  oh redfield said with respectful understanding then he added ill get you the hair  the unbelievers crowded to the house in the light from the uncurtained windows one of them stood tiptoe peering in while the others waited its chuck full he reported no room for sinners i reckon  oh if dylks is in there hell work one of his miracles and make room another of the hounds answered redfield stood trying the door locked hammer on it break it in here give him a shoulder  the mob surged forward laughing and shouting and crushed redfield against the door the panel cracked and groaned redfield called to the crowd to hold back but suddenly the door opened and the fanatical face of enraghty showed itself above redfields back  what do you want he demanded this is the lords house  then its as much ourn as what it is yourn some one shouted back  we want to see the lord another called just one look just one lick  the old schoolmaster lost his selfcontrol there are some of you out there that ive licked before now for your mischief  yes we know that came back you didnt lick us enough wed like to have you give us some more  the hindmost of the hounds surged against those in front and the whole mob fell forward upon redfield he staggered over the threshold to save himself and struck enraghty backward in his helpless plunge  oh look out there the nearest of the mob called back yourre hurtin mr enraghty  well we dont want to hurt old saint paul a mocker returned but they pressed on wilfully helplessly they pushed those in front who might have held back and filled the entryway and the rooms beyond in a circle of his worshipers kneeling at his feet stood dylks while they hailed him as their god and entreated his mercy at the scramble behind them they sprang up and stood dazed confronting their enemies  we want dylks we want the good old man we want the lion of judah out of the way little flock came in many voices but when the worshipers yielded dylks had vanished  a moment of awe spread to their adversaries but in another moment the riot began again the unbelievers caught the spirit of the worse among them and stormed through the house searching it everywhere from the cellar to the garret a yell rose from them when they found dylks half way up the chimney of the kitchen his captors pulled him forward into the light and held him cowering under the cries of kill him tie him to a tree and whip him tar and feather him ride him on a rail  no dont hurt him redfield commanded take him to a justice of the peace and try him  yes the leader of the hounds assented take him to squire braile hell settle with him  the little flock rallied to the rescue and some of the herd joined them as an independent neutral abel reverdy whom his wife stirred to action caught up a stool and joined the defenders  why you fool a leader of the hounds derided him amiably what you want to do with that stool if the almighty cant help himself you think youre goin to help him  abel was daunted by the reasoning and even sally stayed her war cries  well i guess theres sumpin in that abel assented and he lowered his weapon  the incident distracted his captors and dylks broke from them and ran into the yard before the house he was covered with soot and dust and his clothes were torn his coat was stripped in tatters and his long hair hung loose over it  his prophecies of doom to those who should lay hands upon him had been falsified but to the literal sense of david gillespie he had not yet been sufficiently proved an impostor till he should bring his daughter a strand of the hair which dylks had proclaimed it death to touch she would believe in him and david followed in the crowd straining forward to reach redfield who with one of his friends had dylks under his protection the old man threw himself upon dylks and caught a thick strand of his hair dragging him backward by it redfield looked round he said you want that do you well i promised he tore it from the scalp and gave it into davids hand and david walked back with it into the house where his daughter remained with the wailing and sobbing womenworshipers of the desecrated idol  he flung the lock at her feet theres the hair that it was death to touch she did not speak she only looked at it with horror  dont you believe its his her father roared  yes yes i know its his and now lets go home and pray for him and for you father weve both got the same god now  a bitter retort came to the old mans lips but the abhorrent look of his daughter stayed his words and they went into the night together while the noise of the mob stormed back to them through the darkness farther and farther away    xiv   the captors of dylks chose the temple as the best place for keeping him till morning when they could take him for trial to matthew braile but they had probably no sense of the place where he had insolently triumphed so often as the fittest scene of his humiliation they stumbled in a loose mob behind and before and beside him through the dim night and tried to pass redfields guard to strike him with their hands or the sticks which they tore from the wayside bushes at a little distance a straggling troop of the believers followed men and women wailing and sobbing and adoring and comforting their idol with promises of fealty in terms of pathetic grotesqueness a wellknown voice called to him dont you be afraid god almighty they cant hurt a hair of your head and the burst of savage mirth which followed sally reverdys words drowned the retort of a scoffer why there aint hardly any left to hurt sally  the noise of the talking and laughing and the formless progress of the mob hushed the nearer night voices of the fields and woods but from a distance the shuddering cry of a screechowl could be heard and the melancholy call of a killdee in a pasture beside the creek the people friends and foes together made their way unlighted except by the tin lantern which some one had caught from where it stood on enraghtys gatepost  with this one of the unbelievers took his stand at the door of the temple after redfield had passed in with his prisoner and lifted it successively to the faces of those trying to enter he allowed some and refused others according as they were of those who denied or confessed dylks and a hound at his elbow explained dont want any but goats in here tonight  the common parlance was saturated with scriptural phrase and the gross mockery would have been taken seriously if the speaker had not been so notoriously irreverent as it was the words won him applause which redfield and his friends were not able to quell the joke was caught up and tossed back and forth the little flock outside raised their hymn the scoffers within joined in derision and carried the hymn through to the end  dylks sat shrunken on the bench below the pulpit his head fallen forward and his face hidden redfield and one of his friends sat on either side and others tried to save him from those who from time to time pushed forward to strike him they could not save him from the insults which broke again and again upon the silence when redfield rose and appealed to the people to leave the man to the law they came back at him with shrieks and yells  did the law keep my family from bein broke up by this devil my wife left me and my own brother wont speak to me because i wouldnt say he was my savior and my god  im an old woman and i lived with my son but my son has quit me to starve for all he cares because i believe in the god of jacob and he believes in this snorting twolegged horse  my sister wont live with me because i wont fall down and worship her golden calf  hes spread death and destruction in my family my daughters wont look at me and my two sons fought till they were all blood about him  the accusings and upbraidings thickened upon him but dylks sat silent except for a low groan of what might have seemed remorse he put his hand to the place on his head where the hair had been torn away and looked at the blood on his fingers  a woman stole under the guard of his keepers and struck him a savage blow on the cheeks first one and then the other now you can see how it feels to have your own husband slap you because you wont say you believe in such a god as you are you heathen pest  the guards struggled with her and a man stooped over dylks and voided a mouthful of tobacco juice in his face another lashed him on the head with a switch of leatherwood all in a squalid travesty of the supreme tragedy of the race as if a consciousness of the semblance touched the gospelread actors in the drama they shrank in turn from what they had done and lost themselves in the crowd  the night wore away and when the red sunrise began to pierce the dusk of the temple where some had fallen asleep and others drowsed as they walked to and fro to keep themselves awake redfield conferred with his lieutenants then they pulled their captive to his feet not roughly and moved with him down the aisle and out of the door they left some of the slumberers still sleeping of the others not all followed them on their way to matthew brailes up through the woods and past the cornfields and tobacco patches but with those of the little flock who had hung nightlong about the temple singing and praying to their idol they arrived some before and some after the prisoner at the log cabin of the magistrate he was sitting after his habit in his splintbottomed chair tilted against the porch wall waiting for the breakfast which his wife was getting within as the crowd straggled up to the porch he tilted his chair down and came forward with a frown of puzzle whats this he demanded then catching sight of a womans eager face among the foremost his frown relaxed and he said dont all speak at once sally  deed and deed im not agoun to speak at all squire braile but if you want to know you can see for yourself that theyve got the good old man here and from the tell ive hearn they want you to try him theyve been hittun him over the face and head all night she looked defiantly round on the unbelievers who so far joined in the squires grin as to burst into a general laugh and a cry of good for you sally youre about right  illustration now you can see how it feels to have your own husband slap you  braile referred himself to redfield who mounted to the porch with the other guards and the tattered and bedraggled dylks in their midst what are you doing with this man jim  weve brought him to you to find out squire braile you know who he is and all the mischief hes been making in this settlement we dont need to go into that  wish youd step in there the squire said nodding toward the room opposite the kitchen and bring me out the laws of ohio you know where it is  his recognition of redfield as a lawstudent pleased the herd of the lost and one of the guards said all right jim well hold him  as redfield disappeared within the squire called after him bring out my table too will you well have the trial here  thats all right as fer as it goes squire one of the crowd before the cabin called out but there aint room enough for us up there  well the squire answered youve got the whole state of ohio down there i reckon you can find room in it if you stand close  he turned the joke on the crowd which acquiesced with cheers when redfield returned with the large book and the small table he had been sent for the squire drew up to them and proclaimed silence in the court then who complains against this man you james redfield  i arrested him but i dont complain of him more than the rest you know what hes been doing in leatherwood as well as other places for the last month or six weeks we want his mischief stopped we want to see what the law can do about it we could have lynched him but that aint the right way and so we all feel  well weve got to make a start somewhere the justice returned whats he accused of what do you accuse him of  well for one thing redfield said rather reluctantly he professes to be almighty god  and he is god the most high jehovah maker of heaven and earth came in a varying cry from the believers who had gathered increasingly on the skirts of their enemies  their voices seemed to put life and courage into the prisoner who for the first time lifted his fallen face and looked at the justice with a light of hope in his dulled eyes  you hear that the old squire addressed him is that your name are you god  thou sayest the prisoner answered with a sudden effrontery  that will do the old man shouted he might have been willing to burlesque the case from his own disbelief but he could not suffer the desecration of the hallowed words and dylks shrank from his eyes of fierce rebuke stand away from him he added to the guards now then have you folks got any other charge against him has he stolen anything like a mule for instance has he robbed a henroost has he assaulted anybody or set a tobaccoshed on fire some one must make a charge i dont much care what it is  the old man scowled round on the people nearest him and down on the crowd below the believers waited in anxious silence the unbelievers applauded his humor with friendly laughter and a kindlier spirit spread through them they were beginning to see dylks as a joke  redfieldthe squire turned to the young manlets have a look at the laws of ohio in such case made and provided he opened the book which redfield put on the table before him and went carefully through the index then he closed it there dont seem he said to be any charge against the prisoner except claiming to be the almighty he pleads guilty to that and he could be fined and imprisoned if there was any law against a mans being god but there isnt unless its some law of the bible which isnt in force through reenactment in ohio he hasnt offended against any of our statutes neither he nor his followers in this state every man has a right to worship what god he pleases under his own vine and figtree none daring to molest him or make him afraid with religious fanaticism our laws have nothing to do unless it be pushed so far as to violate some public ordinance this i find the prisoner has not done therefore he stands acquitted  a roar of protest a shout of joy went up from the crowd according to their belief and unbelief after his first plea dylks had remained silent in becoming meekness and selfrespect now he looked wildly round in fear and hope but he did not speak  clear the way you the squire called to the people about him and below him and he got slowly to his feet he took the arm of the prisoner at one side and said here jim redfield you take this fellows other arm and as the young man helplessly obeyed now he commanded and with dylks between them they left the porch and passed through the severing crowd of friends and foes before the cabin while they hesitated in doubt of his purpose braile led the way with the prisoner acquitted but still in custody toward the turnpike road where the country lane passing the cabin joined it a little way off  the crowd straggled after in patient doubt but when the squire halted with his captive and bade redfield move back the suspicions of the unbelievers began to stir  now put the squire said in a low voice and loosed his hold dylks lifted his head alertly as he was accustomed to do when he gave his equine snort but now he made no sound he leaped forward and ran with vast bounds up the smooth turnpike toward the wall of woodland where the whiteness of the highway ceased in the shadow of the trees he far outdistanced the foremost of his pursuers who stopped to gather the broken stone heaped along the roadside and under the rain of these and the storm of curses that they sent after him he escaped into the forest  well abel the squire said to reverdy whom he found not unexpectedly at his elbow when he looked round he may not be much of a god but hes a good deal of a racehorse even if he didnt give his snort  look here squire braile redfield broke out in the first realization of his defeat im not sure your decision was just right  well you can appeal the case to the supreme court jim the old man returned its my breakfast time and he stamped stiffly away down the pike and up the road to his cabin followed by the blessings of the little flock  the little flock had remained in stupefaction at the junction of the country road and the turnpike helplessly watching the flight of their idol from the herd of the lost when dylks vanished in the dusk of the forest and the last of those who had followed him came lagging breathless back and dropped from their hands the broken stone which they had unconsciously brought with them the little flock involuntarily raised their hymn as if it had been a song of triumph an inglorious triumph but an omen of final victory and of the descent of the new jerusalem in leatherwood  never mind one of the herd panted well have him out of that gulf of dark despair yit  the lord will put forth his might one of the flock defied him but if you fellows want to feel the arm of flesh here and now come on  the squire put himself between the forces i want you to keep the peace i command the peace he said with magisterial dignity  oh all right squire a hound applauded him we know youre on our side  brother braile is on the side of righteousness the champion of the flock answered  the squire turned a frowning face upon him if the law could have held your god hed have been on his way to the county jail by this time now you fellows both sides go home and look after your corn and tobacco and you women you go and get breakfast for them and wash up your children and leave the kingdom of heaven alone for a while  the weight of condemnation was for the little flock but there remained discomfort for the herd of the lost and you the squire turned to them you let these folks worship any stock or stone theyre a mind to and you find out the true god if you can and stick to him and dont bother the idolaters i reckon he can take care of himself i command you all to disperse go home get out put  the saints and the sinners felt alike the mystical force of the law in his words and began to move away not without threats and defiances more or less straggling and not altogether ceasing even after they had lost sight of one another in their parting ways  redfield stayed to walk home with the old man of course squire braile he said this aint the last of dylks and it aint the last of us its a sin and a shame to have the thing going on among us you know that as well as i do its got to be stopped if hed got his just dues from you  you young fool the squire retorted kindly havent you gone far enough yet in your blackstone to know that justice is one thing and law is another i gave dylks his legal deserts  blackstone says the law is the perfection of reason  well you think it dont seem to be so in the state of ohio but i reckon it is and so long as we look after our own souls we cant do better than let others look after theirs in their own way come in and have some breakfast he paused before his cabin with the young man  no not this morning squire braile redfield lingered a moment and then he said askingly i didnt see old mr gillespie anywhere this morning  i didnt notice where it comes to a division in public he doesnt usually take sides against his daughter  he wont have to after this  what do you mean  didnt you know she told him once that if he would bring her a hair of dylkss head she would deny him i helped him to a whole lock of it  oh you did that there was condemnation in the squires tone and as if he had been going to express a more explicit displeasure he hesitated then he said well i must be going in and turned his back upon redfield who turned again into the turnpike road and took his way homeward past the long and deep stretch of woods where dylks had found refuge    xv   in the middle of the forest there was a dense thicket of lower growths on a piece of dry land lifted above the waters of a swamp the place was the lair of such small wild things as still survived in the wilderness once the haunt of the wolf and the wild cat and the resort of the bear allured by the profusion of the huckleberries which grew there but except in the early fall when the annual squirrelhunt swept over the whole country side and the summer drought had made the swamp easily passable to the gunners the place was unmolested even the country boy who seeks the bounty of nature wherever she offers it and makes the outlying property of man his prey where nature has been dispossessed did not penetrate the thicket in his search for hazelnuts or chinquapins it was proofed against his venture by its repute of rattlesnakes and copperheads and the rumor of ghosts and witches few of men or boys knew the approach to the interior by the narrow ridge of dry land lifted above the marsh and dylks did not stop in his flight till he reached the thicket and saw in it his hope of securer refuge he walked round it through the pools which the frog and turtle haunted twice before he found this path overhung by a tangle of grapevines there his foot by the instinct which the foot has where the eye fails of a path divined the scarcely trodden way and he found himself in a central opening among the thickly growing bushes it was warm there without the close heat of the woodland and dry except for the spring of clear water that bubbled up in the heart of it and trickled out over green mosses into the outer waters of the swamp  the man stooped over and drank his fill and then made his greedy breakfast on the berries that grew abundantly round and nodded hospitably to his hand all the time he wept and moaned to himself in the selfpity of a hunted fearful wretch then he drank again from the spring and without rising from his knees pushed himself back a little from it and fell over in an instant sleep  he slept through the whole day and at night falling early in the shadows of the forest which thickened over his retreat he supped as he had breakfasted on the wild berries and spring water but with protesting from a stomach habitually flattered by the luxury of fried chicken and ham and cornpone and shortened biscuit and hot coffee which his adorers put before him when he laid aside his divinity and descended to the gratification of his carnal greed he was a gross feeder and in the midst of his fear and the joy of his escape he thought of these things and lusted for them with a sort of thankless resentment  he looked about for something he might kill and he found a wounded pigeon which had fluttered into his refuge from the shot of some gunner but he could not bring himself to eat it raw and if he could have kindled a fire to cook it he reflected it would have betrayed him to his pursuers who must now be searching the woods for him he wrung the pigeons neck and flung it into the bushes and then fell down and wept with his face in the grass he had slept so long that now he could not sleep and when his tears would come no more he sat up and watched the night through till the dawn grayed the blueblack sky the noises of the noiseless woods made themselves heard the cry of a night hawk the hooting of an owl the whirring note of the whippoorwill the long plunging downrush of a dead branch breaking the boughs below it even the snapping of twigs as if under the pressure of stealthy feet these sounds the most delicate of the sounds he heard shook him most with fear and hope and then with despair the feet could be the feet of his enemies seeking him out or of his friends coming to succor and save him then they resolved themselves into the light pressure from little paws the paws of the wildcat or the coon and there was nothing to be feared or hoped from them the constellations wheeled over him in the clear sky and the planets blazed he made out the north star from the lower lines of the dipper the glowing and fading of the august meteors that flitted across the heavens seemed to leave a black trace on his straining eyes texts of scripture declaring how the splendors of the day and night showed forth the glory of the being whose name he had usurped to the deceit and shame of those who trusted him glowed and faded in his mind like those shooting stars in the sky at one time he thought he had cried aloud for destruction in the sin which could not be forgiven but it was only a dull inarticulate moan bursting from his tortured breast  the place where the hair had been torn from his head burned like fire it burned like the wound of a man whom he had once heard tell how it felt to be scalped by an indian the man had recovered but the wound had always hurt and dylks pitied himself that it should be so with him and cursed himself for his unguarded boast that any one who touched a hair of his head should perish he promised that if god would show him a little mercy and send a raven with something for him to eat something warm or send him a cup of coffee somehow or even a raw egg he would go forth before the people he would get up in the temple amidst his believers and declare himself a false prophet and a false god he would not care what they did to him if only he had something cooked to eat something hot to drink  towards morning he slept and then for days and nights how many he did not know it seemed to him that he did not wake but dreamed through a changing time when he was dimly aware of contending voices voices of his believers the little flock and voices of his unbelievers the herd of the lost pleading and threatening in the forest round his place of refuge his followers were trying to bring him food and raiment and his enemies were preventing them and boasting that they would keep guard over his refuge till they starved him out then all again was a blur a texture of conscious and unconscious misery till a night came when the woof broke and trailed away from him and he lifted himself on his elbow and after he had drunk a long draft from the spring found tremulous strength to get to his feet he tried some steps in the open space where the light of the full moon fell and found that he could walk he reached the tangled entrance to his covert and stealthily put the vines aside he peered out into the shadows striped with moonshine and could see no one and he was going to venture farther when he stopped stone still at the figure of a man crouched in the middle of the causeway the mans head was fallen forward and his gun lay across his lap he must be one of the guards that his enemies had set on his refuge to keep him there and starve him out and he must be asleep dylks stooped and peered into his face and knew the man for one of the hounds who had often disturbed his meetings and now he looked about in the rage that surged up through his penitence and selfpity for a stone or a club to strike him senseless or dead if need be but there was no such weapon that he could see and the risk of a struggle was greater than the risk of trying to pass the man without waking him after long doubt he tried with one foot and then another and the man did not wake then he crept slowly by and then with softly dragging steps he got farther from the sleeper and pushed on through the woods in the direction of the turnpike as he imagined it but he came out in a clearing where a new log cabin showed clear in the open under the moon  in the single room of the house a woman lay sleeping with a little child in its cradle beside her bed she rose up and put out her hand instinctively to still the child but it was sleeping quietly and then she started up awake and listened for the voice which she had dreamt was calling her there was no voice and then there was a voice calling hoarsely weakly nancy nancy  in her dream she had thought it was the voice of her husband stealing back to her in the night and it was in the terror of her dream that she now sprang from her bed with her heart aching for pity of him to forbid him and rebuke him for breaking his promise and to scold him away but as she stood listening and the voice came again she knew it was not the voice of laban she ran to the ladder which led to the cabin loft and called up through the open trapdoor jane jane come down here to the baby will you ive got to leave her a minute  what for the girl answered sleepily then oh ill come she aint sick is she aunt nancy oh i do hope she aint sick  no she aint sick nancy said as she put her hands up to help the girl place her feet aright on the rungs of the ladder butlisten she whispered as the voice outside called again its that miserble wretch its joseph dylks ive got to go to him dont you say a word jane gillespie hes joeys father and he must be at deaths door or he wouldnt come to mine  she left the girl standing dazed and ran out and round the cabin in the shadow that it cast in the moon dylks crouched close in the angle made by the chimney  oh nancy he implored her do give me something to eat something warm coffee if youve got it ive been sick and im starving  she knew without seeing it in the shadow how he was stretching out pleading hands to her and she had mercy upon him but she said stonily wait a minute dont be a crybaby and ran back to the door and called to the girl within rake open the fire jane and set the kittle on then she ran back to dylks and stood over him where you been dont you know theyll kill you if they ketch you  yes i know it nancy but i knew this would be the last place they would come for me will the coffee be ready soon oh im so faint i reckon im going to die nancy  i reckon you aint goin to die before you get your coffee itll be ready as soon as the kittle boils  she stood looking grimly down at him while he brokenly told so far as he knew it the story of the days he had passed in hiding  i reckon she said with bitter scorn that i could have fetched you out id a brought you some hot coffee to the door of your den and youd a come when you smelt it  yes thats true he owned in meek acceptance of her scorn  the child cried and she went in but she had no need to comfort it except with a word jane had come to the little one and was stooping above it and cooing to it motherwise and cuddling it to her body while it drowsed away to silence  you mind her jane the mother said and she lifted the pot of coffee from the bed of coals sending a dim glow into the room to meet the dawn at the open door she put some sugar into the bowl she got from its shelf and covered it with a piece of cold cornpone and then went out to dylks who had remained on his knees and now stretched out his trembling hands toward her  she did not speak but poured the bowl full of the steaming coffee and watched him while he gulped half of it down then he reached eagerly for the bread is it hot he asked  no it aint the woman said you can eat cold pone i reckon cant you  oh yes oh yes and glad to get it only i thought he stopped and washed down the mouthful he had torn from the cake with a draft of the coffee which emptied the bowl she filled it mechanically from the pot in her hand and he drank again more slowly and devoured the pone as he drank  now he said i should be all right if it wasnt for my head where they tore out my hair it burns like fire  she bent over him and looked at the wound unflinchingly i cant see very good in this light if i only had some goosegreasebut i reckon hogs lard will do hold on till i can wash it  oh nancy he moaned gratefully  she was gone rather long and there was talk within and the cooing and babble of the child when she came out with a basin of warm water and some lard in a broken saucer in her hands and a towel caught under her arm he suggested i heard you talking with some one nancy  and i suppose it scared you she answered unsparingly well you may thank your stars it wasnt laban i do believe hed kill you meek as he is  dylks drew a quivering breath yes i reckon he would i suppose you must have told him about me  of course i did here hold still she had begun to wash his wound very gently though she spoke so roughly while he murmured with the pain and with the comfort of the pain if you want to know she continued its jane shes been with me ever since that night they caught you you made her ashamed before her father and between her shame and his pride her and him dont speak or haint since then she stays with me and joey stays with him  our joey he asked plaintively  my joey she returned and she involuntarily twitched at the hair she was smoothing  oh he cried from the pain but she did not mind his pain  there she said beginning to put on the lard then she bound over the wound the soft pledget of old linen she had brought and tied round his head a cotton rag to hold the dressing in place she said there again i reckon that will do  he moaned gratefully its the first time ive been out of pain for i dont know how many days and nights nancy he burst out in all recognition of her goodness i oughtnt to have left you  she had been kneeling before him in dressing his hurt and then in critically regarding her handiwork she got to her feet i know you oughtnt she retorted but im glad you done it and im thankful every breath i draw and now i want you to go and dont you think i done what i done out of love for you joseph dylks id a done it for any hurt or hungry dog  illustration she had begun to wash his wound very gently though she spoke so roughly while he murmured with the pain and with the comfort of the pain  dylks got to his feet too with little moans for the stiffness in his joints i know you would nancy he said humbly but all the same i wont forget it if there was anything i could do to show  theres something you could do besides drownin yourself in the creek which i dont ask you in the first place because i dont want your death on my hands and in the next place because youre the unfittinest man to die that i can think of but theres something else and you know it without my tellin you and that is to stop all this now and forever dont you pretend you dont know what i mean  i know what you mean nancy and the good lord knows i would be glad enough to do it if i could but i wouldnt know how to begin  begin she said with a scornful glance at the long tangle of his hair begin by cuttin off that horses tail of yours and then stop snortin like a horse  he shook his head hopelessly it wouldnt do nancy they wouldnt let me draw back now they would kill me  they  thethelittle flock he answered shamefacedly  the herd of the lost will kill you if you dont she said it not in mocking but in realization of the hopeless case and not without pity but at his next words she hardened her heart again  i dont know what to do i dont know where to go i have nowhere to lay my head  dont you use them holy words you wicked wretch and if youre hintin at hidin in my house you cant do itnot with jane hereshe would kill you i believeand not without her  no nancy i can see that but where can i go even that place in the woods theyre watching that and they would have me if i tried to go back  from an impulse as of indifference rather than consideration she said go to squire braile he let you off let him take care of you  nancy he exclaimed i thought of that  she gathered up the basin and the towel she brought and without looking at him again she said well go then and turned and left him where he stood    xvi   matthew braile was sitting in his wonted place with his chair tilted against his porch wall smoking dylks faltered a moment at the bars of the lane from the field of tall corn where he had been finding his way unseen from nancys cabin he lowered two of the middle bars and when he had put them up on the other side he stood looking toward the old man his long hair hung tangled on his shoulders the white bandage which nancy had bound about his head crossed it diagonally above one eye and gave this the effect of a knowing wink which his drawn face unshaven for a week seemed to deprecate  braile stared hard at him then he tilted his chair down and came to the edge of his porch and called in cruel mockery why god is that you  dont squire braile dylks implored in a hoarse undertone theyre after me and if anybody heard you  well come up here the squire bade him dylks hobbled slowly forward and painfully mounted the log steps to the porch where braile surveyed him in detail frowning and twitching his long feathery eyebrows  i know i dont look fit to be seen dylks began but  well the squire allowed after further pause you dont look as if you had just come down from the shining courts above in joyful haste had any breakfast  nancynancy billingsgave me some coffee and some cold pone  well you can have some hot pone pretty soon laban there  no hes away at work still but squire braile  oh i understand i know all about nancy and her first husband and how he left her and she thought he was dead and married a good man and when that worthless devil came back she thought she was living in sin with that good manin sinand drove him away but shes as white as any of the saints you lie about it was like you to go to her the first one in your trouble well what did she say she said dylks stopped his mouth too dry to speak he wetted his lips and whisperedshe said to come to you that you would know what it was best for me to do to he stopped again and asked do you suppose any one will see me here  oh like as not its getting time for honest folks to be up and going to work but i dont want any trouble about you this morning i had enough that other morning come in here he set open the door of one of the rooms giving on the porch and at dylkss fearful glance he laughed not altogether unkindly mis brailes in the kitchen getting breakfast for you though she dont know it yet now then he commanded when he sat down within and pushed a chair to dylks tell me all about it since i saw you going up the pike  in the broken story which dylks told braile had the air of mentally checking off the successive facts and he permitted the man a measure of selfpity though he caught him up at the close well youve got a part of what you deserve but as usually happens with us rascals youve got too much at the same time and what did nancy advise  she told me to come to you  what did nancy advise the squire repeated savagely  she advised me to stop all thishe waved his hands outward and the squire nodded intelligentlyto tell them it wasnt true and i was sorry and to go away  he stopped and braile demanded well and are you going to do it  i want to do it andi cant  you cant whats to hinder you  im afraid to do it  afraid  they would kill me if i did  they who the herd of the lost  the little flock  the men were both silent and then after a long breath the squire said i begin to see  no no you dont begin to see squire braile dylks burst out sobbing and uttering what he said between his sobs nobody can understand it that hasnt been through it how you are tempted on step by step all so easy till you cant go back you cant stop youre tempted by whats the best thing in you by the hunger and thirst to know whats going to be after you die to get near to the god that youve always heard about and read about near him in the flesh and see him and hear him and touch him thats what does it with them and thats what does it in you its something a kind of longing thats always been in the world and you know its in others because you know its in you in your own heart your own soul when you begin to try for it to give out that youre a prophet an apostle you dont have to argue to persuade anybody or convince anybody theyre only too glad to believe what you say from the first word and if you tell them youre christ didnt he always say he would come back and how do they know but what its now and you  yes yes the squire said go on  when i said i was god they hadnt a doubt about it but it was then that the trouble began  the trouble  i had to make some of them saints i had to make enraghty saint paul and i had to make hingston saint peter you think i had to lie to them to deceive them to bewitch them i didnt have to do anything of the kind they did the lying and deceiving and bewitching themselves and when they done it they and all the rest of the believers they had me fast faster than i had them  i could imagine the schoolmaster hanging on to his share of the glory tooth and nail the squire said with a grim laugh but old hingston good old soul he ought to have let go if you wanted him to  oh you dont know half of it dylks said with a fresh burst of sobbing the worst of it is and the dreadfulest is that you begin to believe it yourself  whats that the squire demanded sharply  their faith puts faith into you if they believe what you say you say to yourself that there must be some truth in it if you keep telling them youre jesus christ theres nothing to prove you aint and if you tell them youre god who ever saw god and who can deny it you cant deny it yourself  hold on the old man said he had risen and he began to walk up and down swaying his figure and tilting his head from side to side and frowning his shaggy eyebrows together in a tangled hedge suddenly he stopped before dylks why you poor devil youre not in any unusual fix it must have been so with all the impostors in the world from mahomet up and down why there isnt a false prophet in the old testament that couldnt match experiences with you thats the way its always gone first the liar tells his lie and some of the fools believe it and proselyte the other fools and when there are enough of them their faith begins to work on the liars own unbelief till he takes his lie for the truth was that the way you miserable skunk  it was exactly the way squire braile and you cant tell how it gains on you step by step you see all those educated people like mr enraghty and all those good men like mr hingston taking it for gospel and you cant deny it yourself they convince you of it  exactly and then when the little flock gathers in all the mentally lame halt and blind in the settlement you couldnt get out of it if you had the whole herd of the lost to back you with the hounds yelping round to keep your courage up youve got to stay just where you put yourself heigh  there wouldnt dylks said drying his eyes on a tatter of his coat sleeve be so much trouble if it wasnt for the miracles  yes braile replied to the thoughtful mood which he had fallen into rather than to dylks the ignorant are sure to want a sign though the wise could get along without it and you have to promise them a sign you have to be fool enough to do that though you know well enough you cant work the miracle  you aint sure you cant you think maybe  then why the squire shouted at him why in the devils name didnt you work the miracle at hingstons mill that night why didnt you turn that poor fool womans bolt of linseywoolsey into seamless raiment  dylks did not answer  why didnt you do it heigh  i thought maybei didnt know but i did do it  what do you mean  when i came up outside and told them that the miracle had been worked and the seamless raiment was inside the bolt i thought it must be there  why in the name of  i had prayed so hard for help to do it that i thought it must be  you prayed to whom  togod  to yourself  dylks was silent again in the silence of a selfconvicted criminal he did not move  braile had been walking up and down again in his excitement in his enjoyment of the psychological predicament and again he stopped before dylks why you poor bag of shorts he said i could almost feel sorry for you in spite of the mischief youve made why you oughtnt to be sent to the penitentiary or even lynched you ought to be put amongst the county idiots in the poorhouse and  there came a soft plapping as of bare feet on the puncheon floor of the porch hesitating about and then pausing at the door of the opposite room then there came with the increased smell of cooking the talking of women presently the talking stopped and the plapping of the bare feet approached the door of the room shutting the two men in the squire set it slightly ajar in spite of dylkss involuntary oh dont and faced some one close to the opening  that you sally you havent come to borrow anything at this hour of the night  well i reckon if you was up as early as mis braile youd know it was broad day no i haint come to borry anything exactly but i was just tellin her that if shed lend me a fryun of bacon id do as much for her some day she ast me to tell you your breakfast was ready and not to wait till your compny was gone but bring anybody you got with you  sally peered curiously in at the opening of the door and braile abruptly set it wide perhaps youd like to see who it is  sally started back at sight of the figure within when she could get her breath she gasped well for mercys sakes if it aint the good old man himself but she made no motion of revering or any offer of saluting her late deity  well now if youve got some bacon for abels breakfast you better stop and have yours with us the squire suggested  no i reckon not sally answered i aint exactly sure abel would like it he aint ever been one of the flock although at the same time he aint ever been one of the herd just betwixt and between like as she spoke she edged away backward well i must be goun squire much obleeged to you all the same  the squire followed her backward steps with his voice if you should happen to see jim redfield on his way to his tobacco patch i wish youd tell him to come here id like to see him  he went in again to dylks  what are you going to do with me squire braile he entreated youre not going to give me up  i know my duty to my maker the old man answered ill take care of you jehovah dylks but now you better come in to breakfastget some hot pone ill bring you a basin of water to wash up in  he reopened the door in the face of sally reverdy who gasped out before she plapped over to the steps and dropped away i just seen jim redfield and i tole him you wanted him and he said he would be here in half an hour or as soon as he could see that the men had begun on his tubbacco i didnt tell him who you had here and i wont tell anybody else dont you be afraid  well thats a good girl sally abel couldnt have done better himself the squire called after her and then he turned to dylks come along now and get your hot pone jim redfield wont hurt you ill go bail for him and ill see that nobody else gets at you ive got a loft over this room where youll be safe from everything but a pet coon that your joey gave my little boy and i reckon the coon wont bite you i wouldnt in his place    xvii   redfield came rather later than he had promised excusing himself for his delay i was afraid the frost had caught my tobacco last night but it seems to be all right as far as i can see i stayed till the sun was well up before i decided  it was a pretty sharp night but i dont believe there was any frost the squire said at least dylks didnt complain of it  dylks redfield returned  yes didnt you know he was out again  no i didnt if i had that fellow by the scruff of the neck  the squire knew he meant the sleeping sentinel at the thicket where dylks had been hidden and not dylks but he said nothing and again redfield spoke  look here squire braile i think you did a bad piece of business letting that fellow go  i know you do jim but i expect youll think different when youve seen him  seen him you mean you know where he is  yes  well all ive got to say is that if i can lay hands on that fellow he wont give me the slip again  well suppose we try the squire said and he opened the door into the room where dylks was cowering and remarked with a sort of casualness as if the fact would perhaps interest them both heres one of the lost dylks i thought you might like to see him now sit down both of you and lets talk this thing over  he took a place on the side of the bed and the enemies each faltered to their chairs in mutual amaze  oh sit down sit down the squire insisted you might as well take it comfortably nobodys going to kill either of you  i dont want to do anybody any harm dylks began  youd better not redfield said between his set teeth his hands had knotted themselves into fists at his side  im all weak yet from the fever i had there with nothing but water and berries dylks resumed in his selfpity i did think some of my friends might have come  i took good care of that redfield said they did come at first with something to eat but they knew blame well wed have wrung their necks if wed a caught em we meant to starve you out thats what and we did it and if it hadnt been for that goodfornothing whelp sleeping over his gun you wouldnt have got out alive  well thats all right now jim and youd better forgive and forget both of you the squire interposed dylks has reformed he tells me hes sorry for having been a god and hes going to try to be a man or as much of a man as he can hes going to tell the little flock so and then hes going to get out of leatherwood right off  dylks cleared his throat to ask tremulously did i say that squire braile  yes you did my friend and whats more youre going to keep your word painful as it may be to you ill let you manage it your own way but some way youre going to do it and in the meantime im going to put you under the protection of jim redfield here  my protection redfield protested  yes ive sworn you in as special constable or i will have as soon as i can make out the oath and have you sign it and dylks will get out of the county as soon as he canhe tells me it wont be so easy as we would think and when he does it will be much more to the purpose than riding on a rail in a coat of tar and feathers why he broke off with a stare at dylks as if he saw his raggedness for the first time youll want a coat of some kind to show yourself to the little flock in the herd of the lost wont mind they dont want to be so proud of you i must look up something for you or perhaps send to brother hingston hes about your size but that dont matter now what i want is your promise jim redfield and i know youll do what you say that you wont tell anybody that the supreme being is hiding in my loft here till i say so and when i do that youll see no harm comes to him from mortalsfrom hounds and such like or even the herd of the lost do you promise  redfield hesitated if hell leave the county yes  and you jehovah jove or lord  i will as quick as i can squire braile i will indeed  the squire rose from the edge of the bed then this court stands adjourned he said formally  redfield went out with him leaving dylks trembling behind he said i aint sure you aint making a fool of me squire braile  well i am the squire retorted and dont you make one of yourself and then there wont be any  redfield still hesitated id just like to had another pull at that horsetail of his he said wistfully  well i knew old man gillespie hadnt quite the strength but i thought maybe hughey blake helped pull  hughey blake redfield returned scornfully had nothing to do with it  well anyway i hear its converted jane gillespie and she was worth it though it was rather too much like scalping a live indian  shes worth more than all the other girls in this settlement put together redfield said without comment on the phase of the act which had interested the squire and went down the cabin steps into the lane  braile turned back and opened the door of the room where dylks was lurking  better come out now he said not ungently and get into a safe place before folks begin to be about much or waitill put the ladder up first he brought the ladder from the kitchen where he exchanged a fleeting joke with his wife still at her work of clearing the breakfast things away and set it against the wall under the trapdoor of the loft now then he called and dylks came anxiously out  aint you afraid he began  no but you are and thatll do for both of us theres nobody round and if youll hurry nobodyll see you push the lid to one side and get in and youll be perfectly safe he said as dylks tremulously mounted the ladder i dont say youll be very comfortable theres a little window at one end but it dont give much air and this august sun is apt to get a little warm on the clapboards and i dont suppose it smells very well in there but the coon cant help that its the way nature scented him she hadnt any sweet brier handy at the time and be careful not to step on him hes not very goodtempered but i reckon he wont bite you if you dont bite him  the kitchen door opened and mrs braile put her head out she saw the ladder and the two men then she came out into the porch well matthew braile i might have knowed from the sound of your voice that you was up to some mischief was you goin to send that poor man up into that hot loft well i can tell you youre not she went into the room they had left and they heard her stirring vigorously about beyond its closed door with a noise of rapid steps and hard and soft thumpings she came out again and said go in there now mr dylks and try to get some rest ive made up the bed for you and ill see that nobody disturbs you matthew braile you send and tell mr hingstonor go if you cant ketch anybody goin pastand tell him hes here and bring some decent clothes he aint fit to be seen  well he dont want to be the squire said in the attempt to brave her onset but i reckon youre right mother i should probably have thought of it myselfin time ill send sally or abel if they go pastand they nearly always door some of the hands from the tobacco patches or as you say i may go myself towards evening he wont want to be troubled before then    xviii   at the first meeting in the temple after the open return of dylks to his dispensation the little flock had apparently suffered no loss in number some of his followers had left him but his disciples had been busily preaching him during his abeyance and the defection of old converts was more than made up by the number of proselytes the room actually left by the flock was filled by the herd of the lost who occupied all the seats on one side of the temple with matthew braile and his wife in a foremost place the lower sort of them worsening into the hounds who filled the doorway and hung about the outside of the temple  the whole assembly was orderly those of the little flock who conducted the services had a quelled air which might have been imparted to them by the behavior of dylks he sat bowed and humble on the bench below the pulpit while enraghty preached above him it was rumored that at the housemeetings the worship of dylks had been renewed with the earlier ardor there had been genuflections and prostrations before him with prayers for pardon and hymns of praise especially from the proselytes dylks was said to have accepted their adoration with a certain passivity but to have done nothing to prevent it there was not the more scandalous groveling at his feet which had stirred up the community to his arrest there was as much decorum as could consist with the sacrilegious rites which were still practised with his apparent connivance  he now sat without apparent restiveness under the eyes of the two men who had the greatest right to exact the fulfilment of his promise to forbid this idolatry to end the infamy of its continuance and to go out from among the people whose instincts and conventions his presence outraged near redfield sat david gillespie with his eyes fixed on dylks in a stare of hungry hate and with him sat his daughter who testified by her removal from the little flock her renunciation of her faith in him redfield showed greater patience than gillespie and at times his eyes wandered to the face of the girl who did not seem to feel them on her but sat gazing at her forsaken idol in what might have seemed puzzle for him and wonder at herself others who had rejected him merely kept away but she came as if she would face down the shame of her faith in him before the eyes of her little world sometimes dylks involuntarily put his hand to the black silken cap which replaced the bandage nancy billings had tied over the place where the hair had been torn out when he did this the girl moved a little her face hardened and she stole a glance at redfield  the schoolmaster went on and on preaching dylks insistently but not with the former defiance he did not spare to speak of the cruel sufferings inflicted upon their savior and their god who had borne it with the meekness of the son and the mercy of the father the divine being who had come to sojourn among them at leatherwood in the flesh for the purposes of his inscrutable wisdom might have blasted his enemies with a touch a word but he had spared them he had borne insult and injury but in the last day he would do justice he the judge of all the earth till then let the little flock have patience let them have faith sustained by the daily hourly miracles which he had wrought among them since his return to their midst and rest secure in the strong arms which he folded about them  dylks sat motionless well mother matthew braile hoarsely whispered to his wife i reckon youd better have let me put him up with the coon the heat might have tried the mischief out of him he hasnt kept his word  no matthew he hasnt she whispered back and i think his lying to you so is almost the worst thing hes done the next time you may put him with the coon only the coons too good for him but i reckon jim redfield will look out for him  jimll have to let him alone we cant have any more mobbing and theres no law that can touch dylks in the state of ohio we settled that the first time  enraghty abruptly closed his discourse with a demand for prayer and addressed his supplication to the savior and the judge incarnate there among them the little flock sang the hymn which always opened and closed its devotions and at the end hingston who sat by dylks on the bench below the pulpit made a movement as if to rise but dylks put out his hand and stayed him he welcomed enraghty to the place which he left beside hingston and slowly with the step of one in a dream mounted the stairs of the pulpit amidst the silent amaze of the people he began without preamble in the blend of scriptural text and crude everyday parlance which he ordinarily used  ye have heard it said aforetime that the new jerusalem would come down here in leatherwood but i say unto you that all that has passed away that the words which were spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled many are called but few are chosen verily verily i said unto you that heaven and earth shall pass away but the words i speak now shall not pass away if the works which have been done in leatherwood had been done in tyre and sidon the new jerusalem would have come down in both places for they did not stone the prophets as the herd of the lost did in leatherwood  he means that morning when he took up the pike and the fellows chased him into the tall timber braile whispered to his wife but i cant tell what hes driving at  be still she said  many of the little flock groaned and cried aloud the herd of the lost except for one shrill note of bitter laughter were silent and only those who sat near perceived that it was jane gillespie who had laughed  redfield looked round at her unconscious of his look  i go a long way off dylks proceeded and some of my beloved even my little flock cannot follow me but though they cannot follow me even the lame halt and blind shall be with me in the spirit and shall behold the new jerusalem where i will bring it down  many of the little flock at this cried out where will it be lord where will the new jerusalem come down how shall we see it  with the eyes of faith even as ye have seen the miracles i have wrought among ye which were shown to babes and sucklings and were hidden from the wise of this world but now i go from you and my feet shall be upon the mountains and shall descend upon the other side and there i will bring down the new jerusalem and there ye shall be in the flesh or in the spirit to behold the wonder of it  some of the little flock cried out again oh dont leave us father take us all with you in the flesh we want to be taken up with you and then some of them entreated tell us about it tell us what it will be like  dylks lifted his eyes as if in the rapture of the vision its light shall eclipse the splendor of the sun the temples thereof and the residences of the faithful will be built of diamonds excelling the twinkling beauty of the stars its walls will be of solid gold and its gates silver the streets will be covered with green velvet richer in luster and fabric than mortal eye ever beheld the gardens thereof will be filled with all manner of pleasant fruits precious to the sight and pleasant to the taste the faithful shall ride in chariots of crimson drawn by jetblack horses that need no drivers and their joys shall go on increasing forever the air of the city shall be scented with the smell of shrubs and flowers and ten thousand different instruments all tuned to the songs of heaven shall fill the courts and the streets and the temples and the residences and the gardens with music like ear hath not heard swelling the soul of the saved with perpetual delight  sighs and groans of ecstasy went up from the flock at each of the studied pauses which dylks made in recounting the wonders of the heavenly city fancied one after another at the impulse of their expectation at the end they swarmed forward to the altar place and flung themselves on the ground and heaped the pulpit steps with their bodies take us with you lord they entreated take us all with you in the flesh dont leave us here to perish among the heathen and the ungodly when you go then some began to ask as if he had already consented but what shall we eat and what shall we drink and wherewithal shall we be clothed on that far journey  illustration they swarmed forward to the altarplace and flung themselves on the ground and heaped the pulpitsteps with their bodies  dylks leaned forward against the pulpit desk and showed a few coins drawn from the pocket of hingstons pantaloons which he was wearing these shall be enough for out of these three rusty old coppers i can make millions of gold and silver dollars  the frenzy mounted and the herd of the lost who began to tire of the sight left the temple redfield followed out behind matthew braile and his wife that settles it he said ill see to mr dylks in the morning  now i look at it differently hes going like he said he would and weve got to let him go in his own way and bring down the new jerusalem overthemountains or anywhere else he pleases so he dont bring it down in leatherwood  i say so too matthew hes keeping his word the best he can poor lying soul they wouldnt let him back out now  i dont want you to trouble him jim redfield till you have a warrant from me braile resumed braced by his wifes support and i want you to keep the hounds away and give dylks a fair start you know the law wont let you touch him now do you hear  i hear redfield said sullenly with the consent which braile read in his words but if theres any more such goings on as weve had here tonight i wont answer for the rest of his scalp  he hurried forward from the elderly couple and overtook the gillespies walking rapidly hughey blake had just fallen away from them and stood disconsolately looking after them  is that you james redfield david gillespie asked peering at him in the nights dimness this is the man that helped me to get you a lock of that scoundrels hair he said to his daughter  she answered nothing in acknowledgment of the introduction but redfield said coming round to her side and suiting his step to hers i would like to go home with you till my road passes yours  well she said if you aint ashamed to be seen with such a fool nobody can see you tonight she added bitterly including him in her selfscorn  you neednt imply that i like it to be in the dark i would like to walk with you in broad day past all the houses in leatherwood but i dont suppose youd let me she did not say anything and he added im going to ask you to the first chance still she did not say anything though her father had fallen behind and left the talk wholly to them    xix   nancy sat at her door in the warm september evening when the twilight was beginning to come earlier than in the august days and her boy rushed round the corner of the cabin in a boys habitual breathlessness from running  oh mother mother he called to her as if he were a great way off guess what he did not wait for her to guess the good old man is goin to leave leatherwood and go over the mountains with the little flock and he says hes goin to bring down the new jerusalem at philadelphy and all that wants to go up with him kin go mr hingstons goin with him and hes goin to let benny benny dont know whether he can get to go up in the new jerusalem or not but hes goin to coax his father the hardest kind  he stopped panting at his mothers knees where she sat on the cabin threshold nearly as high as he stood she put up her hand and pushed the wet hair from his forehead how you do sweat joey go round and wash your face at the bench maybe jane will give you a drink of the milk while its warm yet before she lets it down in the well shes just through milkin  the boy tore himself away with a shout of oh goody and his mother heard him at the well wait a minute jane mother said i could have a drink before you let it down and then she heard him between gulps recounting to the girls silence the rumors she had already heard from him he came running back with a white circle of milk round his lips mother he began have you ever been overthemountains  no ive never been anywhere but just here in the country and where you was born back where we moved from  well mother how old am i now  youre goin on twelve joey dear  yes thats what i thought benny aint ony ten and he aint as big for his age as what i am hes been to the circus though his father took him to it at wheeling that time when he went on the steamboat i wisht i could go to a circus  well maybe you kin when you grow up circuses aint everything  no the boy relucted benny says the new jerusalem will be a good deal like the circus thats the reason he coaxed his father to let him go is philadelphy as far as wheeling  a good deal further from what ive heard tell his mother said she smiled at his innocently sinuous approach to his desire  he broke out with it mother whats the reason i cant go with benny and mr hingston and the little flock theyd take good care of me and i wouldnt make mr hingston any trouble me n benny could sleep together and the good old man hes always been very pleasant to me patted my head oncet and ast me what my name was  did you tell him it was billings his mother asked uneasily  no just joseph and he said well that was his name too dont you think the good old man is good  were none of us as good as we ought to be joey no he aint a good man im afraid  my the boy said and then after a moment i dont want to go mother unless you want to let me go  his mother did not speak for a while and it seemed as if she were not going to speak at all so that the boy said with a little sigh of renunciation i didnt expect you would but id be as careful and even if the good old man aint so very good mr hingston is and he wouldnt let anything happen to me  the woman put her hand under the boys chin and looked into his eager eyes which had not ceased their pleading at last she said you can go joey  mother he jumped to his feet from his crouching at hers oh glory to god  hush joey you mustnt say things like that its like swearing dear  i know it is and i didnt mean to of course its right in meetin and it kind of slipped out when i wasnt thinkin but i wont say any bad things you neednt be afraid oh ill be as good but look ahere mother why cant you come too  and leave your little sister she smiled sadly  i didnt think of that but couldnt jane take care of her shes always carryin her around and uncle david could come here and live with them he wouldnt want to stay there without me or no one  it wouldnt do joey dear  no the boy assented  you can go and tell benny i said you might go if his father will have you  oh he will he said so bennys ast him and he said hed take good care of us both  im not afraid you know how to take care of yourself and joey  she stopped and the boy prompted her what mom  when i said the good old man wasnt a good man i didnt want to set you against him i want you to be good to him  yes mother the boy assented in a puzzle but if he aint good  he aint joey hes a wicked man sometimes i think hes the wickedest man in the world but i want you to watch out and if ever you can help him or do anything for him remember that i wanted you to do it a boy can often help a man  i will mother but i dont see the reason if hes so very wicked why  thats the very reason joey dear and go and tell benny now that i let you go anddont tell him what i said about the good old man  oh i woont i woont mom oh gloryoh i didnt mean to say it and i didnt really did i but im so glad and bennyll be too can i tell him now tonight  yes run along  he hesitated then he leaped into the air with a joyful yell and vanished round the corner of the cabin into the dusk  his mother did not leave her place on the threshold but sat with her face bowed in her hands by and by jane gillespie came to the door from within and then nancy lifted her head and made room for her to sit beside her she told her what had passed and jane said if i was a man i would well i know what i would do  she did not sit down but stood behind nancy and talked down over her shoulder yes nancy said thats what i used to say when i was a girl but now im glad i aint a man for i wouldnt know what to do  well i wouldnt a left a hair in his head id aid a half killed him oh when i think what a fool that man made of me  dont let jim redfield make a fool of you then  who said im letting him the girl demanded fiercely  nobody but dont  aunt nancy if it was anybody but you said such a thing but i know its because youre so set on hughey blake hughey blake she ended scornfully and went back into the cabin  nancy rose from her place with a sigh oh i spose youre right about my lettin joey go i dont know why i let him    xx   the meetings of the little flock had continued ever since the reappearance of dylks and in the earlier spirit but the spring was broken and since he had said that the new jerusalem would not come down at leatherwood many had lost not faith but hope few could have the hope of following him as far as faroff philadelphia and sharing the glories which he promised them there for a pioneer community the people were none of them poor some were accounted rich and among the richest were many followers of dylks but most of the flock were hardworking farmers who could not spare the time or the money for that long journey overthemountains even with the prospect of the heavenly city at the end yet certain of the poorest set their houses in order and mortgaged their lands and went with the richest when on a morning after the last great meeting in the temple the little flock assembled for parting some to go and some to stay  nancy did not come with her boy for the farewell they had kissed each other at the cabin door and then he had run lightheartedly away full of wild expectation to find benny hingston at the cross roads and then race with him to join the crowd before the temple where the little flock stood listening to the last words which the good old man should speak to them in leatherwood many wept dylks himself was crying the enemies of their faith did not molest them except for a yelp of derision now and then and a longdrawn howl from the hounds kept well back by the herd of the lost under the command of redfield he stood in the chief place among these and at his right hand matthew braile leaned on his stick  when the last prayer had been said and they who were going had kissed or shaken hands with those who were staying and friends and foes had both scattered braile said to the young man whom he now faced well thats the last of him  redfields jaw was still set from the effort of seeing the affair through in as much decency as he had been able to enforce it aint the last of them but i reckon now hes gone theyll behave themselves none of the saints that are left will make trouble  no with enraghty out of the way and that kind old fool hingston with his example of mistaken righteousness we can get along fairly enough with the old dispensation well abel he called to reverdy who was lounging about in the empty space which the crowd had left unwilling to leave the scene of so much excitement for the dull labors of the field you thought you wouldnt go to see the new jerusalem come down after all hows the good old man goin to work it without you  hes had to work things thout me for a good while now squire abel returned not with perfect satisfaction in the part assigned him by the irony of the squire ever sence that night at mr enraghtys i been putty much done with him a god that couldnt help hisself in a little trouble like that he aint no god for me  oh i remember but what about sally she didnt go with the little flock either  i reckon me n sally thinks putty much alike about the little flock abel said with as much hauteur as a man in his bare feet could command we haint either of us got any use for little flocks any more  well im glad of it but i thought she might have come to see them off  abel relented sally aint very well this mornin up all night with the toothache redfield had turned from them and abel now remarked i was wonderin whether i couldnt borry a little coffee from mis braile for breakfast i been so took up ith all these gouns on that i haint had no time to go to the store  why certainly the squire replied and youd better come and have breakfast with us on the way home i came down without mine so as to see the ancient of days off and make sure of his going  pshaw squire it dont seem quite right to have you usin them old bible sayuns so common like  well abel perhaps it isnt quite the thing but you must make allowance for my being in such high spirits i havent breathed so free in a coons age i would like to have stowed dylks for a little while in the loft with ours but mis braile wouldnt hear of it well weve seen the last of him i hope and now were hearing the last of him he halted abel in their walk at a rise in the ground where they caught the sound of the hymn which the little flock following dylks for a certain way were singing sounds weel at a distance as the scotchman said of the bagpipes and the farther the better i dont believe i should care if i never heard that tune again they reached brailes cabin and he said well now come in and have something to stay your stomach while youre waiting for sally to make the coffee youre going to borrow  no i reckon not squire abel loyally held out  well then come in and get the coffee anyhow  i reckon thats a good idea squire abel assented with a laugh for the joke at his cost as they mounted the steps braile stopped him at the sound of voices in the kitchen  a prevalent voice was the voice of sally well just one sup more mis braile you do make the best coffee i believe in my heart that its took my toothache all away aready and i suppose poor abelll be goun up home with some of that miserble stuff he gits at the store and expectun to find me there in bed yit i thought id jest slip down and borry a little o yourn to surprise him with but when i smelt it i jest couldnt hold out i dont suppose but what he stayed to see the little flock off anyway and you say squire braile went well i reckon he had to justice o the peace that way im thankful the good old mans gone for one and i dont never want to see hide or hair of him agin in leatherwood theres such a thing as gittun enough of a thing and ive got enough of strange gods for one while  murmurs of reply came from mrs braile at times but sally mainly kept the word  well and what do you think of nancy billuns lettun her joey go off with the little flock her talkun the way she always done about em of course hes safe with mr hingston and benny and theyll bring him back all right but dont you think shed be afeared that he might be took up in the new jerusalem when it riz agin  abel the squire said i dont like this we seem to be listening i dont believe sally will like our overhearing her and we ought to warn her its no use your stamping your bare feet for they wouldnt make any noise ill rap my stick on the floor he also called out hello the house and sally herself came to the kitchen door she burst into her large laugh well i declare to goodness if it aint abel and the squire well if this aint the best joke on me did you see dylks off squire braile and a good riddance to bad rubbage i say    xxi   hughey blake longhaired barefooted and freckled hung about the door of nancys cabin where she sat with her little girl playing in the weedy turf at her foot the late october weather was sometimes hot at noon but the evenings were cool and the evening air was sweet with the scent of the ripened corn and the faint odor of the fallen leaves the grasshoppers still hissed at moments the crickets within and without the cabin creaked plaintively  i just come hughey said to see if you thought she wouldnt go to the temple with me tonight the flock lets us have our turn reglar now and were goin to have thursday evenin meetin like we used to in a discouraging silence from nancy he went on im just on my way home now and ill git my shoes there and i dont expect to wear this hickory shirt and no coat  yes i know hughey but i dont believe itll be any use you can try but i dont believe it will i reckon youd find out that shes goin with jim redfield if anybody shes been off with him most the whole afternoon gatherin pawpawshe knows the best places i should think they could have got all the pawpaws in leatherwood by this time you know ive always liked you hughey and so has her father and youve played together ever since you was babies and youve always been her beau from childern up there aint a person in leatherwood that dont respect you and feel to think that any girl might be glad to get you but im afraid its just your cleverness and bein so gentle like  do you spose nancy the young man faltered disconsolately its had anything to do with my not gettin her that hair i could a done it as easy as jim redfield but to tear it right out of his head that way i couldnt it went agin my stommick  i dont believe its that hughey if you must know i believe its just jim redfield himself hes bewitched her and shes got to be bewitched by somebody if it aint one its another it was him then and its jim now  i see the young man assented sadly  she aint good enough for you thats the truth hughey though i say it her own kith and kin i cant make you understand i know but shes got to have somebody that she can feel the power of  id do anything for her nancy  thats just it she dont want that kind of lovin as you may call it i dont believe my brothers a very easy man to turn but jane has always done as she pleased with him hes been like clay in the hands of the potter with her many another girl would have been broken into bits before now but shes just as tough as so much hickory i dont say but what shes a good girl there aint a better in leatherwood or anywheres shes as true as a die and tender as anything in sickness andd lay down and die where she saw her duty andd work till she dropped if need be but no she aint one that wants softness in her friends well she wont git any too much of it in jim redfield theyre of a piece and she may find out that shes made a mistake after all  has sheshe haint promised to marry him yit  no i dont say that but ever since that night at the temple hes been round after her hes been here and hes been at her fathers and she cant go down to the corners for anything but what he comes home helpin her to bring it you seen yourself how he always gets her to come home from meetin  yes hughey assented forlornly im always too late at the door hes with her before a body can git the words out  well thats it i dont say she aint a good girl one of the very best but shes hard hard hard and i dont see whats ever to break her  the girls voice came from round the cabin calling honey honey honey and the little one started from her play at her mothers feet and ran toward the voice which jane now brought with her at the corner and chuckling and jugjugging birdlike for joy threw herself at janes knees  see what i brought you honey its good and ripe but it aint half as good as my honey honey honey she put the pawpaw into the childs hands and mumbled her with kisses of her eyes cheeks hair and neck oh i could eat you eat you  she must have seen the young fellow waiting for her notice but nancy had to say heres hughey jane before she spoke to him  oh hughey she said not unkindly but as if he did not matter  he stood awkward and nancy judged it best for all the reasons to add hughey wants you to go to the temple with him tonight and the young fellow smiled gratefully if not hopefully at her  the girl stiffened herself to her full height from the child she was stooping over she haughtily mounted the steps beside nancy and without other recognition of hughey in the matter she said ive got company and disappeared into the cabin  well hughey nancy pityingly questioned  no no nancy he replied with a manful struggle for manfulness ii its meant i reckon and slunk away from the girls brutality as if it were his own shame  nancy picked up her little one and followed indoors  dont you talk to me aunt nancy the girl cried at her what does he keep askin me for  he wont ask you any more jane the woman quietly returned  they joined in putting the little one to bed then without more words jane kissed the child and came back to kiss her again when she had got to the door aunt nancy i hate you she said as she went out and left the woman alone  ever since joey went away with the believers to see the new jerusalem come down in philadelphia jane had been sleeping at her fathers cabin in resentful duty to his years and solitude she got him his breakfast and left it for him before she went to take her own with nancy and she had his dinner and supper ready for his return from the field but she did not eat with him and he was abed before she came home at night  joey had been gone nearly a month and no word had come back from any of the little flock who went with dylks it was not the day of letters by mail if some of the pilgrims had sent messages by the wagoners returning from their trips over the mountains they had not reached the families left behind and no angelborne tidings came to testify of the wonder at philadelphia those left behind waited in patience rather than anxiety where life was often hard people did not borrow trouble and add that needless debt to their load of daily cares nancy said to others that she did not know what to think and others said the same to her and they got what comfort they could out of that  now she did not light the little raglamp which she and jane sometimes sat by with their belated sewing or darning if they had not kept the hearthfire burning she went to bed in the dark and slept with the workweariness which keeps the heartheavy from waking  she had work in her tobacco patch to do as well as in the house where jane helped her she would not let the girl help her get the logs and brush together on the clearing which laban had begun burning to enrich the soil for the planting of the next years crop with the ashes  she must have slept long hours when she heard the sound of a cry from the dark without  mother mother oh mother it came nearer and nearer till it beat with the sound of a fist on the cabin door in the piecing out of the instant dream which she started from she thought as that night when dylks called her that it must be laban he sometimes called her mother after the baby came and now she called back laban laban but the voice came again it aint father its me mother its joey  oh dear heart she joyfully lamented and flung herself from her bed and reeled still drunk with slumber and pulled up the latch and flung open the door and caught her boy to her breast  oh mother he said laughing and crying im so hungry  to be sure youre hungry child and ill have you your supper in half a minute as soon as i can rake the fire open lay down on mothers bed there and rest while im gettin ready for you the baby wont wake and i dont care if she does  i spose shes grown a good deal but i am tired the boy said stretching himself out me n benny run all the way as soon as we come in sight of the crick and him n mis hingston wanted me to stay all night but i wouldnt i wanted to see you so much mother  did mr hingston come back with you or dont tell me anything dont speak till youve had something to eat  i woont mother the boy promised and then he said but you ought to see philadelphy mother its twenty times as big as wheeling benny says and all red brick houses and white marble steps he was sitting up and talking now his mother flew about in the lank linseywoolsey dress she had thrown over her nightgown in some unrealized interval of her labors and had got the skillet of bacon hissing over the coals  and to think she bleated in selfreproach that ill have to give you rye coffee you know joey dear there haint very much cash about this house and the store wont take truck for coffee but with good cream in it the rye tastes most as good set up to the table now she bade him when she had put the rye coffee with the bacon and some warmedup pone on the leaf lifted from the wall  she let the boy silently glut himself till he glanced round between mouthfuls and said it all looks so funny and little in here after philadelphy  then she said but you dont say anything about the new jerusalem didnt it come down after all she smiled but sadly rather than gladly in her skepticism  no mother the boy answered solemnly then after a moment he said i got something to tell you mother but i dont know whether i hadnt better wait till morning  its most morning now joey i reckon if it aint already thats the twilight comin in at the door if you wouldnt rather get your sleep first  no i cant sleep till i tell you now its about the good old man  did hedid he go up she asked fearfully  no mother he didnt some of them say he was took up but mother i believe he was drownded    xxii   drownded the boys mother echoed what do you mean joey what makes you believe he was drownded  i seen him  seen him  in the water we was all walkin along the river bank and some o the flock got to complainin because he hadnt fetched the new jerusalem down yit and wantin to know when he was goin to do it and sayin this was philadelphy and why didnt he and mr hingston he was tryin to pacify em and mr enraghty he scolded em and told em to hesh up or theyd be in danger of hellfire but they didnt and the good old man he begun to cry it was awful mother  go on joey dont stop  well hed been prayin a good deal off and on and actin like he wasnt in his right senses sometimes talkin to hisself and singin his hymnthat one you know  never mind joey dear his mother said keep on  and all at once he up and says if i want to i can turn this river into a river of gold and one o the flock about the worst one he hollers back well why dont you do it then and mr enraghtywell they call him saint paul you knowhe told him to shut his mouth and they got to jawin and i heard a rattlin of gravel like it was slippin down the bank and then there was the good old man in the water hollerin for help and his hat off floatin down stream and his hair all over his shoulders and before i knowed what to think he sunk and when he come up i was there in the water puttin out for him  yes joey  i cant remember how i got there must a jumped in without thinkin hed been so good to me all along and used to come to me in the nighttime when he sposed i was asleep and kiss me and crybut id a done it for anybody anyway mother  yes go  some of em was takin their shoes and coats off to jump in and some jest standin still and hollerin to me not to let him ketch holt o me or hed pull me under but i knowed he couldnt do that becuz i could ketch him by one arm and hold him offme n bennys practised it in the crickand i swum up to him and he went down agin and when he come up agin his face was all soakin wet like hed been cryin under the water and he says kind o bubblinlike this the boy made the sound he says oh my son god helpbububbless you and then he went down and i swum round and round expectin hed come up somewheres but he didnt come up no more it was awful mother becuz that didnt seem to be the end of it and it was just didnt come up no more they jawed some before they got over the mountains the boy said reminiscently they hadnt brung much money even mr hingston hadnt becuz they expected the good old man to work miracles and make silver and gold money out of red cents like he said he would all the nights we slep out o doors and sometimes we had to ast for victuals but the good old man he always found places to sleep nice caves in the banks and holler trees and wherever he ast for victuals they give plenty and mr enraghty he said it was a miracle if he always knowed the best places to sleep and the kindest women to ast for victuals do you believe it was mother  nancy said after an effort for her voice he might have been there before  well thats so but none of em thunk o that and what mr enraghty said stopped the jawin at the time it all begun agin worse than ever when we got almost to philadelphy and he said some of em must take the south fork of the road with saint paul and keep on till they saw a big light over philadelphy where the new jerusalem was swellin up and the rest would meet em there with him and saint peter they said why couldnt we all go together and it was pretty soon after that that he slipped into the river stumbled on a round stone i reckon  illustration and he went down agin and when he come up agin his face was all soakin wet like hed been crying under the water  the woman sat slowly smoothing the handle of the coffeepot up and down and staring at the boy but she did not speak  benny jumped in by that time but it wasnt any use oh i seen the ocean mother mr hingston took me n benny down on a boat and i seen a stuffed elephant in a show or a museum they called it benny said it was just like the real one in the circus at wheeling mother do you believe he throwed hisself in  who joey she faintly asked  why the good old man thats what some of em said them that was disappointed about the new jerusalem but some said he did fetch it down and they seen it with the black horses and silver gates and velvet streets and everything just the way he promised and the others said hed fooled em or else they was just lyin and they said hed got to the end of his string and that was why he throwed himself in and when he got in he was scared of drowndin and that was why he hollered for help but i believe he just slipped in dont you mother  yes joey  mother i dont believe the good old man had a grea deal of courage all the way over the mountains hed seem to scare at any little noise even in broad daylight oncet when we was goin along through the woods a pig jumped out of some hazelnut bushes and scared him so that he yelled and fell down in a fit and they was a good while fetchin him to do you think he was god mother  no joey  well thats what i think too if he was god he wouldnt been afeared would he and in the night sometimes hed come and git me to come and lay by him where he could put his arm round my neck and feel me like as if he wanted compny well now that wasnt much like god was it and when he thought i was asleep i could hear him prayin o merciful savior and things like that and if he was god who could he pray to it wasnt sense was it well i just believe he fell in and he was afeared he was drowndin and thats why he hollered out dont you mother  yes i do joey  and you think i done right dont you to try to help him even if it was some resk  oh yes  i knowed it

she was sitting with himi believe ill go and lay down on the bed a minute bein up so  why yes mother you lay down and ill clear up the breakfast or supper if its it itll be like old times he said in the pride of his long absence from home his mother lay down on the bed with her face to the wall and he went very quietly about his work so as not to wake the baby but after a moment he went to his mother and whispered hoarsely you dont suppose i could go and see benny a minute after ive got done its most broad day and i know hell be up too  yes go she said without turning her face to him  he kept tiptoeing about and when he had finished he stood waiting to be sure whether she was sleeping before he opened the door now she turned her face and spoke joey  yes mother he whispered back and ran to her softly in his bare feet  did you get to like him any better  he seemed not to take her question as anything strange or to be in doubt of whom she meant  why there in the water at the very last when he kep goin down i liked him yes i must have but all along i felt more like sorry for him he seemed so miserble all the time and sowellscared  yes she had got the boys hand and without turning her body with her face she held his hand in hers closely under her arm joey i told you he was a wicked man i cant tell you any different now but im glad you was sorry for him i am sorry too joeyhe was your father she pressed his hand harder  goodness he said but he did not suffer himself to say more  he went away and left me when you was a little baby and he never come back till he come back here i never had any word from him for all i could tell he was dead i never wanted him to be dead she defended herself to herself in something above the intelligence of the boy i married laban whos been more of a father to you than what he was  oh yes mother  when your real father come here i made your true father go away now she turned and faced her son keeping his hand tighter in hers joey i want to have you go and tell him to come back  right away mother  why yes she said with question in her answer  i thought maybe youd let me see benny first he suggested a little wistfully  she almost laughed you dear boy go and see benny on your way take him with you if his father will let him go youre both such great travelers your fathers at the wilkinses yit i reckon they haint finished with their cider i dont believe go now  the boy had been poising as if on winged feet and now he flew he came back to say at the door i dont believe ill want any breakfast mother we had such a late supper  it was a thoughtful suggestion and she said no but before her answer came he had flown again  the baby woke and she cooed to it and she went about the one room of the little cabin trying to put it more in order than before some pieces of the moss in the chinking of the round logs near the chimney seemed loose and she packed them tighter as she worked she sang she sang a hymn but it was a hymn of thanksgiving  the doorway darkened and she turned to see the figure of her brother black in the light  i see youve heard the news he said grimly i was afraid i might find you making a show of mourning i dont pretend to any i havent had such a load off me since that rascal first come back  she answered resentfully what makes you so glad david he didnt come back to make you drive your husband away  i was always afraid he might make me kill him he tried hard enough and sometimes i thought he might but blessed be the lord hes dead theyre holding a funeral for him in the temple the news is all through the creek i suppose you know how jane has fixed it up with james redfield i feel to be sorry for hughey blake but he never could have mastered her shes got an awful will jane has but james has got an awful will too as strong as jane  nancy cut him short david i dont care anything about janenow  no he assented wheres joey he asked leaning inward with his hands resting on either jamb of the door  gone for laban  well david said with something like grudge you haint lost much time but i dont know as i blame you he relented  i wouldnt care if you did david she answered    xxiii   late in the long twilight of the early spring day a stranger who was traveling in the old fashion on horseback with his legs swathed in green baize against the mud of the streaming roads and with his spattered saddlebags hung over the pommel before him was riding into leatherwood he paused in a puddle of the lane that left the turnpike not far off and curved between the newplowed fields in front of a double log cabin which had the air of being one of the best habitations of its time though its time was long past the logs it was built of were squared the chimneys at either end were of stone masonry instead of notched sticks laid in clay against the wall of the porch between the two rooms of the cabin an old man sat tilted back in his chair smoking a pipe which he took from his mouth at sight of the strangers arrest  can you tell me please which is my way to the tavern or some place where i can find a nights lodging  the old man dropped his chair forward and got somewhat painfully out of it to toddle to the edge of his porch why there isnt a tavern rightly speaking in leatherwood now though for the backwoods we had a very passable one once i wish he said after a moment that we could offer you a lodging here but if youll light and throw your horses rein over the peg in this post i would be pleased to have you stay to supper with us my wife is just getting it  why thank you thank you the stranger said i mustnt think of troubling you i dare say i can get something to eat at your tavern ive often been over night in worse places no doubt ive been traveling through your state and ive turned a little out of my way to stop at leatherwood because ive been interested in a peculiar incident of your local history  the two men perceived from something in each others parlance though one spoke with the neat accent of the countries beyond the alleghanies and the other with the soft slurring ohio river utterance that they were in the presence of men different by thinking if not by learning from most men in the belated region of a new country  oh yes the old man said with instant intelligence the leatherwood god  yes the other eagerly assented i was told at your county seat that i could learn all about it if i asked for squire braile here  i am matthew braile the old man said with dignity and the stranger returned with a certain apology in his laugh  i must confess that i suspected as much and im ashamed not to have frankly asked at once  better lightthe squire condoned whatever offense there might have been in the uncandor i dont often get the chance to talk of our famous imposture and i cant let one slip through my fingers you must come in to supper and if you smoke i can give you a pipe of our yellow tobacco afterwards and we can talk  but i should tire you with my questions in the morning  we old men sometimes have a trick of not living till morning youd better take me while you can get me  well if you put it in that way the stranger said and he slipped down from his saddle  the old man called out here abel and the figure of what seemed an elderly boy came lurching and paddling round the corner of the cabin and ducked his gray head hospitably toward the stranger give this horse a feed while were taking ours  all right squire jest helpin sally put the turkeychicks to bed out o the cold or id a been round at the first splashin in the road  and now come in the squire said reaching a hand of welcome from the edge of the porch to the stranger as he mounted the steps old neighbors of ours he explained abel and the unseen sally weve known them boy and girl from the beginning and when their old cabin fell down in the tailend of a tornado a few years back we got them here in a new one behind ours to take care of them and let them take care of us they dont eat with us he added setting open the kitchen door and ushering the stranger into the warm glow and smell of the interior mis braile he said for introduction to his wife and explained to her a friend that i caught on the wing i dont know that i did get your name  mandevillet j mandeville im from cambridge  thomas jefferson i suppose cambridge ohioback here  massachusetts  well you didnt sound like ohio i always like to make sure well you must pull up mother have you got anything fit to eat this evening  you might try and see mrs braile responded in what seemed their habitual banter  well dont brag the squire returned and between them they welcomed the stranger to a meal that he said he had not tasted the like of in all his western travel  it seemed that their guest did not smoke and the squire alone lighted his pipe then he joked his wife mother will you let us stay by the fire hereits a little chilly outdoors and those young frogs do take the heart of you with their peepingif we dont mind your bothering round mr mandeville wants to hear all about our leatherwood god  hell hear more about him than he wants to if he listens to all you tell matthew mrs braile retorted  oh no oh no the stranger protested and the squire laughed  you wanted to know he said well after the beginning of their talk whether there were many of the little flock left well some and to answer your other question theyre as strong in the faith as ever the dead died in the faith the living that were young in it in the late eighteentwenties are old in it now in the first of the fifties its rather curious the squire said with a long sigh of satisfaction in the anomaly but after the arrest of dylks and his trial and acquittal before this court the squire smiled when he came out of the tall timber and had his scalp mended and got into a whole suit of saint peters clothes he didnt find the little flock fallen off a great deal they were a good deal scared and so was he that was the worst of the lookout for dylks his habit of being afraid it was about the best thing too kept him from playing the very devil theres no telling how far he might have gone if he hadnt been afraid i mean gone in personal mischief  yes the stranger assented and his failure in all his miracles had no effect on his followers  the squire laughed with a rattling of loose teeth on his pipestem why he didnt fail according to the little flock it was only the unbelievers that disbelieved in the miracles even those that went with him overthemountains to see the new jerusalem come down got to having seen it as time went on though some had their doubts when they first came back before they died theyd all seen him go up in a chariot of fire with two black horses and no driver nobody but those two purblind ignorant boys that tried to keep him from drowning when he fell into the river could be got to say that the heavenly city didnt come down and suck him up why seven or eight years after he left there was a preacher who was one of his followers came back here and preached in the dylks templethe old temple burned down long ago and was never rebuilt preached the divinity of dylks and said there was no true religion that didnt recognize him as god as for christianity he said it was just a hotchpotch of judaism and heathenism he saw the good old man go right up into heaven and said he was going to come back to earth before long and set up his kingdom here hes never done it and that slick preacher never came back either after the first he was very well dressed and looked as if he had been living on the fat of the land somewhere among the faithful overthemountains i reckon knew where the fried chickens roosted excuse me mother shes heard that joke before he explained to their guest  ive heard it too often to mind it mrs braile mocked back  well it seems to be new to our friend here  mr mandeville was laughing but he controlled himself to ask and had the fellow no progressive doctrine no steps of belief no logical formulation of his claims he couldnt have been merely a dunderheaded impudent charlatan who expected to convince by the miracles he didnt do  oh no oh no i didnt mean to imply that the squire explained he was a cunning rascal in his way and he had the sort of brain that has served the purpose of the imposter in all ages he had a plan of belief as you may call it which he must have thought out before he came here if he hadnt begged borrowed or stolen it from somebody else at first he called himself a humble teacher of christianity but it wasnt a great while before he pretended to be jesus christ who died on calvary that didnt satisfy him long though when he had convinced some that he was christ he began to teach that the christ who was crucified though he was a real messiah was not a perfect messiah because he had died and been buried and death had had power over him just as it has over any mortal but the real messiah would never taste death and he was that messiah dylks would never taste death and as the real messiah he would be one with god and in fact he was the one and only god these were the steps and the way to belief in the godhead was clear to the meanest understanding the meaner the understanding the clearer the squire summed up with another tattoo on his pipestem you see he resumed after a moment life is hard in a new country and anybody that promises salvation on easy terms has got a strong hold at the very start people will accept anything from him somewhere tucked away in us is the longing to know whether well live again and the hope that well live happy ive got fun out of that fact in a community where ive had the reputation of an infidel for fifty years but all along ive felt it in myself we want to be good and we want to be safe even if we are not good and the first fellow that comes along and tells us to have faith in him and hell make it all right why we have faith in him thats all  well then the stranger said holding him to the logic of the facts as he leaned toward him from his side of the fireplace and fixed him with an eager eye i cant see why he didnt establish his superstition in universal acceptance as say mahomet did  im glad you came to that the squire blandly submitted for one thing and the main thing because he was a coward he had plently of audacity but mighty little courage and his courage gave out just when he needed it the most and perhaps he hadnt perfect faith in himself he was a fool but he wasnt a crazy fool then again my idea is that the scale was too small or the scene or the field or whatever you call it the backwoods as leatherwood was then was not the right starting point for a worldwide imposture then again as i said dylks was timid he was not ready to shed blood for his lie neither other peoples nor his own and when it came to fighting for his doctrine he was afraid he wanted to run and in fact he did run first and last no liar ever had such a hold on them that believed his lie theyd have followed him any lengths but he hadnt the heart to lead them when redfield and i got hold of him after he had tasted the fear of death there that week in the tall timber he was willing to promise anything we said and he kept his promise he wouldnt if he could have helped it but he knew jim redfield would hold him to it if he squeezed his life out doing it  the stranger was silent but not apparently convinced and meanwhile he took up another point of interest in the story which he heard from the squire and whatever became of his wife and her true husband  oh they lived on together not very long though they died within a week of each other about didnt they mother  just a week mrs braile said animated by the human touch in the discussion they lived mighty happy together and it was as good a death as a body could want to die it was that summer when the fever mowed the people down so they took their little girl with them she sighed from a source of hidden sorrow they all went together  braile took his pipe out and gulped before he could answer the strangers next question and the boy dylkss son is he living  oh yes at the pleasant thought of the boy the squire began to smile he and hingstons son took over the mill from hingston after he got too old for it and carried it on together hingston wasnt one that hung on to the faith in dylks but he never made any fuss about giving it up just staid away from the temple that the little flock built for themselves  and is young dylks still carrying on the milling business  who joey oh yes he married benny hingstons sister bennys wife died and he lives with them  and there aint a better man in the whole of leatherwood than joey billins as we always call him mrs braile put in he was the best boy anywhere and hes the best man  well its likely to come out that way sometimes the squire said with tender irony  and you cant say mrs braile continued with a certain note of indignation as for unjust neglect of the pair but what james redfield and jane has got along very well together  oh yes theyve got along the squire assented hes got along with her and shes got along with the childrenplenty of them i reckon shes what he wanted and theyre what she did  the stranger looked a little puzzled  that instinct of maternity the squire explained you may have noticed it in womensome of them  oh oh yes mr mandeville assented he did not seem greatly interested  shes always been just crazy about em mrs braile explained beginnin with nancy billinss little girl well  yes the squire amplified it was the best thing or at least the strongest thing in jane i dont say anything against it mother he said tenderly to his wife jane was a good girl especially after she got over her faith in dylks and shes a good woman at least jim thinks so  mrs braile contented herself as she could with his ironical concession  the stranger looked at his watch he jumped to his feet nine oclock mrs braile im ashamed but you must blame your husband partly good night maam goodwhy look here squire braile he arrested himself in offering his hand how about the obscurity of the scene where joe smith founded his superstition which bids fair to live right along with the other false religions was leatherwood ohio a narrower stage than manchester new york and in point of time the two cults were only four years apart  well thats a thing thats occurred to me since weve been talking suppose we look into it tomorrow come round to breakfastabout six oclock one point though joe smith only claimed to be a prophet and dylks claimed to be a god that made it harder maybe for his superstition   the end
