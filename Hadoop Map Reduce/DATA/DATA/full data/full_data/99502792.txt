99502792	mosses from an old manse                        by nathaniel hawthorne                   passages from a relinquished work    at home  from infancy i was under the guardianship of a village parson who made me the subject of daily prayer and the sufferer of innumerable stripes using no distinction as to these marks of paternal love between myself and his own three boys  the result it must be owned has been very different in their cases and mine they being all respectable men and well settled in life the eldest as the successor to his fathers pulpit the second as a physician and the third as a partner in a wholesale shoestore while i with better prospects than either of them have run the course which this volume will describe  yet there is room for doubt whether i should have been any better contented with such success as theirs than with my own misfortunesat least till after my experience of the latter had made it too late for another trial  my guardian had a name of considerable eminence and fitter for the place it occupies in ecclesiastical history than for so frivolous a page as mine  in his own vicinity among the lighter part of his hearers he was called parson thumpcushion from the very forcible gestures with which he illustrated his doctrines certainly if his powers as a preacher were to be estimated by the damage done to his pulpitfurniture none of his living brethren and but few dead ones would have been worthy even to pronounce a benediction after him  such pounding and expounding the moment he began to grow warm such slapping with his open palm thumping with his closed fist and banging with the whole weight of the great bible convinced me that he held in imagination either the old nick or some unitarian infidel at bay and belabored his unhappy cushion as proxy for those abominable adversaries  nothing but this exercise of the body while delivering his sermons could have supported the good parsons health under the mental toil which they cost him in composition  though parson thumpcushion had an upright heart and some called it a warm one he was invariably stern and severe on principle i suppose to me  with late justice though early enough even now to be tinctured with generosity i acknowledge him to have been a good and wise man after his own fashion  if his management failed as to myself it succeeded with his three sons nor i must frankly say could any mode of education with which it was possible for him to be acquainted have made me much better than what i was or led me to a happier fortune than the present he could neither change the nature that god gave me nor adapt his own inflexible mind to my peculiar character  perhaps it was my chief misfortune that i had neither father nor mother alive for parents have an instinctive sagacity in regard to the welfare of their children and the child feels a confidence both in the wisdom and affection of his parents which he cannot transfer to any delegate of their duties however conscientious  an orphans fate is hard be he rich or poor  as for parson thumpcushion whenever i see the old gentleman in my dreams he looks kindly and sorrowfully at me holding out his hand as if each had something to forgive  with such kindness and such forgiveness but without the sorrow may our next meeting be  i was a youth of gay and happy temperament with an incorrigible levity of spirit of no vicious propensities sensible enough but wayward and fanciful  what a character was this to be brought in contact with the stern old pilgrim spirit of my guardian  we were at variance on a thousand points but our chief and final dispute arose from the pertinacity with which he insisted on my adopting a particular profession while i being heir to a moderate competence had avowed my purpose of keeping aloof from the regular business of life  this would have been a dangerous resolution anywhere in the world it was fatal in new england  there is a grossness in the conceptions of my countrymen they will not be convinced that any good thing may consist with what they call idleness they can anticipate nothing but evil of a young man who neither studies physic law nor gospel nor opens a store nor takes to farming but manifests an incomprehensible disposition to be satisfied with what his father left him  the principle is excellent in its general influence but most miserable in its effect on the few that violate it  i had a quick sensitiveness to public opinion and felt as if it ranked me with the tavern haunters and town pauperswith the drunken poet who hawked his own fourth of july odes and the broken soldier who had been good for nothing since last war  the consequence of all this was a piece of lighthearted desperation  i do not overestimate my notoriety when i take it for granted that many of my readers must have heard of me in the wild way of life which i adopted  the idea of becoming a wandering storyteller had been suggested a year or two before by an encounter with several merry vagabonds in a showmans wagon where they and i had sheltered ourselves during a summer shower  the project was not more extravagant than most which a young man forms stranger ones are executed every day and not to mention my prototypes in the east and the wandering orators and poets whom my own ears have heard i had the example of one illustrious itinerant in the other hemisphereof goldsmith who planned and performed his travels through france and italy on a less promising scheme than mine  i took credit to myself for various qualifications mental and personal suited to the undertaking besides my mind had latterly tormented me for employment keeping up an irregular activity even in sleep and making me conscious that i must toil if it were but in catching butterflies  but my chief motives were discontent with home and a bitter grudge against parson thumpcushion who would rather have laid me in my fathers tomb than seen me either a novelist or an actor two characters which i thus hit upon a method of uniting  after all it was not half so foolish as if i had written romances instead of reciting them  the following pages will contain a picture of my vagrant life intermixed with specimens generally brief and slight of that great mass of fiction to which i gave existence and which has vanished like cloudshapes  besides the occasions when i sought a pecuniary reward i was accustomed to exercise my narrative faculty wherever chance had collected a little audience idle enough to listen  these rehearsals were useful in testing the strong points of my stories and indeed the flow of fancy soon came upon me so abundantly that its indulgence was its own reward though the hope of praise also became a powerful incitement  since i shall never feel the warm gush of new thought as i did then let me beseech the reader to believe that my tales were not always so cold as he may find them now  with each specimen will be given a sketch of the circumstances in which the story was told  thus my airdrawn pictures will be set in frames perhaps more valuable than the pictures themselves since they will be embossed with groups of characteristic figures amid the lake and mountain scenery the villages and fertile fields of our native land but i write the book for the sake of its moral which many a dreaming youth may profit by though it is the experience of a wandering storyteller    a flight in the fog  i set out on my rambles one morning in june about sunrise  the day promised to be fair though at that early hour a heavy mist lay along the earth and settled in minute globules on the folds of my clothes so that i looked precisely as if touched with a hoarfrost the sky was quite obscured and the trees and houses invisible till they grew out of the fog as i came close upon them  there is a hill towards the west whence the road goes abruptly down holding a level course through the village and ascending an eminence on the other side behind which it disappears  the whole view comprises an extent of half a mile here i paused and while gazing through the misty veil it partially rose and swept away with so sudden an effect that a gray cloud seemed to have taken the aspect of a small white town a thin vapor being still diffused through the atmosphere the wreaths and pillars of fog whether hung in air or based on earth appeared not less substantial than the edifices and gave their own indistinctness to the whole  it was singular that such an unromantic scene should look so visionary  half of the parsons dwelling was a dingy white house and half of it was a cloud but squire moodys mansion the grandest in the village was wholly visible even the latticework of the balcony under the front window while in another place only two red chimneys were seen above the mist appertaining to my own paternal residence then tenanted by strangers  i could not remember those with whom i had dwelt there not even my mother the brick edifice of the bank was in the clouds the foundations of what was to be a great block of buildings had vanished ominously as it proved the drygoods store of mr nightingale seemed a doubtful concern and dominicus pikes tobacco manufactory an affair of smoke except the splendid image of an indian chief in front  the white spire of the meetinghouse ascended out of the densest heap of vapor as if that shadowy base were its only support or to give a truer interpretation the steeple was the emblem of religion enveloped in mystery below yet pointing to a cloudless atmosphere and catching the brightness of the east on its gilded vane  as i beheld these objects and the dewy street with grassy intervals and a border of trees between the wheeltrack and the sidewalks all so indistinct and not to be traced without an effort the whole seemed more like memory than reality  i would have imagined that years had already passed and i was far away contemplating that dim picture of my native place which i should retain in my mind through the mist of time  no tears fell from my eyes among the dewdrops of the morning nor does it occur to me that i heaved a sigh  in truth i had never felt such a delicious excitement nor known what freedom was till that moment when i gave up my home and took the whole world in exchange fluttering the wings of my spirit as if i would have flown from one star to another through the universe  i waved my hand towards the dusky village bade it a joyous farewell and turned away to follow any path but that which might lead me back  never was childe harolds sentiment adopted in a spirit more unlike his own  naturally enough i thought of don quixote  recollecting how the knight and sancho had watched for auguries when they took the road to toboso i began between jest and earnest to feel a similar anxiety  it was gratified and by a more poetical phenomenon than the braying of the dappled ass or the neigh of rosinante  the sun then just above the horizon shone faintly through the fog and formed a species of rainbow in the west bestriding my intended road like a gigantic portal  i had never known before that a bow could be generated between the sunshine and the morning mist  it had no brilliancy no perceptible hues but was a mere unpainted framework as white and ghostlike as the lunar rainbow which is deemed ominous of evil  but with a light heart to which all omens were propitious i advanced beneath the misty archway of futurity  i had determined not to enter on my profession within a hundred miles of home and then to cover myself with a fictitious name the first precaution was reasonable enough as otherwise parson thumpcushion might have put an untimely catastrophe to my story but as nobody would be much affected by my disgrace and all was to be suffered in my own person i know not why i cared about a name  for a week or two i travelled almost at random seeking hardly any guidance except the whirling of a leaf at some turn of the road or the green bough that beckoned me or the naked branch that pointed its withered finger onward  all my care was to be farther from home each night than the preceding morning    a fellowtraveller  one day at noontide when the sun had burst suddenly out of a cloud and threatened to dissolve me i looked round for shelter whether of tavern cottage barn or shady tree  the first which offered itself was a woodnot a forest but a trim plantation of young oaks growing just thick enough to keep the mass of sunshine out while they admitted a few straggling beams and thus produced the most cheerful gloom imaginable  a brook so small and clear and apparently so cool that i wanted to drink it up ran under the road through a little arch of stone without once meeting the sun in its passage from the shade on one side to the shade on the other  as there was a steppingplace over the stone wall and a path along the rivulet i followed it and discovered its sourcea spring gushing out of an old barrel  in this pleasant spot i saw a light pack suspended from the branch of a tree a stick leaning against the trunk and a person seated on the grassy verge of the spring with his back towards me  he was a slender figure dressed in black broadcloth which was none of the finest nor very fashionably cut  on hearing my footsteps he started up rather nervously and turning round showed the face of a young man about my own age with his finger in a volume which he had been reading till my intrusion  his book was evidently a pocket bible though i piqued myself at that period on my great penetration into peoples characters and pursuits i could not decide whether this young man in black were an unfledged divine from andover a college student or preparing for college at some academy  in either case i would quite as willingly have found a merrier companion such for instance as the comedian with whom gil blas shared his dinner beside a fountain in spain  after a nod which was duly returned i made a goblet of oakleaves filled and emptied it two or three times and then remarked to hit the strangers classical associations that this beautiful fountain ought to flow from an urn instead of an old barrel  he did not show that he understood the allusion and replied very briefly with a shyness that was quite out of place between persons who met in such circumstances  had he treated my next observation in the same way we should have parted without another word  it is very singular said ithough doubtless there are good reasons for itthat nature should provide drink so abundantly and lavish it everywhere by the roadside but so seldom anything to eat why should not we find a loaf of bread on this tree as well as a barrel of good liquor at the foot of it  there is a loaf of bread on the tree replied the stranger without even smilingat a coincidence which made me laugh  i have something to eat in my bundle and if you can make a dinner with me you shall be welcome  i accept your offer with pleasure said i  a pilgrim such as i am must not refuse a providential meal  the young man had risen to take his bundle from the branch of the tree but now turned round and regarded me with great earnestness coloring deeply at the same time  however he said nothing and produced part of a loaf of bread and some cheese the former being evidently home baked though some days out of the oven  the fare was good enough with a real welcome such as his appeared to be after spreading these articles on the stump of a tree he proceeded to ask a blessing on our food an unexpected ceremony and quite an impressive one at our woodland table with the fountain gushing beside us and the bright sky glimmering through the boughs nor did his brief petition affect me less because his embarrassment made his voice tremble  at the end of the meal he returned thanks with the same tremulous fervor  he felt a natural kindness for me after thus relieving my necessities and showed it by becoming less reserved  on my part i professed never to have relished a dinner better and in requital of the strangers hospitality solicited the pleasure of his company to supper  where  at your home  asked he  yes said i smiling  perhaps our roads are not the same observed he  o i can take any road but one and yet not miss my way answered i  this morning i breakfasted at home i shall sup at home tonight and a moment ago i dined at home  to be sure there was a certain place which i called home but i have resolved not to see it again till i have been quite round the globe and enter the street on the east as i left it on the west in the mean time i have a home everywhere or nowhere just as you please to take it  nowhere then for this transitory world is not our home said the young man with solemnity  we are all pilgrims and wanderers but it is strange that we two should meet  i inquired the meaning of this remark but could obtain no satisfactory reply  but we had eaten salt together and it was right that we should form acquaintance after that ceremony as the arabs of the desert do especially as he had learned something about myself and the courtesy of the country entitled me to as much information in return  i asked whither he was travelling  i do not know said he but god knows  that is strange  exclaimed i not that god should know it but that you should not  and how is your road to be pointed out  perhaps by an inward conviction he replied looking sideways at me to discover whether i smiled perhaps by an outward sign  then believe me said i the outward sign is already granted you and the inward conviction ought to follow  we are told of pious men in old times who committed themselves to the care of providence and saw the manifestation of its will in the slightest circumstances as in the shooting of a star the flight of a bird or the course taken by some brute animal  sometimes even a stupid ass was their guide  may i not be as good a one  i do not know said the pilgrim with perfect simplicity  we did however follow the same road and were not overtaken as i partly apprehended by the keepers of any lunatic asylum in pursuit of a stray patient  perhaps the stranger felt as much doubt of my sanity as i did of his though certainly with less justice since i was fully aware of my own extravagances while he acted as wildly and deemed it heavenly wisdom  we were a singular couple strikingly contrasted yet curiously assimilated each of us remarkable enough by himself and doubly so in the others company without any formal compact we kept together day after day till our union appeared permanent  even had i seen nothing to love and admire in him i could never have thought of deserting one who needed me continually for i never knew a person not even a woman so unfit to roam the world in solitude as he wasso painfully shy so easily discouraged by slight obstacles and so often depressed by a weight within himself  i was now far from my native place but had not yet stepped before the public  a slight tremor seized me whenever i thought of relinquishing the immunities of a private character and giving every man and for money too the right which no man yet possessed of treating me with open scorn  but about a week after contracting the above alliance i made my bow to an audience of nine persons seven of whom hissed me in a very disagreeable manner and not without good cause  indeed the failure was so signal that it would have been mere swindling to retain the money which had been paid on my implied contract to give its value of amusement  so i called in the doorkeeper bade him refund the whole receipts a mighty sum and was gratified with a round of applause by way of offset to the hisses  this event would have looked most horrible in anticipationa thing to make a man shoot himself or run amuck or hide himself in caverns where he might not see his own burning blush but the reality was not so very hard to bear  it is a fact that i was more deeply grieved by an almost parallel misfortune which happened to my companion on the same evening  in my own behalf i was angry and excited not depressed my blood ran quick my spirits rose buoyantly and i had never felt such a confidence of future success and determination to achieve it as at that trying moment i resolved to persevere if it were only to wring the reluctant praise from my enemies  hitherto i had immensely underrated the difficulties of my idle trade now i recognized that it demanded nothing short of my whole powers cultivated to the utmost and exerted with the same prodigality as if i were speaking for a great party or for the nation at large on the floor of the capitol  no talent or attainment could come amiss everything indeed was requisitewide observation varied knowledge deep thoughts and sparkling ones pathos and levity and a mixture of both like sunshine in a raindrop lofty imagination veiling itself in the garb of common life and the practised art which alone could render these gifts and more than these available  not that i ever hoped to be thus qualified  but my despair was no ignoble one for knowing the impossibility of satisfying myself even should the world be satisfied i did my best to overcome it investigated the causes of every defect and strove with patient stubbornness to remove them in the next attempt  it is one of my few sources of pride that ridiculous as the object was i followed it up with the firmness and energy of a man  i manufactured a great variety of plots and skeletons of tales and kept them ready for use leaving the filling up to the inspiration of the moment though i cannot remember ever to have told a tale which did not vary considerably from my preconceived idea and acquire a novelty of aspect as often as i repeated it oddly enough my success was generally in proportion to the difference between the conception and accomplishment  i provided two or more commencements and catastrophes to many of the talesa happy expedient suggested by the double sets of sleeves and trimmings which diversified the suits in sir piercy shaftons wardrobe  but my best efforts had a unity a wholeness and a separate character that did not admit of this sort of mechanism    the village theatre  about the first of september my fellowtraveller and myself arrived at a country town where a small company of actors on their return from a summers campaign in the british provinces were giving a series of dramatic exhibitions  a moderately sized hall of the tavern had been converted into a theatre  the performances that evening were the heir at law and no song no supper with the recitation of alexanders feast between the play and farce  the house was thin and dull  but the next day there appeared to be brighter prospects the playbills announcing at every corner on the townpump andawful sacrilegeon the very door of the meetinghouse an unprecedented attraction after setting forth the ordinary entertainments of a theatre the public were informed in the hugest type that the printingoffice could supply that the manager had been fortunate enough to accomplish an engagement with the celebrated storyteller  he would make his first appearance that evening and recite his famous tale of mr higginbothams catastrophe which had been received with rapturous applause by audiences in all the principal cities  this outrageous flourish of trumpets be it known was wholly unauthorized by me who had merely made an engagement for a single evening without assuming any more celebrity than the little i possessed  as for the tale it could hardly have been applauded by rapturous audiences being as yet an unfilled plot nor even when i stepped upon the stage was it decided whether mr higginbotham should live or die  in two or three places underneath the flaming bills which announced the storyteller was pasted a small slip of paper giving notice in tremulous characters of a religious meeting to be held at the schoolhouse where with divine permission eliakim abbott would address sinners on the welfare of their immortal souls  in the evening after the commencement of the tragedy of douglas i took a ramble through the town to quicken my ideas by active motion my spirits were good with a certain glow of mind which i had already learned to depend upon as the sure prognostic of success passing a small and solitary schoolhouse where a light was burning dimly and a few people were entering the door i went in with them and saw my friend eliakim at the desk  he had collected about fifteen hearers mostly females  just as i entered he was beginning to pray in accents so low and interrupted that he seemed to doubt the reception of his efforts both with god and man  there was room for distrust in regard to the latter  at the conclusion of the prayer several of the little audience went out leaving him to begin his discourse under such discouraging circumstances added to his natural and agonizing diffidence  knowing that my presence on these occasions increased his embarrassment i had stationed myself in a dusky place near the door and now stole softly out  on my return to the tavern the tragedy was already concluded and being a feeble one in itself and indifferently performed it left so much the better chance for the storyteller  the bar was thronged with customers the toddystick keeping a continual tattoo while in the hall there was a broad deep buzzing sound with an occasional peal of impatient thunderall symptoms of all overflowing house and an eager audience  i drank a glass of wineandwater and stood at the side scene conversing with a young person of doubtful sex if a gentleman how could he have performed the singing girl the night before in no song no supper  or if a lady why did she enact young norval and now wear a green coat and white pantaloons in the character of little pickle  in either case the dress was pretty and the wearer bewitching so that at the proper moment i stepped forward with a gay heart and a hold one while the orchestra played a tune that had resounded at many a country ball and the curtain as it rose discovered something like a country barroom such a scene was well enough adapted to such a tale  the orchestra of our little theatre consisted of two fiddles and a clarinet but if the whole harmony of the tremont had been there it might have swelled in vain beneath the tumult of applause that greeted me  the good people of the town knowing that the world contained innumerable persons of celebrity undreamed of by them took it for granted that i was one and that their roar of welcome was but a feeble echo of those which had thundered around me in lofty theatres  such an enthusiastic uproar was never heard  each person seemed a briarcus clapping a hundred hands besides keeping his feet and several cudgels in play with stamping and thumping on the floor while the ladies flourished their white cambric handkerchiefs intermixed with yellow and red bandanna like the flags of different nations after such a salutation the celebrated storyteller felt almost ashamed to produce so humble an affair as mr higginbothams catastrophe  this story was originally more dramatic than as there presented and afforded good scope for mimicry and buffoonery neither of which to my shame did i spare  i never knew the magic of a name till i used that of mr higginbotham  often as i repeated it there were louder bursts of merriment than those which responded to what in my opinion were more legitimate strokes of humor  the success of the piece was incalculably heightened by a stiff cue of horsehair which little pickle in the spirit of that mischiefloving character had fastened to my collar where unknown to me it kept making the queerest gestures of its own in correspondence with all mine  the audience supposing that some enormous joke was appended to this long tail behind were ineffably delighted and gave way to such a tumult of approbation that just as the story closed the benches broke beneath them and left one whole row of my admirers on the floor  even in that predicament they continued their applause  in after times when i had grown a bitter moralizer i took this scene for an example how much of fame is humbug how much the meed of what our better nature blushes at how much an accident how much bestowed on mistaken principles and how small and poor the remnant from pit and boxes there was now a universal call for the storyteller  that celebrated personage came not when they did call to him  as i left the stage the landlord being also the postmaster had given me a letter with the postmark of my native village and directed to my assumed name in the stiff old handwriting of parson thumpcushion doubtless he had heard of the rising renown of the storyteller and conjectured at once that such a nondescript luminary could be no other than his lost ward  his epistle though i never read it affected me most painfully  i seemed to see the puritanic figure of my guardian standing among the fripperies of the theatre and pointing to the playersthe fantastic and effeminate men the painted women the giddy girl in boys clothes merrier than modestpointing to these with solemn ridicule and eying me with stern rebuke  his image was a type of the austere duty and they of the vanities of life  i hastened with the letter to my chamber and held it unopened in my hand while the applause of my buffoonery yet sounded through the theatre  another train of thought came over me  the stern old man appeared again but now with the gentleness of sorrow softening his authority with love as a father might and even bending his venerable head as if to say that my errors had an apology in his own mistaken discipline  i strode twice across the chamber then held the letter in the flame of the candle and beheld it consume unread  it is fixed in my mind and was so at the time that he had addressed me in a style of paternal wisdom and love and reconciliation which i could not have resisted had i but risked the trial  the thought still haunts me that then i made my irrevocable choice between good and evil fate  meanwhile as this occurrence had disturbed my mind and indisposed me to the present exercise of my profession i left the town in spite of a laudatory critique in the newspaper and untempted by the liberal offers of the manager  as we walked onward following the same road on two such different errands eliakim groaned in spirit and labored with tears to convince me of the guilt and madness of my life
