47834104	hunted and harried by rm ballantyne  chapter one  on the hunt  on a brilliant summer morning in the last quarter of the seventeenth century a small troop of horsemen crossed the ford of the river cairn in dumfriesshire not far from the spot where stands the little church of irongray and gaining the road on the western bank of the stream wended their way towards the moors and uplands which lie in the neighbourhood of skeoch hill  the dragoons for such they were trotted rapidly along the road that led into the solitudes of the hills with all the careless dash of men whose interests are centred chiefly on the excitements of the passing hour yet with the unflagging perseverance of those who have a fixed purpose in viewtheir somewhat worn aspect and the mud with which they were bespattered from jackboot to iron headpiece telling of a long ride over rugged ground  the officer in command of the party rode a little in advance  close behind him followed two troopers one of whom was a burly middleaged man with a stern swarthy countenance the other a youth whose tall frame was scarcely if at all less powerful than that of his comradeinarms though much more elegant in form while his youthful and ruddy yet masculine countenance suggested that he must at that time have been but a novice in the art of war  this youth alone of all the party had a somewhat careworn and sad expression on his brow  it could hardly have been the result of fatigue for there was more of ease and vigour in his carriage than in that of any of his companions  we should be near the river by this time glendinning said the leader of the party reining in and addressing the swarthy trooper  ay sir the cluden rins jist ayont the turn o the road there replied the man  yell hear the roar o the fa in a meenit or twa  even as he spoke the dull growl of a cataract was heard and a few minutes later the party came upon the ford of the river  it was situated not many yards below the picturesque waterfall which is now spanned by the routen bridge but which at that time was unbridgedat all events if a bridge had previously existed it had fallen in or been carried awayand the wild gorge was impassable  the sound of the fall alone told of its vicinity for a dense mass of foliage hid it completely from the troopers view until they had surmounted the steep bank on the other side of the stream  are you well acquainted with this man black asked the leader of the party as they emerged from the thick belt of trees and shrubs by which the cluden was shaded and continued their journey on the more open ground beyond  i ken him weel sir answered the trooper  andrew black was an auld freend o mine an a big stoot angry man he iskindly disposed nae doot when ye let him alane but a perfet deevil incarnate when hes roosed  he did me an ill turn ance that ive no paid him off for yet  i suppose then said the officer that your guiding us so willingly to his cottage is in part payment of this unsettled debt  maybe it is replied the trooper grimly  they say continued the other that there is some mystery about the man that somehow nobody can catch him  like an eel he has slipped through our fellows fingers and disappeared more than once when they thought they had him quite safe  it is said that on one occasion he managed even to give the slip to claverhouse himself which you know is not easy  that may be sir but hell no slip through my fingers gin i ance git a grup o his thrapple said the swarthy man with a revengeful look  we must get a grip of him somehow returned the officer for it is said that he is a sly helper of the rebelsthough it is as difficult to convict as to catch him and as this gathering of which our spies have brought information is to be in the neighbourhood of his house he is sure to be mixed up with it  nae doot o that sir an so we may manage to kill twa birds wi ae stane  but im in a diffeeculty noo sir for ye ken im no acquaint wi this country nae farer than the cluden ford an here we hae come to a fork i the road  the party halted as he spoke while the perplexed guide stroked his rather long nose and looked seriously at the two roads or bridlepaths into which their road had resolved itself and each of which led into very divergent parts of the heathclad hills  this guide glendinning had become acquainted with black at a time when the latter resided in lanarkshire and as he had just said was unacquainted with the region through which they now travelled beyond the river cluden  after a short conference the officer in command decided to divide the party and explore both paths  you will take one man glendinning and proceed along the path to the right he said i will try the left  if you discover anything like a house or cot within a mile or two you will at once send your comrade back to let me know while you take up your quarters in the cottage and await my coming  choose whom you will for your companion  i choose will wallace then said glendinning with a nod to the young trooper whom we have already introduced  the youth did not seem at all flattered by the selection but of course obeyed orders with military promptitude and followed his comrade for some time in silence though with a clouded brow  it seems to me said the swarthy trooper as they drew rein and proceeded up a steep ascent at a walk that yere no sae pleased as ye might be wi the wark we hae on hand  pleased exclaimed the youth whose tone and speech seemed to indicate him an englishman how can i be pleased when all i have been called on to do since i enlisted has been to aid and abet in robbery cruelty and murder  i honour loyalty and detest rebellion as much as any man in the troop but if i had known what i now know i would never have joined you  glendinning gazed at his companion in amazement  having been absent on detached service when will wallace had joinedabout three weeks previouslyhe was ignorant both as to his character and his recent experiences  he had chosen him on the present occasion simply on account of his youth and magnificent physique  i doot ive made a mistake in choosin you said glendinning with some asperity after a few moments but its ower late noo to rectifeet  what ails ye lad  what hae ye seen  i have seen what i did not believe possible answered the other with suppressed feeling  i have seen a little boy tortured with the thumbscrews pricked with bayonets and otherwise inhumanly treated because he would not or could not tell where his father was  i have seen a man hung up to a beam by his thumbs because he would not give up money which perhaps he did not possess  i have seen a woman tortured by having lighted matches put between her fingers because she would not or could not tell where a conventicle was being held  i did not indeed see the last deed actually done else would i have cut down the coward who did it  the poor thing had fainted and the torture was over when i came upon them  only two days ago i was ordered out with a party who pillaged the house of a farmer because he refused to take an oath of allegiance which seems to have been purposely so worded as to make those who take it virtually bondslaves to the king and which makes him master of the lives properties and consciences of his subjectsand all this done in the kings name and by the kings troops  an what pairt did you tak in these doins asked glendinning with some curiosity  i did my best to restrain my comrades and when they were burning the hayricks throwing the meal on the dunghill and wrecking the property of the farmer i cut the cords with which they had bound the poor fellow to his chair and let him go free  did onybody see you do that  i believe not though i should not have cared if they had  im thoroughly disgusted with the service  i know little or nothing of the principles of these rebelsthese fanatics as you call thembut tyranny or injustice i cannot stand whether practised by a king or a beggar and i am resolved to have nothing more to do with such fiendish work  young man said the swarthy comrade in a voice of considerable solemnity ye hae obviously mistaen your callin  if you werena new to thae pairts ye would ken that the things ye objec to are quite common  punishin an harryin the rebels and fanaticscovenanters they ca theirselshas been gaun on for years ower a the land  in my opeenion its weel deserved an naething that ye can do or say wull prevent it though what ye do an say is no unlikely to cut short yer ain career by means o a rope roond yer thrapple  but losh man i wonder ye haena heard about thae matters afore now  my having spent the last few years of my life in an outoftheway part of ireland may account for that said wallace  my fathers recent death obliged my mother to give up her farm and return to her native town of lanark where she now lives with a brother  poverty and the urgency of a cousin have induced me unfortunately to take service with the dragoons  after what yeve said hoo am i to coont on yer helpin me enoo asked glendinning  as long as i wear the kings uniform you may count on my obeying orders unless i am commanded to break the plainest laws of god answered the young man  as our present business is only to discover the cottage of andrew black there seems likely to be no difficulty between us just now  hm  im no sure o that but if yell tak my advice lad yell haud yer tongue aboot thae matters  if clavers heard the half o what yeve said to me hed send ye into the next warl withoot gieing ye time to say yer prayers  freedom of speech is no permitted at the present time in scotlandunless it be the right kind of speech and  he stopped for at that moment two young girls suddenly appeared at a bend of the road in front of them  they gazed for a moment at the soldiers in evident surprise and then turned as if to fly but glendinning put spurs to his horse and was beside them in a moment leaping to the ground he seized the girls roughly by their arms as they clung together in alarm  one of the two was a darkeyed little child the other was fair unusually pretty and apparently about fifteen or sixteen years of age  the trooper proceeded to question them sharply  be gentle said will wallace sternly as he rode up and also dismounting stood beside them  no fear of their running away now  the swarthy trooper pretended not to hear but nevertheless relaxed his grip and merely rested his hand upon the fair girls shoulder as he said to the other  now my wee doo ye canna be far frae hame is be sworn  whats yer name  aggie wilson answered the child at once  and yours  jean black replied the blonde timidly  oho an yer faithers name is andrew an his hoose is close by ill be bound so yell be guid eneuch to show us the way tillt  but first my bonny lass yell gie me a  slipping his arm round the waist of the terrified blonde the trooper rudely attempted to terminate his sentence in a practical manner but before his lips could touch her face he received a blow from his comrade that sent him staggering against a neighbouring tree  blazing with astonishment and wrath glendinning drew his sword and sprang at his companion who already full of indignation at the memory of what he had been so recently compelled to witness could ill brook the indignity thus offered to the defenceless girl  his weapon flashed from its sheath on the instant and for a few moments the two men cut and thrust at each other with savage ferocity  wallace however was too young and unused to mortal strife to contemplate with indifference the possibility of shedding the blood of a comrade  quickly recovering himself he stood entirely on the defensive which his vigorous activity enabled him easily to do  burning under the insult he had received glendinning felt no such compunctions  he pushed his adversary fiercely and made a lunge at last which not only passed the sword through the left sleeve of the youths coat but slightly wounded his arm  roused to uncontrollable anger by this will wallace fetched his opponent a blow so powerful that it beat down his guard rang like a hammer on his iron headpiece and fairly hurled the man into the ditch at the roadside  somewhat alarmed at this sudden result the youth hastily pulled him out and kneeling beside him anxiously examined his head  much to his relief he found that there was no wound at all and that the man was only stunned  after the examination wallace observed that the girls had taken advantage of the fray to make their escape  indignation and anger having by that time evaporated and his judgment having become cool wallace began gradually to appreciate his true position and to feel exceedingly uncomfortable  he had recklessly expressed opinions and confessed to actions which would of themselves ensure his being disgraced and cast into prison if not worse he had almost killed one of his own comrades and had helped two girls to escape who could probably have assisted in the accomplishment of the duty on which they had been despatched  his case he suddenly perceived was hopeless and he felt that he was a lost man  will wallace was quick of thought and prompt in action  carefully disposing the limbs of his fallen comrade and resting his head comfortably on a grassy bank he cast a hurried glance around him  on his left hand and behind him lay the rich belt of woodland that marked the courses of the rivers cluden and cairn  in front stretched the moors and hills of the ancient district of galloway at that time given over to the tender mercies of graham of claverhouse  beside him stood the two patient troophorses gazing quietly at the prostrate man as if in mild surprise at his unusual stillness  beyond this he could not see with the physical eye but with the mental orb he saw a dark vista of ruined character blighted hopes and dismal prospects  the vision sufficed to fix his decision  quietly like a warriors wraith he sheathed his sword and betook himself to the covert of the peatmorass and the heather hill  he was not the first good man and true who had sought the same shelter  at the time of which we write scotland had for many years been in a woeful plightwith tyranny draining her lifeblood cupidity grasping her wealth hypocrisy and bigotry misconstruing her motives and falsifying her character  charles the second filled the throne unprincipled men alike in church and state made use of their position and power to gain their own ends and enslave the people  the king determined to root out presbytery from scotland as less subservient to his despotic aims and forcibly to impose prelacy on her as a steppingstone to popery had no difficulty in finding ecclesiastical and courtly bravos to carry out his designs and for a long series of dismal years persecution stalked redhanded through the land  happily for the wellbeing of future generations our covenanting forefathers stood their ground with christian heroism for both civil and religious liberty were involved in the struggle  their socalled fanaticism consisted in a refusal to give up the worship of god after the manner dictated by conscience and practised by their forefathers in declining to attend the ministry of the ignorant and too often vicious curates forced upon them and in refusing to take the oath of allegiance just referred to by will wallace  conventicles as they were calledor the gathering together of christians in houses and barns or on the hillsides to worship god were illegally pronounced illegal by the king and council and disobedience to the tyrannous law was punished with imprisonment torture confiscation of property and death  to enforce these penalties the greater part of scotlandespecially the south and west was overrun by troops and treated as if it were a conquered country the peopleholding that in some matters it is incumbent to obey god rather than man and that they were bound not to forsake the assembling of themselves togetherresolved to set the intolerable law at defiance and went armed to the hillmeetings  they took up arms at first however chiefly if not solely to protect themselves from a licentious soldiery who went about devastating the land not scrupling to rob and insult helpless women and children and to shed innocent blood  our scottish forefathers believingin common with the lower animals and lowest savagesthat it was a duty to defend their females and little ones naturally availed themselves of the best means of doing so  about this time a meeting or conventicle of considerable importance was appointed to be held among the secluded hills in the neighbourhood of irongray and andrew black the farmer was chosen to select the particular spot and make the preliminary arrangements  now this man black is not easily described for his was a curiously compound character  to a heart saturated with the milk of human kindness was united a will more inflexible if possible than that of a mexican mule a frame of herculean mould and a spirit in which profound gravity and reverence waged incessant warfare with a keen appreciation of the ludicrous  peacefully inclined in disposition with a tendency to believe well of all men and somewhat free and easy in the formation of his opinions he was very unwilling to resist authority but the love of truth and justice was stronger within him than the love of peace  in company with his shepherd quentin dicka man of nearly his own size and buildandrew black proceeded to a secluded hollow in skeoch hill to gather and place in order the masses of rock which were to form the seats of the communicants at the contemplated religious gatheringwhich seats remain to this day in the position they occupied at that time and are familiarly known in the district as the communion stones of irongray  chapter two  the fanatic and the spy  the night was dark and threatening when andrew black and his shepherd left their cottage and quickly but quietly made for the neighbouring hill  the weather was well suited for deeds of secrecy for gusts of wind with an occasional spattering of rain swept along the hillface and driving clouds obscured the moon which was then in its first quarter  at first the two men were obliged to walk with care for the light was barely sufficient to enable them to distinguish the sheeptrack which they followed and the few words they found it necessary to speak were uttered in subdued tones  jean black and her cousin aggie wilson had reported their rencontre with the two dragoons and quentin dick had himself seen the main body of the troops from behind a heather bush on his way back to the farm therefore caution was advisable  but as they climbed skeoch hill and the moon shed a few feeble rays on their path they began to converse more freely  for a few minutes their intercourse related chiefly to sheep and the work of the farm for both andrew and his man were of that sedate imperturbable nature which is not easily thrown off its balance by excitement or danger  then their thoughts turned to the business in hand  nae fear o the sodgers comin here on a nicht like this remarked andrew as a squall nearly swept the blue bonnet off his head  maybe no growled quentin dick sternly but ive heard frae tam chanter that servants o that papist earl o nithsdale an o the scoondrel sir robert dalziel hae been seen pokin their noses aboot at irongray  if they git wund o the place were no likely to hae a quiet time ot  did ye say that the sodgers illused the bairns  naane o them was inclined to be impident but the ither a guidlookin young felly accordin to jean took their pairt an quarrelled wi his comrade sae that they cam to loggerheeds at last but what was the upshot naebody kens for the bairns took to their heels an left them fechtin  an what if they sud fin yer hoose an the bairns unproteckit asked the shepherd  theyre no likely to fin the hoose in a nicht like this man an if they do theyll fin naebody but ramblin peter there for i gied the lassies an the women strick orders to tak to the hidyhole at the first soond o horses feet  by this time the men had reached a secluded hollow in the hill so completely enclosed as to be screened from observation on all sides they halted here a few moments for two dark forms were seen in the uncertain light to be moving about just in front of them  its them whispered andrew  whae asked the shepherd  alexander mccubine an edward gordon  guid an safe men baith responded quentin ye better gie them a cry  andrew did so by imitating the cry of a plover  it was replied to at once  the stanes are big ye see explained andrew while the two men were approaching  itll tak the strength o the fowr o us to lift some o them  weve got the cairn aboot finished said mccubine as he came up  he spoke in a low voice for although there was no probability of any one being near they were so accustomed to expect danger because of the innumerable enemies who swarmed about the country that caution had almost become a second nature  without further converse the four men set to work in silence  they completed a circular heap or cairn of stones three or four feet high and levelled the top thereof to serve as a table or a pulpit at the approaching assembly  in front of this and stretching towards a sloping brae they arranged four rows of very large stones to serve as seats for the communicants with a few larger stones between them as if for the support of rude tables of plank  it took several hours to complete the work  when it was done andrew black surveyed it with complacency and gave it as his opinion that it was a braw kirk capable o accommodatin a congregation o some thoosands mair or less  then the two men gordon and mccubine bidding him and the shepherd goodnight went away into the darkness from which they had emerged  wharll they be sleepin the nicht asked the shepherd as he and andrew turned homeward  i the peatbog i doot for i daurna tak them hame whan the dragoons is likely to gie us a ca besides the hidyhole wull be ower fu soon noo lad he added as they surmounted a hillock from which they had a dim view of the surrounding country gang ye doon an see if ye can fin oot onything mair aboot thae sodgers  ill awa hame an see that as right there  they parted the shepherd turning sharp off to the right while the farmer descended towards his cottage  he had not advanced above half the distance when an object a little to the left of his path induced him to stop  it resembled a round stone and was too small to have attracted the attention of any eye save one which was familiar with every bush and stone on the ground  grasping a stout thorn stick which he carried andrew advanced towards the object in question with catlike caution until quite close to it when he discovered that it was the head of a man who was sleeping soundly under a whinbush  a closer inspection showed that the man wore an iron headpiece a soldiers coat and huge jackboots  a dragoon and a spy thought andrew while he raised his cudgel the only weapon he carried and frowned  but andrew was a merciful man he could not bring himself to strike a sleeping man even though waking him might entail a doubtful conflict for he could see that the troopers hand grasped the hilt of his naked sword  for a few moments he surveyed the sleeper as if calculating his chances then he quietly dropped his plaid took off his coat and untying his neckcloth laid it carefully on one side over a bush  having made these preparations he knelt beside will wallacefor it was heand grasped him firmly by the throat with both hands  as might have been expected the young trooper attempted to spring up and tried to use his weapon but finding this to be impossible at such close quarters he dropped it and grappled the farmer with all his might but andrew holding on to him like a vice placed his knee upon his chest and held him firmly down  its o nae manner o use to strive ye see said andrew relaxing his grip a little ive gotten ye an if ye like to do my biddin ill no be hard on ye  if you will let me rise and stand before me in fair fight ill do your business if not your bidding returned wallace in a tone of what may be termed stern sulkiness  div ye think its likely ill staund before you in fair fecht as you cadyou wi a swurd and me wi a bit stick my lad  na na yell hae to submit little though ye like it  give me the stick then and take you the sword i shall be content said the indignant trooper making another violent but unsuccessful effort to free himself  its a fair offer said andrew when he had subdued the poor youth a second time an reflecs favourably on yer courage but im a man o peace an have no thirst for bloodshedwhilk is more than ye can say young man but if yell let me tie yer hands thegither an gang peaceably hame wi me is promise that nae mischiefll befa ye  no man shall ever tie my hands together as long as there is life in my body replied the youth  stop stop callant exclaimed andrew as will was about to renew the struggle  the pride o youth is awful  hear what ive gotten to say to ye man or ill hae to throttle ye ootright  itll come to the same thing if yell alloo me to tie ane o my hands to ane o yours  ye canna objec to that surely for ill be your prisoner as muckle as youll be mineand thatll be fair play for well leave the swurd lyin on the brae to keep the bit stick company  well i agree to that said wallace in a tone that indicated surprise with a dash of amusement  an ye promise no to try to get away when youre tied towhen im tied to you  i promise  hereupon the farmer reaching out his hand picked up the black silk neckcloth which he had laid aside and with it firmly bound his own left wrist to the right wrist of his captive talking in a grave subdued tone as he did so  nae doot the promise o a spy is hardly to be lippened to but if i find that yere a dishonourable man yell find that im an uncomfortable prisoner to be tied to  noo git up lad an well gang hame thegither  on rising the first thing the trooper did was to turn and take a steady look at the man who had captured him in this singular manner  weel what dye think o me asked andrew with what may be termed a grave smile  if you want to know my true opinion returned wallace i should say that i would not have thought from the look of you that you could have taken mean advantage of a sleeping foe  ayan i would not have thought from the look o you retorted andrew that ye could hae sellt yersel to gang skulkin aboot the hills as a spy upon the puir craters that are only seekin to worship their maker in peace  without further remark andrew black leaving his coat and plaid to keep company with the sword and stick led his prisoner down the hill  andrews cottage occupied a slight hollow on the hillside which concealed it from every point of the compass save the high ground above it  leading the trooper up to the door he tapped gently and was promptly admitted by some one whom wallace could not discern as the interior was dark  oh uncle andrew  im glad yeve come for peter hasna come back yet an im feared somethin has come ower him  strike a light lassie  ive gotten haud o a spy here an canna weel dot mysel  when a light was procured and held up it revealed the pretty face of jean black which underwent a wondrous change when she beheld the face of the prisoner  uncle andrew she exclaimed this is nae spy  hes the man that cam to the help o aggie an me against the dragoon  is that sae said black turning a look of surprise on his prisoner  it is true indeed that i had the good fortune to protect jean and her friend from an insolent comrade answered wallace and it is also true that that act has been partly the cause of my deserting to the hills being starved for a day and a night and taken prisoner now as a spy  sir said andrew hastily untying the kerchief that bound them together i humbly ask your pardon  moreover its my opeenion that if ye hadna been starvin ye wadna have been here e noo for yere uncommon teuch  rin lassie an fetch some breed an cheese  whars marion an isbl  they went out to seek for peter said jean as she hastened to obey her uncles mandate  at that moment a loud knocking was heard at the door and the voice of marion one of the maidservants was heard outside  on the door being opened she and her companion isabel burst in with excited looks and the information pantingly given that the sodgers were comin  haud yer noise lassie an licht the firepit on the parritch pat come peter lets hear a aboot it  ramblin peter who had been thus named because of his inveterate tendency to range over the neighbouring hills was a quiet undersized saidtobe weakminded boy of sixteen years though he looked little more than fourteen  no excitement whatever ruffled his placid countenance as he gave his reportto the effect that a party of dragoons had been seen by him not half an hour before searching evidently for his masters cottage  theyll soon find it said the farmer turning quickly to his domesticsaway wi ye lassies and hide  the two servantgirls with jean and her cousin aggie wilson ran at once into an inner room and shut the door  ramblin peter sat stolidly down beside the fire and calmly stirred the porridgepot which was nearly full of the substantial scottish fare  noo sir said black turning to will wallace who had stood quietly watching the various actors in the scene just described yer comradesll be here in a wee while  may i ask what ye expect  i expect to be imprisoned at the least more probably shot  hm pleasant expectations for a young man nae doot  im sorry that its oot o my power to stop an see the fun for the sodgers have strange suspicions aboot me so im forced to mak mysel scarce an leave ramblin peter to do the hospitalities o the hoose  but before i gang awa i wad fain repay ye for the guid turn ye did to my bairns  if ye are willin to shut yer eyes an do what i tell ye ill put you in a place o safety  thank you mr black returned wallace of course i shall only be too glad to escape from the consequences of my unfortunate position but do not misunderstand me although neither a spy nor a covenantor i am a loyal subject and would not now be a deserter if that character had not been forced upon me first by the brutality of the soldiers with whom i was banded and then by the insolence of my comradeinarms to your daughter  niece niece interrupted black i wish she was my dauchter bless her bonny face  niver fear sir ive nae doot o yer loyalty though you an yer freends misdoot mine  i claim to be as loyal as the best o ye but theres nae dictionary in this warld that defines loyalty to be slavish submission o body an sowl to a tyrant that fears naether god nor man  the quastion noo is div ye want to escape and wull ye trust me  the sound of horses galloping in the distance tended to quicken the young troopers decision  he submitted to be blindfolded by his captor  noo peter said andrew as he was about to lead wallace away ye ken what to dae  gie them plenty to eat show them the rum bottle let them hae the rin o the hoose an say that i bade ye treat them weel  ay was ramblin peters laconic reply  leading his captive out at the door round the house and reentering by a back door apparently with no other end in view than to bewilder him andrew went into a dark room opened some sort of doorto enter which the trooper had to stoop lowand conducted him down a steep narrow staircase  the horsemen meanwhile had found the cottage and were heard at that moment tramping about in front and thundering on the door for admittance  wallace fancied that the door which closed behind him must be of amazing thickness for it shut out almost completely the sounds referred to  on reaching the foot of the staircase and having the napkin removed from his eyes he found himself in a long low vaulted chamber  there was no one in it save his guide and a venerable man who sat beside a deal table reading a document by the light of a tallow candle stuck in the mouth of a black bottle  the soldiers meanwhile having been admitted by ramblin peter proceeded to question that worthy as to andrew black and his household not being satisfied of the truth of his replies they proceeded to apply torture in order to extract confession  it was the first time that this mode of obtaining information had been used in blacks cottage and it failed entirely for ramblin peter was staunch and although inhumanly thrashed and probed with swordpoints the poor lad remained dumb insomuch that the soldiers at length set him down as an idiot for he did not even cry out in his agoniesexcepting in a curious halfstifled mannerbecause he knew well that if his master were made aware by his cries of what was going on he would be sure to hasten to the rescue at the risk of his life  having devoured the porridge drunk the rum and destroyed a considerable amount of the farmers produce the lawless troopers who seemed to be hurried in their proceedings at that time finally left the place  about the time that these events were taking place in and around blacks cottage bands of armed men with women and even children were hastening towards the same locality to attend the great conventicle for which the preparations already described were being made  the immediate occasion of the meeting was the desire of the parishioners of the reverend john welsh a greatgrandson of john knox to make public avowal at the communion table of their fidelity to christ and their attachment to the minister who had been expelled from the church of irongray but strong sympathy induced many others to attend not only from all parts of galloway and nithsdale but from the distant clyde the shores of the forth and elsewhere so that the roads were crowded with people making for the rendezvoussome on foot others on horseback  many of the latter were gentlemen of means and position who as well as their retainers were more or less well armed and mounted  the reverend john blackadder the auld minister of troqueera noted hero of the covenant who afterwards died a prisoner on the bass rocktravelled with his party all the way from edinburgh and a company of eighty horse proceeded to the meeting from clydesdale  preliminary services conducted by mr blackadder and mr welsh were held near dumfries on the saturday but at these the place of meeting on the sabbath was only vaguely announced as a hillside in irongray so anxious were they to escape being disturbed by their enemies and the secret was kept so well that when the sabbath arrived a congregation of above three thousand had assembled round the communion stones in the hollow of skeoch hill  sentinels were posted on all the surrounding heights  one of these sentinels was the farmer andrew black with a cavalry sword belted to his waist and a rusty musket on his shoulder  beside him stood a tall stalwart youth in shepherds costume  yer ain mother wadna ken ye remarked andrew with a twinkle in his eyes  i doubt that replied the youth a mothers eyes are keen  i should not like to encounter even glendinning in my present guise  as he spoke the rich melody of the opening psalm burst from the great congregation and rolled in softened cadence towards the sentinels  chapter three  the true and the false at work  the face of nature did not seem propitious to the great gathering on skeoch hill  inky clouds rolled athwart the leaden sky threatening a deluge of rain and fitful gusts of wind seemed to indicate the approach of a tempest  nevertheless the elements were held in check by the god of nature so that the solemn services of the day were conducted to a close without discomfort though not altogether without interruption  several of the most eminent ministers who had been expelled from their charges were present on this occasion  besides john welsh of irongray there were arnot of tongland blackadder of troqueer and dickson of rutherglengodly men who had for many years suffered persecution and imprisonment and were ready to lay down their lives in defence of religious liberty  the price set upon the head of that notour traitor mr john welsh dead or alive was 9000 merks  mr arnot was valued at 3000  these preached and assisted at different parts of the services while the vast multitude sat on the sloping hillside and the mounted men drew up on the outskirts of the congregation so as to be within sound of the preachers voices and at the same time be ready for action on the defensive if enemies should appear  andrew black and his companion stood for some time listening with bowed heads to the slow sweet music that floated towards them  they were too far distant to hear the words of prayer that followed yet they continued to stand in reverent silence for some time listening to the soundblack with his eyes closed his young companion gazing wistfully at the distant landscape which from the elevated position on which they stood lay like a magnificent panorama spread out before them  on the left the level lands bordering the rivers cairn and nith stretched away to the solway with the cumberland mountains in the extreme distance in front and on the right lay the wild romantic hillcountry of which in after years it was so beautifully written    o bonnie hills of galloway oft have i stood to see   at sunset hour your shadows fall all darkening on the lea   while visions of the buried years came oer me in their might   as phantoms of the sepulchreinstinct with inward light   the years the years when scotland groaned beneath her tyrants hand   and twas not for the heather she was called the purple land   and twas not for her loveliness her children blessed their god   but for secret places of the hills and the mountain heights   untrod  who was the old man i found in what you call your hidyhole asked wallace turning suddenly to his companion  im no sure that i have a right to answer that said black regarding will with a halfserious halfamused look  hooever noo that yeve taen service wi me and ken about my hidyhole i suppose i may trust ye wi a my secrets  i would not press you to reveal any secrets mr black yet i think you are safe to trust me seeing that you know enough about my own secrets to bring me to the gallows if so disposed  ay i hae ye there lad  but ill trust ye on better grunds than that i believe ye to be an honest man and thats enough for me  weel ye maun ken its saxteen year since i howkit the hidyhole below my hoose an wad ye believe ittheyve no fund it oot yet  not even had a suspeecion ot though the sodgers hae been sair puzzled mony a time aboot hoo i managed to gie them the slip  an monys the puir body baith gentle and simple that ive gien food an shelter to whae was very likely to hae perished o cauld an hunger but for the hidyhole among ithers ive often had the persecuited ministers doon there readin their bibles or sleepin as comfortable as ye like when the dragoons was drinkin roarin an singin like deevils ower their heids  my certies if clavers or sherp or lauderdale had an inklin o the hunderd pairt o the lawbrekin that ive done its a gallows in the gressmarkit as high as hamans wad be ereckit for me an my heed an hauns may be would be bleachin on the nether bow  humph but theyve no gotten me yet  and i sincerely hope they never will remarked wallace but you have not yet told me the name of the old man  i was comin to him continued black but wheniver i wander to the doins o that blackhearted cooncil im like to lose the threed o my discoorse  yon is a great man i the kirk o scotland  they ca him donald cargill  the adventures that puir man has had in the coorse o mair nor quarter o a century wad mak a grand storybuik  he has no fear o man an hes an awfu stickler for justice  ise warrant he gied ye some strang condemnations o the poors that be  indeed he did not said wallace  surely you misjudge his character his converse with me was entirely religious and his chief anxiety seemed to be to impress on me the love of god in sending jesus christ to redeem a wicked world from sin  i tried to turn the conversation on the state of the times but he gently turned it round again to the importance of being at peace with god and giving heed to the condition of my own soul  he became at last so personal that i did not quite like it  yet he was so earnest and kind that i could not take offence  ay ay said black in a musing tone i see  he clearly thinks that yer hert needs mair instruction than yer heed  hm maybe hes right hooever hes a wonderfu man gangs aboot the country preachin everywhere altho he kens that the sodgers are aye on the lookoot for him an that if they catch him its certain death  he wad have been at this communion nae doot if he hadna engaged to preach somewhere near sanquhar this vera day  then he has left the hidyhole by this time i suppose  ye may be sure o that for when there is work to be done for the master donal cargill doesna let the gress grow under his feet  im sorry that i shall not see him again returned the extrooper in a tone of regret for i like him much  now while this conversation was going on a portion of the troop of dragoons which had been out in search of andrew black was sent under glendinning now a sergeant in quest of an aged couple named mitchell who were reported to have entertained intercommuned iúeú outlawed persons attended conventicles in the fields ventured to have family worship in their cottages while a few neighbours were present and to have otherwise broken the laws of the secret council  this council which was ruled by two monsters in human form namely archbishop sharp of saint andrews and the duke of lauderdale having obtained full powers from king charles the second to put down conventicles and enforce the laws against the fanatics with the utmost possible rigour had proceeded to carry out their mission by inviting a host of half if not quite savage highlanders to assist them in quelling the people  this host numbering with 2000 regulars and militia about 10000 men eagerly accepted the invitation and was let loose on the south and western districts of scotland about the beginning of the year and for some time ravaged and pillaged the land as if it had been an enemys country  they were thanked by the king for so readily agreeing to assist in reducing the covenanters to obedience to us and our laws and were told to take up free quarters among the disaffected to disarm such persons as they should suspect to carry with them instruments of torture wherewith to subdue the refractory and in short to act very much in accordance with the promptings of their own desires  evidently the mission suited these men admirably for they treated all parties as disaffected with great impartiality and plundered tortured and insulted to such an extent that after about three months of unresisted depredation the shame of the thing became so obvious that government was compelled to send them home again  they had accomplished nothing in the way of bringing the covenanters to reason but they had desolated a fair region of scotland spilt much innocent blood ruined many families and returned to their native hills heavily laden with booty of every kind like a victorious army  it is said that the losses caused by them in the county of ayr alone amounted to over 11000 pounds sterling  the failure of this horde did not in the least check the proceedings of sharp or lauderdale or their likeminded colleagues  they kept the regular troops and militia moving about the land enforcing their idiotical and wicked laws at the point of the sword  we say idiotical advisedly for what could give stronger evidence of mental incapacity than the attempt to enforce a bond upon all landed proprietors obliging themselves and their wives children and servants as well as all their tenants and cottars with their wives children and servants to abstain from conventicles and not to receive assist or even speak to any forfeited persons intercommuned ministers or vagrant preachers but to use their utmost endeavours to apprehend all such  those who took this bond were to receive an assurance that the troops should not be quartered on their landsa matter of considerable importancefor this quartering involved great expense and much destruction of property in most cases and absolute ruin in some  after the battle of the pentland hills in 1666 in which the covenanters driven to desperation made an unsuccessful effort to throw off the tyrannical yoke severer laws were enacted against them  their wily persecutor also being well aware of the evil influence of disagreement among men threw a bone of contention among them in the shape of royal acts of indulgence as they were styled by which a certain number of the ejected ministers were permitted to preach on certain conditions but only within their own parishes  to preach at a separate meeting in a private house subjected the minister to a fine of 5000 merks about 278 pounds  to preach in the fields was to incur the penalty of death and confiscation of property  and these arbitrary laws were not merely enacted for intimidation  they were rigorously enforced  the curates in many cases became mere spies and government informers  many of the best men in the land laid down their lives rather than cease to proclaim the gospel of love and peace and goodwill in jesus christ  of course their enemies set them down as selfwilled and turbulent fanatics  it has ever been and ever will be thus with men who are indifferent to principle  they will not as well as cannot understand those who are ready to fight and if need be die for truth their unspoken argument seems to be you profess to preach peace love submission to authority etcetera very good stand to your principles  leave all sorts of carnal fighting to us  obey us conform humbly to our arrangements whatever they are and all will be well but dare to show the slightest symptom of restiveness under what you style our injustice tyranny cruelty etcetera and we will teach you the submission which you preach but fail to practise by means of fire and sword and torture and death  many good men and true with gentle spirits and it may be somewhat exalted ideas about the rights of royalty accepted the indulgence as being better than nothing or better than civil war  no doubt also there were a fewneither good men nor truewho accepted it because it afforded them a loophole of escape from persecution  similarly on the other side there were good men and true who with bolder hearts perhaps and clearer brains it may be refused the indulgence as a presumptuous enactment which cut at the roots of both civil and religious liberty as implying a right to withhold while it professed to give and which if acquiesced in would indicate a degree of abject slavery to man and unfaithfulness to god that might sink scotland into a condition little better than that of some eastern nations at the present day  thus was the camp of the covenanters divided  there were also more subtle divisions which it is not necessary to mention here and in both camps of course there was an infusion especially amongst the young men of that powerful elementlove of excitement and danger for their own sake with little if any regard to principle which goes far in all ages to neutralise the efforts and hamper the energies of the wise  besides the acts of indulgence another and most tyrannical measure already mentioned had been introduced to crush if possible the presbyterians  letters of intercommuning were issued against a great number of the most distinguished presbyterians including several ladies of note by which they were proscribed as rebels and cut off from all society  a price amounting in some instances to 500 pounbds sterling was fixed on their heads and every person not excepting their nearest of kin was prohibited from conversing with or writing to them or of aiding with food clothes or any other necessary of life on pain of being found guilty of the same crimes as the intercommuned persons  the natural result of such inhuman laws was that men and women in hundreds had to flee from their homes and seek refuge among the dens and caves of the mountains where many were caught carried off to prison tried tortured and executed while of those who escaped their foes numbers perished from cold and hunger and disease brought on by lying in damp caves and clefts of the rocks without food or fire in all weathers  the fines which were exacted for socalled offences tempted the avarice of the persecutors and tended to keep the torch of persecution aflame  for example sir george maxwell of newark was fined a sum amounting to nearly 8000 pounds sterling for absence from his parish church attendance at conventicles and disorderly baptismsiúeú for preferring his own minister to the curate in the baptizing of his children  hundreds of somewhat similar instances might be given  up to the time of which we write 1678 no fewer than 17000 persons had suffered for attending field meetings either by fine imprisonment or death  such was the state of matters when the party of dragoons under command of sergeant glendinning rode towards the mitchells cottage which was not far from blacks farm  the body of soldiers being too small to venture to interrupt the communion on skeoch hill glendinning had been told to wait in the neighbourhood and gather information while his officer captain houston went off in search of reinforcements  theres the auld sinner himsel cried the sergeant as the party came in sight of an old whitehaired man seated on a knoll by the side of the road  hallo  jock mitchell is that you  come doon here directly i want to speak tye  the old man being stone deaf and having his back to the road was not aware of the presence of the dragoons and of course took no notice of the summons  dye hear shouted the sergeant savagely for he was ignorant of the old mans condition  still mitchell did not move  glendinning whose disposition seemed to have been rendered more brutal since his encounter with wallace drew a pistol from his holster and presented it at mitchell  answer me he shouted again or yere a deed man  mitchell did not move  there was a loud report and next moment the poor old man fell dead upon the ground  it chanced that ramblin peter heard the report though he did not witness the terrible result for he was returning home from the mitchells cottage at the time after escorting jean black and aggie wilson thither  the two girls having been forbidden to attend the gathering on skeoch hill had resolved to visit the mitchells and spend the sabbath with them  peter had accompanied them and spent the greater part of the day with them but feeling the responsibility of his position as the representative of andrew black during his absence had at last started for home  a glance over a rising ground sufficed to make the boy turn sharp round and take to his heels  he was remarkably swift of foot  a few minutes brought him to the cottage door which he burst open  the sodgers is comin grannie  he so styled the old woman though she was no relation  did ye see my auld man  no  away wi ye bairns said mrs mitchell quickly but quietly  oot by the back door an doon the burnside theyll niver see ye for the busses  but grannie we canna leave you here alone remonstrated jean with an anxious look  an i can fecht remarked peter in a low voice that betrayed neither fear nor excitement  the sodgers can do nae harm to me returned the old woman firmly do my bidding bairns  be aff i say  there was no resisting mrs mitchells word of command  hastening out by the back door just as the troopers came in sight peter and his companions diving into the shrubbery of the neighbouring streamlet made their way to blacks farm by a circuitous route  there the girls took shelter in the house locking the door and barring the windows while peter diverging to the left made for the hills like a hunted hare  andrew was standing alone at his post when the lithe runner came in sight  will wallace had left him by that time and was listening entranced to the fervid exhortations of dickson of rutherglen  the sodgers gasped peter as he flung himself down to rest  comin this way lad  na  theyre at the mitchells  a safe at the ferm asked andrew quickly  ay i saw the lasses into the hoose  rin to the meetin an gie the alarm  tell them to send wallace an quentin here wi sax stoot menweel airmedan anither sentry for im gaun awa  almost before the sentence was finished ramblin peter was up and away and soon the alarming cry arose from the assembly the dragoons are upon us  instantly the clydesdale men mounted and formed to meet the expected onset  the men of nithsdale were not slow to follow their example and gordon of earlstoun a tried and skilful soldier put himself at the head of a large troop of galloway horse  four or five companies of foot also well armed got ready for action and videttes and single horsemen were sent out to reconnoitre  thus in a moment was this assembly of worshippers transformed into a band of christian warriors ready to fight and die for their families and liberties  but the alarm as it turned out was a false one  glendinning informed by spies of the nature of the gathering was much too sagacious a warrior to oppose his small force to such overwhelming odds  he contented himself for the present with smaller game  after continuing in the posture of defence for a considerable time the assembly dispersed those who were defenceless being escorted by armed parties to the barns and cottages around  as they retired from the scene the windows of heaven were opened and the rain which had been restrained all day came down in torrents and sent the cairn and cluden red and roaring to the sea  but long before this dispersion took place andrew black with quentin dick will wallace ramblin peter and six sturdy young men armed with sword gun and pistol had hurried down the hill to succour the mitchells if need be and see to the welfare of those who had been left behind in the farm  chapter four  the hunting and harrying displayed  being ignorant as we have said of the cruel murder of old mitchell ramblin peters report had not seriously alarmed black  he concluded that the worst the troopers would do would be to rob the poor old couple of what money they found in their possession oblige them to take the oath of supremacy drink the health of king and bishops and otherwise insult and plunder them  knowing the mitchells intimately he had no fear that their opposition would invite severity  being very fond of them however he resolved at the risk of his life to prevent as far as possible the threatened indignity and plunder  theyre a douce auld pair he remarked to will wallace as they strode down the hillside together quiet an peaceable wi naething to speak o in the way of opeenionssomethin like myselan willin to letbe for letbe  but since the country has been owerrun by thae hielanders an sodgers theyve had little peace and the auld man has gien them a heap o trouble for hes as deaf as a post  peter says the pairty o dragoons is a sma ane so i expect the sight o usll scare them away an prevent fechtin  it may be so said wallace and of course i shall not fail you in this attempt to protect your old friends but to tell you the truth i dont quite like this readiness on the part of you covenanters to defy the laws however bad they may be and to attack the kings troops  the bible which you so often quote inculcates longsuffering and patience  hm there speaks yer ignorance returned the farmer with a dash of cynicism in his tone  hoo mony years think ye are folk to submit to tyranny an wrang an fierce oppression for nae sin whatever against the laws o god or the land  are twunty thretty or forty years no enough to warrant oor claim to langsufferin  does submission to lawbrekin on the pairt o government an langcontinued highhanded oppression frae king courtier an prelate accompanied wi barefaced plunder and murderdoes that no justifiee oor claim to patience  to a this the covenanters hae submitted for mony weary years withoot rebellion except maybe in the metter o the pentlands when a wheen o us were driven to desperation  but i understand your feelins lad for im a man o peace by natur an would gladly submit to injustice to keep things quietif possable but some things are no possable an the bible itsel says were to live peaceably wi a men only as much as in us lies  the extrooper was silent  although ignorant of the full extent of maddening persecution to which not merely the covenanters but the people of scotland generally had been subjected his own limited experience told him that there was much truth in what his companion said still like all loyalhearted men he shrank from the position of antagonism to government  i agree with you he said after a few minutes thought but i have been born i suppose with a profound respect for law and legally constituted authority  div ye think lad returned black impressively that naebodys been born wi a high respec for law but yersel  i suppose ye admit that the king is bound to respec the law as weel as the people  of course i do  i am no advocate of despotism  weel then continued the farmer with energy in the year saxteen fortyane an at ither times kings an parliaments hae stamped the covenants o scotland as bein pairt o the law o this landwhereby freedom o conscience an presbyterian worship are secured to us a an here comes chairles the second an breks the law by sendin that scoondrel the duke o lauderdale here wi full poors to dae what he likesan middleton a man wi nae heart an less conscience that was raised up frae naething to be a noble nae less  my word nobles are easy made but theyre no sae easy unmade  an this lauderdale maks a cooncil wi airchbishop sherpa traiter and a turncoatan a wheen mair like himsel and they send sodgers oot ower the land to eat us up an cram prelacy doon oor throats an curates into oor poopits whether we wull or no  an that though chairles himsel signed the covenant at the time he was crooned  ca ye that law or legally constituted authority  although deeply excited by this brief recital of his countrys wrongs black maintained the quiet expression of feature and tone of voice that were habitual to him  further converse on the subject was interrupted by their arrival at the farm where they found all right save that jean and aggie were in a state of tearful anxiety about their poor neighbours  while the farmer was seeing to the security of his house and its arrangements preparatory to continuing the march to the mitchells cottage the rest of the party stood about the front door conversing will wallace was contemplating jean black with no little admiration as she moved about the house  there was something peculiarly attractive about jean  a winsome air and native grace with refinement of manner unusual in one of her station would have stamped her with a powerful species of beauty even if she had not possessed in addition a modest look and fair young face  the extrooper was questioning in a dreamy way whether he had ever before seen such a pretty and agreeable specimen of girlhood when he experienced a shock of surprise on observing that jean had gone to a neighbouring spring for water and was making something very like a signal to him to follow her  the surprise was mingled with an uncomfortable feeling of regret for the action seemed inconsistent with the maidens natural modesty  forgie me sir she said for being so bold but oh sir if ye knew how anxious i am about uncle black ye would understandhe is wanted so much an theres them in the hidyhole that would fare ill if he was taken to prison just now  ifyewould  well jean said will sympathising with the struggle it evidently cost the girl to speak to himdont hesitate to confide in me  what would you have me do  only to keep him back frae the sodgers if ye can  hes such an awfu man to fecht when hes roosed that hes sure to kill some o them if hes no killed himsel  an itll be ruin to us a an to the mitchells too if  she was interrupted at this point by black himself calling her name  trust me said wallace earnestly i understand what you wish and will do my best to prevent evil  a grateful look was all the maidens reply as she hurried away  our heros perplexity as to how this promise was to be fulfilled was however needless for on reaching the mitchells hut it was found that the troopers had already left the place but the state of things they had left behind them was enough to stir deeply the pity and the indignation of the party  everything in confusionbroken furniture meal and grain scattered on the floor open chests and cupboardstold that the legalised brigands had done their worst  poor mrs mitchell had objected to nothing that they said or did or proposed to her  she feebly drank the health of king and prelates when bidden to do so and swore whatever testoaths they chose to apply to her till they required her to admit that the king was lord over the kirk and the conscience  then her spirit fired and with a firm voice she declared that no king but christ should rule over her kirk or conscienceto which she boldly added that she had attended conventicles and would do so again  having obtained all they wanted the dragoons went away leaving the old woman among the ruins of her home for they probably did not consider it worth while carrying off a prisoner who would in all likelihood have died on the road to prison  in the midst of all the noise and confusion it had struck the old woman as strange that they never once asked about her husband  after they had gone however the arrival of two neighbours bearing his dead body revealed the terrible reason  she uttered no cry when they laid his corpse on the floor but sat gazing in horror as if turned to stone thus black and his friends found her  she could not be roused to speak and looked after a few minutes like one who had not realised the truth  in this state she was conveyed to blacks cottage and handed over to jean whom every one seemed intuitively to regard as her natural comforter  the poor child led her into her own room sat down beside her on the bed laid the aged head on her sympathetic bosom and sobbed as if her heart was breaking  but no response came from the old woman save that once or twice she looked up feebly and said jean dear what ails ye  in the council chamber at edinburgh lauderdale learning on one occasion that many persons both high and low had refused to take the bond already referred to which might well have been styled the bond of slavery bared his arm in fury and smiting the table with his fist swore with a terrific oath that he would force them to take the bond  what we have described is a specimen of the manner in which the force was sometimes applied  the heartless despot and his clerical coadjutors had still to learn that tyranny has not yet forged the weapon that can separate man from his god  what think ye noo asked andrew black turning to wallace with a quiet but stern look after old mrs mitchell had been carried in what think ye noo lad o us covenanters an oor lack o langsufferin an oor defyin the laws  arent these laws we ought to defy but havena properly defied yet laws illegally made by a perjured king and an upstart cooncil  mr black said the extrooper seizing his companions hand with an iron grip from this day forward i am with youheart and soul  little did wallace think when he came to this decision that he had still stronger reason for his course of action than he was aware of at the moment  it was night when mrs mitchell was brought into the farmhouse and preparations were being made for a hasty meal when ramblin peter came in with the news that a number of people in the lanarkshire district had been intercommuned and driven from their homesamongst others david spence will wallaces uncle with whom his mother had taken up her abode  the distracted looks of poor wallace on hearing this showed the powerful effect the news had upon him  keep yersel quiet noo said black in an encouraging tone as he took the youths arm and led him out of the house  these are no times to let our hearts rin awa wi oor heids  yer mither must be looked after but i the meantime let me tell ye that yer uncle daavid is a douce cliver felly an fears naething i this warld  if he did he wadna be amang the intercommuned  be sure hes no the man to leave his sister maggie in trouble  of course yell be wantin to be aff to look after her  of courseinstantly said wallace  na  yell hae yer supper firstan a guid ainfor yell need it have patience noo an listen to me for ill do the very best i can for ye in this straitan its no muckle ye can do for yersel withoot help  there was something so decided yet kindly and reassuring in the farmers tone and manner that wallace felt relieved in spite of his anxieties and submitted to his guidance in all things  black then explained that he had a friend in lanark who owed him money on lambs sold to him the previous year that he meant to send his man quentin dick first to collect that money and then proceed to edinburgh for the purpose of making further arrangements there about cattle  noo continued black ive gotten a mither as weel as you an she lives in the canlemaker raw close to the greyfriars kirkyairdwhere they signed the covenants ye ken  weel i wad advise you to gang to lanark wi quentin an when ye find yer mither tak her to edinbro an let her live wi my mither i the meantime till we see what the lord has in store for this puir persecuted remnant  im sorry to pairt wi ye lad sae unexpectedly but in thae times when folk are called on to pairt wi their heids unexpectedly we mauna compleen  ill take your advice gladly said wallace  when will quentin dick be ready to start  in less than an hour  the moonll be up soon after that  its o nae use startin on sae dark a nicht till shes up for yell hae to cross some nasty grund  noo lad though im no a minister my advice to ye is to gang doon into the hidyhole an pray aboot this matter  niver mind the folk ye find there  theyre used to prayin  its my opeenion that if there was less preachin an mair prayin wed be a the better for t  its a thrawn warld we live in but were bound to mak the best ot  although not much in the habit of engaging in prayersave at the formal periods of morning and eveningour extrooper was just then in the mood to take his friends advice  he retired to the place of refuge under blacks house where he found several people who had evidently been at the communion on skeoch hill  these were engaged in earnest conversation and took little notice of him as he entered  the place was very dimly lighted  one end of the low vaulted chamber was involved in obscurity  thither the youth went and knelt down  from infancy his mother had taught him to say his prayers and had sought to induce him to pray  it is probable that the first time he really did so was in that secret chamber where in much anxiety of soul he prayed for herself  after a hasty but hearty supper he and quentin dick set out on their night journey  they carried nothing with them except two wallets filled as wallace could not help thinking with a needlessly large amount of provisions  of course they were unarmed for they travelled in the capacity of peaceful drovers with plaids on their shoulders and the usual staves in their hands  one would think we were going to travel for a month in some wilderness to judge from the weight of our haversacks observed wallace after trudging along for some time in silence  maybe well be langer than a month returned quentin ann the wulderness hereaway is warse than the wulderness that moses led his folk through  they had manna there  mony o us hae naething here  quentin dick spoke with cynicism in his tone for he was a stern straightforward man on whom injustice told with tremendous power and who had not yet been taught by adversity to bow his head to man and restrain his indignation  before wallace had time to make any rejoinder something like the appearance of a group of horsemen in front arrested them  they were still so far distant as to render their tramp inaudible  indeed they could not have been seen at all in so dark a night but for the fact that in passing over the crest of a hill they were for a moment or two dimly defined against the sky  dragoonsfowr o them muttered quentin  well step aside here an let them gang by  clambering up the somewhat rugged side of the road the two men concealed themselves among the bushes intending to wait till the troopers should pass  what can they be doing in this direction i wonder whispered wallace  my freend answered quentin dinna whisper when yere hidin  of a the sounds for attractin attention an revealin secrets a whisper is the warst  speak low if ye maun speak but sometimes its wiser no to speak ava  dootless the sodgersll be giein andrew black a ca but he kens brawly hoo to tak care o himsel  when the horseman approached it was seen that they were driving before them a boy or lad on foot  evidently they were compelling him to act as their guide  its ramblin peter theyve gotten haud o as sure as im a leevin man said the shepherd with a low chuckle id ken him amang a thoosand by the way he rins  shall we not rescue him exclaimed wallace starting up  wheesht keep still man  nae fear o peter  hell lead them in amang the bogs o some peatmoss or ither gie them the slip there an leave them to find their way oot  just as the troop trotted past an incident occurred which disconcerted the hiders not a little  a dog which the soldiers had with them scented them stopped and after snuffing about for a few seconds began to bark furiously  the troop halted at once and challenged  tak nae notice remarked quentin in a low voice which went no farther than his comrades ear  a bright flash and sharp report followed the challenge and a ball whistled through the thicket  ay fire away soliloquised quentin  ye seldom hit when ye can see its no likely yell dae muckle better i the dark  the dog however having discovered the track of the hidden men rushed up the bank towards them  the shepherd picked up a stone and waiting till the animal was near enough flung it with such a true aim that the dog went howling back to the road  on this a volley from the carbines of the troopers cut up the bushes all around them  thatll dae noo  come awa wull said the shepherd rising and proceeding farther into the thicket by a scarce visible footpath  the horses canna follow us here unless they hae the legs an airms o puggies  as for the men theyd have to cut a track to let their big boots pass  we may tak it easy for theyre uncommon slow at loadin  in a few minutes the two friends were beyond all danger  returning then to the road about a mile farther on they continued to journey until they had left the scene of the great communion far behind them and when day dawned they retired to a dense thicket in a hollow by the banks of a little burn and there rested till near sunset when the journey was resumed  that night they experienced considerable delay owing to the intense darkness  towards dawn the day following quentin dick led his companion into a wild thicklywooded place which seemed formed by nature as a place of refuge for a hunted creaturewhether man or beast  entering the mouth of what seemed to be a cavern he bade his companion wait  presently a sound as of the cry of some wild bird was heard it was answered by a similar cry in the far distance  soon after the shepherd returned and taking his companion by the hand led him into the cave which a few paces from its mouth was profoundly dark  almost immediately a glimmering light appeared  a few steps farther and wallace found himself in the midst of an extraordinary scene  the cavern at its inner extremity was an apartment of considerable size and the faint light of a few lanterns showed that the place was clouded by smoke from a low fire of wood that burned at the upper end  here standing seated and reclining were assembled all sorts and conditions of mensome in the prime and vigour of life some bowed with the weight of years others both young and old gaunt and haggard from the influence of disease and suffering and many giving evidence by their aspect that their days on earth were numbered  some by the stern contraction of brow and lip seemed to suggest that submission was the last thought that would enter their minds but not a few of the party wore that look of patient endurance which is due to the influence of the spirit of godnot to mere human strength of mind and will  all seemed to be famishing for want of food while ragged clothes shaggy beards hollow cheeks and unkempt locks told eloquently of the long years of bodily and mental suffering which had been endured under ruthless persecution  chapter five  risks and refuges  immediately on entering the cave in which this party of covenanters had found a temporary shelter will wallace learned the reason of the large supply of provisions which he and his comrade had carried  ive brought this for ye frae andrew black said quentin taking the wallet from his shoulder and presenting it to a man in clerical costume who advanced to welcome him  he thought ye might stand in need o victuals  ever thoughtful of his friends i thank him heartily said the minister accepting the walletas also that handed to him by wallace andrew is a true helper of the persecuted and i thank the lord who has put it into his heart to supply us at a time when our provisions are wellnigh exhausted  our numbers have been unexpectedly increased by the arrival of some of the unfortunates recently expelled from lanark  from lanark echoed wallace as he glanced eagerly round on the forlorn throng  can you tell me sir if a mr david spence and a mrs wallace have arrived from that quarter  i have not heard of them returned the minister as he emptied the wallets and began to distribute their contents to those around himah here is milkim glad our friend black thought of that for we have a poor dying woman here who can eat nothing solid  here webster take it to her  with a sudden sinking at the heart wallace followed the man to whom the milk had been given  might not this dying woman he thought be his own mother  true he had just been told that no one with her name had yet sought refuge there but there was a bare possibility andanxiety does not reason  as he crossed to a spot where several persons were bending over a couch of straw a tremendous clap of thunder shook the solid walls of the cavern  this was immediately followed by a torrent of rain the plashing of which outside suggested that all the windows of heaven had been suddenly opened  the incident was natural enough in itself but the anxious youth took it as a bad omen and trembled as he had never before trembled at the disturbances of nature  one glance however sufficed to relieve his mind  the dying woman was young delicate of constitution by nature long exposure to damp air in caves and cold beds on the ground with bad and insufficient food had sealed her doom  lying there with hollow cheeks eyes closed and lips deathly pale it seemed as if the spirit had already fled  oh my ain lizzie cried a poor woman who knelt beside her  wheesht mither whispered the dying woman slowly opening her eyes it is the lords doingshall not the judge of a the earth do right well understand it a some dayfor ever wi the lord  the last words were audible only to the mothers ear  food for the body even if it could have availed her came too late  another moment and she was in the land where hunger and thirst are unknownwhere the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest  the mourners were still standing in silence gazing on the dead when a loud noise and stamping of feet was heard at the entrance of the cave turning round they saw several drenched and haggard persons enter among them a man supportingalmost carryinga woman whose drooping figure betokened great exhaustion  thank you o thank you iim better now said the woman looking up with a weary yet grateful expression at her protector  will wallace sprang forward as he heard the voice  mother mother he cried and next moment he had her in his arms  the excitement coupled with extreme fatigue was almost too much for the poor woman  she could not speak but with a sigh of contentment allowed her head to fall upon the broad bosom of her son  accustomed as those hunted people were to scenes of suffering wild despair and sometimes though not often to bursts of sudden joy this incident drew general attention and sympathyexcept indeed from the mother of the dead woman whose poor heart was for the moment stunned several womenone of whom was evidently a lady of some position crowded to wills assistance and conveyed mrs wallace to a recess in the cave which was curtained off  here they gave her food and changed her soaking garments  meanwhile her brother david spencea grandlooking old man of gentle manners and refined mindgave his nephew an account of the manner in which they had been driven from their home  what is the matter with your hands uncle asked will observing that both were bandaged  they tried the thumbscrews on me said spence with a pitiful smile glancing at his injured members  they wanted to force me to sign the bond which i declined to dofirst because it required me to perform impossibilities and second because it was such as no government in the world has a right to exact or freeman to sign  they were going to put the boot on me at first but the officer in command ordered them to try the thumbscrews  this was lucky for a man may get along with damaged thumbs but it would have been hard to travel with crippled legs  i held out though until the pain became so great that i couldnt help giving a tremendous yell  this seemed to touch the officer with pity for he ordered his men to let me be  soon afterwards your mother and i managed to give them the slip and we came on here  but why came you here uncle asked will  because i dont want to be taken to edinburgh and hanged  besides after hearing of your temporary settlement with black i thought the safest place for your mother would be beside yourself  when wallace explained the cause of his own journey and the condition of the district around blacks farm the plans of david spence had to be altered  he resolved after consideration and prayer to take to the mountains and remain in hiding while mrs wallace should go to edinburgh as already planned and live with mrs black  but it will never do to take her along with yourself will said spence  she cannot walk a step farther  we must try to get her a horse and let her journey along with some o the armed bands that attended the conventicle at skeoch hill  they will be sure to be returning this way in a day or two  you are right said the minister who has already been introduced and who overheard the concluding remark as he came forward  the armed men will be passing this way in a day or two and we will take good care of your mother young sir while she remains with us  just so rejoined spence  ill see to that so nephew you and your comrade quentin may continue your journey with easy minds  youll need all your caution to avoid being taken up and convicted for the tyrants are in such a state of mind just now that if a man only looks independent they suspect him and there is but a short road between suspicion and the gallows now  humph well be as innocentlookin an submissive as bairns remarked quentin dick with a grim smile on his lips and a frown on his brow that were the reverse of childlike  convinced that spences arrangement for his mothers safety was the best in the circumstances wallace left her though somewhat reluctantly in the care of the outlawed covenanters and resumed his journey with the shepherd after a few hours rest  proceeding with great caution they succeeded in avoiding the soldiers who scoured the country until towards evening while crossing a rising ground they were met suddenly by two troopers  a thicket and bend in the road had up to that moment concealed them from view  level grassfields bordered the road on either side so that successful flight was impossible  wull ye fecht asked quentin in a quick subdued voice  of course i will returned wallace  ca canny at first then  be humble an awfu meek till i say noo  the troopers were upon them almost as soon as this was uttered  ho my fine fellows exclaimed one of them riding up to quentin with drawn sword fanatics ill be bound  where from and where away now  we come honoured sir frae irongray an were gaun to ednbury t buy cattle answered quentin with downcast eyes  indeed oho then you must needs have the cash wherewith to buy the cattle  where is it  in ma pooch said the shepherd with a deprecating glance at his pocket  hand it over then my good fellow  fanatics are not allowed to have money or to purchase cattle nowadays  but honoured sir were no fannyteeks  were honest shepherds  the lamblike expression of quentin dicks face as he said this was such that wallace had considerable difficulty in restraining an outburst of laughter despite their critical position  he maintained his gravity however and firmly grasped his staff which like that of his companion was a blackthorn modelled somewhat on the pattern of the club of hercules  here melville said the first trooper hold my horse while i ease this honest shepherd of his purse  sheathing his sword he drew a pistol from its holster and handing the reins to his companion dismounted  noo exclaimed quentin bringing his staff down on the troopers iron headpiece with a terrific thwack  like a flash of lightning the club of wallace rang and split upon that of the other horseman who fell headlong to the ground  strong arms have seldom occasion to repeat a welldelivered blow  while the soldiers lay prone upon the road their startled horses galloped back the way they had come  thats unfortnit said quentin  thae twa look like an advancegaird an if so the main bodyll no be lang o gallopin up to see whats the maitter  it behoves us to rin  the only port of refuge that appeared to them as they looked quickly round was a clump of trees on a ridge out of which rose the spire of a church  the kirks but a puir sanctuary nooadays remarked the shepherd as he set off across the fields at a quick run but its oor only chance  they had not quite gained the ridge referred to when the danger that quentin feared overtook them  a small company of dragoons was seen galloping along the road  we may gain the wood before they see us suggested will wallace  if it was a wud i wadna care for the sodgers replied his comrade but its only a bit plantation  well jist mak for the manse an hide if we can i the coalhole or some place  as he spoke a shout from the troopers told that they had been seen and several of them leaving the road dashed across the field in pursuit  now it chanced that at that quiet evening hour the young curate of the district the reverend frank selby was enjoying a game of quoits with a neighbouring curate the reverend george lawless on a piece of ground at the rear of the manse  the reverend frank was a genial lowlander of the muscular type  the reverend george was a renegade highlandman of the cadaverous order  the first was a harumscarum young pastor with a beasjollyasyoucan spirit and had accepted his office at the recommendation of a relative in power  the second was a meanspirited wolf in sheeps clothing who like his compatriot archbishop sharp had sold his kirk and country as well as his soul for what he deemed some personal advantage  as may well be supposed neither of those curates was a shining light in the ministry  missed again  i find it as hard to beat you lawless as i do to get my parishioners to come to church exclaimed the reverend frank with a goodhumoured laugh as his quoit struck the ground and having been badly thrown rolled away  thats because you treat your quoits carelessly as you treat your parishioners returned the reverend george as he made a magnificent throw and ringed the tee  bravo thats splendid exclaimed selby  not bad returned lawless  you see you want more decision with the throwas with the congregation  if you will persist in refusing to report delinquents and have them heavily fined or intercommuned you must expect an empty church  mine is fairly full just now and i have weeded out most of the incorrigibles  i will never increase my congregation by such means and i have no wish to weed out the incorrigibles rejoined selby becoming grave as he made another and a better throw  at that moment our fugitive shepherds dashing round the corner of the manse almost plunged into the arms of the reverend frank selby  they pulled up panting and uncertain how to act  you seem in haste friends said the curate with an urbane smile  oot o the fryinpan into the fire growled quentin grasping his staff and setting his teeth  if you will condescend to explain the fryingpan i may perhaps relieve you from the fire said selby with emphasis  wallace observed the tone and grasped at the forlorn hope  the dragoons are after us sir he said eagerly unless you can hide us we are lost  if you are honest men interrupted the reverend george lawless with extreme severity of tone and look you have no occasion to hide  bub were not honest men interrupted quentin in a spirit of almost hilarious desperation were fannyteeksrebelscovenantersborn eediots  then observed lawless with increasing austerity you richly deserve  george said the reverend frank sharply you are in my parish just now and i expect you to respect my wishes  throw your plaids sticks and bonnets behind that bush my ladswell out of sightso  now cast your coats and join us in our game  the fugitives understood and swiftly obeyed him  while they were hastily stripping off their coats selby took his brother curate aside and looking him sternly in the face saidnow george lawless if you by word or look interfere with my plans i will give you cause to repent it to the latest day of your life  if any one had seen the countenance of the reverend george at that moment he would have observed that it became suddenly clothed with an air of meekness that was by no means attractive  at the time we write of any curate might with the assistance of the soldiers fine whom he pleased and as much as he pleased or he might by reporting a parishioner an absentee from public worship consign him or her to prison or even to the gallows  but though all the curates were in an utterly false position they were not all equally depraved selby was one who felt more or less of shame at the contemptible part he was expected to play  when the troopers came thundering round the corner of the manse a few minutes later quentin dick in his shirt sleeves was in the act of making a beautiful throw and will wallace was watching him with interest  even the reverend george seemed absorbed in the game for he felt that the eyes of the reverend frank were upon him  excuse me gentlemen said the officer in command of the soldiers did you see two shepherds run past here  no answered the reverend frank with a candid smile i saw no shepherds run past here  strange returned the officer they seemed to enter your shrubbery and to disappear near the house  did you see the path that diverges to the left and takes down to the thicket in the hollow asked selby  yes i did but they seemed to have passed that when we lost sight of them  let me advise you to try it now said selby  i will replied the officer wheeling his horse round and galloping off followed by his men  now friends i have relieved you from the fire as i promised said the reverend frank turning to the shepherds see that you dont get into the fryingpan again  whether you deserve hanging or not is best known to yourselves  to say truth you dont look like it but judging from appearance i should think that in these times youre not unlikely to get it  on with your coats and plaids and be off as fast as you canover the ridge yonder  in less than halfanhour youll be in denmans dean where a regiment of cavalry would fail to catch you  we shall never forget you  there there interrupted the reverend frank be off  the troopers will soon return  ive seen more than enough of hanging quartering and shooting to convince me that presbytery is not to be rooted out nor prelacy established by such means  be off i say  thus urged the fugitives were not slow to avail themselves of the opportunity and soon were safe in denmans dean  now lawless said the reverend frank in a cheerful tone my conscience which has been depressed of late feels easier this evening let us go in to supper and remember that no one knows about this incident except youand i  so theres no chance of its going further  the two rebels know it suggested lawless  no they dont replied the other airily  they have quite forgotten it by this time and even if it should recur to memory their own interest and gratitude would seal their lipsso were quite safe you and i quite safecome along  our travellers met with no further interruption until they reached edinburgh  it was afternoon when they arrived and entering by the road that skirts the western base of the castle rock proceeded towards the grassmarket  pushing through the crowd gathered in that celebrated locality quentin and wallace ascended the steep street named candlemaker row which led and still leads to the high ground that has since been connected with the high street by george the fourth bridge  about halfway up the ascent they came to a semicircular projection which encroached somewhat on the footway  it contained a stair which led to the interior of one of the houses  here was the residence of mrs black the mother of our friend andrew  the good woman was at home busily engaged with her knitting needles when her visitors entered  a glance sufficed to show wallace whence andrew black derived his grave quiet selfpossessed character as well as his powerful frame and courteous demeanour  she received quentin dick to whom she was well known with a mixture of goodwill and quiet dignity  ive brought a freend o mr blacks to bide wi ye for a wee while if ye can take him in said quentin introducing his young companion as wull wallace  im prood to receive an welcome ony freend o my boy andry returned the good woman with a slight gesture that would have become a duchess  ay an yer son wants ye to receive wallaces mither as weel  shell likely be here in a day or twa  shes been sair persecooted of late puir body for shes a staunch upholder o the covenants  there have been several covenants in scotland the most important historically being the national covenant of 1638 and the solemn league and covenant of 1643  it was to these that quentin referred and to these that he and the great majority of the scottish people clung with intense almost superstitious veneration and well they might for these covenantswhich some enthusiasts had signed with their bloodcontained nearly all the principles which lend stability and dignity to a people such as a determination to loyally stand by and defend the king and the liberties and laws of the kingdom to have before the eyes the glory of god the advancement of the kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ the honour and happiness of the king and his posterity as well as the safety and peace of the people to preserve the rights and privileges of parliament so that arbitrary and unlimited power should never be suffered to fall into the hands of rulers and to vindicate and maintain the liberties of the subjects in all these things which concern their consciences persons and estates  in short it was a testimony for constitutional government in opposition to absolutism  such were the principles for which mrs black contended with a resolution equal if not superior to that of her stalwart son so that it was in a tone of earnest decision that she assured her visitors that nothing would gratify her more than to receive a woman who had suffered persecution for the sake o the master an the covenants  she then ushered wallace and quentin dick into her little parloura humble but neatly kept apartment the back window of whicha hole not much more than two feet squarecommanded a view of the tombstones and monuments of greyfriars churchyard  chapter six  tells of overwhelming reverses  mrs black was a woman of sedate character and considerable knowledge for her station in lifeespecially in regard to scripture  like her son she was naturally grave and thoughtful with a strong tendency to analyse and to inquire into the nature and causes of things  unlike andrew however all her principles and her creed were fixed and well definedat least in her own mind for she held it to be the bounden duty of every christian to be ready at all times to give a reason for the hope that is in him as well as for every opinion that he holds her natural kindness was somewhat concealed by slight austerity of manner  she was seated one evening plying her ever active needle at the same small window which overlooked the churchyard  the declining sun was throwing dark shadows across the graves  a ray of it gleamed on a corner of the particular tombstone which being built against her house slightly encroached upon her window  no one was with the old woman save a large cat to whom she was in the habit of addressing occasional remarks of a miscellaneous nature as if to relieve the tedium of solitude with the fiction of intercourse  ay pussie she said ye may weel wash yer face an purr for theres nae fear o you bein dragged before airchbishop sherp to hae yer thoombs screwed or yer legs squeezed in the  she stopped abruptly for heavy footsteps were heard on the spiral stair and next moment will wallace entered  well mrs black he said sitting down in front of her its all settled with bruce  im engaged to work at his forge and have already begun business  so i see an ye look businesslike answered the old woman with a very slight smile and a significant glance at our heros costume  a considerable change had indeed taken place in the personal appearance of will wallace since his arrival in edinburgh for in place of the shepherds garb with which he had started from the bonnie hills of galloway he wore the leathern apron and other habiliments of a blacksmith  moreover his hair had been allowed to grow in luxuriant natural curls about his head and as the sun had bronzed him during his residence with black and a young beard and moustache had begun to assert themselves in premature vigour his whole aspect was that of a grand heroic edition of his former self  yes the moment i told your friend said wallace that you had sent me to him and that i was one of those who had good reason to conceal myself from observation he gave me a hearty shake of the hand and accepted my offer of service all the more that having already some knowledge of his craft i did not require teaching  so he gave me an apron and set me to work at once  i came straight from the forge just as i left off work to see what you would think of my disguise  yell do yell do returned mrs black with a nod of approval  yer face an hands need mair washin than my pussie gies her nose  but wheesht  i hear a fit on the stair  itll be quentin dick  i sent him oot for a red herrin or twa for supper  as she spoke quentin entered with a brown paper parcel the contents of which were made patent by means of scent without the aid of sight  the shepherd seemed a little disconcerted at sight of a stranger for as wallace stood up the light did not fall on his face but a second glance sufficed to enlighten him  no that bad he said surveying the metamorphosed shepherd but i doot yer auld friends the dragoons wad sune see through tconsiderin yer size an the soond o yer voice  so saying he proceeded to place the red herrings on a gridiron as if he were the recognised cook of the establishment  presently bruce himselfmrs blacks friend the blacksmithmade his appearance and the four were soon seated round a supper of oatcakes mashed potatoes milk and herring  for some time they discussed the probability of wallace being recognised by spies as one who had attended the conventicle at irongray or by dragoons as a deserter then as appetite was appeased they diverged to the lamentable state of the country and the highhanded doings of the privy council  the airchbishop cam to the toon this mornin remarked mrs black so therell be plenty o torterin gaun on  i fear youre right said bruce who having sojourned a considerable time in england had lost much of his northern language and accent that horrible instrument the boot was brought this very morning to my smiddy for repair  they had been so hard on some poor wretch i suppose that they broke part of it but i put a flaw into its heart that will force them to be either less cruel or to come to me again for repairs  hm if ye try thae pranks ower often theyll find it oot said quentin  sherp is weel named and if he suspects what yeve done yell get a taste of the buit yersel  the hatred with which by far the greater part of the people of scotland regarded archbishop sharp of saint andrews is scarcely a matter of wonder when the mans character and career is considered  originally a presbyterian and minister of crail he was sent to court by his brethren and countrymen as their advocate and agent and maintained there at their expense for the express purpose of watching over the interests of their church  sharp not only betrayed his trust but went over to what might well at that time be described as the enemy and secretly undermined the cause which he was bound in honour to support finally he threw off all disguise and was rewarded by being made archbishop of saint andrews and primate of scotland  this was bad enough but the new prelate not satisfied with the gratification of his ambition became after the manner of apostates a bitter persecutor of the friends he had betrayed  charles the second who was indolent incapable and entirely given over to selfindulgence handed over the affairs of scotland to an unprincipled cabal of laymen and churchmen who may be fittingly described as drunken libertines  by these menof whom middleton lauderdale and sharp were the chiefall the laws passed in favour of presbytery were rescinded new tyrannical laws such as we have elsewhere referred to were enacted and ruthlessly enforced prelacy was established the presbyterian church was laid in ruins and all who dared to question the righteousness of these transactions were pronounced rebels and treated as such  there was no impartial tribunal to which the people could appeal  the king who held presbyterianism to be unfit for a gentleman cared for none of these things and even if he had it would have mattered little for those about him took good care that he should not be approached or enlightened as to the true state of affairs in scotland  sharp himself devised and drafted a new edict empowering any officer or sergeant to kill on the spot any armed man whom he found returning from or going to a conventicle and he was on the point of going to london to have this edict confirmed when his murderous career was suddenly terminated  in the days of james the sixth and charles the first the bishops although forced on the scottish church and invested with certain privileges were subject to the jurisdiction of the general assembly but soon after charles the second mounted the throne ecclesiastical government was vested entirely in their hands and all the ministers who refused to recognise their usurped authority were expelled  it was in 1662 that the celebrated act was passed by middleton and his colleagues in glasgow college  it provided that all ministers must either submit to the bishops or remove themselves and families out of their manses churches and parishes within a month  it was known as the drunken act of glasgow owing to the condition of the legislators four hundred brave and true men left their earthly all at that time rather than violate conscience and forsake god  their example ultimately saved the nation from despotism  the archbishop of saint andrews was chief in arrogance and cruelty among his brethren  he afterwards obtained permission to establish a high commission court in scotlandin other words an inquisitionfor summarily executing all laws acts and orders in favour of episcopacy and against recusants clergy and laity  it was under this authority that all the evil deeds hitherto described were done and of this commission sharp was constant president  it may be well to remark here that the prelacy which was so detested by the people of scotland was not english episcopacy but scotch prelacy it was in truth little better at that time than popery disguiseda sort of confused religiopolitical popery of which system the king was selfconstituted pope while his unprincipled minions of the council were cardinals  no wonder then that at the mere mention of sharps name mrs black shook her head sorrowfully bruce the blacksmith frowned darkly and quentin dick not only frowned but snorted vehemently and smote the table with such violence that the startled pussie fled from the scene in dismay  save us a  quentin said mrs black yell surely be hanged or shot if ye dinna learn to subdue yer wrath  subdue my wrath wumman exclaimed the shepherd grinding his teeth if ye had seen the half o what ive seen ye wadbut ye ken maist naething aboot it  gie me some mair tatties an mulk itll quiet me maybe  in order that the reader may know something of one of the things about which mrs black as well as quentin dick himself was happily ignorant at that time we must change the scene once more to the neighbourhood of andrew blacks cottage  it was early in the day and the farmer was walking along the road that led to cluden ford bent on paying a visit to dumfries when he was overtaken by a troop of about twenty horsemen  they had ridden out of the bush and come on the road so suddenly that black had no time to secrete himself  knowing that he was very much wanted especially after the part he had played at the recent conventicle on skeoch hill he at once decided that discretion was the better part of valour and took to his heels  no man in all the countryside could beat the stout farmer at a race either short or long but he soon found that four legs are more than a match for two  the troopers soon gained on him though he ran like a mountain hare  having the advantage however of a start of about three hundred yards he reached the bend in the road where it begins to descend towards the ford before his pursuers overtook him  but andrew felt that the narrow strip of wood beside which he was racing could not afford him shelter and that the ford would avail him nothing  in his extremity he made up his mind to a desperate venture  on his right an open glade revealed to him the dark gorge through which the cluden thundered  the stream was in flood at the time and presented a fearful aspect of seething foam mingled with black rocks as it rushed over the lynn and through its narrow throat below  a path led to the brink of the gorge which is now spanned by the routen bridge from the sharpedged cliff on one side to the equally sharp cliff on the other was a width of considerably over twenty feet  towards this point andrew black sped  close at his heels the dragoons followed glendinning on a superb horse in advance of the party  it was an untried leap to the farmer who nevertheless went at it like a thunderbolt and cleared it like a stag  the troopers behind seeing the nature of the ground pulled up in time and wheeling to the left made for the ford  glendinning however was too late  the reckless sergeant enraged at being so often baulked by the farmer had let his horse go too far  he tried to pull up but failed  the effort to do so rendered a leap impossible  so near was he to the fugitive that the latter was yet in the midst of his bound when the former went over the precipice head foremost horse and all  the poor steed fell on the rocks below and broke his neck but the rider was shot into the deep dark pool round which the cluden whirled in foamflecked eddies  in the midst of its heaving waters he quickly arose flinging his long arms wildly about and shouting for help with bubbling cry  the iron helm jackboots and other accoutrements of a seventeenth century trooper were not calculated to assist flotation  glendinning would have terminated his career then and there if the flood had not come to his aid by sweeping him into the shallow water at the lower end of the pool whence some of his men soon after rescued him  meanwhile andrew black plunging into the woods on the opposite side of the river was soon far beyond the reach of his foes  but escape was not now the chief anxiety of our farmer and selfishness formed no part of his character  when he had left home a short time before his niece jean was at work in the dairy ramblin peter was attending to the cattle marion clark and her comrade isabel scott were busy with domestic affairs and old mrs mitchellwho never quite recovered her reasonwas seated in the chimney corner calmly knitting a sock  to warn these of their danger was now the urgent duty of the farmer for well he knew that the disappointed soldiers would immediately visit his home  indeed he saw them ride away in that direction soon afterwards and started off to forestall them if possible by taking a short cut glendinning had borrowed the horse of a trooper and left the dismounted man to walk after them  but there was no particularly short cut to the cottage and in spite of andrews utmost exertions the dragoons arrived before him  not however before the wary peter had observed them given the alarm got all the inmates of the farmincluding mrs mitchelldown into the hidyhole and established himself in the chimney corner with a look of imbecile innocence that was almost too perfect  poor peter his heart sank when the door was flung violently open and there entered a band of soldiers among whom he recognised some of the party which he had so recently led into the heart of a morass and so suddenly left to find their way out as they best could  but no expression on peters stolid countenance betrayed his feelings  so my young bantam cock exclaimed a trooper striding towards him and bending down to make sure weve got hold of you at last  eh exclaimed peter interrogatively  youre a precious scoundrel arent you continued the trooper  ay responded peter  i told you the lad was an idiot said a comrade  the remark was not lost upon the boy whose expression immediately became still more idiotic if possible  tell me said glendinning grasping peter savagely by one ear where is your master  i dinna ken sir  is there nobody in the house but you  naebody but me said peter an you he added looking vacantly round on the soldiers  now look ee here lad im not to be trifled with said the sergeant  where are the rest of your household hidden  answer quick  peter looked into the sergeants face with a vacant stare but was silent  glendinning whose recent misfortune had rendered him unusually cruel at once knocked the boy down and kicked him then lifting him by the collar and thrusting him violently into the chair repeated the question but received no answer  changing his tactics he tried to cajole him and offered him money but with similar want of success  hand me your swordbelt cried the sergeant to a comrade  with the belt he thrashed peter until he himself grew tired but neither word nor cry did he extract and again flinging him on the floor he kicked him severely  heres a rope sergeant said one of the men at this point and theres a convenient rafter  a lad that wont speak is not fit to live  nay hanging is too good for the brute said glendinning drawing a pistol from his belt  tie a cloth over his eyes  peter turned visibly paler while his eyes were being bandaged and the troopers thought that they had at last overcome his obstinacy but they little knew the heroic character they had to deal with  now said the sergeant resting the cold muzzle of his weapon against the boys forehead at the word three your brains are on the floor if you dont tell me where your people are hidonetwo  stop sergeant let him have a taste of the thumbscrews before you finish him off suggested one of the men  so be itfetch them  the horrible instrument of torture was brought  it was constantly used to extract confession from the poor covenanters during the long years of persecution of that black period of scottish history  peters thumbs were placed in it and the screw was turned  the monsters increased the pressure by slow degrees repeating the question at each turn of the screw  at first peter bore the pain unmoved but at last it became so excruciating that his cheeks and lips seemed to turn grey and an appalling shriek burst from him at last  talk of devils  the history of the human race has proved that when men have deliberately given themselves over to highhanded contempt of their maker there is not a devil among all the legions in hell who could be worse he might be cleverer he could not be more cruel  the only effect of the shriek upon glendinning was to cause him to order another turn of the screw  happily at the moment the shriek was uttered andrew black arrived and finding the troophorses picketed outside with no one apparently to guard them he looked in at the window and saw what was going on  with a fierce roar of mingled horror surprise and rage he sprang into the room and his huge fist fell on the brow of glendinning like the hammer of thor  his left shot full into the face of the man who had worked the screws and both troopers fell prone upon the floor with a crash that shook the building  the act was so quick and so overpoweringly violent that the other troopers were for a moment spellbound  that moment sufficed to enable black to relieve the screws and set peter free  cway oot lad after me cried andrew darting through the doorway for he felt that without more space to fight he would be easily overpowered  the dragoons recovering darted after him  the farmer caught up a huge flail with which he was wont to thresh out his oats it fell on the headpiece of the first trooper causing it to ring like an anvil and stretching its owner on the ground  the second trooper fared no better but the head of the flail broke into splinters on his iron cap and left andrew with the stump only to continue the combat this however was no insignificant weapon and the stout farmer laid about him with such fierce rapidity as to check for a few moments the overwhelming odds against him  pistols would certainly have been used had not glendinning recovering his senses staggered out and shouted take him alive men  this was quickly done for two troopers leaped on andrew behind and pinioned his arms while he was engaged with four in front  the four sprang on him at the same instant  even then andrew blacks broad backwhich was unusually upproved too strong for them for he made a sort of plunging somersault and carried the whole six along with him to the ground  before he could rise however more troopers were on the top of him  samson himself would have had to succumb to the dead weight  in a few seconds he was bound with ropes and led into the house  ramblin peter had made a bold assault on a dragoon at the beginning of the fray but could do nothing with his poor maimed hands and was easily secured  let him taste the thumbscrews growled glendinning savagely and pointing to black  dae yer warst ye born deevil said black recklesslyfor oppression driveth even a wise man mad  very goodfetch the boot said the sergeant  the instrument of torture was brought and affixed to the farmers right leg the wedge was inserted and a blow of the mallet given  blacks whole visage seemed to darken his frowning brows met and his lips were compressed with a force that meant endurance unto the death  at that moment another party of dragoons under captain houston galloped up the captain entered and stopping the proceedings of his subordinate ordered black and peter to be set on horseback and bound together  fire the place he added  if there are people in it anywhere that will bring them out  oh dear gasped peter the hidy  wheesht bairn said black in a low voice  theyre safe enough  the firell no touch them an besides theyre in the lords hands  a few minutes more and the whole farmsteading was in flames  the dragoons watched the work of destruction until the roof of the cottage fell in then mounting their horses they descended to the road with the two prisoners and turned their faces in the direction of edinburgh  chapter seven  more than one narrow escape  one day about a week after the burning of blacks farm a select dinnerparty of redhot rebelsas government would have styled them persecuted people as they called themselvesassembled in mrs blacks little room in candlemaker row  their looks showed that their meeting was not for the purpose of enjoyment  the party consisted of mrs black mrs wallace who had reached edinburgh in company with her brother david spence jean black will wallace quentin dick and jock bruce the blacksmith  but i canna understand lassie said mrs black to jean hoo ye werena a roasted alive i the hidyhole or suffocated at the best an hoo did ye ever get oot wi the ruckle o burning rafters abune ye  it was easy enough answered the girl for uncle andry made the roof o the place uncommon thick an theres a short tunnel leadin to some bushes by the burn that let us oot at a place that canna be seen frae the hoose  but oh granny dinna ask me to speak aboot thae things for they may be torturin uncle andry at this vera moment  are you sure it was him ye saw she added turning to bruce  quite sure replied the smith  i chanced to be passing the tolbooth at the moment the door opened  a party of the city guard suddenly came out with black in the midst and led him up the high street  im sure theyll torture him said the poor girl while the tears began to flow at the dreadful thought  they stick at naethin now  i think said will wallace in a tone that was meant to be comforting that your uncle may escape the torture for the archbishop does not preside at the council today  i hear that he has gone off suddenly to saint andrews  that wont serve your uncle much remarked bruce sternly for some of the other bishops are nigh as bad as sharp and with that raving monster lauderdale among them theyre likely not only to torture but to hang him for he is well known and has been long and perseveringly hunted  in his indignation the smith did not think of the effect his foreboding might have on his friends mother but the sight of her pale cheeks and quivering lips was not lost upon wallace whose sympathies had already been stirred deeply not only by his regard for black but also by his pity for tenderhearted jean  by heaven he exclaimed starting up in a sudden burst of enthusiasm if you will join me friends i am quite ready to attempt a rescue at once  a sort of pleased yet halfcynical smile crossed the grave visage of quentin dick as he glanced at the youth  hoots man sit doon he said quietly ye micht as weel try to rescue a kid frae the jaws o a lion as rescue andry black frae the fangs o lauderdale an his crew  but something may be dune when theyre takin him back to the tolboothif yere a wullin to help  we mak full twuntyfour feet amangst us an oor shoothers are braid  im ready said david spence in the quiet tone of a man who usually acts from principle  an so am i cried bruce smiting the table with the fist of a man who usually acts from impulse  while wallace calmed his impatient spirit and sat down to hatch a plot with his brother conspirators a strange scene was enacting in the council chamber where the perjured prelates and peers were in the habit of practising cruelty oppression and gross injustice under the name of law  they sat beside a table which was covered with books and parchments  in front of them seated on a chair with his arms pinioned was andrew black  his face was pale and had a careworn look but he held his head erect and regarded his judges with a look of stern resolution that seemed to exasperate them considerably  on the table lay a pair of brassmounted thumbscrews and beside them the strangelooking instrument of torture called the boot  in regard to these machines there is a passage in the privy council records which gives an idea of the spirit of the age about which we write  it runs thus whereas the boots were the ordinary way to explicate matters relating to the government and there is now a new invention and engine called the thumbkins which will be very effectual to the purpose aforesaid the lords ordain that when any person shall by their order be put to the torture the said boots and thumbkins be applied to them as it shall be found fit and convenient  lauderdale on this occasion found it fit and convenient to apply the torture to another man in the presence of black in order that the latter might fully appreciate what he had to expect if he should remain contumacious  the poor man referred to had not been gifted with a robust frame or a courageous spirit  when asked however to reveal the names of some comrades who had accompanied him to a fieldpreaching he at first loyally and firmly refused to do so  then the boot was applied  it was a wooden instrument which enclosed the foot and lower limb of the victim  between it and the leg a wedge was inserted which when struck repeatedly compressed the limb and caused excruciating agony  in some cases this torture was carried so far that it actually crushed the bone causing blood and marrow to spout forth  it was so in the case of that wellknown martyr of the covenant hugh mckail not long before his execution  the courage of the poor man of whom we now write gave way at the second stroke of the mallet and at the third uttering a shriek of agony he revealed in short gasps the names of all the comrades he could recall let us not judge him harshly until we have undergone the same ordeal with credit  a look of intense pity overspread the face of andrew black while this was going on  his broad chest heaved and drops of perspiration stood on his brow  he had evidently forgotten himself in his strong sympathy with the unhappy martyr  when the latter was carried out in a half fainting condition he turned to lauderdale and frowning darkly said  thou meeserable sinner cheeld o the deevil an enemy o a righteousness div ee think that your bloodstained haund can owerturn the cause o the lord  this speech was received with a flush of anger quickly followed by a supercilious smile  we shall see  get the boot ready there  now sir turning to black answer promptlywill you subscribe the oath of the kings supremacy  nothat i wull not  i acknowledge nae king ower my conscience but the king o kings  as for that perjured libertine on the throne for whom theres muckle need to pray i tell ye plainly that i consider the freedom and welfare o scotland stands higher than the supposed rights o king and lords  ye misca us rebels  if ye ken the history o yer ain countrywhilk i misdootye would ken that the parliaments o baith scotland an england have laid it doon in declaration and in practice that resistance to the exercise o arbitrary power is lawfu therefore resistance to chairles and you his shameless flunkeys is nae mair rebellion than its rebellion in a cat to flee in the face o a bulldoug that wants to worry her kittens  against the tyrant that has abused his trust an upset oor constitution an broken a the laws o god and man i count it to be my bounden duty to fecht wi swurd an lip as langs i hae an airm to strike an a tongue to wag  noo ye may dae yer warst  at a signal the executioner promptly fitted the boot to the bold mans right leg  blacks look of indignant defiance passed away and was replaced by an expression of humility that strangely enough seemed rather to intensify than diminish his air of fixed resolve  while the instrument of torture was being arranged he turned his face to the bishop of galloway who sat beside lauderdale silently and sternly awaiting the result and with an almost cheerful air and quiet voice said  god has for his ain wise ends made the heart o the puir man that has just left us tender an hes made mine teuch but tak notice thou wolf in sheeps clothing that its no upon its teuchness but upon the speerit o the lord that i depend for grace to withstand on this evil day  strike said the duke in a low stern voice  the mallet fell the wedge compressed the strong limb and andrew compressed his lips  again  a second time the mallet fell but no sign did the unhappy man give of the pain which instantly began to shoot through the limb  after a few more blows the duke stayed the process and reiterated his questions but black took no notice of him whatever  large beads of sweat broke out on his brow  these were the only visible signs of suffering unless we except the deathly pallor of his face  again said the merciless judge  the executioner obeyed but the blow had been barely delivered when a loud snap was heard and the tortured man experienced instant relief jock bruces little device had been successful the instrument of torture was broken  thanks be to thy name o god for grace to help me thus far said black in a quiet tone  fix on the other boot cried lauderdale savagely for the constancy as well as the humility of the martyr exasperated him greatly  the executioner was about to obey when a noise was heard at the door of the council chamber and a cavalier booted and spurred and splashed with mud as if he had ridden fast and far strode hastily up to the duke and whispered in his ear  the effect of the whisper was striking for an expression of mingled surprise horror and alarm overspread for a few moments even his hard visage  at the same time the bishop of galloway was observed to turn deadly pale and an air of consternation generally marked the members of council  murderedin cold blood muttered the duke as if he could not quite believe the newsand perhaps realised for the first time that there were others besides the archbishop of saint andrews who richly deserved a similar fate  hastily ordering the prisoner to be removed to the tolbooth he retired with his infamous companions to an inner room  the wellknown historical incident which was thus announced shall receive but brief comment here  there is no question at all as to the fact that sharp was unlawfully killed that he was cruelly slain without trial and without judicial condemnation by a party of covenanters  nothing justifies illegal killing  the justice of even legal killing is still an unsettled question but one which does not concern us just now  we make no attempt to defend the deed of those men  it is not probable that any average christian whether in favour of the covenanters or against them would justify the killing of an old man by illegal means however strongly he might hold the opinion that the old man deserved to die  in order to form an unprejudiced opinion on this subject recourse must be had to facts  the following are briefly the facts of the case  a merchant named william carmichael formerly a bailie of edinburgh was one of sharps favourites and one of his numerous commissioners for suppressing conventicles in fife  he was a licentious profligate greedy of money and capable of undertaking any job however vile  this mans enormities were at last so unbearable that he became an object of general detestation and his excessive exactions had ruined so many respectable lairds owners and tenants that at last nine of these who had been outlawed interdicted the common intercourse of society and hunted like wild beasts on the mountains resolved since all other avenues of redressing their unjust sufferings were denied them to take the law into their own hands and personally chastise carmichael accordingly hearing that the commissioner was hunting on the moors in the neighbourhood of cupar they rode off in search of him  they failed to find him and were about to disperse when a boy brought intelligence that the coach of archbishop sharp was approaching  baffled in their previous search and smarting under the sense of their intolerable wrongs the party regarded this as a providential deliverance of their archenemy into their hands  here was the chief cause of all their woes the man who more almost than any other had been instrumental in the persecution and ruin of many families in the torture and death of innumerable innocent men and women and the banishment of some of their nearest and dearest to perpetual exile on the plantations where they were treated as slaves  they leaped at the sudden and unexpected opportunity  they reasoned that what had been done in the past and was being done at the time would continue to be done in the future for there was no symptom of improvement but rather of increasing severity in the government and ecclesiastics  overtaking the coach which contained the prelate and his daughter they stopped it made archbishop sharp step out and slew him there on magus moor  it was a dark unwarrantable deed but it was unpremeditated and necessarily unknown at first to any but the perpetrators so that it would be inexcusably unfair to saddle it upon the great body of the covenanters who as far as we can ascertain from their writings and opinions condemned it although naturally they could not but feel relieved to think that one of their chief persecutors was for evermore powerless for further evil and some of them refused to admit that the deed was murder  they justified it by the case of phinehas  a better apology lies in the text oppression maketh a wise man mad  this event had the effect apparently of causing the council to forget our friends black and ramblin peter for a time for they were left in the tolbooth for about three weeks after that whereat andrew was much pleased for it gave his maimed limb time to recover  as peter remarked gravely its an ill wund that blaws naebody guid  a robust and earnest nation cannot be subdued by persecution  the more the council tyrannised over and trampled upon the liberties of the people of scotland the more resolutely did the lealhearted and brave among them resist the oppressors  it is ever thus  it ever should be thus for while an individual man has a perfect right if he chooses to submit to tyranny on his own account he has no right to stand tamely by and see gross oppression and cruelty exercised towards his family and neighbours and country  at least if he does so he earns for himself the character of an unpatriotic poltroon  true patriotism consists in a readiness to sacrifice onesself to the national wellbeing  as far as things temporal are concerned the records of the scottish covenanters prove incontestably that those longtried men and women submitted with unexampled patience for full eightandtwenty years to the spoiling of their goods and the ruin of their prospects but when it came to be a question of submission to the capricious will of the king or loyalty to jesus christ thousands of them chose the latter alternative and many hundreds sealed their testimony with their blood  when at last the question arose shall we consent to the free preaching of the gospel being suppressed altogether or shall we assert our rights at the point of the sword there also arose very considerable difference of opinion among the covenanters  many of those who held the peaceatalmostanyprice principle counselled submission  others such as richard cameron donald cargill and thomas douglas who believed in the right of selfdefence and in such a text as smite a scorner and the simple will beware advocated the use of carnal weapons for protection alone although when driven to desperation they were compelled to go further  some of the ejected ministers such as blackadder and welsh professed to be undecided on this point and leant to a more or less submissive course  matters were now hastening to a crisis  a lawless government had forced a lawabiding people into the appearance though not the reality of rebellion  the bands of armed men who assembled at conventicles became so numerous as to have the appearance of an army  the council exasperated and alarmed sent forth more troops to disperse and suppress these though they had been guilty of no act of positive hostility  at this crisis cargill and his friends the ultracovenanters as they were styled resolved to publish to the world their testimony to the cause and truth which they defended and against the sins and defections of the times  they chose the 29th of may for this purpose that being the anniversary of the kings birth and restoration  led by robert hamilton a small party of them rode into the royal burgh of rutherglen and there after burning various tyrannical actsas their adversaries had previously burnt the covenantsthey nailed to the cross a copy of what is now known as the declaration of rutherglen in which all their grievances were set forth  the news of this daring act spread like wildfire and the notorious graham of claverhouse was sent to seize kill and destroy all who took any part in this business  how claverhouse went with his disciplined dragoons seized john king chaplain to lord cardross with about fourteen other prisoners in passing through hamilton tied them in couples drove them before the troops like sheep attacked the covenanters at drumclog received a thorough defeat from the undisciplined rebels who freed the prisoners and sent the dragoons back completely routed to glasgow is matter of history  while these stirring events were going on our friend andrew black and ramblin peter were languishing in the unsavoury shades of the tolbooth prison  one forenoon andrew was awakened from an uneasy slumber  they bade him rise  his arms were bound with a rope and he was led up the canongate towards the wellremembered council chamber in company with ramblin peter who owing to his size and youth was not bound but merely held in the grasp of one of the guards  at the mouth of one of the numerous closes which lead down to the cowgate and other parts of the old town stood will wallace quentin dick david spence and jock bruce each armed with a heavy blackthorn bruce had been warned by a friendly turnkey of what was pendinghence their opportune presence  as soon as the prison party was opposite the close the rescue party made a united rushand the united rush of four such strapping fellows was worth seeing  so thought the crowd and cheered  so thought not the city guard four of whom went down like ninepins  blacks bonds were cut and himself hurried down the close almost before the guard had recovered from the surprise  no doubt that guard was composed of brave men but when they met two such lions in the mouth of the close as wallace and quentinfor these two turned at baythey paused and levelled their pikes  turning these aside like lightning the lions felled their two foremost adversaries  the two who followed them met a similar fate  thinking that four were sufficient to block the entry at least for a few moments our heroes turned unlionlike and fled at a pace that soon left the enemy far behind  this delay had given time to black and his other friends to make good their retreat  meanwhile ramblin peter taking advantage of the confusion wrenched himself suddenly free from the guard who held him and vanished down another close  the rescue having been effected the party purposely scattered  blacks leg however prevented him from running fast  he therefore thought it best to double round a corner and dash into a doorway trusting to having been unobserved  in this however he was mistaken  his enemies indeed saw him not but ramblin peter chanced to see him while at some distance off and made for the same place of refuge  springing up a spiral stair three steps at a time black did not stop till he gained the attics and leaped through the open doorway of a garret where he found an old woman wailing over a bed on which lay the corpse of a man with a coffin beside it  what want ye here demanded the old creature angrily  wow wumman im hard pressed  theyre at my heels said black looking anxiously at the skylight as if meditating a still higher flight  are ye ane o the persecuted remnant asked the woman in a changed tone  ay that am i  hide then hide manhaste ye  where asked the perplexed fugitive  there said the woman removing the coffin lid  andrew hesitated  just then hurrying footsteps were heard on the stair  he hesitated no longer  stepping into the coffin he lay down and the woman covered him up  oh wumman said black lifting the lid a little tak care ye dinna meddle wi the screwnails  they may  wheesht  haud yer tongue growled the woman sharply and reclosed the lid with a bang just as ramblin peter burst into the room  what want ye here callant  peter drew back in dismay  im lookin fori was thinkindid ee see a man  the lid of the coffin flew off as he spoke and his master sprang out  man peter gasped the farmer yours is the sweetest voice ive heard for mony a day  i verily thocht i was doomedbut come awa lad thank ee kindly auld wife for the temporary accommodation  the intruders left as abruptly as they had entered  that night the whole party was reassembled in mrs blacks residence in candlemaker row where over a supper o parritch an soor mulk andrew black heard from jock bruce all about the declaration of rutherglen and the defeat of claverhouse by the covenanters at drumclog  the thundercloods are gatherin said black with a grave shake of the head as the party broke up and were about to separate for the night tak my word for t well hear mair o this afore lang  we need scarcely add that on this occasion andrew was a true prophet  chapter eight  bothwell bridge  matters had now come to such a pass that it was no longer possible to defer the evil day of civil war  persecuted inhumanly and beyond endurance with every natural avenue of redress closed and flushed with recent victory the covenanters resolved not only to hold together for defensive purposes but to take the initiative push their advantage and fight for civil and religious liberty  it was the old old fight which has convulsed the world probably since the days of edenthe uprising of the persecuted many against the tyrannical few  in the confusions of a sinstricken world the conditions have been occasionally and partially reversed but for the most part historys record tells of the abuse of power on the part of the few who possess it and the resulting consequence that    mans inhumanity to man   makes countless thousands mourn  until the downtrodden have turned at bay and like the french in 1793 have taken fearful vengeance or as in the case of the covenanters at the time of which we write have reaped only disaster and profounder woe  there were however two elements of weakness among the covenanters in 1679 which rendered all their efforts vain despite the righteousness of their cause  one was that they were an undisciplined body without appointed and experienced officers while their leader robert hamilton was utterly unfitted by nature as well as training for a military command  the other weakness was that the unhappy differences of opinion among them as to lines of duty to which we have before referred became more and more embittered instead of being subordinated to the stern necessities of the hour  the earnest men of god amongst them could no doubt have brought things to a better state in this crisis if their counsels had prevailed but the men whose powers of endurance had at last given way were too many and strong for these so that instead of preparing for united action the turbulent among them continued their dissensions until too late  after drumclog hamilton led his men to glasgow to attack the enemys headquarters there  he was repulsed and then retired to hamilton where he formed a camp  the privy council meanwhile called out the militia and ordered all the heritors and freeholders to join with the regulars in putting down the insurrection  a good many people from all quarters had joined the covenanters after the success at drumclog but it is thought that their numbers never exceeded 4000  the army which prepared to meet them under the command of the duke of monmouth and buccleuch was said to be 10000 strongamong them were some of the best of the kings troops  the duke was anxious to delay matters apparently with some hope of reconciliation  many of the covenanters were likeminded and it is said that mr welsh visited the royal camp in disguise with a view to a peaceful solution but the stern spirits in both camps rendered this impossible  some from principle others from prejudice could not see their way to a compromise while the unprincipled on either side cried havoc and let slip the dogs of war  it was on sabbath the 22nd of june that the dukes army reached bothwell moor the advanced guards entering bothwell town within a quarter of a mile of the bridge which spans the clyde  the covenanters lay encamped on hamilton moor on the southern side of the river  that morning a company of stalwart young men coming from the direction of edinburgh had crossed bothwell bridge before the arrival of the royal army and joined the covenanters  they were preceded by two men on horseback  it seems a daftlike thing said one horseman to the other as they traversed the moor that the likes o me should be ridin to battle like a lord insteed o trudgin wi the men on futt but man its no easy to walk far efter wearin a tichtfittin buitthough it was only for a wee while i had it on  its a verra weel for you wull thats oor eleckit captain an can sit yer horse like a markis but as for me ill slip aff an fecht on my legs when it comes to that  theres no military law andrew against fighting on foot returned the captain who we need scarcely say was will wallace but if you are well advised youll stick to the saddle as long as you can  see yonder seems to be the headquarters of the camp  we will report our arrival and then see to breakfast  ayill be thankfu for a bite o somethin for im fair famished an theres a proverb i think that says its ill fechtin on an empy stammack  it seems to me theres less order an mair noise yonder than befits a camp o serious menspecially on a sabbath mornin  the same thought occurred to myself said wallace  perhaps they have commenced the services for you know there are several ministers among them  mair like disputation than services returned the farmer with a grave shake of his head  finding that andrew was correct and that the leaders of the little army were wasting the precious moments in irrelevant controversy the edinburgh contingent turned aside and set about preparing a hasty breakfast  this reinforcement included quentin dick jock bruce david spence and ramblin peter also tam chanter edward gordon and alexander mccubine who had been picked up on the march  of course while breaking their fast they discussed the pros and cons of the situation freely  if the kings troops are as near as they are reported to be said wallace our chances of victory are small  i fear yere richt said black  it becomes ignorance to haud its tongue in the presence o knowledge nae dootan i confess to bein as ignorant as a bairn o the art o war but common sense seems to say that haverin aboot theology on the eve o a fecht is no sae wiselike as disposin yer men to advantage  the very craws might be ashamed o sic a noise  even while he spoke a cry was raised that the enemy was in sight and the confusion that prevailed before became redoubled as the necessity for instant action arose  in the midst of it however a few among the more sedate and coolheaded leaders did their best to reduce the little army to something like order and put it in battle array  there was no lack of personal courage  men who had for the sake of righteousness suffered the loss of all things and had carried their lives in their hands for so many years were not likely to present a timid front in the hour of battle  and leaders such as john nisbet of hardhill one of the most interesting sufferers in the twentyeight years persecution clelland who had fought with distinguished courage at drumclog henry hall of haughhead david hackston of rathillet john balfour of burley turnbull of bewlie with major learmont and captain john paton of meadowheadtwo veterans who had led the westland covenanters in their first battle at the pentland hillssuch men were well able to have led a band of even halfdisciplined men to victory if united under a capable general  but such was not to be  the laws of god whether relating to physics or morals are inexorable  a divided army cannot conquer  they had assembled to fight instead of fighting they disputed and that so fiercely that two opposing parties were formed in the camp and their councils of war became arenas of strife  the drilling of men had been neglected officers were not appointed stores of ammunition and other supplies were not provided and no plan of battle was concerted  all this with incapacity at the helm resulted in overwhelming disaster and the sacrifice of a body of brave devoted men  it afterwards intensified persecution and postponed constitutional liberty for many years  in this state of disorganisation the covenanters were found by the royal troops  the latter were allowed quietly to plant their guns and make arrangements for the attack  but they were not suffered to cross bothwell bridge with impunity  some of the bolder spirits leaving the disputants to fight with tongue and eye drew their swords and advanced to confront the foe  its every man for himsel here remarked andrew black indignantly wiping his mouth with his cuff as he rose from the meal which he was well aware might be his last  the lord hae mercy on the puir covenanters for theyre in sair straits this day  come awa wull wallacelead us on to battle  our hero who was busily forming up his men needed no such exhortation seeing that there was no one in authority to direct his movements he resolved to act for his own hand  he gave the word to march and set off at a quick step for the river where the fight had already begun soon he and his small band were among those who held the bridge  here they found hackston hall turnbull and the lionlike john nisbet each with a small band of devoted followers sternly and steadily defending what they knew to be the key to their position  distributing his men in such a way among the coppices on the rivers bank that they could assail the foe to the greatest advantage without unnecessarily exposing themselves wallace commenced a steady fusillade on the kings footguards who were attempting to storm the bridge  the covenanters had only one cannon and about 300 men with which to meet the assault but the gun was effectively handled and the men were staunch  on the central arch of the old bridgewhich was long and narrowthere stood a gate  this had been closed and barricaded with beams and trees and the parapets on the farther side had been thrown down to prevent the enemy finding shelter behind them  these arrangements aided the defenders greatly so that for three hours the gallant 300 held the position in spite of all that superior discipline and numerous guns could do  at last however the ammunition of the defenders began to fail  where did ye tether my horse asked will wallace addressing peter who acted the part of aidedecamp and servant to his commander  ayont the hoose there replied peter who was crouching behind a treestump  jump on its back lad and ride to the rear at full speed  tell them were running short of powder and ball  we want more men too at once haste ye  ay an tell them frae me that if we lose the brig we lose the day growled andrew black who begrimed with powder was busily loading and firing his musket from behind a thick bush which though an admirable screen from vision was a poor protection from bullets as the passage of several leaden messengers had already proved  but our farmer was too much engrossed with present duty to notice trifles  without a word except his usual ay ramblin peter jumped up and ran to where his commanders steed was picketed  in doing so he had to pass an open space and a ball striking his cap sent it spinning into the air but peter like black was not easily affected by trifles  next moment he was on the back of wills horsea great longlegged chestnutand flying towards the main body of covenanters in rear  the bullets were whistling thickly past him  one of these grazing some tender part of his steeds body acted as a powerful spur so that the alarmed creature flew over the ground at racing speed much to its riders satisfaction  when they reached the lines however and he attempted to pull up peter found that the great toughmouthed animal had taken the bit in its teeth and bolted  no effort that his puny arm could make availed to check it  through the ranks of the covenanters he sped wildly and in a short time was many miles from the battlefield how long he might have continued his involuntary retreat is uncertain but the branch of a tree brought it to a close by sweeping him off the saddle  a quarter of an hour later an old woman found him lying on the ground insensible and with much difficulty succeeded in dragging him to her cottage  meanwhile the tide of war had gone against the covenanters  whatever may be said of hamilton unquestionably he did not manage the fight well  no ammunition or reinforcements were sent to the front  the stout defenders of the bridge were forced to give way in such an unequal conflict  yet they retired fighting for every inch of the ground indeed instead of being reinforced they were ordered to retire and at last when all hope was gone they reluctantly obeyed  noo this bates a exclaimed black in a tone of ineffable disgust as he ran to the end of the bridge clubbed his musket and laid about him with the energy of despair  will wallace was at his side in a moment so was quentin dick  they found balfour and hackston already there and for a few moments these men even turned the tide of battle for they made an irresistible dash across the bridge and absolutely drove the assailants from their guns but being unsupported were compelled to retire  if each had been a hercules the gallant five would have had to succumb before such overwhelming odds  a few minutes more and the covenanters were driven back  the kings troops poured over the bridge and began to form on the other side  then it was that graham of claverhouse seeing his opportunity led his dragoons across the bridge and charged the main body of the covenanters undisciplined troops could not withstand the shock of such a charge they quickly broke and fled and now the battle was changed to a regular rout  kill kill cried claverhouse no quarter  his men needed no such encouragement  from that time forward they galloped about the moor slaying remorselessly all whom they came across  the gentlespirited monmouth seeing that the victory was gained gave orders to cease the carnage but claverhouse paid no attention to this he was like the maneating tigershaving once tasted blood he could not be controlled though monmouth galloped about the field doing his best to check the savage soldiery  it is said that afterwards his royal fatherfor he was an illegitimate son of the kingfound fault with him for his leniency after bothwell we can well believe it for in a letter which he had previously sent to the council charles wrote that it was his royal will and pleasure that they should prosecute the rebels with fire and sword and all other extremities of war  speaking at another time to monmouth about his conduct charles said if i had been present there should have been no trouble about prisoners  to which monmouth replied if that was your wish you should not have sent me but a butcher  in the general flight black owing to his lame leg stumbled over a bank pitched on his head and lay stunned  quentin dick stooping to succour him was knocked down from behind and both were captured fortunately monmouth chanced to be near them at the time and prevented their being slaughtered on the spot like so many of their countrymen of whom it is estimated that upwards of four hundred were slain in the pursuit that succeeded the fightmany of them being men of the neighbourhood who had not been present on the actual field of battle at all  among others wallaces uncle david spence was killed  twelve hundred it is said laid down their arms and surrendered at discretion  wallace himself seeing that the day was lost and further resistance useless and having been separated from his friends in the general melee sought refuge in a clump of alders on the banks of the river another fugitive made for the same spot about the same time  he was an old man yet vigorous and ran well but the soldiers who pursued soon came up and knocked him down  having already received several dangerous wounds in the head the old man seemed to feel that he had reached the end of his career on earth and calmly prepared for death  but the end had not yet come  even among the bloodstained troops of the king there were men whose hearts were not made of flint and who doubtless disapproved of the cruel work in which it was their duty to take part instead of giving the old man the coup de grace one of the soldiers asked his name  donald cargill answered the wounded man  that name sounds familiar said the soldier  are not you a minister  yea i have the honour to be one of the lords servants  upon hearing this the soldiers let him go and bade him get off the field as fast as possible  cargill was not slow to obey and soon reached the alders where he fell almost fainting to the ground  here he was discovered by wallace and recognised as the old man whom he had met in andrew blacks hidyhole the poor man could scarcely walk but with the assistance of his stout young friend who carefully dressed his wounds he managed to escape wallace himself was not so fortunate  after leaving cargill in a place of comparative safety he had not the heart to think only of his own escape while uncertain of the fate of his friends  he was aware indeed of his uncles death but knew nothing about andrew black quentin dick or ramblin peter  when therefore night had put an end to the fiendish work he returned cautiously to search the field of battle but while endeavouring to clamber over a wall was suddenly pounced upon by half a dozen soldiers and made prisoner  at an earlier part of the evening he would certainly have been murdered on the spot but by that time the royalists were probably tired of indiscriminate slaughter for they merely bound his arms and led him to a spot where those covenanters who had been taken prisoners were guarded  the guarding was of the strangest and cruellest  the prisoners were made to lie flat down on the groundmany of them having been previously stripped nearly naked and if any of them ventured to change their positions or raise their heads to implore a draught of water they were instantly shot  next day the survivors were tied together in couples and driven off the ground like a herd of cattle  will wallace stood awaiting his turn and watching the first band of prisoners march off  suddenly he observed andrew black coupled to quentin dick  they passed closed to him  as they did so their eyes met  losh man is that you exclaimed black a gleam of joy lighting up his sombre visage  eh but i am gled to see that yer still leevin  not more glad than i to see that youre not dead responded will quickly  wheres peter and bruce  a stern command to keep silence and move on drowned the answer and in another minute wallace with an unknown comradeinarms had joined the procession  thus they were ledor rather drivenwith every species of cruel indignity to edinburgh but the jails there were already full there was no place in which to stow such noxious animals  had charles the second been there according to his own statement he would have had no difficulty in dealing with them but bad as the council was it was not quite so brutal it would seem as the king  put them in the greyfriars churchyard was the orderand to that celebrated spot they were marched  seated at her back window in candlemaker row mrs black observed with some surprise and curiosity the sad procession wending its way among the tombs and round the church  the news of the fight at bothwell bridge had only just reached the city and she knew nothing of the details  mrs wallace and jean black were seated beside her knitting  whall they be noo soliloquised mrs black  maybe prisoners taken at bothwell brig suggested mrs wallace  jean started dropped her knitting and said in a low anxious voice as she gazed earnestly at the procession ifif its them uncle andrew ananthe others may be amang them  the procession was not more than a hundred yards distantnear enough for sharp loving eyes to distinguish friends  i see them cried jean eagerly  next moment she had leaped over the window which was not much over six feet from the ground  she doubled round a tombstone and running towards the prisoners got near enough to see the head of the procession pass through a large iron gate at the southwest corner of the churchyard and to see clearly that her uncle and quentin dick were theretied together  here a soldier stopped her  as she turned to entreat permission to pass on she encountered the anxious gaze of will wallace as he passed  there was time for the glance of recognition that was all  a few minutes more and the long procession had passed into what afterwards proved to be one of the most terrible prisons of which we have any record in history  jean black was thrust out of the churchyard along with a crowd of others who had entered by the front gate  filled with dismay and anxious forebodings she returned to her temporary home in the row  chapter nine  among the tombs  the enclosure at the southwestern corner of greyfriars churchyard which had been chosen as the prison of the men who were spared after the battle of bothwell bridge was a small narrow space enclosed by very high walls and guarded by a strong iron gatethe same gate probably which still hangs there at the present day  there among the tombs without any covering to shelter them from the wind and rain without bedding or sufficient food with the dank grass for their couches and graves for pillows did most of these unfortunatesfrom twelve to fifteen hundredlive during the succeeding five months  they were rigorously guarded night and day by sentinels who were held answerable with their lives for the safe keeping of the prisoners  during the daytime they stood or moved about uneasily  at nights if any of them ventured to rise the sentinels had orders to fire upon them  if they had been dogs they could not have been treated worse  being men their sufferings were terribleinconceivable  ere long many a poor fellow found a deathbed among the graves of that gloomy enclosure  to add to their misery friends were seldom permitted to visit them and those who did obtain leave were chiefly females who were exposed to the insults of the guards  a week or so after their being shut up here andrew black stood one afternoon leaning against the headstone of a grave on which quentin dick and will wallace were seated  it had been raining and the grass and their garments were very wet  a leaden sky overhead seemed to have deepened their despair for they remained silent for an unusually long time  this is awfu said black at last with a deep sigh  if there was ony chance o makin a dash an fechtin to the end i wad tak comfort but to be left here to sterve an rot nicht an day wi naethin to do an maist naethin to think onitsits awfu  as the honest man could not get no further than this ideaand the idea itself was a mere truismno response was drawn from his companions who sat with clenched fists staring vacantly before them  probably the first stage of incipient madness had set in with all of them  did jean give you any hope yesterday asked wallace languidly for he had asked the same question every day since the poor girl had been permitted to hold a brief conversation with her uncle at the iron gate towards which only one prisoner at a time was allowed to approach  the answer had always been the same  na na  she bids me hope indeed in the lordan shes right there but as for man what can we hope frae him  ye may weel ask that exclaimed quentin dick with sudden and bitter emphasis  man indeed  its my opeenion that man when left to hissel is nae better than the deevil  i faith i think hes waur for hes mair contemptible  ye may be right quentin for a i ken but some men are no left to theirsels  theres that puir young chiel anderson that was shot i the lungs an has scarce been able the last day or twa to crawl to the yett to see his auld mitherhes deeing this afternoon  i went ower to the tombstane that keeps the east wund aff him an he said to me andry man said he ill no be able to crawl to see my mither the day  ill vera likely be deid before she comes  wull ye tell her no to greet for me for im restin on the lord jesus an ill be a free man afore night singing the praises o redeeming love and waitin for her to come  quentin had covered his face with his hands while black spoke and a low groan escaped him for the youth anderson had made a deep impression on the three friends during the week they had suffered together  wallace without replying went straight over to the tomb where anderson lay  he was followed by the other two  on reaching the spot they observed that he lay on his back with closed eyes and a smile resting on his young face  he sleeps said wallace softly  ay he sleeps weel said black shaking his head slowly  i ken the look o that sleep  an yonders his puir mither at the yett  bide by him quentin while i gang an brek it to her  it chanced that mrs anderson and jean came to the gate at the same moment  on hearing that her son was dead the poor woman uttered a low wail and would have fallen if jean had not caught her and let her gently down on one of the graves  jean was as we have said singularly sympathetic  she had overheard what her uncle had said and forthwith sat down beside the bereaved woman drew her head down on her breast and tried to comfort her as she had formerly tried to comfort old mrs mitchell  even the guards were softened for a few minutes but soon they grew impatient and ordered them both to leave  bide a wee said jean i maun hae a word wi my uncle  she rose as she spoke and turned to the gate  weel what luck asked black grasping both her hands through the bars  no luck uncle answered jean whimpering a little in spite of her efforts to keep up  as we ken naebody o note here that could help us i just went straight to the parliament hoose an saw lauderdale himsel but he wouldna listen to me  an what could i say  i couldna tell him a lee ye ken an say ye hadna been to conventicles or sheltered the rebels as they ca us  but i said i was sure ye were sorry for what ye had done an that ye would never do it again if they would only let you off  oh jean jean yere a gowk for that was twa lees ye telt him interrupted black with a short sarcastic laugh for im no a bit sorry for what ive done an ill dot ower again if ever i git the chance  neer heed lass youve done your best  an hoos mither an mrs wallace  theyre baith weel but awfu cast doon aboot you ananwull and quentin  ani had maist forgotpeter has turned up safe an soond he says that  come cut short your haverin said the sentinel who had been induced to favour jean partly because of her sweet innocent face and partly because of the money which mrs black had given her to bribe him  weel tell peter said black hurriedly to gang doon to the ferm an see if he can find oot onything aboot marion clerk an isabel scott im wae for thae lassies  theyre ower guid to let live in peace at a time like this  tell him to tell them frae me to flee to the hills noo that the hidyhole is gaen theres no a safe hoose in a the land only the caves an the peatbogs and even they are but puir protection  uncle dear is not the lord our hidingplace until these calamities be overpast said jean while the tears that she could not suppress ran down her cheeks  yere right bairn  god forgie my want o faith  rin awa noo  i see the sentrys getting wearied  the lord bless ye  the night chanced to be very dark  rain fell in torrents and wind in fitful gusts swept among the tombs chilling the prisoners to the very bone  it is probable that the guards would for their own comfort have kept a slack lookout had not their own lives depended a good deal on their fidelity  as it was the vigil was not so strict as it might have been and they found it impossible to see the whole of that long narrow space of ground in so dark a night  about midnight the sentry fancied he saw three figures flitting across the yard  putting his musket through the bars of the gate he fired at once but could not see whether he had done execution and so great was the noise of the wind and rain that the report of his piece was not audible more than a few paces from where he stood except to leeward  alarms were too frequent in those days to disturb people much  a few people no doubt heard the shot listened perchance for a moment or two and then turning in their warm beds continued their repose  the guard turned out but as all seemed quiet in the churchyardprison when they peered through the iron bars they turned in again and the sentinel recharged his musket  close beside one of the sodden graves lay the yet warm body of a dead man  the random bullet had found a billet in his heart and natures sweet restorer had been merged into the sleep of death  fortunate man he had been spared probably months of slowtimed misery with almost certain death at the end in any case  three men rose from behind the headstone of that grave and looked sorrowfully on the drenched figure  he has passed the golden gates said one in a low voice  a wonderful change  ay wull responsed another of the trio but its noo or niver wi us  set yer heid agin the wa quentin  the shepherd obeyed and the three proceeded to carry out a plan which they had previously deviseda plan which only very strong and agile men could have hoped to carry through without noise  selecting a suitable part of the wall in deepest shadow where a headstone slightly aided them quentin planted his feet firmly and resting his arms on the wall leaned his forehead against them  black mounted on his shoulders and standing erect assumed the same position  then wallace grasping the garments of his friends climbed up the living ladder and stood on blacks shoulders so that he could just grip the top of the wall and hang on  at this point in the process the conditions were so to speak reversed  black grasped wallace with both hands by one of his ankles and held on like a vice  the living ladder was now hanging from the top of the wall instead of standing at the foot of it and quentinthe lowest rung so to speakbecame the climber  from wallaces shoulders he easily gained the top of the wall and was able to reach down a helping hand to black as he made his way slowly up wallaces back  then both men hauled wallace up with some trouble for the strain had been almost too much for him and he could hardly help himself  at this juncture the sentinel chanced to look up and dark though it was he saw the three figures on the wall a little blacker than the sky behind  instantly the bright flash of his musket was seen and the report mingled with his cry of alarm again brought out the guard  a volley revealed the three prisoners for a moment  dinna jump cried black as the bullets whizzed past their heads yell brek yer legs  tak it easy  theyre slow at loadin an the mair hurry the less speed  the caution was only just in time for the impulsive wallace had been on the point of leaping from the wall instead of doing which he assisted in reversing the process which has just been described  it was much easier however and the drop which wallace had to make after his friends were down was broken by their catching him in their arms inexperience however is always liable to misfortune  the shock of such a heavy man dropping from such a height gave them a surprise and sent them all three violently to the ground but the firing shouting and confusion on the other side of the wall caused them to jump up with wonderful alacrity  candlemaker raw said black in a hoarse whisper as they dashed off in different directions and were lost in blackness of night  with a very sad face on which however there was an air of calm resignation mrs black sat in her little room with her bible open before her  she had been reading to mrs wallace and jean preparatory to retiring for the night  its awful to think of their lying out yonder bedless maybe supperless on a night like this said mrs wallace  jean with her pretty face in that condition which the scotch and norwegian languages expressively call begrutten could do nothing but sigh  just then hurried steps were heard on the stair and next moment a loud knocking shook the door  whas that exclaimed mrs black rising  its me mither  open quick  next moment andrew sprang in and looked hastily round  am i the first mither  before the poor woman could recover from her joy and amazement sufficiently to reply another step was heard on the stair  thats ane o them said black turning and holding the door so as to be ready for friend or foe  he was right  mrs wallace uttered a little scream of joy as her son leaped into the room  whaurs quentin asked black  the question was scarcely put when the shepherd himself bounded up the stair  theyve gotten sight o me i fear he said  have ye a garret wumminonywhere to hide  no a place in the hoose big enough for a moose to hide in said mrs black with a look of dismay  as she spoke a confused noise of voices and hurrying steps was heard in the street  another moment and they were at the foot of the stair  the three men seized the poker tongs and shovel  mrs black opened her back window and pointed to the churchyard  yer only chance she said  andrew black leaped out at once  wallace followed like a harlequin quentin dick felt that there was no time for him to follow without being seen  dropping his poker he sprang through the doorway and closing the door on himself began to thunder against it just as an officer leading some of the townguard reached the landing  open i say cried quentin furiously im sure the rebels cam in here  dinna be keepin the gentlemen o the gaird waitin here  open i say or ill drive the door in  bursting the door open as though in fulfilment of his threat quentin sprang in and looking hastily round cried as if in towering wrath whaur are they  whaur are thae pestiferous rebels  theres nae rebels here gentlemen said mrs black  yere welcome to seek  they maun hae gaen up the next stair said quentin turning to the officer  and pray who are you that ye seem so anxious to catch the rebels  wha am i repeated quentin with glaring eyes and a sort of grasping of his strong fingers that suggested the idea of tearing some one to pieces  div ee no see that im a shepherd  the sufferins than i hae gaen through an endured on accoont o thae rebels is pastbut cway sirs theyll escape us if we stand haverin here  so saying the bold man dashed down the stair and into the next house followed by the townguards who did not know him  the prisoners guards were fortunately searching in another direction  a strict search was made in the next house at which quentin assisted  when they were yet in the thick of it he went quietly downstairs and walked away from the scene as he expressed it hotchinby which he meant chuckling  but poor andrew black and will wallace were not so fortunate  a search which was made in the outer churchyard resulted in their being discovered among the tombs and they were forthwith conducted to the tolbooth prison  when ramblin peter after many narrow escapes reached the farm in dumfries in a halffamished state he sat down among the desolate ruins and howled with grief  having thus relieved his feelings he dried his eyes and proceeded in his usual sedate manner to examine things in detail  he soon found that his master had been wrong in supposing that the hidyhole had been discovered or destroyed  as he approached the outer end of the tunnel a head suddenly appeared above ground and as suddenly vanished  hallo exclaimed peter in surprise  hallo echoed the head and reappeared blazing with astonishment  is that you peter  ay mccubine thats me  i thought ye was a deid  hae ye ony parritch i the hole  im awfu hungry  cway in lad weve plenty to eat here an guid company as weelthe lord be thankit  the man led the wayfamiliar enough to peter and in the hidyhole he found several persons some of whom from their costume were evidently ministers  they paid little attention to the boy at first being engaged in earnest conversation  no no mr cargill said one  i cannot agree with you in the stern line of demarcation which you would draw between us  we are all the servants of the most high god fighting for suffering for the truth as it is in jesus  it is true that rather than bow to usurped power i chose to cast in my lot with the ejected but having done that and suffered the loss of all things temporal i do not feel called on to pronounce such absolute condemnation on my brethren who have accepted the indulgence  i know that many of them are as earnest followers of christ as ourselvesit may be more sobut they think it right to bow before the storm rather than risk civil war to accept what of toleration they can get while they hope and pray for more  in that case mr welsh replied cargill what comes of their testimony for the truth  is not christ king in his own household charles is king in the civil state  the oath which he requires of every minister who accepts the indulgence distinctly recognises himthe kingas lord of the conscience ruler of the spiritual kingdom of this land  to take such an oath is equivalent to acknowledging the justice of his pretensions  they do not see it in that light returned mr welsh  i agree with your views and think our indulged brethren in the wrong but i counsel forbearance and cannot agree with the idea that it is our duty to refuse all connection with them and treat them as if they belonged to the ranks of the malignants  see what such opinions have cost us already in the overwhelming disaster at bothwell brig  overwhelming disaster counts for nothing in such a cause as this rejoined cargill gravely  the truth has been committed to us and we are bound to be valiant for the trutheven to death  is it not so mr cameron  the young man to whom the old covenanter turned was one of the most noted among the men who fought and died for the covenant  an earnest godly young minister he had just returned from holland with the intention of taking up the standard which had been almost dropped in consequence of the hotter persecutions which immediately followed the battle of bothwell bridge  of course you know that i agree with you mr cargill  when you licensed me to preach the blessed gospel mr welsh you encouraged me to independent thought  under the guidance i believe of the holy spirit i have been led to see the sinfulness of the indulgence and i am constrained to preach against it  truly my chief concern is for the salvation of soulsthe bringing of men and women and children to the saviour but after that or rather along with that to my mind comes the condemnation of sin whether public or private  consider what the indulgence and persecution together have done now  have they not wellnigh stopped the fieldpreaching altogether so that with the exception of yourselves and mr thomas douglas and a few others there is no one left to testify  part of my mission has been to go round among the ministers on this very point but my efforts have been in vain as far as i have yet gone  it has been prophesied continued cameron with a sad smile that i shall yet lose my head in this cause  that may well be for there is that in my soul which will not let me stand still while my master is dishonoured and sin is triumphant  as to the king he may so far as i know be truly descended from the race of our kings but he has so grievously departed from his duty to the peopleby whose authority alone magistrates existand has so perjured himself usurped authority in church matters and tyrannised in matters civil that the people of scotland do no longer owe him allegiance and although i stand up for governments and governors such as gods word and our covenants allow i will surelywith all who choose to join me disown charles stuart as a tyrant and a usurper  the discussion had continued so long that the ministers as if by mutual consent dropped it after this point and turned to ramblin peter who was appeasing his hunger with a huge luggie o parritch  but the poor boy had no heart to finish his meal on learning that marion clark and isabel scottof whom he was very fondhad been captured by the soldiers and sent to edinburgh  indeed nothing would satisfy him but that he should return to the metropolis without delay and carry the bad news to his master  that same night when darkness rendered it safe cargill cameron welsh and douglas with some of their followers left blacks place of concealment and went off in different directions to risk for a brief space the shelter of a friendly cottage where the neighbours would assemble to hear the outlawed ministers while one of them kept watch or to fulfil their several engagements for the holding of conventicles among the secret places of the hills  chapter ten  fiercer and fiercer  after his escape quentin dick hearing of the recapture of his comrades and knowing that he could not in any way help them resolved to go back to dumfries to make inquiries about the servant lassies marion and isabel being ignorant of the fact that ramblin peter had been sent on the same errand before him  now although the one was travelling to and the other from edinburgh they might easily have missed each other as they travelled chiefly at night in order to escape observation  but hearing on the way that the muchloved minister mr welsh was to preach in a certain locality they both turned aside to hear him and thus came together  a price of 500 pounds sterling had been set on the head of mr welsh and for twenty years he had been pursued by his foes yet for that long period he succeeded in eluding his pursuerseven though the resolute and vindictive claverhouse was among themand in continuing his work of preaching to the people  though a meek and humble man welsh was cool courageous and selfpossessed with apparently a dash of humour in himas was evidenced by his preaching on one occasion in the middle of the frozen tweed so that either he might shun giving offence to both nations or that two kingdoms might dispute his crime  the evening before the meeting at which quentin and peter unwittingly approached each other mr welsh found himself at a loss where to spend the night for the bloodhounds were already on his track  he boldly called at the house of a gentleman who was personally unknown to him but who was known to be hostile to fieldpreachers in general and to himself in particular  as a stranger mr welsh was kindly received probably in such dangerous times it was considered impolite to make inquiry as to names  at all events the record says that he remained unknown  in course of conversation his host referred to welsh and the difficulty of getting hold of him  i am sent said welsh to apprehend rebels  i know where mr welsh is to preach tomorrow and will give you the rebel by the hand  overjoyed at this news the gentleman agreed to accompany him to the meeting on the morrow  arriving next day at the rendezvous the congregation made way for the minister and his host  the latter was then invited to take a seat and to his great amazement his guest of the previous night stood up and preached  at the close of the sermon mr welsh held out his hand to his host  i promised he said to give you mr welsh by the hand  yes returned the gentleman who was much affected as he grasped the hand and you said that you were sent to apprehend rebels  let me assure you that i a rebellious sinner have been apprehended this day  it was at this interesting moment that quentin and peter recognised each other and forgetting all other points of interest turned aside to discuss their own affairs  then theres nae use o my gaun ony farer said the shepherd thoughtfully  nane whatever said peter yed best cway back t toon wi me yell be safer there nor here an may chance to be o service to the lassies  alas for the poor lassies  they were in the fangs of the wolves at that very time  in that councilroom where for years the farce of trial and the tragedy of cruel injustice had been carried on marion clark and isabel scott were standing before their civil and clerical inquisitors the trial was nearly over  proceeding upon their mean principle of extracting confession by the method of entrapping questions and thus obtaining from their unsuspecting victims sufficient evidenceas they saidto warrant condemnation they had got the poor servingmaids to admit that they had attended fieldpreachings had conversed with some whom the government denounced as rebels and other matters which sufficed to enable them to draw up a libel  those two innocent girls were then handed over to the justiciary court before which they were charged with the crime of receiving and corresponding with mr donald cargill mr thomas douglas mr john welsh and mr richard cameron with the murderers of archbishop sharp and with having heard the said ministers preach up treason and rebellion  when the indictment was read to them the poor things meekly admitted that it was correct except in so far as it called the ministers rebels and asserted that they preached up treason  the jury were exceedingly unwilling to serve on the trial but were compelled to do so under threat of fine  after deliberating on the evidence they found the girls both guilty by their own confession of holding the opinions charged against them but that as actors or receivers of rebels the charge was not proven  upon this they were condemned to die but before leaving the court isabel scott said impressively i take all witness against another at you to your appearance before god that your proceeding against us this day is only for owning christ his gospel and his members  see a cloud of witnesses page 122 edition 1871 they were then led back to prison  when quentin and peter arrived in edinburgh two days later they passed under the west port which was decorated with the shrivelled heads and hands of several martyrs and made their way to the grassmarket which they had to traverse in going towards candlemaker row  here they found a large crowd surrounding the gallowstree which did such frequent service there  two female figures were swinging from the beam  the auld story said the shepherd in a low sad voice  what was their crime he inquired of a bystander  they tried to serve the lord that was a replied the man bitterly but they ended their coorse bravely  ane sang the 84th psalm and the ither spake of gods great love an free grace to her and to sinfu man  puir things exclaimed quentin with tremulous voice  its ower noo theyre fairly inside o the celestial gates  the sight was all too common in those dark days to induce delay but the two friends had to pass near the gallows and naturally looked up in passing  quentin gasped peter stretching out both hands towards the martyrs whose now soulless frames were hanging there itsits marion an  a low wail followed as the poor boy fell over in a swoon  the shepherds heart almost stood still and his great chest quivered for a moment as he gazed but he was a man of strong will and iron mould  stooping he picked up his little friend and carried him silently away  their grief was however diverted to other channels on reaching the abode of mrs black for there they found her and mrs wallace and jean in deepest sorrow over the terrible news just brought to them by jock bruce  andrew black he told them had been sent a prisoner to the bass rock and will wallace with two hundred others had been banished to the plantations in barbadoes where they were to be sold as slaves  quentin sat down covered his face with both hands and groaned aloud on hearing this  peter who had recovered by that time looked about him with the expressionless face of one whose reason has been unseated observing that jean was sitting apart sobbing as if her heart would break he went quietly to her and taking one of her hands began to stroke it gently  dinna greet jean he said the lord will deliver them  marion aye telt me that an i believe she was richt  truly these unfortunate people needed all the consolation that the word could give them for banishment to the plantations usually meant banishment for life and as to the hundreds who found a prison on the bleak and rugged bass rock at the mouth of the forth many of these also found a grave  after the battle of bothwell bridge the persecutions which had been so severe for so many years were continued with intensified bitterness not only were all the old tyrannical laws carried into force with increased severity but new and harsher laws were enacted  among other things the common soldiers were given the right to carry these laws into effectin other words to murder and plunder according to their own will and pleasure  and now in 1680 began what has been termed the killingtime in which graham of claverhouse afterwards viscount dundee grierson of lagg dalziel and others became preeminently notorious for their wanton cruelty in slaughtering men women and even children  on 22nd june 1680 twenty armed horsemen rode up the main street of the burgh of sanquhar  the troop was headed by richard cameron and his brother michael who dismounting nailed to the cross a paper which the latter read aloud  it was the famous declaration of sanquhar in which charles stuart was publicly disowned  while the fields of scotland were being traversed and devastated by a lawless banditti authorised by a lawless and covenantbreaking king and government those indomitable men who held with cameron and cargill united themselves more closely together and thus entered into a new bond pledging themselves to be faithful to god and to each other in asserting their civil and religious rights which they believed could only be secured by driving from the throne that perfidious covenantbreaking race untrue both to the most high god and to the people over whom for their sins they were set  if the cameronians were wrong in this opinion then must the whole nation have been wrong when a few years later it came to hold the same opinion and acted in accordance therewith  as well might we find fault with bruce and wallace as with our covenanting patriots  be this as it may richard cameron with his followers asserted the principle which afterwards became lawnamely that the house of stuart should no longer desecrate the throne  he did not however live to see his desire accomplished  at airsmossin the district of kylewith a band of his followers numbering twentysix horse and forty foot he was surprised by a party of upwards of one hundred and twenty dragoons under command of bruce of earlshall  the cameronians were headed by hackston of rathillet who had been present at the murder of sharp though not an active participator  knowing that no mercy was to be expected they resolved to fight  before the battle cameron engaging in a brief prayer used the remarkable words lord take the ripe but spare the green  the issue against such odds was what might have been expected  nearly all the covenanters were slain  richard cameron fell fighting back to back with his brother  some of the footmen escaped into the moss  hackston was severely wounded and taken prisoner  camerons head and hands were cut off and taken to edinburgh where they were cruelly exhibited to his fathera prisoner at the time  do ye know them asked the wretch who brought them  the old man kissing them replied ay i know them they are my sonsmy own dear sons  it is the lord good is the will of the lord who cannot wrong me nor mine but has made goodness and mercy to follow us all our days  a wonderful speech this from one suffering under perhaps the severest trial to which poor human nature can be subjected  well might be applied to him the wordsslightly paraphrasedo man great was thy faith  hackston was taken to edinburgh which he entered on a horse with his head bare and his face to the tail the hangman carrying camerons head on a halter before him  the indignities and cruelties which were perpetrated on this man had been minutely prearranged by the privy council  we mention a few in order that the reader may the better understand the inconceivable brutality of the government against which the scottish covenanters had to contend  besides the barbarities connected with poor camerons head and hands it was arranged that hackstons body was to be drawn backward on a hurdle to the cross of edinburgh where in the first place his right hand was to be struck off and after some time his left hand  thereafter he was to be hanged up and cut down alive his bowels to be taken out and his heart shown to the people by the hangman and then to be burnt in a fire on the scaffold  afterwards his head was to be cut off and his body divided into four quarters to be sent respectively to saint andrews glasgow leith and burntisland  in carrying out his fiendish instructions the bungling executioner was a long time mangling the wrist of hackstons right arm before he succeeded in separating the hand  hackston quietly advised him to be more careful to strike in the joint of the left  having been drawn up and let fall with a jerk three times life was not extinct for it is said that when the heart was torn out it moved after falling on the scaffold  several others who had been with cameron were betrayed at this time by apostate comrades tried under torture and executed and the persecution became so hot that fieldpreaching was almost extinguished the veteran donald cargill however still maintained his ground  this able uncompromising yet affectionate and charitable man had prepared a famous document called the queensferry paper of which it has been said that it contains the very pith of sound constitutional doctrine regarding both civil and ecclesiastical rights  once however he mistook his mission  in the presence of a large congregation at torwood he went so far as to excommunicate charles the second the dukes of york lauderdale and rothes sir cú mckenzie and dalziel of binns  that these despots richly deserved whatever excommunication might imply can hardly be denied but it is equally certain that prolonged and severe persecution had stirred up poor cargill upon this occasion to overstep his duty as a teacher of love to god and man  heavily did cargill pay for his errorsas well as for his long and conscientious adherence to duty  five thousand merks were offered for him dead or alive  being captured he was taken to edinburgh on the 15th of july and examined by the council  on the 26th he was tried and condemned and on the 27th he was hanged after having witnessed a good confession which he wound up with the words i forgive all men the wrongs they have done against me  i pray that the sufferers may be kept from sin and helped to know their duty  about this time a test oath was ordered to be administered to all men in position or authority  the gist of it was that king charles the second was the only supreme governor in the realm over all causes as well ecclesiastical as civil and that it was unlawful for any subject upon pretence of reformation or any pretence whatever to enter into covenants or leagues or to assemble in any councils conventicles assemblies etcetera ecclesiastical or civil without his special permission  pretty well this for a king who had himself signed the covenantwithout which signing the scottish nation would never have consented to assist in putting him on the throne  the greater number of the men in office in scotland took the oath though there were several exceptionsthe duke of argyll the duke of hamilton john hope of hopetoun the duchess of rothes and othersamong whom were eighty of the conforming clergy whose loyalty could not carry them so far and who surrendered their livings rather than their consciences  it would require a volume to record even a bare outline of the deeds of darkness that were perpetrated at this time  we must dismiss it all and return to the actors in our tale  will wallace after being recaptured as already stated was sent off to the plantations in a vessel with about two hundred and fifty other unfortunates many of whom were seriously ill if not dying in consequence of their long exposure in the greyfriars churchyard packed in the hold of the ship so closely that they had not room to lie down and almost suffocated with foul air and stench the sufferings which they endured were far more terrible than those they experienced when lying among the tombs but god sent most of them speedy deliverance  they were wrecked on the coast of orkney  at night they were dashed on the rocks  the prisoners entreated to be let out of their prison but the brutal captain ordered the hatches to be chained down  a tremendous wave cleft the deck and a few of the more energetic managed to escape and reach the shore  the remainderat least two hundredwere drowned in the hold  will wallace was among the saved but was taken to leith and transferred to another vessel  after several months of tossings on the deep he reached his destination and was sold into slavery  many monthseven yearspassed away but no news reached candlemaker row regarding the fate of the banished people  as to andrew black the only change that took place in his condition during his long captivity was his transferenceunknown to his kindredfrom the gloomy prison of the bass rock to the still gloomier cells of dunnottar castle  during all this time and for some years after the persecutions were continued with everincreasing severity it seemed as if nothing short of the extirpation of the covenanters altogether was contemplated  in short the two parties presented at this period an aspect of human affairs which may well be styled monstrous  on the one hand a people suffering and fighting to the death to uphold law and on the other a tyrant king and arrogant ecclesiastics and nobles with their paid slaves and sycophants deliberately violating the same  quentin dick and ramblin peter had been drawn closer together by powerful sympathy after the imprisonment of black and the banishment of will wallace  they were likeminded in their aspirations though very dissimilar in physical and mental endowment  feeling that edinburgh was not a safe place in which to hide after his recent escape quentin resolved to return to dumfries to inquire after and if possible to aid his friends there  peter determined to cast in his lot with him  in size he was still a boy though he had reached manhood  we maun dae our best to help the wanderers said the shepherd as they started on their journey  ay assented peter  arrived in galloway they were passing over a wide moorland region one afternoon when a man suddenly appeared before them as if he had dropped from the clouds and held out his hand  what  mccubine can that be you exclaimed quentin grasping the proffered hand  man i am glad to see ye  what brings ye here  mccubine explained that he and his friend gordon with four comrades were hiding in the moss to avoid a party of dragoons who were pursuing them  grierson of lagg is with them and captain bruce is in command he said so we may expect no mercy if they catch us  only the other day bruce and his men dragged puir old tam mchaffie out o his bed tho he was ill wi fever an shot him  having conducted quentin and peter to the secret place where his friends were hidden mccubine was asked anxiously by the former if he knew anything about the wilsons  ay we ken this answered gordon that although the auld folk have agreed to attend the curates for the sake o peace the twa lassies have refused and been driven out o hoose an hame  they maun hae been wanderin amang the hills noo for monthsif theyre no catched by this time  hearing this quentin sprang up  we maun rescue them peter he said  ay returned the boy  jean black will expect that for aggies sake shes her bosom freend ye ken  refusing to delay for even half an hour the two friends hurried away they had scarcely left and the six hunted men were still standing on the road where they had bidden them godspeed when bruce with his dragoons suddenly appearedsurprised and captured them all  with the brutal promptitude peculiar to that wellnamed killingtime four of them were drawn up on the road and instantly shot and buried where they fell by lochenkit moor where a monument now marks their resting place  the two spared men gordon and mccubine were then without reason assigned bound and carried away  next day the party came to the cluden water crossing which they followed the road which leads to dumfries until they reached the neighbourhood of irongray  there is a field there with a mound in it on which grows a clump of old oaktrees  here the two friends were doomed without trial to die  it is said that the minister of irongray at that time was suspected of favourable leanings toward the covenanters and that the proprietor of the neighbouring farm of hallhill betrayed similar symptoms hence the selection of the particular spot between the two places in order to intimidate both the minister and the farmer  this may well have been the case for history shows that a very strong and indomitable covenanting spirit prevailed among the parishioners of irongray as well as among the people of the south and west of scotland generally  indeed wodrow the historian says that the people of irongray were the first to offer strenuous opposition to the settlement of the curates  when gordon and mccubine were standing under the fatal tree with the ropes round their necks a sorrowing acquaintance asked the latter if he had any word to send to his wife  yes answered the martyr tell her that i leave her and the two babes upon the lord and to his promise a father to the fatherless and a husband to the widow is the lord in his holy habitation  hearing this the man employed to act the part of executioner seemed touched and asked forgiveness  poor man was the reply i forgive thee and all men  they died at peace with god and man  an old tombstone surrounded by an iron rail marks to this day the spot among the old oaktrees where the bodies of mccubine and gordon were laid to rest  commenting on this to his friend selby the reverend george lawless gave it as his opinion that two more fanatics were well out of the world  to which the reverend frank replied very quietly  yes george well out of it indeed and as i would rather die with the fanatics than live with the godless i intend to join the covenanters tonightso my pulpit shall be vacant tomorrow  chapter eleven  coming events cast shadows  in february 1685 charles the second diednot without some suspicion of foul play  his brother the duke of york an avowed papist ascended the throne as james the second  this was a flagrant breach of the constitution and argyllattempting to avert the catastrophe by an invasion of scotland at the same time that monmouth should invade englandnot only failed but was captured and afterwards executed by the same instrumentthe maidenwith which his fathers head had been cut off nigh a quarter of a century before  as might have been expected the persecutions were not relaxed by the new king  when good old cargill was martyred a handsome fair young man was looking on in profound sorrow and pity  he was a youth of great moral power and with a large heart  his name was james renwick  from that hour this youth cast in his lot with the persecuted wanderers and after the martyrdom of cameron and cargill and the death of welsh he was left almost alone to manage their affairs  the strict covenanters had by this time formed themselves into societies for prayer and conference and held quarterly district meetings in sequestered places with a regular system of correspondencethus secretly forming an organised body which has continued down to modern times  it was while this young servant of godhaving picked up the mantle which cargill droppedwas toiling and wandering among the mountains morasses and caves of the west that a troop of dragoons was seen one may morning galloping over the same region on duty  they swept over hill and dale with the dash and rattle of men in all the pride of youth and strength and the panoply of war  they were hasting however not to the battlefield but to the field of agriculture there to imbrue their hands in the blood of the unarmed and the helpless  at the head of the band rode the valiant graham of claverhouse  most people at that time knew him as the bloody clavers but as we look at the gay cavalier with his waving plume martial bearing beautiful countenance and magnificent steed we are tempted to ask has there not been some mistake here  some have thought so  one or two literary men who might have known better have even said so and attempted to defend their position  methinks this is our quarry glendinning said claverhouse drawing rein as they approached a small cottage near to which a man was seen at work with a spade  yesthats john brown of priesthill said the sergeant  you know the pestilent fanatic well i suppose  ay  he gets the name o being a man of eminent godliness answered the sergeant in a mocking tone and is even credited with having started a sabbathschool  john brown known as the christian carrier truly was what glendinning had sneeringly described him  on seeing the cavalcade approach he guessed no doubt that his last hour had come for many a time had he committed the sin of succouring the outlawed covenanters and he had stoutly refused to attend the ministry of the worthless curate george lawless  indeed it was the information conveyed to government by that reverend gentleman that had brought claverhouse down upon the unfortunate man  the dragoons ordered him to proceed to the front of his house where his wife was standing with one child in her arms and another by her side the usual ensnaring questions as to the supremacy of the king etcetera were put to him and the answers being unsatisfactory claverhouse ordered him to say his prayers and prepare for immediate death  brown knew that there was no appeal  all scotland was well aware by that time that soldiers were empowered to act the part of judge jury witness and executioner and had become accustomed to it  the poor man obeyed he knelt down and prayed in such a strain that even the troopers it is said were impressedat all events their subsequent conduct would seem to countenance this belief  their commander however was not much affected for he thrice interrupted his victim telling him that he had given him time to pray but not to preach  sir returned brown ye know neither the nature of preaching nor praying if ye call this preaching  now said claverhouse take farewell of your wife and children  after the poor man had kissed them claverhouse ordered six of his men to fire but they hesitated and finally refused  enraged at this their commander drew a pistol and with his own hand blew out john browns brains  what thinkest thou of thy husband now woman he said turning to the widow  i ever thought much good of him she answered and as much now as ever  it were but justice to lay thee beside him exclaimed the murderer  if you were permitted she replied i doubt not but your cruelty would go that length  thus far the excitement of the dreadful scene enabled the poor creature to reply but nature soon asserted her sway  sinking on her knees by the side of the mangled corpse the widow neither observing nor caring for the departure of the dragoons proceeded to bind up her husbands shattered skull with a kerchief while the pentup tears burst forth  the house stood in a retired solitary spot and for some time the bereaved woman was left alone with god and her children but before darkness closed in a human comforter was sent to her in the person of quentin dick  on his arrival in wigtown quentin finding that his friends the wilson girls had been imprisoned with an old covenanter named mrs mclachlan and that he could not obtain permission to see them resolved to pay a visit to john brown the carrier who was an old friend and who might perhaps afford him counsel regarding the wilsons  leaving ramblin peter behind to watch every event and fetch him word if anything important should transpire he set out and reached the desolated cottage in the evening of the day on which his friend was shot  quentin was naturally a reserved man and had never been able to take a prominent part with his covenanting friends in conversation or in public prayer but the sight of his old friends widow in her agony and her terrified little ones broke down the barrier of reserve completely although a stern and a strong man not prone to give way to feeling he learned that night the full meaning of what it is to weep with those that weep  moreover his tongue was unloosed and he poured forth his soul in prayer and quoted gods word in a way that cheered in no small degree his stricken friend  during several days he remained at priesthill doing all in his power to assist the family and receiving some degree of comfort in return for strong sympathy and fellowship in sorrow had induced him to reveal the fact that he loved margaret wilson who at that time lay in prison with her young sister agnes awaiting their trial in wigtown  seated one night by the carriers desolated hearth where several friends had assembled to mourn with the widow quentin was about to commence family worship when he was interrupted by the sudden entrance of ramblin peter  the expression of his face told eloquently that he brought bad news  the wilsons he said are condemned to be drowned with old mrs mclachlan  no baith o the lasses he added correcting himself for the faither managed to git ane o them off by a bribe o a hundred pounds an thats every bodle that he owns  which is to be drooned asked quentin in a low voice  margetthe auldest  a deep groan burst from the shepherd as the bible fell from his hands  come he said to peter and passed quickly out of the house without a word to those whom he left behind  arrived in wigtown the wretched man went about wildly seeking to move the feelings of men whose hearts were like the nether millstone  oh if i only had siller he exclaimed to the wilsons father clasping his hands in agony  hae ye nae mair  no anither plack said the old man in deepest dejection  they took all i had for aggie  ye are strang quentin suggested peter who now understood the reason of his friends wild despair  could ye no waylay somebody an rob them  surely it wouldna be coonted wrang in the circumstances  sin is sin peter  better death than sin returned quentin with a grave look  aweel we maun just dee then said peter in a tone of resignation  nothing could avert the doom of these unfortunate women  their judges of whom grierson laird of lagg was one indicted this young girl and the old woman with the ridiculous charge of rebellion of having been at the battles of bothwell bridge and airsmoss and present at twenty conventicles as well as with refusing to swear the abjuration oath  the innocent victims were carried to the mouth of the river bladenoch being guarded by troops under major winram and followed by an immense crowd both of friends and spectators  quentin dick and his little friend peter were among them  the former had possessed himself of a stick resembling a quarterstaff  his wild appearance and bloodshot eyes with his great size and strength induced people to keep out of his way  he had only just reached the spot in time  no word did he speak till he came up to major winram  then he sprang forward and said in a loud voice i forbid this execution in the name of god at the same time raising his staff  instantly a trooper spurred forward and cut him down from behind  take him away said winram and quentin while endeavouring to stagger to his feet was ridden down secured and dragged away  poor peter shared his fate  so quickly and quietly was it all done that few except those quite close to them were fully aware of what had occurred  the blow on his head seemed to have stunned the shepherd for he made no resistance while they led him a considerable distance back into the country to a retired spot and placed him with his back against a cliff then the leader of the party told off six men to shoot him  not until they were about to present their muskets did the shepherd seem to realise his position  then an eager look came over his face and he said with a smile ay be quick  maybe ill git there first to welcome her  a volley followed and the soul of quentin dick was released from its tenement of clay  peter on seeing the catastrophe fell backwards in a swoon and the leader of the troop feeling perhaps a touch of pity cast him loose and left him there  returning to the sands the soldiers found that the martyrdom was wellnigh completed  the mouth of the bladenoch has been considerably modified  at this time the rivers course was close along the base of the hill on which wigtown stands  the tide had turned and the flowing sea had already reversed the current of the river  the banks of sand were steep and several feet high at the spot to which the martyrs were led so that people standing on the edge were close above the inrushing stream  two stakes had been driven into the top of the banksone being some distance lower down the river than the other  ropes of a few yards in length were fastened to them and the outer ends tied round the martyrs waistsold mrs mclachlan being attached to the lower post  they were then bidden prepare for death which they did by kneeling down and engaging in fervent prayer  it is said that the younger woman repeated some passages of scripture and even sang part of the 25th psalm  at this point a married daughter of mrs mclachlan named milliken who could not believe that the sentence would really be carried out gave way to violent lamentations and fainted when she saw that her mothers doom was fixed  they carried the poor creature away from the dreadful scene  the old woman was first pushed over the brink of the river and a soldier thrusting her head down into the water with a halbert held it there  this was evidently done to terrify the younger woman into submission for while the aged martyr was struggling in the agonies of death one of the tormentors asked margaret wilson what she thought of that sight  what do i see was her reply  i see christ in one of his members wrestling there  think ye that we are sufferers  no it is christ in us for he sends none a warfare on his own charges  these were her last words as she was pushed over the bank and like her companion forcibly held down with a halbert  before she was quite suffocated however winram ordered her to be dragged out and when able to speak she was asked if she would pray for the king  i wish the salvation of all men she replied and the damnation of none  dear margaret urged a bystander in a voice of earnest entreaty say god save the king say god save the king  god save him if he will she replied  it is his salvation i desire  she has said it she has said it cried the pitying bystanders eagerly  that wont do cried the laird of lagg coming forward at the moment uttering a coarse oath let her take the testoaths  as this meant the repudiation of the covenants and the submission of her conscience to the kingto her mind inexcusable sinthe martyr firmly refused to obey  she was immediately thrust back into the water and in a few minutes more her heroic soul was with her god and saviour  the truth of this storylike that of john brown of priesthill though attested by a letter of claverhouse himself see dr cunninghams history of the church of scotland volume two page 239has been called in question and the whole affair pronounced a myth  we have no space for controversy but it is right to add that if it be a myth the records of the kirksessions of kirkinner and penninghamewhich exist and in which it is recordedmust also be mythical  the truth is that both stories have been elaborately investigated by men of profound learning and unquestionable capacity and the truth of them proved up to the hilt  as to graham of claverhousethere are people we believe who would whitewash the devil if he were only to present himself with a dashing person and a handsome face  but such historians as macaulay mccrie mckenzie and others refuse to whitewash claverhouse  even sir walter scottwho was very decidedly in sympathy with the cavalierssays of him in old mortality he was the unscrupulous agent of the scottish privy council in executing the merciless seventies of the government in scotland during the reigns of charles the second and james the second and his latest apologist candidly admits that it is impossible altogether to acquit claverhouse of the charges laid to his account we are inclined to ask with some surprise why should he wish to acquit him  but claverhouse himself as if in prophetic cynicism writes his own condemnation as to character thus in any service i have been in i never inquired further in the laws than the orders of my superior officer  an appropriate motto for a soldier of fortune which might be abbreviated and paraphrased into stick at nothing  coupling all this with the united testimony of tradition and nearly all ancient historians we can only wonder at the prejudice of those who would still weave a chaplet for the brow of bonnie dundee  turning now from the southwest of scotland we direct attention to the eastern seaboard of kincardine where perched like a seabird on the weatherbeaten cliffs stands the stronghold of dunnottar castle  down in the dungeons of that rugged pile lies our friend andrew black very different from the man whose fortunes we have hitherto followed care torment disease hard usage long confinement and desperate anxiety have graven lines on his face that nothing but death can smooth out  wildlytangled hair with a long shaggy beard and moustache render him almost unrecognisable  only the old unquenchable fire of his eye remains also the kindliness of his old smile when such a rare visitant chances once again to illuminate his worn features  years of suffering had he undergone and there was now little more than skin and bone of him left to undergo more  let me hae a turn at the crack noo he said coming forward to a part of the foul miry dungeon where a crowd of male and female prisoners were endeavouring to inhale a little fresh air through a crevice in the wall im fit to choke for want o a breath o caller air  as he spoke a groan from a dark corner attracted his attention  at once forgetting his own distress he went to the place and discovered one of the prisoners a young man with his head pillowed on a stone and mire some inches deep for his bed  eh sandy are ye sae far gane asked black kneeling beside him in tender sympathy  oh andry manfor a breath o fresh air before i dee  here ane o ye cried black help me to carry sandy to the crack waes me man he added in a lower voice i could hae carried you ye wi my pirlie ance but im little stronger than a bairn noo  sandy was borne to the other side of the dungeon and his head put close to the crevice through which he could see the white ripples on the summer sea far below  a deep inspiration seemed for a moment to give new lifethen a prolonged sigh and the freed happy soul swept from the dungeons of earth to the realms of celestial light and liberty  hes breathin the air o paradise noo said black as he assisted to remove the dead man from the opening which the living were so eager to reach  ye was up in the ither dungeon last night he said turning to the man who had aided him what was a the groans an cries aboot  torturin the puir lads that tried to escape answered the man with a dark frown  hm  i thoucht as muckle  they were gey hard on them i darsay  they were that  ye see the disease thats broke oot amang them whatever it ismade some o them sae desprit that they got through the wundy that looks to the sea an creepit alang the precipice  it was a daftlike thing to try in the daylight but certain death would hae been their lot i suspec if they had ventured on a precipice like that i the dark  some women washin doon below saw them and gied the alarm the gairds cam the hue and cry was raised the yetts were shut and fifteen were catched an brought backbut twentyfive got away  my heart is wae for the fifteen  they were laid on their backs on benches their hands were bound doon to the foot o the forms an burnin matches were putt atween every finger an the sodgers blew on them to keep them alight  the governor ye see had ordered this to gang on withoot stoppin for three oors  some o the puir fallows were deid afore the end o that time an im thinkin the survivorsll be crippled for life  while listening to the horrible tale andrew black resolved on an attempt to escape that very night  wull ye gang wi me he asked of the only comrade whom he thought capable of making the venture but the comrade shook his head  na he said ill no try  theyve starved me to that extent that ive nae strength left  i grow dizzy at the vera thoucht  but dye think the wundys big enough to let ye through  oo ay returned black with a faint smile  i was ower stoot fort ance but its an ill wund that blaws nae guid  stervation has made me thin enough noo  that night when alleven the harassed prisonersin dunnottar castle were asleep except the sentinels the desperate man forced himself with difficulty through the very small window of the dungeon  it was unbarred because opening out on the face of an almost sheer precipice it was thought that nothing without wings could escape from it  black however had been accustomed to precipices from boyhood  he had observed a narrow ledge just under the window and hoped that it might lead to something  just below it he could see another and narrower ledge  what was beyond that he knew notand did not much care  once outside with his breast pressed against the wall of rock he passed along pretty quickly considering that he could not see more than a few yards before him  but presently he came to the end of the ledge and by no stretching out of foot or hand could he find another projection of any kind  he had now to face the great danger of sliding down to the lower ledge and his heart beat audibly against his ribs as he gazed into the profound darkness below  indecision was no part of andrew blacks character  breathing a silent prayer for help and deliverance he sat down on the ledge with his feet overhanging the abyss  for one moment he reconsidered his position  behind him were torture starvation prolonged misery and almost certain death  below was perhaps instantaneous death or possible escape  he pushed off again commending his soul to god and slid down  for an instant destruction seemed inevitable but next moment his heels struck the lower ledge and he remained fast  with an earnest thank god he began to creep along  the ledge conducted him to safer ground and in another quarter of an hour he was free  to get as far and as quickly as possible from dunnottar was now his chief aim  he travelled at his utmost speed till daybreak when he crept into a dry ditch and overcome by fatigue forgot his sorrow in profound unbroken slumber  rising late in the afternoon he made his way to a cottage and begged for bread  they must have suspected what he was and where he came from but they were friendly for they gave him a loaf and a few pence without asking questions  thus he travelled by night and slept by day till he made his way to edinburgh which he entered one evening in the midst of a crowd of people and went straight to candlemaker row  mrs black mrs wallace jean black and poor agnes wilson were in the old room when a tap was heard at the door which immediately opened and a gaunt dishevelled wayworn man appeared  mrs black was startled at first for the man regardless of the other females advanced towards her  then sudden light seemed to flash in her eyes as she extended both hands  mither was all that andrew could say as he grasped them fell on his knees and with a profound sigh laid his head upon her lap  chapter twelve  the darkest hour before the dawn  many months passed away during which andrew black cleanshaved brushedup and converted into a very respectable ordinarylooking artisan carried on the trade of a turner in an underground cellar in one of the most populous parts of the cowgate  lost in the crowd was his idea of security  and he was not far wrong  his cellar had a way of escape through a back door  its grated window under the level of the street admitted light to his whirling lathe but aided by dirt on the glass it baffled the gaze of the curious  his evenings were spent in candlemaker row where seated by the window with his mother mrs wallace and the two girls he smoked his pipe and commented on scotlands woes while gazing across the tombs at the glow in the western sky  ramblin peterno longer a beardless boy but a fairly wellgrown and goodlooking youthwas a constant visitor at the row  aggie wilson had taught him the use of his tongue but peter was not the man to use it in idle flirtationnor aggie the girl to listen if he had done so  they had both seen too much of the stern side of life to condescend on trifling  once by a superhuman effort and with an alarming flush of the countenance peter succeeded in stammering a declaration of his sentiments  aggie with flaming cheeks and downcast eyes accepted the declaration and the matter was settled that was all for the subject had rushed upon both of them as it were unexpectedly and as they were in the public street at the time and the hour was noon further demonstration might have been awkward  thereafter they were understood to be keeping company  but they were a grave couple  if an eavesdropper had ventured to listen sober talk alone would have repaid the sneaking act and not unfrequently reference would have been heard in tones of deepest pathos to dreadful scenes that had occurred on the shores of the solway or sorrowful comments on the awful fate of beloved friends who had been banished to the plantations  one day jeanfairhaired blueeyed pensive jeanwas seated in the cellar with her uncle  she had brought him his daily dinner in a tin can and he having just finished it was about to resume his work while the niece rose to depart  time had transformed jean from a pretty girl into a beautiful woman but there was an expression of profound melancholy on her once bright face which never left it now save when a passing jest called up for an instant a feeble reminiscence of the sweet old smile  noo jean awa wi ye  ill never get thae parritchsticks feenished if ye sit haverin there  something very like the old smile lighted up jeans face as she rose and with a weel goodday uncle left the cellar to its busy occupant  black was still at work and the shadows of evening were beginning to throw the inner end of the cellar into gloom when the door slowly opened and a man entered stealthily  the unusual action as well as the appearance of the man caused black to seize hold of a heavy piece of wood that leaned against his lathe  the thought of being discovered and sent back to dunnottar or hanged had implanted in our friend a salutary amount of caution though it had not in the slightest degree affected his nerve or his cool promptitude in danger  he had deliberately made up his mind to remain quiet as long as he should be let alone but if discovered to escape or die in the attempt  the intruder was a man of great size and strength but as he seemed to be alone black quietly leaned the piece of wood against the lathe again in a handy position  ye seem to hae been takin lessons frae the cats lately to judge from yer step said black  shut the door man behint ye  theres a draft i this place thatll be like to gie ye the rheumatiz  the man obeyed and advancing silently stood before the lathe  there was light enough to reveal the fact that his countenance was handsome though bronzed almost to the colour of mahogany while the lower part of it was hidden by a thick beard and a heavy moustache  black who began to see that the strange visitor had nothing of the appearance of one sent to arrest him said in a halfhumorous remonstrative tone  maybe yere a furriner an dinna understan mainners but its as weel to tell ye that i expec men to tak aff their bannets when they come into my hoose  without speaking the visitor removed his cap  black recognised him in an instant  wull wallace he gasped in a hoarse whisper as he sprang forward and laid violent hands on his old friend  losh man are my een leein ist possable  can this be you  yes thank god it is indeed  he stopped short for andrew albeit unaccustomed like most of his countrymen to give way to ebullitions of strong feeling threw his long arms around his friend and fairly hugged him  he did not indeed condescend on a frenchmans kiss but he gave him a stage embrace and a squeeze that was worthy of a bear  your force is not much abated i seeor rather feel said will wallace when he was released  abated echoed black its little need in thae awfu times  but man your force has increased if im no mistaen  doubtlessit is natural after having toiled with the slaves in barbadoes for so many years  the work was kill or cure out there  but tell memy motherand yours  oh theyre baith weel and hearty thank the lord answered black but what for dye no speer after jean he added in a somewhat disappointed tone  because i dont need to  ive seen her already and know that she is well  seen her exclaimed andrew in surprise  ay you and jean were seated alone at the little window in the candlemaker raw last night about ten oclock and i was standing by a tombstone in the greyfriars churchyard admiring you  i did not like to present myself just then for fear of alarming the dear girl too much and then i did not dare to come here today till the gloamin  i only arrived yesterday  weel weel  the like o this bates a  losh man  i hope its no a dream  nip me man to mak sure  sit doon sit doon an lets hear a aboot it  the story was a long one  before it was quite finished the door was gently opened and jean black herself entered  she had come as was her wont every night to walk home with her uncle  black sprang up  jean my wummin he said hastily putting on his blue bonnet theres no light eneuch for ye to be intryduced to my freend here but ye can hear him if ye canna see him  im gaun oot to see what sort o a night it is  hell tak care o ye till i come back  without awaiting a reply he went out and shut the door and the girl turned in some surprise towards the stranger  jean he said in a low voice holding out both hands  jean did not scream or faint  her position in life as well as her rough experiences forbade such weakness but it did not forbidwell it is not our province to betray confidences  all we can say is that when andrew black returned to the cellar after a prolonged and no doubt scientific inspection of the weather he found that the results of the interview had been quite satisfactoryeminently so  need we say that there were rejoicing and thankful hearts in candlemaker row that night  we think not  if any of the wraiths of the covenanters were hanging about the old churchyard and had peeped in at the wellknown back window about the small hours of the morning they would have seen our hero clasping his mother with his right arm and jean with his left  he was encircled by an eager groupcomposed of mrs black and andrew jock bruce ramblin peter and aggie wilsonwho listened to the stirring tale of his adventures or detailed to him the not less stirring and terrible history of the long period that had elapsed since he was torn from them as they had believed for ever  next morning jean accompanied her lover to the workshop of her uncle who had preceded them as he usually went to work about daybreak  are ye no feared asked jean with an anxious look in her companions face that some of your auld enemies may recognise you  youre so big andand she thought of the word handsome but substituted oddlooking  there is little fear jean  ive been so long away that most of the peoplethe enemies at leastwho knew me must have left besides my bronzed face and bushy beard form a sufficient disguise i should think  im no sure o that returned the girl shaking her head doubtfully an it seems to me that the best thing ye can do will be to gang to the workshop every mornin before its daylight  have ye fairly settled to tak to uncle andrews trade  yes  last night he and i arranged it while you were asleep  i must work you know to earn my living and there is no situation so likely to afford such effectual concealment  bruce offered to take me on again but the smiddy is too public and too much frequented by soldiers  ah jean  i fear that our weddingday is a long way off yet for although i could easily make enough to support you in comfort if there were no difficulties to hamper me there is not much chance of my making a fortune as andrew black says by turning parritchsticks and peeries  wallace tried to speak lightly but could not disguise a tone of despondency  your new king he continued seems as bad as the old one if not worse  from all i hear he seems to have set his heart on bringing the country back again to popery and black will be the lookout if he succeeds in doing that  he has quarrelled they say with his bishops and in his anger is carrying matters against them with a high hand  i fear that there is woe in store for poor scotland yet  it may be so returned jean sadly  the lord knows what is best but he can make the wrath of man to praise him  perhaps she added looking up with a solemn expression on her sweet face perhaps like quentin dick an margaret wilson you an i may never wed  they had reached the east end of the grassmarket as she spoke and had turned into it before she observed that they were going wrong but wallace explained that he had been directed by black to call on ramblin peter who lived there and procure from him some turningtools  on the way they were so engrossed with each other that they did not at first observe the people hurrying towards the lower end of the market  then they became aware that an execution was about to take place  the old story muttered wallace while an almost savage scowl settled on his face  let us hurry by said jean in a low tone  at the moment the unhappy man who was about to be executed raised his voice to speak as was the custom in those times  jean started paused and turned deadly pale  i ken the voice she exclaimed  as the tones rose in strength she turned towards the gallows and almost dragged her companion after her in her eagerness to get near  its mr renwick she said the dear servant o the lord  wallace on seeing her anxiety elbowed his way through the crowd somewhat forcibly and thus made way for jean till they stood close under the gallows  it was a woeful sight in one sense for it was the murder of a fair and goodly as well as godly man in the prime of life yet it was a grand sight inasmuch as it was a noble witnessing unto death for god and truth and justice in the face of prejudice passion and highhanded tyranny  the martyr had been trying to address the crowd for some time but had been barbarously interrupted by the beating of drums  just then a curate approached him and said mr renwick own our king and we will pray for you  its that scoundrel the reverend george lawless murmured wallace in a deep and bitter tone  i am come here replied the martyr to bear my testimony against you and all such as you are  own our king and pray for him whatever ye say of us returned the curate  i will discourse no more with you rejoined renwick  i am in a little to appear before him who is king of kings and lord of lords who shall pour shame contempt and confusion on all the kings of the earth who have not ruled for him  after this renwickas was usual with the martyrs when about to finish their coursesang read a portion of scripture and prayed in the midst of considerable interruption from the drums  he also managed to address the spectators  among the sentences that reached the ears of jean and wallace were the following  i am come here this day to lay down my life for adhering to the truths of christ  i die as a presbyterian protestant  i own the word of god as the rule of faith and manners  i leave my testimony against  all encroachments made on christs rights who is the prince of the kings of the earth  the noise of the drums rendered his voice inaudible at this point and the executioner advancing tied a napkin over his eyes  he was then ordered to go up the ladder  to a friend who stood by him he gave his last messages  among them were the words  keep your ground and the lord will provide you teachers and ministers and when he comes he will make these despised truths glorious in the earth  his last words werelord into thy hands i commit my spirit for thou hast redeemed me lord god of truth  thus fell the last as it turned out of the martyrs of the covenants on the 17th of february 1688  but it did not seem to will wallace that the storm of twentyeight long years had almost blown over as he glanced at the scowling brows and compressed lips of the upturned faces around him  comecome away jean he said quickly as he felt the poor girl hang heavily on his arm and observed the pallor of her face  ay lets gang hame she said faintly  as will turned to go he encountered a face that was very familiar  the owner of it gazed at him inquiringly  it was that of his old comrade in arms glendinning  stooping over his companion as if to address her wallace tried to conceal his face and pushed quickly through the crowd whether glendinning had recognised him or not he could not be sure but from that day forward he became much more careful in his movements went regularly to his work with andrew black before daylight and did not venture to return each night till after dark  it was a weary and irksome state of things but betteras black sagaciously remarkedthan being imprisoned on the bass rock or shut up in dunnottar castle  but the near presence of jean black had no doubt more to do with the resignation of our hero to his position than the fear of imprisonment  as time passed things in the political horizon looked blacker than ever  the king began to show himself more and more in his true coloursas one who had thoroughly made up his mind to rule as an absolute monarch and to reclaim the kingdom to popery  among other things he brought troops over from ireland to enforce his will some of his english troops having made it abundantly plain that they could not be counted on to obey the mandates of one who wished to arrogate to himself unlimited power and showed an utter disregard of the rights of the people  indeed on all hands the kings friends began to forsake him and even his own children fell away from him at last  rumours of these things more or less vague had been reaching edinburgh from time to time causing uneasiness in the minds of some and hope in the hearts of others  one night the usual party of friends had assembled to sup in the dwelling of mrs black  it was the sabbath  wallace and black had remained close all daywith the exception of an hour before daylight in the morning when they had gone out for exercise  it was one of those dreary days not unknown to auld reekie which are inaugurated with a persistent drizzle continued with a scotch mist and dismissed with an even downpour  yet it was by no means a dismal day to our friends of candlemaker row  they were all more or less earnestly religious as well as intellectual so that intercourse in reference to the things of the kingdom of god and reading the word with a freeandeasy commentary by mrs black and much acquiescence on the part of mrs wallace and occasional disputations between andrew and bruce kept them lively and well employed until suppertime  the meal had just been concluded when heavy footfalls were heard on the stair outside and in another moment there was a violent knocking at the door  the men sprang up and instinctively grasped the weapons that came first to hand  wallace seized the pokera new and heavy one andrew the shovel and jock bruce the tongs while ramblin peter possessed himself of a stout rollingpin  placing themselves hastily in front of the women who had drawn together and retreated to a corner they stood on the defensive while mrs black demanded to know who knocked so furiously on a sabbath nicht  instead of answering the visitors burst the door open and halfadozen of the townguard sprang in and levelled their pikes  yield yourselves cried their leader  i arrest you in the kings name  but the four men showed no disposition to yield and the resolute expression of their faces induced their opponents to hesitate  i ken o nae king in this realm said andrew black in a deep stern voice an we refuse to set oor necks under the heel o a usurpin tyrant  do your duty men said a man who had kept in the background but who now stepped to the front  ha this is your doing glendinning exclaimed wallace who recognised his old comrade  the sergeant had obviously been promoted for he wore the costume of a commissioned officer  ay i have an auld score to settle wi you wallace an i hope to see you an your comrades swing in the grassmarket before lang  yell niver see that my man said black as he firmly grasped the shovel  ye haena gotten us yet an its my opeenion that you an your freendsll be in kingdomcome before we swing if ye try to tak us alive  oot o this hoose ye scoondrels  so saying black made a spring worthy of a royal bengal tiger turned aside the pike of the foremost man and brought the shovel down on his iron headpiece with such force that he was driven back into the passage or landing and fell prostrate  black was so ably and promptly seconded by his stalwart comrades that the room was instantly cleared glendinning driven back by an irresistible blow from the rollingpin tripped over the fallen man and went headlong down the winding stairs at the bottom of which he lay dead with his neck broken by the fall  but the repulse thus valiantly effected did not avail them much for the leader of the guard had reinforcements below which he now called up before the door could be shut these swarmed into the room and drove the defenders back into their corner  the leader hesitated however to give the order to advance on them partly it may be because he wished to induce submission and thus avoid bloodshed and partly no doubt because of the terrible aspect of the four desperate men who knowing that the result of their capture would be almost certain death preceded by imprisonment and probably torture had evidently made up their minds to fight to the death  at that critical moment a quick step was heard upon the stair and the next moment the reverend frank selby entered the room  just in time i see he said in a cool nonchalant manner that was habitual to him  i think sir he added turning to the leader of the guard that it may be as well to draw off your men and return to the guardroom  ill do that retorted the man sharply when i receive orders from my superiors  just now ill do my duty  of course you will do what is right my good sir replied the reverend frank yet i venture to think you will regret neglecting my advice which allow me to assure you is given in quite a friendly and disinterested spirit  i have just left the precincts of the council chamber where i was told by a friend in office that the councillors have been thrown into a wild and excusable state of alarm by the news that william prince of orange who perhaps you may know is jamess soninlaw and nephew has landed in torbay with 15000 dutchmen  he comes by invitation of the nobles and clergy of the kingdom to take possession of the crown which our friend james has forfeited and james himself has fled to franceone of the few wise things of which he has ever been guilty  it is further reported that the panicstricken privy council here talks of throwing open all the prisondoors in edinburgh after which it will voluntarily dissolve itself  if it could do so in prussic acid or some chemical solvent suited to the purpose its exit would be hailed as all the more appropriate  meanwhile i am of opinion that all servants of the council would do well to retire into as much privacy as possible and then maintain a careful lookout for squalls  having delivered this oration to the gaping guard the reverend frank crossed the room and went through the forbidden and dangerous performance of shaking hands heartily with the rebels  he was still engaged in this treasonable act and the men of the townguard had not yet recovered from their surprise when hurrying footsteps were again heard on the stair and a man of the townguard sprang into the room went to his chief and whispered in his ear  the result was that with a countenance expressing mingled surprise and anxiety the officer led his men from the scene and left the longpersecuted covenanters in peace  losh man div ee railly think the news can be true asked andrew black after they had settled down and heard it all repeated  indeed i do said the reverend frank earnestly and i thank god that a glorious revolution seems to have taken place and hope that the long long years of persecution are at last drawing to a close  and frank selby was right  the great revolution of 1688 which set william and mary on the throne also banished the tyrannical and despotic house of stuart for ever opened the prison gates to the covenanters restored to some extent the reign of justice and mercy crushed if it did not kill the heads of popery and absolute power and sent a great wave of praise and thanksgiving over the whole land prelacy was no longer forced upon scotland  the rights and liberties of the people were secured and the day had at last come which crowned the struggles and sufferings of half a century  as mrs black remarked  surely the blood o the martyrs has not been shed in vain    but what of the fortunes of those whose adventures we have followed so long  whatever they were the record has not been written yet we have been told by a man whose name we may not divulge but who is an unquestionable authority on the subject that soon after the persecution about which we have been writing had ceased a farmer of the name of black settled down among the bonnie hills of galloway not far from the site of the famous communion stones on skeoch hill where he took to himself a wife that another farmer a married man named wallace went and built a cottage and settled there on a farm close beside black that a certain rú peter became shepherd to the farmer black and with his wife served him faithfully all the days of his life that the families of these men were very large the men among them being handsome and stalwart the women modest and beautiful and that all of them were loyal subjects and earnest enthusiastic covenanters  it has been also said though we do not vouch for the accuracy of the statement that in the kirksession books of the neighbouring kirk of irongray there may be found among the baptisms such names as andrew wallace and will black quentin dick black and jock bruce wallace also an aggie a marion and an isabel peter besides several jeans scattered among the three families  it has likewise been reported on reliable authority that the original mr black whose christian name was andrew was a famous teller of stories and narrator of facts regarding the persecution of the covenanters especially of the awful killingtime when the powers of darkness were let loose on the land to do their worst and when the blood of scotlands martyrs flowed like water  between 1661 when the marquis of argyll was beheaded and 1668 when james renwick suffered there were murdered for the cause of christ and christian liberty about 18000 noble men and women some of whom were titled but the most of whom were unknown to earthly fame  it is a marvellous record of the power of god and well may we give all honour to the martyr band while we exclaim with the ayrshire elder    o for the brave true hearts of old   that bled when the banner perished   o for the faith that was strong in death   the faith that our fathers cherished    the banner might fall but the spirit lived   and liveth for evermore   and scotland claims as her noblest names   the covenant men of yore  the end
