99988114	the figure in the carpet     i had done a few things and earned a few pencei had perhaps even had time to begin to think i was finer than was perceived by the patronising but when i take the little measure of my course a fidgety habit for its none of the longest yet i count my real start from the evening george corvick breathless and worried came in to ask me a service  he had done more things than i and earned more pence though there were chances for cleverness i thought he sometimes missed  i could only however that evening declare to him that he never missed one for kindness  there was almost rapture in hearing it proposed to me to prepare for the middle the organ of our lucubrations so called from the position in the week of its day of appearance an article for which he had made himself responsible and of which tied up with a stout string he laid on my table the subject  i pounced upon my opportunitythat is on the first volume of itand paid scant attention to my friends explanation of his appeal  what explanation could be more to the point than my obvious fitness for the task  i had written on hugh vereker but never a word in the middle where my dealings were mainly with the ladies and the minor poets  this was his new novel an advance copy and whatever much or little it should do for his reputation i was clear on the spot as to what it should do for mine  moreover if i always read him as soon as i could get hold of him i had a particular reason for wishing to read him now i had accepted an invitation to bridges for the following sunday and it had been mentioned in lady janes note that mr vereker was to be there  i was young enough for a flutter at meeting a man of his renown and innocent enough to believe the occasion would demand the display of an acquaintance with his last  corvick who had promised a review of it had not even had time to read it he had gone to pieces in consequence of news requiringas on precipitate reflexion he judgedthat he should catch the night mail to paris  he had had a telegram from gwendolen erme in answer to his letter offering to fly to her aid  i knew already about gwendolen erme i had never seen her but i had my ideas which were mainly to the effect that corvick would marry her if her mother would only die  that lady seemed now in a fair way to oblige him after some dreadful mistake about a climate or a cure she had suddenly collapsed on the return from abroad  her daughter unsupported and alarmed desiring to make a rush for home but hesitating at the risk had accepted our friends assistance and it was my secret belief that at sight of him mrs erme would pull round  his own belief was scarcely to be called secret it discernibly at any rate differed from mine  he had showed me gwendolens photograph with the remark that she wasnt pretty but was awfully interesting she had published at the age of nineteen a novel in three volumes deep down about which in the middle he had been really splendid  he appreciated my present eagerness and undertook that the periodical in question should do no less then at the last with his hand on the door he said to me  of course youll be all right you know  seeing i was a trifle vague he added  i mean you wont be silly  sillyabout vereker  why what do i ever find him but awfully clever  well whats that but silly  what on earth does awfully clever mean  for gods sake try to get at him  dont let him suffer by our arrangement  speak of him you know if you can as i should have spoken of him  i wondered an instant  you mean as far and away the biggest of the lotthat sort of thing  corvick almost groaned  oh you know i dont put them back to back that way its the infancy of art  but he gives me a pleasure so rare the sense ofhe mused a littlesomething or other  i wondered again  the sense pray of want  my dear man thats just what i want you to say  even before he had banged the door i had begun book in hand to prepare myself to say it  i sat up with vereker half the night corvick couldnt have done more than that  he was awfully clever i stuck to that but he wasnt a bit the biggest of the lot  i didnt allude to the lot however i flattered myself that i emerged on this occasion from the infancy of art  its all right they declared vividly at the office and when the number appeared i felt there was a basis on which i could meet the great man  it gave me confidence for a day or twothen that confidence dropped  i had fancied him reading it with relish but if corvick wasnt satisfied how could vereker himself be  i reflected indeed that the heat of the admirer was sometimes grosser even than the appetite of the scribe  corvick at all events wrote me from paris a little illhumouredly  mrs erme was pulling round and i hadnt at all said what vereker gave him the sense of    chapter ii    the effect of my visit to bridges was to turn me out for more profundity  hugh vereker as i saw him there was of a contact so void of angles that i blushed for the poverty of imagination involved in my small precautions  if he was in spirits it wasnt because he had read my review in fact on the sunday morning i felt sure he hadnt read it though the middle had been out three days and bloomed i assured myself in the stiff garden of periodicals which gave one of the ormolu tables the air of a stand at a station  the impression he made on me personally was such that i wished him to read it and i corrected to this end with a surreptitious hand what might be wanting in the careless conspicuity of the sheet  im afraid i even watched the result of my manoeuvre but up to luncheon i watched in vain  when afterwards in the course of our gregarious walk i found myself for half an hour not perhaps without another manoeuvre at the great mans side the result of his affability was a still livelier desire that he shouldnt remain in ignorance of the peculiar justice i had done him  it wasnt that he seemed to thirst for justice on the contrary i hadnt yet caught in his talk the faintest grunt of a grudgea note for which my young experience had already given me an ear  of late he had had more recognition and it was pleasant as we used to say in the middle to see how it drew him out  he wasnt of course popular but i judged one of the sources of his good humour to be precisely that his success was independent of that  he had none the less become in a manner the fashion the critics at least had put on a spurt and caught up with him  we had found out at last how clever he was and he had had to make the best of the loss of his mystery  i was strongly tempted as i walked beside him to let him know how much of that unveiling was my act and there was a moment when i probably should have done so had not one of the ladies of our party snatching a place at his other elbow just then appealed to him in a spirit comparatively selfish  it was very discouraging i almost felt the liberty had been taken with myself  i had had on my tongues end for my own part a phrase or two about the right word at the right time but later on i was glad not to have spoken for when on our return we clustered at tea i perceived lady jane who had not been out with us brandishing the middle with her longest arm  she had taken it up at her leisure she was delighted with what she had found and i saw that as a mistake in a man may often be a felicity in a woman she would practically do for me what i hadnt been able to do for myself some sweet little truths that needed to be spoken i heard her declare thrusting the paper at rather a bewildered couple by the fireplace  she grabbed it away from them again on the reappearance of hugh vereker who after our walk had been upstairs to change something  i know you dont in general look at this kind of thing but its an occasion really for doing so  you havent seen it  then you must  the man has actually got at you at what i always feel you know  lady jane threw into her eyes a look evidently intended to give an idea of what she always felt but she added that she couldnt have expressed it  the man in the paper expressed it in a striking manner  just see there and there where ive dashed it how he brings it out  she had literally marked for him the brightest patches of my prose and if i was a little amused vereker himself may well have been  he showed how much he was when before us all lady jane wanted to read something aloud  i liked at any rate the way he defeated her purpose by jerking the paper affectionately out of her clutch  hed take it upstairs with him and look at it on going to dress  he did this half an hour lateri saw it in his hand when he repaired to his room  that was the moment at which thinking to give her pleasure i mentioned to lady jane that i was the author of the review  i did give her pleasure i judged but perhaps not quite so much as i had expected  if the author was only me the thing didnt seem quite so remarkable  hadnt i had the effect rather of diminishing the lustre of the article than of adding to my own  her ladyship was subject to the most extraordinary drops  it didnt matter the only effect i cared about was the one it would have on vereker up there by his bedroom fire  at dinner i watched for the signs of this impression tried to fancy some happier light in his eyes but to my disappointment lady jane gave me no chance to make sure  i had hoped shed call triumphantly down the table publicly demand if she hadnt been right  the party was largethere were people from outside as well but i had never seen a table long enough to deprive lady jane of a triumph  i was just reflecting in truth that this interminable board would deprive me of one when the guest next me dear womanshe was miss poyle the vicars sister a robust unmodulated personhad the happy inspiration and the unusual courage to address herself across it to vereker who was opposite but not directly so that when he replied they were both leaning forward  she enquired artless body what he thought of lady janes panegyric which she had readnot connecting it however with her righthand neighbour and while i strained my ear for his reply i heard him to my stupefaction call back gaily his mouth full of bread  oh its all rightthe usual twaddle  i had caught verekers glance as he spoke but miss poyles surprise was a fortunate cover for my own  you mean he doesnt do you justice said the excellent woman  vereker laughed out and i was happy to be able to do the same its a charming article he tossed us  miss poyle thrust her chin half across the cloth  oh youre so deep she drove home  as deep as the ocean  all i pretend is that the author doesnt see  but a dish was at this point passed over his shoulder and we had to wait while he helped himself  doesnt see what my neighbour continued  doesnt see anything  dear mehow very stupid  not a bit vereker laughed main  nobody does  the lady on his further side appealed to him and miss poyle sank back to myself  nobody sees anything she cheerfully announced to which i replied that i had often thought so too but had somehow taken the thought for a proof on my own part of a tremendous eye i didnt tell her the article was mine and i observed that lady jane occupied at the end of the table had not caught verekers words  i rather avoided him after dinner for i confess he struck me as cruelly conceited and the revelation was a pain  the usual twaddlemy acute little study  that ones admiration should have had a reserve or two could gall him to that point  i had thought him placid and he was placid enough such a surface was the hard polished glass that encased the bauble of his vanity  i was really ruffled and the only comfort was that if nobody saw anything george corvick was quite as much out of it as i  this comfort however was not sufficient after the ladies had dispersed to carry me in the proper manneri mean in a spotted jacket and humming an airinto the smokingroom  i took my way in some dejection to bed but in the passage i encountered mr vereker who had been up once more to change coming out of his room  he was humming an air and had on a spotted jacket and as soon as he saw me his gaiety gave a start  my dear young man he exclaimed im so glad to lay hands on you  im afraid i most unwittingly wounded you by those words of mine at dinner to miss poyle  i learned but half an hour ago from lady jane that youre the author of the little notice in the middle  i protested that no bones were broken but he moved with me to my own door his hand on my shoulder kindly feeling for a fracture and on hearing that i had come up to bed he asked leave to cross my threshold and just tell me in three words what his qualification of my remarks had represented  it was plain he really feared i was hurt and the sense of his solicitude suddenly made all the difference to me  my cheap review fluttered off into space and the best things i had said in it became flat enough beside the brilliancy of his being there  i can see him there still on my rug in the firelight and his spotted jacket his fine clear face all bright with the desire to be tender to my youth  i dont know what he had at first meant to say but i think the sight of my relief touched him excited him brought up words to his lips from far within  it was so these words presently conveyed to me something that as i afterwards knew he had never uttered to any one  ive always done justice to the generous impulse that made him speak it was simply compunction for a snub unconsciously administered to a man of letters in a position inferior to his own a man of letters moreover in the very act of praising him  to make the thing right he talked to me exactly as an equal and on the ground of what we both loved best  the hour the place the unexpectedness deepened the impression  he couldnt have done anything more intensely effective    chapter iii    i dont quite know how to explain it to you he said but it was the very fact that your notice of my book had a spice of intelligence it was just your exceptional sharpness that produced the feelinga very old story with me i beg you to believeunder the momentary influence of which i used in speaking to that good lady the words you so naturally resent  i dont read the things in the newspapers unless theyre thrust upon me as that one wasits always ones best friend who does it  but i used to read them sometimesten years ago  i dare say they were in general rather stupider then at any rate it always struck me they missed my little point with a perfection exactly as admirable when they patted me on the back as when they kicked me in the shins whenever since ive happened to have a glimpse of them they were still blazing awaystill missing it i mean deliciously  you miss it my dear fellow with inimitable assurance the fact of your being awfully clever and your articles being awfully nice doesnt make a hairs breadth of difference  its quite with you rising young men vereker laughed that i feel most what a failure i am  i listened with keen interest it grew keener as he talked  you a failureheavens  what then may your little point happen to be  have i got to tell you after all these years and labours  there was something in the friendly reproach of thisjocosely exaggeratedthat made me as an ardent young seeker for truth blush to the roots of my hair  im as much in the dark as ever though ive grown used in a sense to my obtuseness at that moment however verekers happy accent made me appear to myself and probably to him a rare dunce  i was on the point of exclaiming ah yes dont tell me  for my honour for that of the craft dont when he went on in a manner that showed he had read my thought and had his own idea of the probability of our some day redeeming ourselves  by my little point i meanwhat shall i call itthe particular thing ive written my books most for  isnt there for every writer a particular thing of that sort the thing that most makes him apply himself the thing without the effort to achieve which he wouldnt write at all the very passion of his passion the part of the business in which for him the flame of art burns most intensely  well its that  i considered a momentthat is i followed at a respectful distance rather gasping  i was fascinatedeasily youll say but i wasnt going after all to be put off my guard  your descriptions certainly beautiful but it doesnt make what you describe very distinct  i promise you it would be distinct if it should dawn on you at all  i saw that the charm of our topic overflowed for my companion into an emotion as lively as my own  at any rate he went on i can speak for myself  theres an idea in my work without which i wouldnt have given a straw for the whole job its the finest fullest intention of the lot and the application of it has been i think a triumph of patience of ingenuity  i ought to leave that to somebody else to say but that nobody does say it is precisely what were talking about  it stretches this little trick of mine from book to book and everything else comparatively plays over the surface of it  the order the form the texture of my books will perhaps some day constitute for the initiated a complete representation of it  so its naturally the thing for the critic to look for  it strikes me my visitor added smiling even as the thing for the critic to find  this seemed a responsibility indeed  you call it a little trick  thats only my little modesty  its really an exquisite scheme  and you hold that youve carried the scheme out  the way ive carried it out is the thing in life i think a bit well of myself for  i had a pause  dont you think you oughtjust a trifleto assist the critic  assist him  what else have i done with every stroke of my pen ive shouted my intention in his great blank face  at this laughing out again vereker laid his hand on my shoulder to show the allusion wasnt to my personal appearance  but you talk about the initiated  there must therefore you see be initiation  what else in heavens name is criticism supposed to be  im afraid i coloured at this too but i took refuge in repeating that his account of his silver lining was poor in something or other that a plain man knows things by  thats only because youve never had a glimpse of it he returned  if you had had one the element in question would soon have become practically all youd see  to me its exactly as palpable as the marble of this chimney besides the critic just isnt a plain man  if he were pray what would he be doing in his neighbours garden  youre anything but a plain man yourself and the very raison detre of you all is that youre little demons of subtlety  if my great affairs a secret thats only because its a secret in spite of itselfthe amazing event has made it one  i not only never took the smallest precaution to keep it so but never dreamed of any such accident if i had i shouldnt in advance have had the heart to go on  as it was i only became aware little by little and meanwhile i had done my work  and now you quite like it i risked  my work  your secret  its the same thing  your guessing that vereker replied is a proof that youre as clever as i say  i was encouraged by this to remark that he would clearly be pained to part with it and he confessed that it was indeed with him now the great amusement of life  i live almost to see if it will ever be detected  he looked at me for a jesting challenge something far within his eyes seemed to peep out  but i neednt worryit wont  you fire me as ive never been fired i declared you make me determined to do or die  then i asked  is it a kind of esoteric message  his countenance fell at thishe put out his hand as if to bid me goodnight  ah my dear fellow it cant be described in cheap journalese  i knew of course hed be awfully fastidious but our talk had made me feel how much his nerves were exposed  i was unsatisfiedi kept hold of his hand  i wont make use of the expression then i said in the article in which i shall eventually announce my discovery though i dare say i shall have hard work to do without it  but meanwhile just to hasten that difficult birth cant you give a fellow a clue  i felt much more at my ease  my whole lucid effort gives him the clueevery page and line and letter  the things as concrete there as a bird in a cage a bait on a hook a piece of cheese in a mousetrap  its stuck into every volume as your foot is stuck into your shoe  it governs every line it chooses every word it dots every i it places every comma  i scratched my head  is it something in the style or something in the thought  an element of form or an element of feeling  he indulgently shook my hand again and i felt my questions to be crude and my distinctions pitiful  goodnight my dear boydont bother about it  after all you do like a fellow  and a little intelligence might spoil it i still detained him  he hesitated  well youve got a heart in your body  is that an element of form or an element of feeling  what i contend that nobody has ever mentioned in my work is the organ of life  i seeits some idea about life some sort of philosophy  unless it be i added with the eagerness of a thought perhaps still happier some kind of game youre up to with your style something youre after in the language  perhaps its a preference for the letter p i ventured profanely to break out  papa potatoes prunesthat sort of thing  he was suitably indulgent  he only said i hadnt got the right letter  but his amusement was over i could see he was bored  there was nevertheless something else i had absolutely to learn  should you be able pen in hand to state it clearly yourselfto name it phrase it formulate it  oh he almost passionately sighed if i were only pen in hand one of you chaps  that would be a great chance for you of course  but why should you despise us chaps for not doing what you cant do yourself  cant do  he opened his eyes  havent i done it in twenty volumes  i do it in my way he continued  go you and dont do it in yours  ours is so devilish difficult i weakly observed  sos mine  we each choose our own  theres no compulsion  you wont come down and smoke  no  i want to think this thing out  youll tell me then in the morning that youve laid me bare  ill see what i can do ill sleep on it  but just one word more i added  we had left the roomi walked again with him a few steps along the passage  this extraordinary general intention as you call itfor thats the most vivid description i can induce you to make of itis then generally a sort of buried treasure  his face lighted  yes call it that though its perhaps not for me to do so  nonsense i laughed  you know youre hugely proud of it  well i didnt propose to tell you so but it is the joy of my soul  you mean its a beauty so rare so great  he waited a little again  the loveliest thing in the world  we had stopped and on these words he left me but at the end of the corridor while i looked after him rather yearningly he turned and caught sight of my puzzled face  it made him earnestly indeed i thought quite anxiously shake his head and wave his finger give it upgive it up  this wasnt a challengeit was fatherly advice  if i had had one of his books at hand id have repeated my recent act of faithid have spent half the night with him  at three oclock in the morning not sleeping remembering moreover how indispensable he was to lady jane i stole down to the library with a candle  there wasnt so far as i could discover a line of his writing in the house    chapter iv    returning to town i feverishly collected them all i picked out each in its order and held it up to the light  this gave me a maddening month in the course of which several things took place one of these the last i may as well immediately mention was that i acted on verekers advice  i renounced my ridiculous attempt  i could really make nothing of the business it proved a dead loss after all i had always as he had himself noted liked him and what now occurred was simply that my new intelligence and vain preoccupation damaged my liking  i not only failed to run a general intention to earth i found myself missing the subordinate intentions i had formerly enjoyed  his books didnt even remain the charming things they had been for me the exasperation of my search put me out of conceit of them  instead of being a pleasure the more they became a resource the less for from the moment i was unable to follow up the authors hint i of course felt it a point of honour not to make use professionally of my knowledge of them i had no knowledgenobody had any  it was humiliating but i could bear itthey only annoyed me now  at last they even bored me and i accounted for my confusionperversely i allowby the idea that vereker had made a fool of me  the buried treasure was a bad joke the general intention a monstrous pose  the great point of it all is however that i told george corvick what had befallen me and that my information had an immense effect upon him  he had at last come back but so unfortunately had mrs erme and there was as yet i could see no question of his nuptials  he was immensely stirred up by the anecdote i had brought from bridges it fell in so completely with the sense he had had from the first that there was more in vereker than met the eye  when i remarked that the eye seemed what the printed page had been expressly invented to meet he immediately accused me of being spiteful because i had been foiled  our commerce had always that pleasant latitude  the thing vereker had mentioned to me was exactly the thing he corvick had wanted me to speak of in my review  on my suggesting at last that with the assistance i had now given him he would doubtless be prepared to speak of it himself he admitted freely that before doing this there was more he must understand  what he would have said had he reviewed the new book was that there was evidently in the writers inmost art something to be understood  i hadnt so much as hinted at that  no wonder the writer hadnt been flattered  i asked corvick what he really considered he meant by his own supersubtlety and unmistakeably kindled he replied  it isnt for the vulgarit isnt for the vulgar  he had hold of the tail of something he would pull hard pull it right out  he pumped me dry on verekers strange confidence and pronouncing me the luckiest of mortals mentioned half a dozen questions he wished to goodness i had had the gumption to put  yet on the other hand he didnt want to be told too much it would spoil the fun of seeing what would come  the failure of my fun was at the moment of our meeting not complete but i saw it ahead and corvick saw that i saw it  i on my side saw likewise that one of the first things he would do would be to rush off with my story to gwendolen  on the very day after my talk with him i was surprised by the receipt of a note from hugh vereker to whom our encounter at bridges had been recalled as he mentioned by his falling in a magazine on some article to which my signature was attached  i read it with great pleasure he wrote and remembered under its influence our lively conversation by your bedroom fire  the consequence of this has been that i begin to measure the temerity of my having saddled you with a knowledge that you may find something of a burden  now that the fits over i cant imagine how i came to be moved so much beyond my wont  i had never before mentioned no matter in what state of expansion the fact of my little secret and i shall never speak of that mystery again  i was accidentally so much more explicit with you than it had ever entered into my game to be that i find this gamei mean the pleasure of playing itsuffers considerably  in short if you can understand it ive rather spoiled my sport  i really dont want to give anybody what i believe you clever young men call the tip thats of course a selfish solicitude and i name it to you for what it may be worth to you  if youre disposed to humour me dont repeat my revelation  think me dementedits your right but dont tell anybody why  the sequel to this communication was that as early on the morrow as i dared i drove straight to mr verekers door  he occupied in those years one of the honest old houses in kensington square  he received me immediately and as soon as i came in i saw i hadnt lost my power to minister to his mirth  he laughed out at sight of my face which doubtless expressed my perturbation  i had been indiscreetmy compunction was great  i have told somebody i panted and im sure that person will by this time have told somebody else  its a woman into the bargain  the person youve told  no the other person  im quite sure he must have told her  for all the good it will do heror do me  a woman will never find out  no but shell talk all over the place  shell do just what you dont want  vereker thought a moment but wasnt so disconcerted as i had feared  he felt that if the harm was done it only served him right  it doesnt matterdont worry  ill do my best i promise you that your talk with me shall go no further  very good do what you can  in the meantime i pursued george corvicks possession of the tip may on his part really lead to something  that will be a brave day  i told him about corvicks cleverness his admiration the intensity of his interest in my anecdote and without making too much of the divergence of our respective estimates mentioned that my friend was already of opinion that he saw much further into a certain affair than most people  he was quite as fired as i had been at bridges  he was moreover in love with the young lady perhaps the two together would puzzle something out  vereker seemed struck with this  do you mean theyre to be married  i dare say thats what it will come to  that may help them he conceded but we must give them time  i spoke of my own renewed assault and confessed my difficulties whereupon he repeated his former advice  give it up give it up he evidently didnt think me intellectually equipped for the adventure  i stayed half an hour and he was most goodnatured but i couldnt help pronouncing him a man of unstable moods  he had been free with me in a mood he had repented in a mood and now in a mood he had turned indifferent  this general levity helped me to believe that so far as the subject of the tip went there wasnt much in it  i contrived however to make him answer a few more questions about it though he did so with visible impatience for himself beyond doubt the thing we were all so blank about was vividly there  it was something i guessed in the primal plan something like a complex figure in a persian carpet  he highly approved of this image when i used it and he used another himself its the very string he said that my pearls are strung on the reason of his note to me had been that he really didnt want to give us a grain of succourour density was a thing too perfect in its way to touch  he had formed the habit of depending on it and if the spell was to break it must break by some force of its own he comes back to me from that last occasionfor i was never to speak to him againas a man with some safe preserve for sport  i wondered as i walked away where he had got his tip    chapter v    when i spoke to george corvick of the caution i had received he made me feel that any doubt of his delicacy would be almost an insult  he had instantly told gwendolen but gwendolens ardent response was in itself a pledge of discretion  the question would now absorb them and would offer them a pastime too precious to be shared with the crowd  they appeared to have caught instinctively at verekers high idea of enjoyment  their intellectual pride however was not such as to make them indifferent to any further light i might throw on the affair they had in hand  they were indeed of the artistic temperament and i was freshly struck with my colleagues power to excite himself over a question of art hed call it letters hed call it life but it was all one thing in what he said i now seemed to understand that he spoke equally for gwendolen to whom as soon as mrs erme was sufficiently better to allow her a little leisure he made a point of introducing me  i remember our going together one sunday in august to a huddled house in chelsea and my renewed envy of corvicks possession of a friend who had some light to mingle with his own he could say things to her that i could never say to him  she had indeed no sense of humour and with her pretty way of holding her head on one side was one of those persons whom you want as the phrase is to shake but who have learnt hungarian by themselves she conversed perhaps in hungarian with corvick she had remarkably little english for his friend  corvick afterwards told me that i had chilled her by my apparent indisposition to oblige them with the detail of what vereker had said to me  i allowed that i felt i had given thought enough to that indication  hadnt i even made up my mind that it was vain and would lead nowhere  the importance they attached to it was irritating and quite envenomed my doubts  that statement looks unamiable and what probably happened was that i felt humiliated at seeing other persons deeply beguiled by an experiment that had brought me only chagrin  i was out in the cold while by the evening fire under the lamp they followed the chase for which i myself had sounded the horn  they did as i had done only more deliberately and sociablythey went over their author from the beginning  there was no hurry corvick said the future was before them and the fascination could only grow they would take him page by page as they would take one of the classics inhale him in slow draughts and let him sink all the way in  they would scarce have got so wound up i think if they hadnt been in love  poor verekers inner meaning gave them endless occasion to put and to keep their young heads together  none the less it represented the kind of problem for which corvick had a special aptitude drew out the particular pointed patience of which had he lived he would have given more striking and it is to be hoped more fruitful examples  he at least was in verekers words a little demon of subtlety  we had begun by disputing but i soon saw that without my stirring a finger his infatuation would have its bad hours  he would bound off on false scents as i had done he would clap his hands over new lights and see them blown out by the wind of the turned page  he was like nothing i told him but the maniacs who embrace some bedlamitical theory of the cryptic character of shakespeare  to this he replied that if we had had shakespeares own word for his being cryptic he would at once have accepted it  the case there was altogether differentwe had nothing but the word of mr snooks  i returned that i was stupefied to see him attach such importance even to the word of mr vereker  he wanted thereupon to know if i treated mr verekers word as a lie  i wasnt perhaps prepared in my unhappy rebound to go so far as that but i insisted that till the contrary was proved i should view it as too fond an imagination  i didnt i confess sayi didnt at that time quite knowall i felt  deep down as miss erme would have said i was uneasy i was expectant at the core of my disconcerted statefor my wonted curiosity lived in its asheswas the sharpness of a sense that corvick would at last probably come out somewhere  he made in defence of his credulity a great point of the fact that from of old in his study of this genius he had caught whiffs and hints of he didnt know what faint wandering notes of a hidden music  that was just the rarity that was the charm  it fitted so perfectly into what i reported  if i returned on several occasions to the little house in chelsea i dare say it was as much for news of vereker as for news of miss ermes ailing parent  the hours spent there by corvick were present to my fancy as those of a chessplayer bent with a silent scowl all the lamplit winter over his board and his moves  as my imagination filled it out the picture held me fast  on the other side of the table was a ghostlier form the faint figure of an antagonist goodhumouredly but a little wearily securean antagonist who leaned back in his chair with his hands in his pockets and a smile on his fine clear face  close to corvick behind him was a girl who had begun to strike me as pale and wasted and even on more familiar view as rather handsome and who rested on his shoulder and hung on his moves  he would take up a chessman and hold it poised a while over one of the little squares and then would put it back in its place with a long sigh of disappointment  the young lady at this would slightly but uneasily shift her position and look across very hard very long very strangely at their dim participant  i had asked them at an early stage of the business if it mightnt contribute to their success to have some closer communication with him  the special circumstances would surely be held to have given me a right to introduce them  corvick immediately replied that he had no wish to approach the altar before he had prepared the sacrifice  he quite agreed with our friend both as to the delight and as to the honour of the chasehe would bring down the animal with his own rifle when i asked him if miss erme were as keen a shot he said after thinking  no im ashamed to say she wants to set a trap  shed give anything to see him she says she requires another tip  shes really quite morbid about it  but she must play fairshe shant see him he emphatically added  i wondered if they hadnt even quarrelled a little on the subjecta suspicion not corrected by the way he more than once exclaimed to me  shes quite incredibly literary you knowquite fantastically  i remember his saying of her that she felt in italics and thought in capitals  oh when ive run him to earth he also said then you know i shall knock at his door  ratheri beg you to believe  ill have it from his own lips  right you are my boy youve done it this time  he shall crown me victorwith the critical laurel  meanwhile he really avoided the chances london life might have given him of meeting the distinguished novelist a danger however that disappeared with verekers leaving england for an indefinite absence as the newspapers announcedgoing to the south for motives connected with the health of his wife which had long kept her in retirement  a yearmore than a yearhad elapsed since the incident at bridges but i had had no further sight of him  i think i was at bottom rather ashamedi hated to remind him that though i had irremediably missed his point a reputation for acuteness was rapidly overtaking me  this scruple led me a dance kept me out of lady janes house made me even decline when in spite of my bad manners she was a second time so good as to make me a sign an invitation to her beautiful seat  i once became aware of her under verekers escort at a concert and was sure i was seen by them but i slipped out without being caught  i felt as on that occasion i splashed along in the rain that i couldnt have done anything else and yet i remember saying to myself that it was hard was even cruel  not only had i lost the books but i had lost the man himself  they and their author had been alike spoiled for me  i knew too which was the loss i most regretted  i had taken to the man still more than i had ever taken to the books    chapter vi    six months after our friend had left england george corvick who made his living by his pen contracted for a piece of work which imposed on him an absence of some length and a journey of some difficulty and his undertaking of which was much of a surprise to me  his brotherinlaw had become editor of a great provincial paper and the great provincial paper in a fine flight of fancy had conceived the idea of sending a special commissioner to india  special commissioners had begun in the metropolitan press to be the fashion and the journal in question must have felt it had passed too long for a mere country cousin  corvick had no hand i knew for the big brush of the correspondent but that was his brotherinlaws affair and the fact that a particular task was not in his line was apt to be with himself exactly a reason for accepting it  he was prepared to outherod the metropolitan press he took solemn precautions against priggishness he exquisitely outraged taste  nobody ever knew it that offended principle was all his own  in addition to his expenses he was to be conveniently paid and i found myself able to help him for the usual fat book to a plausible arrangement with the usual fat publisher  i naturally inferred that his obvious desire to make a little money was not unconnected with the prospect of a union with gwendolen erme  i was aware that her mothers opposition was largely addressed to his want of means and of lucrative abilities but it so happened that on my saying the last time i saw him something that bore on the question of his separation from our young lady he brought out with an emphasis that startled me  ah im not a bit engaged to her you know  not overtly i answered because her mother doesnt like you but ive always taken for granted a private understanding  well there was one  but there isnt now  that was all he said save something about mrs ermes having got on her feet again in the most extraordinary waya remark pointing as i supposed the moral that private understandings were of little use when the doctor didnt share them  what i took the liberty of more closely inferring was that the girl might in some way have estranged him well if he had taken the turn of jealousy for instance it could scarcely be jealousy of me  in that caseover and above the absurdity of ithe wouldnt have gone away just to leave us together  for some time before his going we had indulged in no allusion to the buried treasure and from his silence which my reserve simply emulated i had drawn a sharp conclusion  his courage had dropped his ardour had gone the way of minethis appearance at least he left me to scan  more than that he couldnt do he couldnt face the triumph with which i might have greeted an explicit admission  he neednt have been afraid poor dear for i had by this time lost all need to triumph  in fact i considered i showed magnanimity in not reproaching him with his collapse for the sense of his having thrown up the game made me feel more than ever how much i at last depended on him  if corvick had broken down i should never know no one would be of any use if he wasnt it wasnt a bit true i had ceased to care for knowledge little by little my curiosity not only had begun to ache again but had become the familiar torment of my days and my nights  there are doubtless people to whom torments of such an order appear hardly more natural than the contortions of disease but i dont after all know why i should in this connexion so much as mention them  for the few persons at any rate abnormal or not with whom my anecdote is concerned literature was a game of skill and skill meant courage and courage meant honour and honour meant passion meant life  the stake on the table was of a special substance and our roulette the revolving mind but we sat round the green board as intently as the grim gamblers at monte carlo  gwendolen erme for that matter with her white face and her fixed eyes was of the very type of the lean ladies one had met in the temples of chance i recognised in corvicks absence that she made this analogy vivid it was extravagant i admit the way she lived for the art of the pen  her passion visibly preyed on her and in her presence i felt almost tepid  i got hold of deep down again  it was a desert in which she had lost herself but in which too she had dug a wonderful hole in the sanda cavity out of which corvick had still more remarkably pulled her  early in march i had a telegram from her in consequence of which i repaired immediately to chelsea where the first thing she said to me was  he has got it he has got it  she was moved as i could see to such depths that she must mean the great thing  verekers idea  his general intention  george has cabled from bombay  she had the missive open there it was emphatic though concise eureka  immense  that was allhe had saved the cost of the signature  i shared her emotion but i was disappointed  he doesnt say what it is  how could hein a telegram  hell write it  but how does he know  know its the real thing  oh im sure that when you see it you do know  vera incessu patuit dea  its you miss erme who are a dear for bringing me such news i went all lengths in my high spirits  but fancy finding our goddess in the temple of vishnu  how strange of george to have been able to go into the thing again in the midst of such different and such powerful solicitations  he hasnt gone into it i know its the thing itself let severely alone for six months that has simply sprung out at him like a tigress out of the jungle  he didnt take a book with him on purpose indeed he wouldnt have needed tohe knows every page as i do by heart  they all worked in him together and some day somewhere when he wasnt thinking they fell in all their superb intricacy into the one right combination  the figure in the carpet came out  thats the way he knew it would come and the real reasonyou didnt in the least understand but i suppose i may tell you nowwhy he went and why i consented to his going  we knew the change would do itthat the difference of thought of scene would give the needed touch the magic shake  we had perfectly we had admirably calculated  the elements were all in his mind and in the secousse of a new and intense experience they just struck light  she positively struck light herselfshe was literally facially luminous  i stammered something about unconscious cerebration and she continued  hell come right homethis will bring him  to see vereker you mean  to see verekerand to see me  think what hell have to tell me  i hesitated  about india  about fiddlesticks  about verekerabout the figure in the carpet  but as you say we shall surely have that in a letter  she thought like one inspired and i remembered how corvick had told me long before that her face was interesting  perhaps it cant be got into a letter if its immense  perhaps not if its immense bosh  if he has hold of something that cant be got into a letter he hasnt hold of the thing verekers own statement to me was exactly that the figure would fit into a letter  well i cabled to george an hour agotwo words said gwendolen  is it indiscreet of me to ask what they were  she hung fire but at last brought them out  angel write  good i exclaimed  ill make it sureill send him the same    chapter vii    my words however were not absolutely the samei put something instead of angel and in the sequel my epithet seemed the more apt for when eventually we heard from our traveller it was merely it was thoroughly to be tantalised  he was magnificent in his triumph he described his discovery as stupendous but his ecstasy only obscured itthere were to be no particulars till he should have submitted his conception to the supreme authority  he had thrown up his commission he had thrown up his book he had thrown up everything but the instant need to hurry to rapallo on the genoese shore where vereker was making a stay  i wrote him a letter which was to await him at adeni besought him to relieve my suspense  that he had found my letter was indicated by a telegram which reaching me after weary days and in the absence of any answer to my laconic dispatch to him at bombay was evidently intended as a reply to both communications  those few words were in familiar french the french of the day which covick often made use of to show he wasnt a prig  it had for some persons the opposite effect but his message may fairly be paraphrased  have patience i want to see as it breaks on you the face youll make  tellement envie de voir ta tetethat was what i had to sit down with  i can certainly not be said to have sat down for i seem to remember myself at this time as rattling constantly between the little house in chelsea and my own  our impatience gwendolens and mine was equal but i kept hoping her light would be greater  we all spent during this episode for people of our means a great deal of money in telegrams and cabs and i counted on the receipt of news from rapallo immediately after the junction of the discoverer with the discovered  the interval seemed an age but late one day i heard a hansom precipitated to my door with the crash engendered by a hint of liberality  i lived with my heart in my mouth and accordingly bounded to the windowa movement which gave me a view of a young lady erect on the footboard of the vehicle and eagerly looking up at my house  at sight of me she flourished a paper with a movement that brought me straight down the movement with which in melodramas handkerchiefs and reprieves are flourished at the foot of the scaffold  just seen verekernot a note wrong  pressed me to bosomkeeps me a month  so much i read on her paper while the cabby dropped a grin from his perch  in my excitement i paid him profusely and in hers she suffered it then as he drove away we started to walk about and talk  we had talked heaven knows enough before but this was a wondrous lift  we pictured the whole scene at rapallo where he would have written mentioning my name for permission to call that is i pictured it having more material than my companion whom i felt hang on my lips as we stopped on purpose before shopwindows we didnt look into  about one thing we were clear  if he was staying on for fuller communication we should at least have a letter from him that would help us through the dregs of delay  we understood his staying on and yet each of us saw i think that the other hated it  the letter we were clear about arrived it was for gwendolen and i called on her in time to save her the trouble of bringing it to me  she didnt read it out as was natural enough but she repeated to me what it chiefly embodied  this consisted of the remarkable statement that hed tell her after they were married exactly what she wanted to know  only then when im his wifenot before she explained  its tantamount to sayingisnt itthat i must marry him straight off  she smiled at me while i flushed with disappointment a vision of fresh delay that made me at first unconscious of my surprise  it seemed more than a hint that on me as well he would impose some tiresome condition  suddenly while she reported several more things from his letter i remembered what he had told me before going away  he had found mr vereker deliriously interesting and his own possession of the secret a real intoxication  the buried treasure was all gold and gems  now that it was there it seemed to grow and grow before him it would have been through all time and taking all tongues one of the most wonderful flowers of literary art  nothing in especial once you were face to face with it could show for more consummately done when once it came out it came out was there with a splendour that made you ashamed and there hadnt been save in the bottomless vulgarity of the age with every one tasteless and tainted every sense stopped the smallest reason why it should have been overlooked  it was great yet so simple was simple yet so great and the final knowledge of it was an experience quite apart  he intimated that the charm of such an experience the desire to drain it in its freshness to the last drop was what kept him there close to the source  gwendolen frankly radiant as she tossed me these fragments showed the elation of a prospect more assured than my own  that brought me back to the question of her marriage prompted me to ask if what she meant by what she had just surprised me with was that she was under an engagement  of course i am she answered  didnt you know it  she seemed astonished but i was still more so for corvick had told me the exact contrary  i didnt mention this however i only reminded her how little i had been on that score in her confidence or even in corvicks and that moreover i wasnt in ignorance of her mothers interdict  at bottom i was troubled by the disparity of the two accounts but after a little i felt corvicks to be the one i least doubted  this simply reduced me to asking myself if the girl had on the spot improvised an engagementvamped up an old one or dashed off a newin order to arrive at the satisfaction she desired  she must have had resources of which i was destitute but she made her case slightly more intelligible by returning presently  what the state of things has been is that we felt of course bound to do nothing in mammas lifetime  but now you think youll just dispense with mammas consent  ah it maynt come to that  i wondered what it might come to and she went on  poor dear she may swallow the dose  in fact you know she added with a laugh she really musta proposition of which on behalf of every one concerned i fully acknowledged the force    chapter viii    nothing more vexatious had ever happened to me than to become aware before corvicks arrival in england that i shouldnt be there to put him through  i found myself abruptly called to germany by the alarming illness of my younger brother who against my advice had gone to munich to study at the feet indeed of a great master the art of portraiture in oils  the near relative who made him an allowance had threatened to withdraw it if he should under specious pretexts turn for superior truth to parisparis being somehow for a cheltenham aunt the school of evil the abyss  i deplored this prejudice at the time and the deep injury of it was now visiblefirst in the fact that it hadnt saved the poor boy who was clever frail and foolish from congestion of the lungs and second in the greater break with london to which the event condemned me  im afraid that what was uppermost in my mind during several anxious weeks was the sense that if we had only been in paris i might have run over to see corvick  this was actually out of the question from every point of view  my brother whose recovery gave us both plenty to do was ill for three months during which i never left him and at the end of which we had to face the absolute prohibition of a return to england  the consideration of climate imposed itself and he was in no state to meet it alone  i took him to meran and there spent the summer with him trying to show him by example how to get back to work and nursing a rage of another sort that i tried not to show him  the whole business proved the first of a series of phenomena so strangely interlaced that taken togetherwhich was how i had to take themthey form as good an illustration as i can recall of the manner in which for the good of his soul doubtless fate sometimes deals with a mans avidity  these incidents certainly had larger bearings than the comparatively meagre consequence we are here concerned withthough i feel that consequence also a thing to speak of with some respect  its mainly in such a light i confess at any rate that the ugly fruit of my exile is at this hour present to me  even at first indeed the spirit in which my avidity as i have called it made me regard that term owed no element of ease to the fact that before coming back from rapallo george corvick addressed me in a way i objected to  his letter had none of the sedative action i must today profess myself sure he had wished to give it and the march of occurrences was not so ordered as to make up for what it lacked  he had begun on the spot for one of the quarterlies a great last word on verekers writings and this exhaustive study the only one that would have counted have existed was to turn on the new light to utteroh so quietlythe unimagined truth  it was in other words to trace the figure in the carpet through every convolution to reproduce it in every tint  the result according to my friend would be the greatest literary portrait ever painted and what he asked of me was just to be so good as not to trouble him with questions till he should hang up his masterpiece before me  he did me the honour to declare that putting aside the great sitter himself all aloft in his indifference i was individually the connoisseur he was most working for  i was therefore to be a good boy and not try to peep under the curtain before the show was ready  i should enjoy it all the more if i sat very still  i did my best to sit very still but i couldnt help giving a jump on seeing in the times after i had been a week or two in munich and before as i knew corvick had reached london the announcement of the sudden death of poor mrs erme  i instantly by letter appealed to gwendolen for particulars and she wrote me that her mother had yielded to longthreatened failure of the heart  she didnt say but i took the liberty of reading into her words that from the point of view of her marriage and also of her eagerness which was quite a match for mine this was a solution more prompt than could have been expected and more radical than waiting for the old lady to swallow the dose  i candidly admit indeed that at the timefor i heard from her repeatedlyi read some singular things into gwendolens words and some still more extraordinary ones into her silences  pen in hand this way i live the time over and it brings back the oddest sense of my having been both for months and in spite of myself a kind of coerced spectator  all my life had taken refuge in my eyes which the procession of events appeared to have committed itself to keep astare  there were days when i thought of writing to hugh vereker and simply throwing myself on his charity  but i felt more deeply that i hadnt fallen quite so lowbesides which quite properly he would send me about my business  mrs ermes death brought corvick straight home and within the month he was united very quietlyas quietly i seemed to make out as he meant in his article to bring out his trouvailleto the young lady he had loved and quitted  i use this last term i may parenthetically say because i subsequently grew sure that at the time he went to india at the time of his great news from bombay there had been no positive pledge between them whatever  there had been none at the moment she was affirming to me the very opposite  on the other hand he had certainly become engaged the day he returned  the happy pair went down to torquay for their honeymoon and there in a reckless hour it occurred to poor corvick to take his young bride a drive  he had no command of that business  this had been brought home to me of old in a little tour we had once made together in a dogcart  in a dogcart he perched his companion for a rattle over devonshire hills on one of the likeliest of which he brought his horse who it was true had bolted down with such violence that the occupants of the cart were hurled forward and that he fell horribly on his head  he was killed on the spot gwendolen escaped unhurt  i pass rapidly over the question of this unmitigated tragedy of what the loss of my best friend meant for me and i complete my little history of my patience and my pain by the frank statement of my having in a postscript to my very first letter to her after the receipt of the hideous news asked mrs corvick whether her husband mightnt at least have finished the great article on vereker  her answer was as prompt as my question  the article which had been barely begun was a mere heartbreaking scrap  she explained that our friend abroad had just settled down to it when interrupted by her mothers death and that then on his return he had been kept from work by the engrossments into which that calamity was to plunge them  the opening pages were all that existed they were striking they were promising but they didnt unveil the idol that great intellectual feat was obviously to have formed his climax  she said nothing more nothing to enlighten me as to the state of her own knowledgethe knowledge for the acquisition of which i had fancied her prodigiously acting  this was above all what i wanted to know  had she seen the idol unveiled  had there been a private ceremony for a palpitating audience of one  for what else but that ceremony had the nuptials taken place  i didnt like as yet to press her though when i thought of what had passed between us on the subject in corvicks absence her reticence surprised me  it was therefore not till much later from meran that i risked another appeal risked it in some trepidation for she continued to tell me nothing  did you hear in those few days of your blighted bliss i wrote what we desired so to hear  i said we as a little hint and she showed me she could take a little hint i heard everything she replied and i mean to keep it to myself    chapter ix    it was impossible not to be moved with the strongest sympathy for her and on my return to england i showed her every kindness in my power  her mothers death had made her means sufficient and she had gone to live in a more convenient quarter  but her loss had been great and her visitation cruel it never would have occurred to me moreover to suppose she could come to feel the possession of a technical tip of a piece of literary experience a counterpoise to her grief  strange to say none the less i couldnt help believing after i had seen her a few times that i caught a glimpse of some such oddity  i hasten to add that there had been other things i couldnt help believing or at least imagining and as i never felt i was really clear about these so as to the point i here touch on i give her memory the benefit of the doubt stricken and solitary highly accomplished and now in her deep mourning her maturer grace and her uncomplaining sorrow incontestably handsome she presented herself as leading a life of singular dignity and beauty  i had at first found a way to persuade myself that i should soon get the better of the reserve formulated the week after the catastrophe in her reply to an appeal as to which i was not unconscious that it might strike her as mistimed  certainly that reserve was something of a shock to mecertainly it puzzled me the more i thought of it and even though i tried to explain it with moments of success by an imputation of exalted sentiments of superstitious scruples of a refinement of loyalty  certainly it added at the same time hugely to the price of verekers secret precious as this mystery already appeared  i may as well confess abjectly that mrs corvicks unexpected attitude was the final tap on the nail that was to fix fast my luckless idea convert it into the obsession of which im for ever conscious  but this only helped me the more to be artful to be adroit to allow time to elapse before renewing my suit  there were plenty of speculations for the interval and one of them was deeply absorbing  corvick had kept his information from his young friend till after the removal of the last barrier to their intimacythen only had he let the cat out of the bag  was it gwendolens idea taking a hint from him to liberate this animal only on the basis of the renewal of such a relation  was the figure in the carpet traceable or describable only for husbands and wivesfor lovers supremely united  it came back to me in a mystifying manner that in kensington square when i mentioned that corvick would have told the girl he loved some word had dropped from vereker that gave colour to this possibility  there might be little in it but there was enough to make me wonder if i should have to marry mrs corvick to get what i wanted  was i prepared to offer her this price for the blessing of her knowledge  ah that way madness layso i at least said to myself in bewildered hours  i could see meanwhile the torch she refused to pass on flame away in her chamber of memorypour through her eyes a light that shone in her lonely house  at the end of six months i was fully sure of what this warm presence made up to her for  we had talked again and again of the man who had brought us togetherof his talent his character his personal charm his certain career his dreadful doom and even of his clear purpose in that great study which was to have been a supreme literary portrait a kind of critical vandyke or velasquez she had conveyed to me in abundance that she was tonguetied by her perversity by her piety that she would never break the silence it had not been given to the right person as she said to break the hour however finally arrived  one evening when i had been sitting with her longer than usual i laid my hand firmly on her arm  now at last what is it  she had been expecting me and was ready  she gave a long slow soundless headshake merciful only in being inarticulate  this mercy didnt prevent its hurling at me the largest finest coldest never i had yet in the course of a life that had known denials had to take full in the face  i took it and was aware that with the hard blow the tears had come into my eyes  so for a while we sat and looked at each other after which i slowly rose i was wondering if some day she would accept me but this was not what i brought out  i said as i smoothed down my hat  i know what to think then  its nothing  a remote disdainful pity for me gathered in her dim smile then she spoke in a voice that i hear at this hour  its my life  as i stood at the door she added  youve insulted him  do you mean vereker  i mean the dead  i recognised when i reached the street the justice of her charge yes it was her lifei recognised that too but her life none the less made room with the lapse of time for another interest  a year and a half after corvicks death she published in a single volume her second novel overmastered which i pounced on in the hope of finding in it some telltale echo or some peeping face  all i found was a much better book than her younger performance showing i thought the better company she had kept  as a tissue tolerably intricate it was a carpet with a figure of its own but the figure was not the figure i was looking for  on sending a review of it to the middle i was surprised to learn from the office that a notice was already in type  when the paper came out i had no hesitation in attributing this article which i thought rather vulgarly overdone to drayton deane who in the old days had been something of a friend of corvicks yet had only within a few weeks made the acquaintance of his widow  i had had an early copy of the book but deane had evidently had an earlier  he lacked all the same the light hand with which corvick had gilded the gingerbreadhe laid on the tinsel in splotches    chapter x    six months later appeared the right of way the last chance though we didnt know it that we were to have to redeem ourselves written wholly during verekers sojourn abroad the book had been heralded in a hundred paragraphs by the usual ineptitudes  i carried it as early a copy as any i this time flattered myself straightway to mrs corvick  this was the only use i had for it i left the inevitable tribute of the middle to some more ingenious mind and some less irritated temper  but i already have it gwendolen said  drayton deane was so good as to bring it to me yesterday and ive just finished it  yesterday  how did he get it so soon  he gets everything so soon  hes to review it in the middle  hedrayton deanereview vereker  i couldnt believe my ears  why not  one fine ignorance is as good as another  i winced but i presently said  you ought to review him yourself  i dont review she laughed  im reviewed  just then the door was thrown open  ah yes heres your reviewer  drayton deane was there with his long legs and his tall forehead  he had come to see what she thought of the right of way and to bring news that was singularly relevant  the evening papers were just out with a telegram on the author of that work who in rome had been ill for some days with an attack of malarial fever  it had at first not been thought grave but had taken in consequence of complications a turn that might give rise to anxiety  anxiety had indeed at the latest hour begun to be felt  i was struck in the presence of these tidings with the fundamental detachment that mrs corvicks overt concern quite failed to hide it gave me the measure of her consummate independence  that independence rested on her knowledge the knowledge which nothing now could destroy and which nothing could make different  the figure in the carpet might take on another twist or two but the sentence had virtually been written  the writer might go down to his grave  she was the person in the world to whomas if she had been his favoured heirhis continued existence was least of a need  this reminded me how i had observed at a particular moment after corvicks deaththe drop of her desire to see him face to face  she had got what she wanted without that  i had been sure that if she hadnt got it she wouldnt have been restrained from the endeavour to sound him personally by those superior reflexions more conceivable on a mans part than on a womans which in my case had served an a deterrent  it wasnt however i hasten to add that my case in spite of this invidious comparison wasnt ambiguous enough  at the thought that vereker was perhaps at that moment dying there rolled over me a wave of anguisha poignant sense of how inconsistently i still depended on him  a delicacy that it was my one compensation to suffer to rule me had left the alps and the apennines between us but the sense of the waning occasion suggested that i might in my despair at last have gone to him  of course i should really have done nothing of the sort  i remained five minutes while my companions talked of the new book and when drayton deane appealed to me for my opinion of it i made answer getting up that i detested hugh vereker and simply couldnt read him  i departed with the moral certainty that as the door closed behind me deane would brand me for awfully superficial his hostess wouldnt contradict that at least  i continue to trace with a briefer touch our intensely odd successions  three weeks after this came verekers death and before the year was out the death of his wife  that poor lady i had never seen but i had had a futile theory that should she survive him long enough to be decorously accessible i might approach her with the feeble flicker of my plea  did she know and if she knew would she speak  it was much to be presumed that for more reasons than one she would have nothing to say but when she passed out of all reach i felt renannouncement indeed my appointed lot  i was shut up in my obsession for evermy gaolers had gone off with the key  i find myself quite as vague as a captive in a dungeon about the tinge that further elapsed before mrs corvick became the wife of drayton deane  i had foreseen through my bars this end of the business though there was no indecent haste and our friendship had fallen rather off  they were both so awfully intellectual that it struck people as a suitable match but i had measured better than any one the wealth of understanding the bride would contribute to the union  never for a marriage in literary circlesso the newspapers described the alliancehad a lady been so bravely dowered  i began with due promptness to look for the fruit of the affairthat fruit i mean of which the premonitory symptoms would be peculiarly visible in the husband  taking for granted the splendour of the other partys nuptial gift i expected to see him make a show commensurate with his increase of means  i knew what his means had beenhis article on the right of way had distinctly given one the figure  as he was now exactly in the position in which still more exactly i was not i watched from month to month in the likely periodicals for the heavy message poor corvick had been unable to deliver and the responsibility of which would have fallen on his successor  the widow and wife would have broken by the rekindled hearth the silence that only a widow and wife might break and deane would be as aflame with the knowledge as corvick in his own hour as gwendolen in hers had been  well he was aflame doubtless but the fire was apparently not to become a public blaze  i scanned the periodicals in vain  drayton deane filled them with exuberant pages but he withheld the page i most feverishly sought  he wrote on a thousand subjects but never on the subject of vereker  his special line was to tell truths that other people either funked as he said or overlooked but he never told the only truth that seemed to me in these days to signify  i met the couple in those literary circles referred to in the papers  i have sufficiently intimated that it was only in such circles we were all constructed to revolve  gwendolen was more than ever committed to them by the publication of her third novel and i myself definitely classed by holding the opinion that this work was inferior to its immediate predecessor  was it worse because she had been keeping worse company  if her secret was as she had told me her lifea fact discernible in her increasing bloom an air of conscious privilege that cleverly corrected by pretty charities gave distinction to her appearanceit had yet not a direct influence on her work  that only made oneeverything only made oneyearn the more for it only rounded it off with a mystery finer and subtler    chapter xi    it was therefore from her husband i could never remove my eyes  i beset him in a manner that might have made him uneasy  i went even so far as to engage him in conversation  didnt he know hadnt he come into it as a matter of coursethat question hummed in my brain  of course he knew otherwise he wouldnt return my stare so queerly  his wife had told him what i wanted and he was amiably amused at my impotence  he didnt laughhe wasnt a laugher  his system was to present to my irritation so that i should crudely expose myself a conversational blank as vast as his big bare brow it always happened that i turned away with a settled conviction from these unpeopled expanses which seemed to complete each other geographically and to symbolise together drayton deanes want of voice want of form  he simply hadnt the art to use what he knew he literally was incompetent to take up the duty where corvick had left it  i went still furtherit was the only glimpse of happiness i had  i made up my mind that the duty didnt appeal to him  he wasnt interested he didnt care  yes it quite comforted me to believe him too stupid to have joy of the thing i lacked  he was as stupid after as he had been before and that deepened for me the golden glory in which the mystery was wrapped i had of course none the less to recollect that his wife might have imposed her conditions and exactions  i had above all to remind myself that with verekers death the major incentive dropped  he was still there to be honoured by what might be donehe was no longer there to give it his sanction  who alas but he had the authority  two children were born to the pair but the second cost the mother her life  after this stroke i seemed to see another ghost of a chance  i jumped at it in thought but i waited a certain time for manners and at last my opportunity arrived in a remunerative way his wife had been dead a year when i met drayton deane in the smokingroom of a small club of which we both were members but where for monthsperhaps because i rarely entered iti hadnt seen him  the room was empty and the occasion propitious  i deliberately offered him to have done with the matter for ever that advantage for which i felt he had long been looking  as an older acquaintance of your late wifes than even you were i began you must let me say to you something i have on my mind i shall be glad to make any terms with you that you see fit to name for the information she must have had from george corvickthe information you know that had come to him poor chap in one of the happiest hours of his life straight from hugh vereker  he looked at me like a dim phrenological bust  the information   verekers secret my dear manthe general intention of his books the string the pearls were strung on the buried treasure the figure in the carpet  he began to flushthe numbers on his bumps to come out verekers books had a general intention  i stared in my turn  you dont mean to say you dont know it  i thought for a moment he was playing with me  mrs deane knew it she had it as i say straight from corvick who had after infinite search and to verekers own delight found the very mouth of the cave  where is the mouth  he told after their marriage and told alonethe person who when the circumstances were reproduced must have told you  have i been wrong in taking for granted that she admitted you as one of the highest privileges of the relation in which you stood to her to the knowledge of which she was after corvicks death the sole depositary  all i know is that that knowledge is infinitely precious and what i want you to understand is that if youll in your turn admit me to it youll do me a kindness for which i shall be lastingly grateful  he had turned at last very red i dare say he had begun by thinking i had lost my wits  little by little he followed me on my own side i stared with a livelier surprise  then he spoke i dont know what youre talking about  he wasnt actingit was the absurd truth  she didnt tell you  nothing about hugh vereker  i was stupefied the room went round  it had been too good even for that  upon your honour  upon my honour  what the devils the matter with you he growled  im astoundedim disappointed  i wanted to get it out of you  it isnt in me he awkwardly laughed  and even if it were  if it were youd let me have itoh yes in common humanity  but i believe you  i seei see i went on conscious with the full turn of the wheel of my great delusion my false view of the poor mans attitude  what i saw though i couldnt say it was that his wife hadnt thought him worth enlightening  this struck me as strange for a woman who had thought him worth marrying  at last i explained it by the reflexion that she couldnt possibly have married him for his understanding  she had married him for something else  he was to some extent enlightened now but he was even more astonished more disconcerted  he took a moment to compare my story with his quickened memories  the result of his meditation was his presently saying with a good deal of rather feeble form this is the first i hear of what you allude to  i think you must be mistaken as to mrs drayton deanes having had any unmentioned and still less any unmentionable knowledge of hugh vereker  shed certainly have wished itshould it have borne on his literary characterto be used  it was used  she used it herself  she told me with her own lips that she lived on it  i had no sooner spoken than i repented of my words he grew so pale that i felt as if i had struck him  ah lived  he murmured turning short away from me  my compunction was real i laid my hand on his shoulder  i beg you to forgive meive made a mistake  you dont know what i thought you knew  you could if i had been right have rendered me a service and i had my reasons for assuming that youd be in a position to meet me  your reasons he asked  what were your reasons  i looked at him well i hesitated i considered  come and sit down with me here and ill tell you  i drew him to a sofa i lighted another cigar and beginning with the anecdote of verekers one descent from the clouds i recited to him the extraordinary chain of accidents that had in spite of the original gleam kept me till that hour in the dark  i told him in a word just what ive written out here  he listened with deepening attention and i became aware to my surprise by his ejaculations by his questions that he would have been after all not unworthy to be trusted by his wife  so abrupt an experience of her want of trust had now a disturbing effect on him but i saw the immediate shock throb away little by little and then gather again into waves of wonder and curiositywaves that promised i could perfectly judge to break in the end with the fury of my own highest tides  i may say that today as victims of unappeased desire there isnt a pin to choose between us  the poor mans state is almost my consolation there are really moments when i feel it to be quite my revenge
