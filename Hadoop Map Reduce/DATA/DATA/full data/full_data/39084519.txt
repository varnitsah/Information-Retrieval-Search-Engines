39084519	children of the frost  by jack london  1902       illustration and the girl kasaan crept in very timid and quiet and dropped a little bag upon the things for my journey     contents   in the forests of the north  the law of life  nambok the unveracious  the master of mystery  the sunlanders  the sickness of lone chief  keesh the son of keesh  the death of ligoun  li wan the fair  the league of the old men     in the forests of the north   a weary journey beyond the last scrub timber and straggling copses into the heart of the barrens where the niggard north is supposed to deny the earth are to be found great sweeps of forests and stretches of smiling land but this the world is just beginning to know the worlds explorers have known it from time to time but hitherto they have never returned to tell the world  the barrenswell they are the barrens the bad lands of the arctic the deserts of the circle the bleak and bitter home of the muskox and the lean plains wolf so avery van brunt found them treeless and cheerless sparsely clothed with moss and lichens and altogether uninviting at least so he found them till he penetrated to the white blank spaces on the map and came upon undreamedof rich spruce forests and unrecorded eskimo tribes it had been his intention and his bid for fame to break up these white blank spaces and diversify them with the black markings of mountainchains sinks and basins and sinuous river courses and it was with added delight that he came to speculate upon the possibilities of timber belts and native villages  avery van brunt or in full distinction professor a van brunt of the geological survey was second in command of the expedition and first in command of the subexpedition which he had led on a side tour of some half a thousand miles up one of the branches of the thelon and which he was now leading into one of his unrecorded villages at his back plodded eight men two of them frenchcanadian voyageurs and the remainder strapping crees from manitobaway he alone was fullblooded saxon and his blood was pounding fiercely through his veins to the traditions of his race clive and hastings drake and raleigh hengest and horsa walked with him first of all men of his breed was he to enter this lone northland village and at the thought an exultancy came upon him an exaltation and his followers noted that his legweariness fell from him and that he insensibly quickened the pace  the village emptied itself and a motley crowd trooped out to meet him men in the forefront with bows and spears clutched menacingly and women and children faltering timidly in the rear van brunt lifted his right arm and made the universal peace sign a sign which all peoples know and the villagers answered in peace but to his chagrin a skinclad man ran forward and thrust out his hand with a familiar hello he was a bearded man with cheeks and brow bronzed to copperbrown and in him van brunt knew his kind  who are you he asked gripping the extended hand andrée  whos andrée the man asked back  van brunt looked at him more sharply by george youve been here some time  five years the man answered a dim flicker of pride in his eyes but come on lets talk  let them camp alongside of me he answered van brunts glance at his party old tantlatch will take care of them come on  he swung off in a long stride van brunt following at his heels through the village in irregular fashion wherever the ground favored the lodges of moose hide were pitched van brunt ran his practised eye over them and calculated  two hundred not counting the young ones he summed up  the man nodded pretty close to it but heres where i live out of the thick of it you knowmore privacy and all that sit down ill eat with you when your men get something cooked up ive forgotten what tea tastes like five years and never a taste or smell any tobacco ah thanks and a pipe good now for a firestick and well see if the weed has lost its cunning  he scratched the match with the painstaking care of the woodsman cherished its young flame as though there were never another in all the world and drew in the first mouthful of smoke this he retained meditatively for a time and blew out through his pursed lips slowly and caressingly then his face seemed to soften as he leaned back and a soft blur to film his eyes he sighed heavily happily with immeasurable content and then said suddenly  god but that tastes good  van brunt nodded sympathetically five years you say  five years the man sighed again and you i presume wish to know about it being naturally curious and this a sufficiently strange situation and all that but its not much i came in from edmonton after muskox and like pike and the rest of them had my mischances only i lost my party and outfit starvation hardship the regular tale you know sole survivor and all that till i crawled into tantlatchs here on hand and knee  five years van brunt murmured retrospectively as though turning things over in his mind  five years on february last i crossed the great slave early in may  and you are  fairfax van brunt interjected  the man nodded  let me see  john i think it is john fairfax  how did you know fairfax queried lazily halfabsorbed in curling smokespirals upward in the quiet air  the papers were full of it at the time prevanche  prevanche fairfax sat up suddenly alert he was lost in the smoke mountains  yes but he pulled through and came out  fairfax settled back again and resumed his smokespirals i am glad to hear it he remarked reflectively prevanche was a bully fellow if he did have ideas about headstraps the beggar and he pulled through well im glad  five years  the phrase drifted recurrently through van brunts thought and somehow the face of emily southwaithe seemed to rise up and take form before him five years  a wedge of wildfowl honked low overhead and at sight of the encampment veered swiftly to the north into the smouldering sun van brunt could not follow them he pulled out his watch it was an hour past midnight the northward clouds flushed bloodily and rays of sombrered shot southward firing the gloomy woods with a lurid radiance the air was in breathless calm not a needle quivered and the least sounds of the camp were distinct and clear as trumpet calls the crees and voyageurs felt the spirit of it and mumbled in dreamy undertones and the cook unconsciously subdued the clatter of pot and pan somewhere a child was crying and from the depths of the forest like a silver thread rose a womans voice in mournful chant  ooooooahaahaahaaaaa ooooooahaahaa  van brunt shivered and rubbed the backs of his hands briskly  and they gave me up for dead his companion asked slowly  well you never came back so your friends  promptly forgot fairfax laughed harshly defiantly  why didnt you come out  partly disinclination i suppose and partly because of circumstances over which i had no control you see tantlatch here was down with a broken leg when i made his acquaintancea nasty fractureand i set it for him and got him into shape i stayed some time getting my strength back i was the first white man he had seen and of course i seemed very wise and showed his people no end of things coached them up in military tactics among other things so that they conquered the four other tribal villages which you have not yet seen and came to rule the land and they naturally grew to think a good deal of me so much so that when i was ready to go they wouldnt hear of it were most hospitable in fact put a couple of guards over me and watched me day and night and then tantlatch offered me inducementsin a sense inducementsso to say and as it didnt matter much one way or the other i reconciled myself to remaining  i knew your brother at freiburg i am van brunt  fairfax reached forward impulsively and shook his hand you were billys friend eh poor billy he spoke of you often  rum meeting place though he added casting an embracing glance over the primordial landscape and listening for a moment to the womans mournful notes her man was clawed by a bear and shes taking it hard  beastly life van brunt grimaced his disgust i suppose after five years of it civilization will be sweet what do you say  fairfaxs face took on a stolid expression oh i dont know at least theyre honest folk and live according to their lights and then they are amazingly simple no complexity about them no thousand and one subtle ramifications to every single emotion they experience they love fear hate are angered or made happy in common ordinary and unmistakable terms it may be a beastly life but at least it is easy to live no philandering no dallying if a woman likes you shell not be backward in telling you so if she hates you shell tell you so and then if you feel inclined you can beat her but the thing is she knows precisely what you mean and you know precisely what she means no mistakes no misunderstandings it has its charm after civilizations fitful fever comprehend  no its a pretty good life he continued after a pause good enough for me and i intend to stay with it  van brunt lowered his head in a musing manner and an imperceptible smile played on his mouth no philandering no dallying no misunderstanding fairfax also was taking it hard he thought just because emily southwaithe had been mistakenly clawed by a bear and not a bad sort of a bear either was carlton southwaithe  but you are coming along with me van brunt said deliberately  no im not  yes you are  lifes too easy here i tell you fairfax spoke with decision i understand everything and i am understood summer and winter alternate like the sun flashing through the palings of a fence the seasons are a blur of light and shade and time slips by and life slips by and then  a wailing in the forest and the dark listen  he held up his hand and the silver thread of the womans sorrow rose through the silence and the calm fairfax joined in softly  ooooooahaahaahaaaaa ooooooahaahaa he sang cant you hear it cant you see it the women mourning the funeral chant my hair whitelocked and patriarchal my skins wrapped in rude splendor about me my huntingspear by my side and who shall say it is not well  van brunt looked at him coolly fairfax you are a damned fool five years of this is enough to knock any man and you are in an unhealthy morbid condition further carlton southwaithe is dead  van brunt filled his pipe and lighted it the while watching slyly and with almost professional interest fairfaxs eyes flashed on the instant his fists clenched he half rose up then his muscles relaxed and he seemed to brood michael the cook signalled that the meal was ready but van brunt motioned back to delay the silence hung heavy and he fell to analyzing the forest scents the odors of mould and rotting vegetation the resiny smells of pine cones and needles the aromatic savors of many campsmokes twice fairfax looked up but said nothing and then  and  emily   three years a widow still a widow  another long silence settled down to be broken by fairfax finally with a naïve smile i guess youre right van brunt ill go along  i knew you would van brunt laid his hand on fairfaxs shoulder of course one cannot know but i imaginefor one in her positionshe has had offers  when do you start fairfax interrupted  after the men have had some sleep which reminds me michael is getting angry so come and eat  after supper when the crees and voyageurs had rolled into their blankets snoring the two men lingered by the dying fire there was much to talk aboutwars and politics and explorations the doings of men and the happening of things mutual friends marriages deathsfive years of history for which fairfax clamored  so the spanish fleet was bottled up in santiago van brunt was saying when a young woman stepped lightly before him and stood by fairfaxs side she looked swiftly into his face then turned a troubled gaze upon van brunt  chief tantlatchs daughter sort of princess fairfax explained with an honest flush one of the inducements in short to make me stay thom this is van brunt friend of mine  van brunt held out his hand but the woman maintained a rigid repose quite in keeping with her general appearance not a line of her face softened not a feature unbent she looked him straight in the eyes her own piercing questioning searching  precious lot she understands fairfax laughed her first introduction you know but as you were saying with the spanish fleet bottled up in santiago  thom crouched down by her husbands side motionless as a bronze statue only her eyes flashing from face to face in ceaseless search and avery van brunt as he talked on and on felt a nervousness under the dumb gaze in the midst of his most graphic battle descriptions he would become suddenly conscious of the black eyes burning into him and would stumble and flounder till he could catch the gait and go again fairfax hands clasped round knees pipe out absorbed spurred him on when he lagged and repictured the world he thought he had forgotten  one hour passed and two and fairfax rose reluctantly to his feet and cronje was cornered eh well just wait a moment till i run over to tantlatch hell be expecting you and ill arrange for you to see him after breakfast that will be all right wont it  he went off between the pines and van brunt found himself staring into thoms warm eyes five years he mused and she cant be more than twenty now a most remarkable creature being eskimo she should have a little flat excuse for a nose and lo it is neither broad nor flat but aquiline with nostrils delicately and sensitively formed as any fine ladys of a whiter breedthe indian strain somewhere be assured avery van brunt and avery van brunt dont be nervous she wont eat you shes only a woman and not a badlooking one at that oriental rather than aborigine eyes large and fairly wide apart with just the faintest hint of mongol obliquity thom youre an anomaly youre out of place here among these eskimos even if your father is one where did your mother come from or your grandmother and thom my dear youre a beauty a frigid frozen little beauty with alaskan lava in your blood and please dont look at me that way  he laughed and stood up her insistent stare disconcerted him a dog was prowling among the grubsacks he would drive it away and place them into safety against fairfaxs return but thom stretched out a detaining hand and stood up facing him  you she said in the arctic tongue which differs little from greenland to point barrow you  and the swift expression of her face demanded all for which you stood his reason for existence his presence there his relation to her husbandeverything  brother he answered in the same tongue with a sweeping gesture to the south brothers we be your man and i  she shook her head it is not good that you be here  after one sleep i go  and my man she demanded with tremulous eagerness  van brunt shrugged his shoulders he was aware of a certain secret shame of an impersonal sort of shame and an anger against fairfax and he felt the warm blood in his face as he regarded the young savage she was just a woman that was alla woman the whole sordid story over again over and over again as old as eve and young as the last new lovelight  my man my man my man she was reiterating vehemently her face passionately dark and the ruthless tenderness of the eternal woman the matewoman looking out at him from her eyes  thom he said gravely in english you were born in the northland forest and you have eaten fish and meat and fought with frost and famine and lived simply all the days of your life and there are many things indeed not simple which you do not know and cannot come to understand you do not know what it is to long for the fleshpots afar you cannot understand what it is to yearn for a fair womans face and the woman is fair thom the woman is nobly fair you have been woman to this man and you have been your all but your all is very little very simple too little and too simple and he is an alien man him you have never known you can never know it is so ordained you held him in your arms but you never held his heart this man with his blurring seasons and his dreams of a barbaric end dreams and dreamdust that is what he has been to you you clutched at form and gripped shadow gave yourself to a man and bedded with the wraith of a man in such manner of old did the daughters of men whom the gods found fair and thom thom i should not like to be john fairfax in the nightwatches of the years to come in the nightwatches when his eyes shall see not the sungloried hair of the woman by his side but the dark tresses of a mate forsaken in the forests of the north  though she did not understand she had listened with intense attention as though life hung on his speech but she caught at her husbands name and cried out in eskimo  yes yes fairfax my man  poor little fool how could he be your man  but she could not understand his english tongue and deemed that she was being trifled with the dumb insensate anger of the matewoman flamed in her face and it almost seemed to the man as though she crouched pantherlike for the spring  he cursed softly to himself and watched the fire fade from her face and the soft luminous glow of the appealing woman spring up of the appealing woman who foregoes strength and panoplies herself wisely in her weakness  he is my man she said gently never have i known other it cannot be that i should ever know other nor can it be that he should go from me  who has said he shall go from thee he demanded sharply half in exasperation half in impotence  it is for thee to say he shall not go from me she answered softly a halfsob in her throat  van brunt kicked the embers of the fire savagely and sat down  it is for thee to say he is my man before all women he is my man thou art big thou art strong and behold i am very weak see i am at thy feet it is for thee to deal with me it is for thee  get up he jerked her roughly erect and stood up himself thou art a woman wherefore the dirt is no place for thee nor the feet of any man  he is my man  then jesus forgive all men van brunt cried out passionately  he is my man she repeated monotonously beseechingly  he is my brother he answered  my father is chief tantlatch he is a power over five villages i will see that the five villages be searched for thy choice of all maidens that thou mayest stay here by thy brother and dwell in comfort  after one sleep i go  and my man  thy man comes now behold  from among the gloomy spruces came the light carolling of fairfaxs voice  as the day is quenched by a sea of fog so his song smote the light out of her face it is the tongue of his own people she said the tongue of his own people  she turned with the free movement of a lithe young animal and made off into the forest  its all fixed fairfax called as he came up his regal highness will receive you after breakfast  have you told him van brunt asked  no nor shall i tell him till were ready to pull out  van brunt looked with moody affection over the sleeping forms of his men  i shall be glad when we are a hundred leagues upon our way he said                                       thom raised the skinflap of her fathers lodge two men sat with him and the three looked at her with swift interest but her face betokened nothing as she entered and took seat quietly without speech tantlatch drummed with his knuckles on a spearheft across his knees and gazed idly along the path of a sunray which pierced a lacinghole and flung a glittering track across the murky atmosphere of the lodge to his right at his shoulder crouched chugungatte the shaman both were old men and the weariness of many years brooded in their eyes but opposite them sat keen a young man and chief favorite in the tribe he was quick and alert of movement and his black eyes flashed from face to face in ceaseless scrutiny and challenge  silence reigned in the place now and again camp noises penetrated and from the distance faint and far like the shadows of voices came the wrangling of boys in thin shrill tones a dog thrust his head into the entrance and blinked wolfishly at them for a space the slaver dripping from his ivorywhite fangs after a time he growled tentatively and then awed by the immobility of the human figures lowered his head and grovelled away backward tantlatch glanced apathetically at his daughter  and thy man how is it with him and thee  he sings strange songs thom made answer and there is a new look on his face  so he hath spoken  nay but there is a new look on his face a new light in his eyes and with the newcomer he sits by the fire and they talk and talk and the talk is without end  chugungatte whispered in his masters ear and keen leaned forward from his hips  there be something calling him from afar she went on and he seems to sit and listen and to answer singing in his own peoples tongue  again chugungatte whispered and keen leaned forward and thom held her speech till her father nodded his head that she might proceed  it be known to thee o tantlatch that the wild goose and the swan and the little ringed duck be born here in the lowlying lands it be known that they go away before the face of the frost to unknown places and it be known likewise that always do they return when the sun is in the land and the waterways are free always do they return to where they were born that new life may go forth the land calls to them and they come and now there is another land that calls and it is calling to my manthe land where he was bornand he hath it in mind to answer the call yet is he my man before all women is he my man  is it well tantlatch is it well chugungatte demanded with the hint of menace in his voice  ay it is well keen cried boldly the land calls to its children and all lands call their children home again as the wild goose and the swan and the little ringed duck are called so is called this stranger man who has lingered with us and who now must go also there be the call of kind the goose mates with the goose nor does the swan mate with the little ringed duck it is not well that the swan should mate with the little ringed duck nor is it well that stranger men should mate with the women of our villages wherefore i say the man should go to his own kind in his own land  he is my own man thom answered and he is a great man  ay he is a great man chugungatte lifted his head with a faint recrudescence of youthful vigor he is a great man and he put strength in thy arm o tantlatch and gave thee power and made thy name to be feared in the land to be feared and to be respected he is very wise and there be much profit in his wisdom to him are we beholden for many thingsfor the cunning in war and the secrets of the defence of a village and a rush in the forest for the discussion in council and the undoing of enemies by word of mouth and the hardsworn promise for the gathering of game and the making of traps and the preserving of food for the curing of sickness and mending of hurts of trail and fight thou tantlatch wert a lame old man this day were it not that the stranger man came into our midst and attended on thee and ever when in doubt on strange questions have we gone to him that out of his wisdom he might make things clear and ever has he made things clear and there be questions yet to arise and needs upon his wisdom yet to come and we cannot bear to let him go it is not well that we should let him go  tantlatch continued to drum on the spearhaft and gave no sign that he had heard thom studied his face in vain and chugungatte seemed to shrink together and droop down as the weight of years descended upon him again  no man makes my kill keen smote his breast a valorous blow i make my own kill i am glad to live when i make my own kill when i creep through the snow upon the great moose i am glad and when i draw the bow so with my full strength and drive the arrow fierce and swift and to the heart i am glad and the meat of no mans kill tastes as sweet as the meat of my kill i am glad to live glad in my own cunning and strength glad that i am a doer of things a doer of things for myself of what other reason to live than that why should i live if i delight not in myself and the things i do and it is because i delight and am glad that i go forth to hunt and fish and it is because i go forth to hunt and fish that i grow cunning and strong the man who stays in the lodge by the fire grows not cunning and strong he is not made happy in the eating of my kill nor is living to him a delight he does not live and so i say it is well this stranger man should go his wisdom does not make us wise if he be cunning there is no need that we be cunning if need arise we go to him for his cunning we eat the meat of his kill and it tastes unsweet we merit by his strength and in it there is no delight we do not live when he does our living for us we grow fat and like women and we are afraid to work and we forget how to do things for ourselves let the man go o tantlatch that we may be men i am keen a man and i make my own kill  tantlatch turned a gaze upon him in which seemed the vacancy of eternity keen waited the decision expectantly but the lips did not move and the old chief turned toward his daughter  that which be given cannot be taken away she burst forth i was but a girl when this stranger man who is my man came among us and i knew not men or the ways of men and my heart was in the play of girls when thou tantlatch thou and none other didst call me to thee and press me into the arms of the stranger man thou and none other tantlatch and as thou didst give me to the man so didst thou give the man to me he is my man in my arms has he slept and from my arms he cannot be taken  it were well o tantlatch keen followed quickly with a significant glance at thom it were well to remember that that which be given cannot be taken away  chugungatte straightened up out of thy youth keen come the words of thy mouth as for ourselves o tantlatch we be old men and we understand we too have looked into the eyes of women and felt our blood go hot with strange desires but the years have chilled us and we have learned the wisdom of the council the shrewdness of the cool head and hand and we know that the warm heart be overwarm and prone to rashness we know that keen found favor in thy eyes we know that thom was promised him in the old days when she was yet a child and we know that the new days came and the stranger man and that out of our wisdom and desire for welfare was thom lost to keen and the promise broken  the old shaman paused and looked directly at the young man  and be it known that i chugungatte did advise that the promise be broken  nor have i taken other woman to my bed keen broke in and i have builded my own fire and cooked my own food and ground my teeth in my loneliness  chugungatte waved his hand that he had not finished i am an old man and i speak from understanding it be good to be strong and grasp for power it be better to forego power that good come out of it in the old days i sat at thy shoulder tantlatch and my voice was heard over all in the council and my advice taken in affairs of moment and i was strong and held power under tantlatch i was the greatest man then came the stranger man and i saw that he was cunning and wise and great and in that he was wiser and greater than i it was plain that greater profit should arise from him than from me and i had thy ear tantlatch and thou didst listen to my words and the stranger man was given power and place and thy daughter thom and the tribe prospered under the new laws in the new days and so shall it continue to prosper with the stranger man in our midst we be old men we two o tantlatch thou and i and this be an affair of head not heart hear my words tantlatch hear my words the man remains  there was a long silence the old chief pondered with the massive certitude of god and chugungatte seemed to wrap himself in the mists of a great antiquity keen looked with yearning upon the woman and she unnoting held her eyes steadfastly upon her fathers face the wolfdog shoved the flap aside again and plucking courage at the quiet wormed forward on his belly he sniffed curiously at thoms listless hand cocked ears challengingly at chugungatte and hunched down upon his haunches before tantlatch the spear rattled to the ground and the dog with a frightened yell sprang sideways snapping in midair and on the second leap cleared the entrance  tantlatch looked from face to face pondering each one long and carefully then he raised his head with rude royalty and gave judgment in cold and even tones the man remains let the hunters be called together send a runner to the next village with word to bring on the fighting men i shall not see the newcomer do thou chugungatte have talk with him tell him he may go at once if he would go in peace and if fight there be kill kill kill to the last man but let my word go forth that no harm befall our manthe man whom my daughter hath wedded it is well  chugungatte rose and tottered out thom followed but as keen stooped to the entrance the voice of tantlatch stopped him  keen it were well to hearken to my word the man remains let no harm befall him  because of fairfaxs instructions in the art of war the tribesmen did not hurl themselves forward boldly and with clamor instead there was great restraint and selfcontrol and they were content to advance silently creeping and crawling from shelter to shelter by the river bank and partly protected by a narrow open space crouched the crees and voyageurs their eyes could see nothing and only in vague ways did their ears hear but they felt the thrill of life which ran through the forest the indistinct indefinable movement of an advancing host  damn them fairfax muttered theyve never faced powder but i taught them the trick  avery van brunt laughed knocked the ashes out of his pipe and put it carefully away with the pouch and loosened the huntingknife in its sheath at his hip  wait he said well wither the face of the charge and break their hearts  theyll rush scattered if they remember my teaching  let them magazine rifles were made to pump wellgood first blood extra tobacco loon  loon a cree had spotted an exposed shoulder and with a stinging bullet apprised its owner of his discovery  if we can tease them into breaking forward fairfax mutteredif we can only tease them into breaking forward  van brunt saw a head peer from behind a distant tree and with a quick shot sent the man sprawling to the ground in a death struggle michael potted a third and fairfax and the rest took a hand firing at every exposure and into each clump of agitated brush in crossing one little swale out of cover five of the tribesmen remained on their faces and to the left where the covering was sparse a dozen men were struck but they took the punishment with sullen steadiness coming on cautiously deliberately without haste and without lagging  ten minutes later when they were quite close all movement was suspended the advance ceased abruptly and the quietness that followed was portentous threatening only could be seen the green and gold of the woods and undergrowth shivering and trembling to the first faint puffs of the daywind the wan white morning sun mottled the earth with long shadows and streaks of light a wounded man lifted his head and crawled painfully out of the swale michael following him with his rifle but forbearing to shoot a whistle ran along the invisible line from left to right and a flight of arrows arched through the air  get ready van brunt commanded a new metallic note in his voice now  they broke cover simultaneously the forest heaved into sudden life a great yell went up and the rifles barked back sharp defiance tribesmen knew their deaths in midleap and as they fell their brothers surged over them in a roaring irresistible wave in the forefront of the rush hair flying and arms swinging free flashing past the treetrunks and leaping the obstructing logs came thom fairfax sighted on her and almost pulled trigger ere he knew her  the woman dont shoot he cried see she is unarmed  the crees never heard nor michael and his brother voyageur nor van brunt who was keeping one shell continuously in the air but thom bore straight on unharmed at the heels of a skinclad hunter who had veered in before her from the side fairfax emptied his magazine into the men to right and left of her and swung his rifle to meet the big hunter but the man seeming to recognize him swerved suddenly aside and plunged his spear into the body of michael on the moment thom had one arm passed around her husbands neck and twisting half about with voice and gesture was splitting the mass of charging warriors a score of men hurled past on either side and fairfax for a brief instants space stood looking upon her and her bronze beauty thrilling exulting stirred to unknown deeps visioning strange things dreaming immortally dreaming snatches and scraps of oldworld philosophies and newworld ethics floated through his mind and things wonderfully concrete and woefully incongruoushunting scenes stretches of sombre forest vastnesses of silent snow the glittering of ballroom lights great galleries and lecture halls a fleeting shimmer of glistening testtubes long rows of booklined shelves the throb of machinery and the roar of traffic a fragment of forgotten song faces of dear women and old chums a lonely watercourse amid upstanding peaks a shattered boat on a pebbly strand quiet moonlit fields fat vales the smell of hay  a hunter struck between the eyes with a rifleball pitched forward lifeless and with the momentum of his charge slid along the ground fairfax came back to himself his comrades those that lived had been swept far back among the trees beyond he could hear the fierce hia hia of the hunters as they closed in and cut and thrust with their weapons of bone and ivory the cries of the stricken men smote him like blows he knew the fight was over the cause was lost but all his race traditions and race loyalty impelled him into the welter that he might die at least with his kind  my man my man thom cried thou art safe  he tried to struggle on but her dead weight clogged his steps  there is no need they are dead and life be good  she held him close around the neck and twined her limbs about his till he tripped and stumbled reeled violently to recover footing tripped again and fell backward to the ground his head struck a jutting root and he was halfstunned and could struggle but feebly in the fall she had heard the feathered swish of an arrow darting past and she covered his body with hers as with a shield her arms holding him tightly her face and lips pressed upon his neck  then it was that keen rose up from a tangled thicket a score of feet away he looked about him with care the fight had swept on and the cry of the last man was dying away there was no one to see he fitted an arrow to the string and glanced at the man and woman between her breast and arm the flesh of the mans side showed white keen bent the bow and drew back the arrow to its head twice he did so calmly and for certainty and then drove the bonebarbed missile straight home to the white flesh gleaming yet more white in the darkarmed darkbreasted embrace     the law of life   old koskoosh listened greedily though his sight had long since faded his hearing was still acute and the slightest sound penetrated to the glimmering intelligence which yet abode behind the withered forehead but which no longer gazed forth upon the things of the world ah that was sitcumtoha shrilly anathematizing the dogs as she cuffed and beat them into the harnesses sitcumtoha was his daughters daughter but she was too busy to waste a thought upon her broken grandfather sitting alone there in the snow forlorn and helpless camp must be broken the long trail waited while the short day refused to linger life called her and the duties of life not death and he was very close to death now  the thought made the old man panicky for the moment and he stretched forth a palsied hand which wandered tremblingly over the small heap of dry wood beside him reassured that it was indeed there his hand returned to the shelter of his mangy furs and he again fell to listening the sulky crackling of halffrozen hides told him that the chiefs mooseskin lodge had been struck and even then was being rammed and jammed into portable compass the chief was his son stalwart and strong head man of the tribesmen and a mighty hunter as the women toiled with the camp luggage his voice rose chiding them for their slowness old koskoosh strained his ears it was the last time he would hear that voice there went geehows lodge and tuskens seven eight nine only the shamans could be still standing there they were at work upon it now he could hear the shaman grunt as he piled it on the sled a child whimpered and a woman soothed it with soft crooning gutturals little kootee the old man thought a fretful child and not overstrong it would die soon perhaps and they would burn a hole through the frozen tundra and pile rocks above to keep the wolverines away well what did it matter a few years at best and as many an empty belly as a full one and in the end death waited everhungry and hungriest of them all  what was that oh the men lashing the sleds and drawing tight the thongs he listened who would listen no more the whiplashes snarled and bit among the dogs hear them whine how they hated the work and the trail they were off sled after sled churned slowly away into the silence they were gone they had passed out of his life and he faced the last bitter hour alone no the snow crunched beneath a moccasin a man stood beside him upon his head a hand rested gently his son was good to do this thing he remembered other old men whose sons had not waited after the tribe but his son had he wandered away into the past till the young mans voice brought him back  is it well with you he asked  and the old man answered it is well  there be wood beside you the younger man continued and the fire burns bright the morning is gray and the cold has broken it will snow presently even now is it snowing  ay even now is it snowing  the tribesmen hurry their bales are heavy and their bellies flat with lack of feasting the trail is long and they travel fast i go now it is well  it is well i am as a last years leaf clinging lightly to the stem the first breath that blows and i fall my voice is become like an old womans my eyes no longer show me the way of my feet and my feet are heavy and i am tired it is well  he bowed his head in content till the last noise of the complaining snow had died away and he knew his son was beyond recall then his hand crept out in haste to the wood it alone stood between him and the eternity that yawned in upon him at last the measure of his life was a handful of fagots one by one they would go to feed the fire and just so step by step death would creep upon him when the last stick had surrendered up its heat the frost would begin to gather strength first his feet would yield then his hands and the numbness would travel slowly from the extremities to the body his head would fall forward upon his knees and he would rest it was easy all men must die  he did not complain it was the way of life and it was just he had been born close to the earth close to the earth had he lived and the law thereof was not new to him it was the law of all flesh nature was not kindly to the flesh she had no concern for that concrete thing called the individual her interest lay in the species the race this was the deepest abstraction old koskooshs barbaric mind was capable of but he grasped it firmly he saw it exemplified in all life the rise of the sap the bursting greenness of the willow bud the fall of the yellow leafin this alone was told the whole history but one task did nature set the individual did he not perform it he died did he perform it it was all the same he died nature did not care there were plenty who were obedient and it was only the obedience in this matter not the obedient which lived and lived always the tribe of koskoosh was very old the old men he had known when a boy had known old men before them therefore it was true that the tribe lived that it stood for the obedience of all its members way down into the forgotten past whose very restingplaces were unremembered they did not count they were episodes they had passed away like clouds from a summer sky he also was an episode and would pass away nature did not care to life she set one task gave one law to perpetuate was the task of life its law was death a maiden was a good creature to look upon fullbreasted and strong with spring to her step and light in her eyes but her task was yet before her the light in her eyes brightened her step quickened she was now bold with the young men now timid and she gave them of her own unrest and ever she grew fairer and yet fairer to look upon till some hunter able no longer to withhold himself took her to his lodge to cook and toil for him and to become the mother of his children and with the coming of her offspring her looks left her her limbs dragged and shuffled her eyes dimmed and bleared and only the little children found joy against the withered cheek of the old squaw by the fire her task was done but a little while on the first pinch of famine or the first long trail and she would be left even as he had been left in the snow with a little pile of wood such was the law  he placed a stick carefully upon the fire and resumed his meditations it was the same everywhere with all things the mosquitoes vanished with the first frost the little treesquirrel crawled away to die when age settled upon the rabbit it became slow and heavy and could no longer outfoot its enemies even the big baldface grew clumsy and blind and quarrelsome in the end to be dragged down by a handful of yelping huskies he remembered how he had abandoned his own father on an upper reach of the klondike one winter the winter before the missionary came with his talkbooks and his box of medicines many a time had koskoosh smacked his lips over the recollection of that box though now his mouth refused to moisten the painkiller had been especially good but the missionary was a bother after all for he brought no meat into the camp and he ate heartily and the hunters grumbled but he chilled his lungs on the divide by the mayo and the dogs afterwards nosed the stones away and fought over his bones  koskoosh placed another stick on the fire and harked back deeper into the past there was the time of the great famine when the old men crouched emptybellied to the fire and let fall from their lips dim traditions of the ancient day when the yukon ran wide open for three winters and then lay frozen for three summers he had lost his mother in that famine in the summer the salmon run had failed and the tribe looked forward to the winter and the coming of the caribou then the winter came but with it there were no caribou never had the like been known not even in the lives of the old men but the caribou did not come and it was the seventh year and the rabbits had not replenished and the dogs were naught but bundles of bones and through the long darkness the children wailed and died and the women and the old men and not one in ten of the tribe lived to meet the sun when it came back in the spring that was a famine  but he had seen times of plenty too when the meat spoiled on their hands and the dogs were fat and worthless with overeatingtimes when they let the game go unkilled and the women were fertile and the lodges were cluttered with sprawling menchildren and womenchildren then it was the men became highstomached and revived ancient quarrels and crossed the divides to the south to kill the pellys and to the west that they might sit by the dead fires of the tananas he remembered when a boy during a time of plenty when he saw a moose pulled down by the wolves zingha lay with him in the snow and watchedzingha who later became the craftiest of hunters and who in the end fell through an airhole on the yukon they found him a month afterward just as he had crawled halfway out and frozen stiff to the ice  but the moose zingha and he had gone out that day to play at hunting after the manner of their fathers on the bed of the creek they struck the fresh track of a moose and with it the tracks of many wolves an old one zingha who was quicker at reading the sign saidan old one who cannot keep up with the herd the wolves have cut him out from his brothers and they will never leave him and it was so it was their way by day and by night never resting snarling on his heels snapping at his nose they would stay by him to the end how zingha and he felt the bloodlust quicken the finish would be a sight to see  eagerfooted they took the trail and even he koskoosh slow of sight and an unversed tracker could have followed it blind it was so wide hot were they on the heels of the chase reading the grim tragedy freshwritten at every step now they came to where the moose had made a stand thrice the length of a grown mans body in every direction had the snow been stamped about and uptossed in the midst were the deep impressions of the splayhoofed game and all about everywhere were the lighter footmarks of the wolves some while their brothers harried the kill had lain to one side and rested the fullstretched impress of their bodies in the snow was as perfect as though made the moment before one wolf had been caught in a wild lunge of the maddened victim and trampled to death a few bones well picked bore witness  again they ceased the uplift of their snowshoes at a second stand here the great animal had fought desperately twice had he been dragged down as the snow attested and twice had he shaken his assailants clear and gained footing once more he had done his task long since but none the less was life dear to him zingha said it was a strange thing a moose once down to get free again but this one certainly had the shaman would see signs and wonders in this when they told him  and yet again they come to where the moose had made to mount the bank and gain the timber but his foes had laid on from behind till he reared and fell back upon them crushing two deep into the snow it was plain the kill was at hand for their brothers had left them untouched two more stands were hurried past brief in timelength and very close together the trail was red now and the clean stride of the great beast had grown short and slovenly then they heard the first sounds of the battlenot the fullthroated chorus of the chase but the short snappy bark which spoke of close quarters and teeth to flesh crawling up the wind zingha bellied it through the snow and with him crept he koskoosh who was to be chief of the tribesmen in the years to come together they shoved aside the under branches of a young spruce and peered forth it was the end they saw  the picture like all of youths impressions was still strong with him and his dim eyes watched the end played out as vividly as in that faroff time koskoosh marvelled at this for in the days which followed when he was a leader of men and a head of councillors he had done great deeds and made his name a curse in the mouths of the pellys to say naught of the strange white man he had killed knife to knife in open fight  for long he pondered on the days of his youth till the fire died down and the frost bit deeper he replenished it with two sticks this time and gauged his grip on life by what remained if sitcumtoha had only remembered her grandfather and gathered a larger armful his hours would have been longer it would have been easy but she was ever a careless child and honored not her ancestors from the time the beaver son of the son of zingha first cast eyes upon her well what mattered it had he not done likewise in his own quick youth for a while he listened to the silence perhaps the heart of his son might soften and he would come back with the dogs to take his old father on with the tribe to where the caribou ran thick and the fat hung heavy upon them  he strained his ears his restless brain for the moment stilled not a stir nothing he alone took breath in the midst of the great silence it was very lonely hark what was that a chill passed over his body the familiar longdrawn howl broke the void and it was close at hand then on his darkened eyes was projected the vision of the moosethe old bull moosethe torn flanks and bloody sides the riddled mane and the great branching horns down low and tossing to the last he saw the flashing forms of gray the gleaming eyes the lolling tongues the slavered fangs and he saw the inexorable circle close in till it became a dark point in the midst of the stamped snow  a cold muzzle thrust against his cheek and at its touch his soul leaped back to the present his hand shot into the fire and dragged out a burning faggot overcome for the nonce by his hereditary fear of man the brute retreated raising a prolonged call to his brothers and greedily they answered till a ring of crouching jawslobbered gray was stretched round about the old man listened to the drawing in of this circle he waved his brand wildly and sniffs turned to snarls but the panting brutes refused to scatter now one wormed his chest forward dragging his haunches after now a second now a third but never a one drew back why should he cling to life he asked and dropped the blazing stick into the snow it sizzled and went out the circle grunted uneasily but held its own again he saw the last stand of the old bull moose and koskoosh dropped his head wearily upon his knees what did it matter after all was it not the law of life     nambok the unveracious   a bidarka is it not so look a bidarka and one man who drives clumsily with a paddle  old baskwahwan rose to her knees trembling with weakness and eagerness and gazed out over the sea  nambok was ever clumsy at the paddle she maundered reminiscently shading the sun from her eyes and staring across the silverspilled water nambok was ever clumsy i remember  but the women and children laughed loudly and there was a gentle mockery in their laughter and her voice dwindled till her lips moved without sound  koogah lifted his grizzled head from his bonecarving and followed the path of her eyes except when wide yaws took it off its course a bidarka was heading in for the beach its occupant was paddling with more strength than dexterity and made his approach along the zigzag line of most resistance koogahs head dropped to his work again and on the ivory tusk between his knees he scratched the dorsal fin of a fish the like of which never swam in the sea  it is doubtless the man from the next village he said finally come to consult with me about the marking of things on bone and the man is a clumsy man he will never know how  it is nambok old baskwahwan repeated should i not know my son she demanded shrilly i say and i say again it is nambok  and so thou hast said these many summers one of the women chided softly ever when the ice passed out of the sea hast thou sat and watched through the long day saying at each chance canoe this is nambok nambok is dead o baskwahwan and the dead do not come back it cannot be that the dead come back  nambok the old woman cried so loud and clear that the whole village was startled and looked at her  she struggled to her feet and tottered down the sand she stumbled over a baby lying in the sun and the mother hushed its crying and hurled harsh words after the old woman who took no notice the children ran down the beach in advance of her and as the man in the bidarka drew closer nearly capsizing with one of his illdirected strokes the women followed koogah dropped his walrus tusk and went also leaning heavily upon his staff and after him loitered the men in twos and threes  the bidarka turned broadside and the ripple of surf threatened to swamp it only a naked boy ran into the water and pulled the bow high up on the sand the man stood up and sent a questing glance along the line of villagers a rainbow sweater dirty and the worse for wear clung loosely to his broad shoulders and a red cotton handkerchief was knotted in sailor fashion about his throat a fishermans tamoshanter on his closeclipped head and dungaree trousers and heavy brogans completed his outfit  but he was none the less a striking personage to these simple fisherfolk of the great yukon delta who all their lives had stared out on bering sea and in that time seen but two white menthe census enumerator and a lost jesuit priest they were a poor people with neither gold in the ground nor valuable furs in hand so the whites had passed them afar also the yukon through the thousands of years had shoaled that portion of the sea with the detritus of alaska till vessels grounded out of sight of land so the sodden coast with its long inside reaches and huge mudland archipelagoes was avoided by the ships of men and the fisherfolk knew not that such things were  koogah the bonescratcher retreated backward in sudden haste tripping over his staff and falling to the ground nambok he cried as he scrambled wildly for footing nambok who was blown off to sea come back  the men and women shrank away and the children scuttled off between their legs only opeekwan was brave as befitted the head man of the village he strode forward and gazed long and earnestly at the newcomer  it is nambok he said at last and at the conviction in his voice the women wailed apprehensively and drew farther away  the lips of the stranger moved indecisively and his brown throat writhed and wrestled with unspoken words  la la it is nambok baskwahwan croaked peering up into his face ever did i say nambok would come back  ay it is nambok come back this time it was nambok himself who spoke putting a leg over the side of the bidarka and standing with one foot afloat and one ashore again his throat writhed and wrestled as he grappled after forgotten words and when the words came forth they were strange of sound and a spluttering of the lips accompanied the gutturals greeting o brothers he said brothers of old time before i went away with the offshore wind  he stepped out with both feet on the sand and opeekwan waved him back  thou art dead nambok he said  nambok laughed i am fat  dead men are not fat opeekwan confessed thou hast fared well but it is strange no man may mate with the offshore wind and come back on the heels of the years  i have come back nambok answered simply  mayhap thou art a shadow then a passing shadow of the nambok that was shadows come back  i am hungry shadows do not eat  but opeekwan doubted and brushed his hand across his brow in sore puzzlement nambok was likewise puzzled and as he looked up and down the line found no welcome in the eyes of the fisherfolk the men and women whispered together the children stole timidly back among their elders and bristling dogs fawned up to him and sniffed suspiciously  i bore thee nambok and i gave thee suck when thou wast little baskwahwan whimpered drawing closer and shadow though thou be or no shadow i will give thee to eat now  nambok made to come to her but a growl of fear and menace warned him back he said something in a strange tongue which sounded like goddam and added no shadow am i but a man  who may know concerning the things of mystery opeekwan demanded half of himself and half of his tribespeople we are and in a breath we are not if the man may become shadow may not the shadow become man nambok was but is not this we know but we do not know if this be nambok or the shadow of nambok  nambok cleared his throat and made answer in the old time long ago thy fathers father opeekwan went away and came back on the heels of the years nor was a place by the fire denied him it is said  he paused significantly and they hung on his utterance it is said he repeated driving his point home with deliberation that sipsip his klooch bore him two sons after he came back  but he had no doings with the offshore wind opeekwan retorted he went away into the heart of the land and it is in the nature of things that a man may go on and on into the land  and likewise the sea but that is neither here nor there it is said  that thy fathers father told strange tales of the things he saw  ay strange tales he told  i too have strange tales to tell nambok stated insidiously and as they wavered and presents likewise  he pulled from the bidarka a shawl marvellous of texture and color and flung it about his mothers shoulders the women voiced a collective sigh of admiration and old baskwahwan ruffled the gay material and patted it and crooned in childish joy  he has tales to tell koogah muttered and presents a woman seconded  and opeekwan knew that his people were eager and further he was aware himself of an itching curiosity concerning those untold tales the fishing has been good he said judiciously and we have oil in plenty so come nambok let us feast  two of the men hoisted the bidarka on their shoulders and carried it up to the fire nambok walked by the side of opeekwan and the villagers followed after save those of the women who lingered a moment to lay caressing fingers on the shawl  there was little talk while the feast went on though many and curious were the glances stolen at the son of baskwahwan this embarrassed himnot because he was modest of spirit however but for the fact that the stench of the sealoil had robbed him of his appetite and that he keenly desired to conceal his feelings on the subject  eat thou art hungry opeekwan commanded and nambok shut both his eyes and shoved his fist into the big pot of putrid fish  la la be not ashamed the seal were many this year and strong men are ever hungry and baskwahwan sopped a particularly offensive chunk of salmon into the oil and passed it fondly and dripping to her son  in despair when premonitory symptoms warned him that his stomach was not so strong as of old he filled his pipe and struck up a smoke the people fed on noisily and watched few of them could boast of intimate acquaintance with the precious weed though now and again small quantities and abominable qualities were obtained in trade from the eskimos to the northward koogah sitting next to him indicated that he was not averse to taking a draw and between two mouthfuls with the oil thick on his lips sucked away at the amber stem and thereupon nambok held his stomach with a shaky hand and declined the proffered return koogah could keep the pipe he said for he had intended so to honor him from the first and the people licked their fingers and approved of his liberality  opeekwan rose to his feet and now o nambok the feast is ended and we would listen concerning the strange things you have seen  the fisherfolk applauded with their hands and gathering about them their work prepared to listen the men were busy fashioning spears and carving on ivory while the women scraped the fat from the hides of the hair seal and made them pliable or sewed muclucs with threads of sinew namboks eyes roved over the scene but there was not the charm about it that his recollection had warranted him to expect during the years of his wandering he had looked forward to just this scene and now that it had come he was disappointed it was a bare and meagre life he deemed and not to be compared to the one to which he had become used still he would open their eyes a bit and his own eyes sparkled at the thought  brothers he began with the smug complacency of a man about to relate the big things he has done it was late summer of many summers back with much such weather as this promises to be when i went away you all remember the day when the gulls flew low and the wind blew strong from the land and i could not hold my bidarka against it i tied the covering of the bidarka about me so that no water could get in and all of the night i fought with the storm and in the morning there was no landonly the seaand the offshore wind held me close in its arms and bore me along three such nights whitened into dawn and showed me no land and the offshore wind would not let me go  and when the fourth day came i was as a madman i could not dip my paddle for want of food and my head went round and round what of the thirst that was upon me but the sea was no longer angry and the soft south wind was blowing and as i looked about me i saw a sight that made me think i was indeed mad  nambok paused to pick away a sliver of salmon lodged between his teeth and the men and women with idle hands and heads craned forward waited  it was a canoe a big canoe if all the canoes i have ever seen were made into one canoe it would not be so large  there were exclamations of doubt and koogah whose years were many shook his head  if each bidarka were as a grain of sand nambok defiantly continued and if there were as many bidarkas as there be grains of sand in this beach still would they not make so big a canoe as this i saw on the morning of the fourth day it was a very big canoe and it was called a schooner i saw this thing of wonder this great schooner coming after me and on it i saw men  hold o nambok opeekwan broke in what manner of men were theybig men  nay mere men like you and me  did the big canoe come fast  ay  the sides were tall the men short opeekwan stated the premises with conviction and did these men dip with long paddles  nambok grinned there were no paddles he said  mouths remained open and a long silence dropped down opeekwan borrowed koogahs pipe for a couple of contemplative sucks one of the younger women giggled nervously and drew upon herself angry eyes  there were no paddles opeekwan asked softly returning the pipe  the south wind was behind nambok explained  but the winddrift is slow  the schooner had wingsthus he sketched a diagram of masts and sails in the sand and the men crowded around and studied it the wind was blowing briskly and for more graphic elucidation he seized the corners of his mothers shawl and spread them out till it bellied like a sail baskwahwan scolded and struggled but was blown down the beach for a score of feet and left breathless and stranded in a heap of driftwood the men uttered sage grunts of comprehension but koogah suddenly tossed back his hoary head  ho ho he laughed a foolish thing this big canoe a most foolish thing the plaything of the wind wheresoever the wind goes it goes too no man who journeys therein may name the landing beach for always he goes with the wind and the wind goes everywhere but no man knows where  it is so opeekwan supplemented gravely with the wind the going is easy but against the wind a man striveth hard and for that they had no paddles these men on the big canoe did not strive at all  small need to strive nambok cried angrily the schooner went likewise against the wind  and what said you made the schschschooner go koogah asked tripping craftily over the strange word  the wind was the impatient response  then the wind made the schschschooner go against the wind old koogah dropped an open leer to opeekwan and the laughter growing around him continued the wind blows from the south and blows the schooner south the wind blows against the wind the wind blows one way and the other at the same time it is very simple we understand nambok we clearly understand  thou art a fool  truth falls from thy lips koogah answered meekly i was overlong in understanding and the thing was simple  but namboks face was dark and he said rapid words which they had never heard before bonescratching and skinscraping were resumed but he shut his lips tightly on the tongue that could not be believed  this schschschooner koogah imperturbably asked it was made of a big tree  it was made of many trees nambok snapped shortly it was very big  he lapsed into sullen silence again and opeekwan nudged koogah who shook his head with slow amazement and murmured it is very strange  nambok took the bait that is nothing he said airily you should see the steamer as the grain of sand is to the bidarka as the bidarka is to the schooner so the schooner is to the steamer further the steamer is made of iron it is all iron  nay nay nambok cried the head man how can that be always iron goes to the bottom for behold i received an iron knife in trade from the head man of the next village and yesterday the iron knife slipped from my fingers and went down down into the sea to all things there be law never was there one thing outside the law this we know and moreover we know that things of a kind have the one law and that all iron has the one law so unsay thy words nambok that we may yet honor thee  it is so nambok persisted the steamer is all iron and does not sink  nay nay this cannot be  with my own eyes i saw it  it is not in the nature of things  but tell me nambok koogah interrupted for fear the tale would go no farther tell me the manner of these men in finding their way across the sea when there is no land by which to steer  the sun points out the path  but how  at midday the head man of the schooner takes a thing through which his eye looks at the sun and then he makes the sun climb down out of the sky to the edge of the earth  now this be evil medicine cried opeekwan aghast at the sacrilege the men held up their hands in horror and the women moaned this be evil medicine it is not good to misdirect the great sun which drives away the night and gives us the seal the salmon and warm weather  what if it be evil medicine nambok demanded truculently i too have looked through the thing at the sun and made the sun climb down out of the sky  those who were nearest drew away from him hurriedly and a woman covered the face of a child at her breast so that his eye might not fall upon it  but on the morning of the fourth day o nambok koogah suggested on the morning of the fourth day when the schschschooner came after thee  i had little strength left in me and could not run away so i was taken on board and water was poured down my throat and good food given me twice my brothers you have seen a white man these men were all white and as many as have i fingers and toes and when i saw they were full of kindness i took heart and i resolved to bring away with me report of all that i saw and they taught me the work they did and gave me good food and a place to sleep  and day after day we went over the sea and each day the head man drew the sun down out of the sky and made it tell where we were and when the waves were kind we hunted the fur seal and i marvelled much for always did they fling the meat and the fat away and save only the skin  opeekwans mouth was twitching violently and he was about to make denunciation of such waste when koogah kicked him to be still  after a weary time when the sun was gone and the bite of the frost come into the air the head man pointed the nose of the schooner south south and east we travelled for days upon days with never the land in sight and we were near to the village from which hailed the men  how did they know they were near opeekwan unable to contain himself longer demanded there was no land to see  nambok glowered on him wrathfully did i not say the head man brought the sun down out of the sky  koogah interposed and nambok went on  as i say when we were near to that village a great storm blew up and in the night we were helpless and knew not where we were  thou hast just said the head man knew  oh peace opeekwan thou art a fool and cannot understand as i say we were helpless in the night when i heard above the roar of the storm the sound of the sea on the beach and next we struck with a mighty crash and i was in the water swimming it was a rockbound coast with one patch of beach in many miles and the law was that i should dig my hands into the sand and draw myself clear of the surf the other men must have pounded against the rocks for none of them came ashore but the head man and him i knew only by the ring on his finger  when day came there being nothing of the schooner i turned my face to the land and journeyed into it that i might get food and look upon the faces of the people and when i came to a house i was taken in and given to eat for i had learned their speech and the white men are ever kindly and it was a house bigger than all the houses built by us and our fathers before us  it was a mighty house koogah said masking his unbelief with wonder  and many trees went into the making of such a house opeekwan added taking the cue  that is nothing nambok shrugged his shoulders in belittling fashion as our houses are to that house so that house was to the houses i was yet to see  and they are not big men  nay mere men like you and me nambok answered i had cut a stick that i might walk in comfort and remembering that i was to bring report to you my brothers i cut a notch in the stick for each person who lived in that house and i stayed there many days and worked for which they gave me moneya thing of which you know nothing but which is very good  and one day i departed from that place to go farther into the land and as i walked i met many people and i cut smaller notches in the stick that there might be room for all then i came upon a strange thing on the ground before me was a bar of iron as big in thickness as my arm and a long step away was another bar of iron  then wert thou a rich man opeekwan asserted for iron be worth more than anything else in the world it would have made many knives  nay it was not mine  it was a find and a find be lawful  not so the white men had placed it there and further these bars were so long that no man could carry them awayso long that as far as i could see there was no end to them  nambok that is very much iron opeekwan cautioned  ay it was hard to believe with my own eyes upon it but i could not gainsay my eyes and as i looked i heard he turned abruptly upon the head man opeekwan thou hast heard the sealion bellow in his anger make it plain in thy mind of as many sealions as there be waves to the sea and make it plain that all these sealions be made into one sealion and as that one sealion would bellow so bellowed the thing i heard  the fisherfolk cried aloud in astonishment and opeekwans jaw lowered and remained lowered  and in the distance i saw a monster like unto a thousand whales it was oneeyed and vomited smoke and it snorted with exceeding loudness i was afraid and ran with shaking legs along the path between the bars but it came with the speed of the wind this monster and i leaped the iron bars with its breath hot on my face  opeekwan gained control of his jaw again andand then o nambok  then it came by on the bars and harmed me not and when my legs could hold me up again it was gone from sight and it is a very common thing in that country even the women and children are not afraid men make them to do work these monsters  as we make our dogs do work koogah asked with sceptic twinkle in his eye  ay as we make our dogs do work  and how do they breed thesethese things opeekwan questioned  they breed not at all men fashion them cunningly of iron and feed them with stone and give them water to drink the stone becomes fire and the water becomes steam and the steam of the water is the breath of their nostrils and  there there o nambok opeekwan interrupted tell us of other wonders we grow tired of this which we may not understand  you do not understand nambok asked despairingly  nay we do not understand the men and women wailed back we cannot understand  nambok thought of a combined harvester and of the machines wherein visions of living men were to be seen and of the machines from which came the voices of men and he knew his people could never understand  dare i say i rode this iron monster through the land he asked bitterly  opeekwan threw up his hands palms outward in open incredulity say on say anything we listen  then did i ride the iron monster for which i gave money  thou saidst it was fed with stone  and likewise thou fool i said money was a thing of which you know nothing as i say i rode the monster through the land and through many villages until i came to a big village on a salt arm of the sea and the houses shoved their roofs among the stars in the sky and the clouds drifted by them and everywhere was much smoke and the roar of that village was like the roar of the sea in storm and the people were so many that i flung away my stick and no longer remembered the notches upon it  hadst thou made small notches koogah reproved thou mightst have brought report  nambok whirled upon him in anger had i made small notches listen koogah thou scratcher of bone if i had made small notches neither the stick nor twenty sticks could have borne themnay not all the driftwood of all the beaches between this village and the next and if all of you the women and children as well were twenty times as many and if you had twenty hands each and in each hand a stick and a knife still the notches could not be cut for the people i saw so many were they and so fast did they come and go  there cannot be so many people in all the world opeekwan objected for he was stunned and his mind could not grasp such magnitude of numbers  what dost thou know of all the world and how large it is nambok demanded  but there cannot be so many people in one place  who art thou to say what can be and what cannot be  it stands to reason there cannot be so many people in one place their canoes would clutter the sea till there was no room and they could empty the sea each day of its fish and they would not all be fed  so it would seem nambok made final answer yet it was so with my own eyes i saw and flung my stick away he yawned heavily and rose to his feet i have paddled far the day has been long and i am tired now i will sleep and tomorrow we will have further talk upon the things i have seen  baskwahwan hobbling fearfully in advance proud indeed yet awed by her wonderful son led him to her igloo and stowed him away among the greasy illsmelling furs but the men lingered by the fire and a council was held wherein was there much whispering and lowvoiced discussion  an hour passed and a second and nambok slept and the talk went on the evening sun dipped toward the northwest and at eleven at night was nearly due north then it was that the head man and the bonescratcher separated themselves from the council and aroused nambok he blinked up into their faces and turned on his side to sleep again opeekwan gripped him by the arm and kindly but firmly shook his senses back into him  come nambok arise he commanded it be time  another feast nambok cried nay i am not hungry go on with the eating and let me sleep  time to be gone koogah thundered  but opeekwan spoke more softly thou wast bidarkamate with me when we were boys he said together we first chased the seal and drew the salmon from the traps and thou didst drag me back to life nambok when the sea closed over me and i was sucked down to the black rocks together we hungered and bore the chill of the frost and together we crawled beneath the one fur and lay close to each other and because of these things and the kindness in which i stood to thee it grieves me sore that thou shouldst return such a remarkable liar we cannot understand and our heads be dizzy with the things thou hast spoken it is not good and there has been much talk in the council wherefore we send thee away that our heads may remain clear and strong and be not troubled by the unaccountable things  these things thou speakest of be shadows koogah took up the strain from the shadowworld thou hast brought them and to the shadowworld thou must return them thy bidarka be ready and the tribespeople wait they may not sleep until thou art gone  nambok was perplexed but hearkened to the voice of the head man  if thou art nambok opeekwan was saying thou art a fearful and most wonderful liar if thou art the shadow of nambok then thou speakest of shadows concerning which it is not good that living men have knowledge this great village thou hast spoken of we deem the village of shadows therein flutter the souls of the dead for the dead be many and the living few the dead do not come back never have the dead come backsave thou with thy wondertales it is not meet that the dead come back and should we permit it great trouble may be our portion  nambok knew his people well and was aware that the voice of the council was supreme so he allowed himself to be led down to the waters edge where he was put aboard his bidarka and a paddle thrust into his hand a stray wildfowl honked somewhere to seaward and the surf broke limply and hollowly on the sand a dim twilight brooded over land and water and in the north the sun smouldered vague and troubled and draped about with bloodred mists the gulls were flying low the offshore wind blew keen and chill and the blackmassed clouds behind it gave promise of bitter weather  out of the sea thou earnest opeekwan chanted oracularly and back into the sea thou goest thus is balance achieved and all things brought to law  baskwahwan limped to the frothmark and cried i bless thee nambok for that thou remembered me  but koogah shoving nambok clear of the beach tore the shawl from her shoulders and flung it into the bidarka  it is cold in the long nights she wailed and the frost is prone to nip old bones  the thing is a shadow the bonescratcher answered and shadows cannot keep thee warm  nambok stood up that his voice might carry o baskwahwan mother that bore me he called listen to the words of nambok thy son there be room in his bidarka for two and he would that thou camest with him for his journey is to where there are fish and oil in plenty there the frost comes not and life is easy and the things of iron do the work of men wilt thou come o baskwahwan  she debated a moment while the bidarka drifted swiftly from her then raised her voice to a quavering treble i am old nambok and soon i shall pass down among the shadows but i have no wish to go before my time i am old nambok and i am afraid  a shaft of light shot across the dimlit sea and wrapped boat and man in a splendor of red and gold then a hush fell upon the fisherfolk and only was heard the moan of the offshore wind and the cries of the gulls flying low in the air     the master of mystery   there was complaint in the village the women chattered together with shrill highpitched voices the men were glum and doubtful of aspect and the very dogs wandered dubiously about alarmed in vague ways by the unrest of the camp and ready to take to the woods on the first outbreak of trouble the air was filled with suspicion no man was sure of his neighbor and each was conscious that he stood in like unsureness with his fellows even the children were oppressed and solemn and little di ya the cause of it all had been soundly thrashed first by hooniah his mother and then by his father bawn and was now whimpering and looking pessimistically out upon the world from the shelter of the big overturned canoe on the beach  and to make the matter worse scundoo the shaman was in disgrace and his known magic could not be called upon to seek out the evildoer forsooth a month gone he had promised a fair south wind so that the tribe might journey to the potlatch at tonkin where taku jim was giving away the savings of twenty years and when the day came lo a grievous north wind blew and of the first three canoes to venture forth one was swamped in the big seas and two were pounded to pieces on the rocks and a child was drowned he had pulled the string of the wrong bag he explaineda mistake but the people refused to listen the offerings of meat and fish and fur ceased to come to his door and he sulked withinso they thought fasting in bitter penance in reality eating generously from his wellstored cache and meditating upon the fickleness of the mob  the blankets of hooniah were missing they were good blankets of most marvellous thickness and warmth and her pride in them was greatened in that they had been come by so cheaply tykwan of the next village but one was a fool to have so easily parted with them but then she did not know they were the blankets of the murdered englishman because of whose takeoff the united states cutter nosed along the coast for a time while its launches puffed and snorted among the secret inlets and not knowing that tykwan had disposed of them in haste so that his own people might not have to render account to the government hooniahs pride was unshaken and because the women envied her her pride was without end and boundless till it filled the village and spilled over along the alaskan shore from dutch harbor to st marys her totem had become justly celebrated and her name known on the lips of men wherever men fished and feasted what of the blankets and their marvellous thickness and warmth it was a most mysterious happening the manner of their going  i but stretched them up in the sun by the sidewall of the house hooniah disclaimed for the thousandth time to her thlinget sisters i but stretched them up and turned my back for di ya doughthief and eater of raw flour that he is with head into the big iron pot overturned and stuck there his legs waving like the branches of a forest tree in the wind and i did but drag him out and twice knock his head against the door for riper understanding and behold the blankets were not  the blankets were not the women repeated in awed whispers  a great loss one added a second never were there such blankets and a third we be sorry hooniah for thy loss yet each woman of them was glad in her heart that the odious dissensionbreeding blankets were gone i but stretched them up in the sun hooniah began for the thousand and first time  yea yea bawn spoke up wearied but there were no gossips in the village from other places wherefore it be plain that some of our own tribespeople have laid unlawful hand upon the blankets  how can that be o bawn the women chorussed indignantly who should there be  then has there been witchcraft bawn continued stolidly enough though he stole a sly glance at their faces  witchcraft and at the dread word their voices hushed and each looked fearfully at each  ay hooniah affirmed the latent malignancy of her nature flashing into a moments exultation and word has been sent to kloknoton and strong paddles truly shall he be here with the afternoon tide  the little groups broke up and fear descended upon the village of all misfortune witchcraft was the most appalling with the intangible and unseen things only the shamans could cope and neither man woman nor child could know until the moment of ordeal whether devils possessed their souls or not and of all shamans kloknoton who dwelt in the next village was the most terrible none found more evil spirits than he none visited his victims with more frightful tortures even had he found once a devil residing within the body of a threemonths babea most obstinate devil which could only be driven out when the babe had lain for a week on thorns and briers the body was thrown into the sea after that but the waves tossed it back again and again as a curse upon the village nor did it finally go away till two strong men were staked out at low tide and drowned  and hooniah had sent for this kloknoton better had it been if scundoo their own shaman were undisgraced for he had ever a gentler way and he had been known to drive forth two devils from a man who afterward begat seven healthy children but kloknoton they shuddered with dire foreboding at thought of him and each one felt himself the centre of accusing eyes and looked accusingly upon his fellowseach one and all save sime and sime was a scoffer whose evil end was destined with a certitude his successes could not shake  hoh hoh he laughed devils and kloknotonthan whom no greater devil can be found in thlinket land  thou fool even now he cometh with witcheries and sorceries so beware thy tongue lest evil befall thee and thy days be short in the land  so spoke lalah otherwise the cheater and sime laughed scornfully  i am sime unused to fear unafraid of the dark i am a strong man as my father before me and my head is clear nor you nor i have seen with our eyes the unseen evil things  but scundoo hath lalah made answer and likewise kloknoton this we know  how dost thou know son of a fool sime thundered the choleric blood darkening his thick bull neck  by the word of their mouthseven so  sime snorted a shaman is only a man may not his words be crooked even as thine and mine bah bah and once more bah and this for thy shamans and thy shamans devils and this and this  and snapping his fingers to right and left sime strode through the onlookers who made overzealous and fearsome way for him  a good fisher and strong hunter but an evil man said one  yet does he flourish speculated another  wherefore be thou evil and flourish sime retorted over his shoulder and were all evil there would be no need for shamans bah you childrenafraidofthedark  and when kloknoton arrived on the afternoon tide simes defiant laugh was unabated nor did he forbear to make a joke when the shaman tripped on the sand in the landing kloknoton looked at him sourly and without greeting stalked straight through their midst to the house of scundoo  of the meeting with scundoo none of the tribespeople might know for they clustered reverently in the distance and spoke in whispers while the masters of mystery were together  greeting o scundoo kloknoton rumbled wavering perceptibly from doubt of his reception  he was a giant in stature and towered massively above little scundoo whose thin voice floated upward like the faint far rasping of a cricket  greeting kloknoton he returned the day is fair with thy coming  yet it would seem  kloknoton hesitated  yea yea the little shaman put in impatiently that i have fallen on ill days else would i not stand in gratitude to you in that you do my work  it grieves me friend scundoo   nay i am made glad kloknoton  but will i give thee half of that which be given me  not so good kloknoton murmured scundoo with a deprecatory wave of the hand it is i who am thy slave and my days shall be filled with desire to befriend thee  as i  as thou now befriendest me  that being so it is then a bad business these blankets of the woman hooniah  the big shaman blundered tentatively in his quest and scundoo smiled a wan gray smile for he was used to reading men and all men seemed very small to him  ever hast thou dealt in strong medicine he said doubtless the evildoer will be briefly known to thee  ay briefly known when i set eyes upon him again kloknoton hesitated have there been gossips from other places he asked  scundoo shook his head behold is this not a most excellent mucluc  he held up the footcovering of sealskin and walrus hide and his visitor examined it with secret interest  it did come to me by a closedriven bargain  kloknoton nodded attentively  i got it from the man lalah he is a remarkable man and often have i thought   so kloknoton ventured impatiently  often have i thought scundoo concluded his voice falling as he came to a full pause it is a fair day and thy medicine be strong kloknoton  kloknotons face brightened thou art a great man scundoo a shaman of shamans i go now i shall remember thee always and the man lalah as you say is a remarkable man  scundoo smiled yet more wan and gray closed the door on the heels of his departing visitor and barred and doublebarred it  sime was mending his canoe when kloknoton came down the beach and he broke off from his work only long enough to ostentatiously load his rifle and place it near him  the shaman noted the action and called out let all the people come together on this spot it is the word of kloknoton devilseeker and driver of devils  he had been minded to assemble them at hooniahs house but it was necessary that all should be present and he was doubtful of simes obedience and did not wish trouble sime was a good man to let alone his judgment ran and withal a bad one for the health of any shaman  let the woman hooniah be brought kloknoton commanded glaring ferociously about the circle and sending chills up and down the spines of those he looked upon  hooniah waddled forward head bent and gaze averted  where be thy blankets  i but stretched them up in the sun and behold they were not she whined  so  it was because of di ya  so  him have i beaten sore and he shall yet be beaten for that he brought trouble upon us who be poor people  the blankets kloknoton bellowed hoarsely foreseeing her desire to lower the price to be paid the blankets woman thy wealth is known  i but stretched them up in the sun she sniffled and we be poor people and have nothing  he stiffened suddenly with a hideous distortion of the face and hooniah shrank back but so swiftly did he spring forward with inturned eyeballs and loosened jaw that she stumbled and fell down grovelling at his feet he waved his arms about wildly flagellating the air his body writhing and twisting in torment an epilepsy seemed to come upon him a white froth flecked his lips and his body was convulsed with shiverings and tremblings  the women broke into a wailing chant swaying backward and forward in abandonment while one by one the men succumbed to the excitement till only sime remained he perched upon his canoe looked on in mockery yet the ancestors whose seed he bore pressed heavily upon him and he swore his strongest oaths that his courage might be cheered kloknoton was horrible to behold he had cast off his blanket and torn his clothes from him so that he was quite naked save for a girdle of eagleclaws about his thighs shrieking and yelling his long black hair flying like a blot of night he leaped frantically about the circle a certain rude rhythm characterized his frenzy and when all were under its sway swinging their bodies in accord with his and venting their cries in unison he sat bolt upright with arm outstretched and long talonlike finger extended a low moaning as of the dead greeted this and the people cowered with shaking knees as the dread finger passed them slowly by for death went with it and life remained with those who watched it go and being rejected they watched with eager intentness  finally with a tremendous cry the fateful finger rested upon lalah he shook like an aspen seeing himself already dead his household goods divided and his widow married to his brother he strove to speak to deny but his tongue clove to his mouth and his throat was sanded with an intolerable thirst kloknoton seemed to half swoon away now that his work was done but he waited with closed eyes listening for the great bloodcry to go upthe great bloodcry familiar to his ear from a thousand conjurations when the tribespeople flung themselves like wolves upon the trembling victim but only was there silence then a low tittering from nowhere in particular which spread and spread until a vast laughter welled up to the sky  wherefore he cried  na na the people laughed thy medicine be ill o kloknoton  it be known to all lalah stuttered for eight weary months have i been gone afar with the siwash sealers and but this day am i come back to find the blankets of hooniah gone ere i came  it be true they cried with one accord the blankets of hooniah were gone ere he came  and thou shalt be paid nothing for thy medicine which is of no avail announced hooniah on her feet once more and smarting from a sense of ridiculousness  but kloknoton saw only the face of scundoo and its wan gray smile heard only the faint far crickets rasping i got it from the man lalah and often have i thought and it is a fair day and thy medicine be strong  he brushed by hooniah and the circle instinctively gave way for him to pass sime flung a jeer from the top of the canoe the women snickered in his face cries of derision rose in his wake but he took no notice pressing onward to the house of scundoo he hammered on the door beat it with his fists and howled vile imprecations yet there was no response save that in the lulls scundoos voice rose eerily in incantation kloknoton raged about like a madman but when he attempted to break in the door with a huge stone murmurs arose from the men and women and he kloknoton knew that he stood shorn of his strength and authority before an alien people he saw a man stoop for a stone and a second and a bodily fear ran through him  harm not scundoo who is a master a woman cried out  better you return to your own village a man advised menacingly  kloknoton turned on his heel and went down among them to the beach a bitter rage at his heart and in his head a just apprehension for his defenceless back but no stones were cast the children swarmed mockingly about his feet and the air was wild with laughter and derision but that was all yet he did not breathe freely until the canoe was well out upon the water when he rose up and laid a futile curse upon the village and its people not forgetting to particularly specify scundoo who had made a mock of him  ashore there was a clamor for scundoo and the whole population crowded his door entreating and imploring in confused babel till he came forth and raised his hand  in that ye are my children i pardon freely he said but never again for the last time thy foolishness goes unpunished that which ye wish shall be granted and it be already known to me this night when the moon has gone behind the world to look upon the mighty dead let all the people gather in the blackness before the house of hooniah then shall the evildoer stand forth and take his merited reward i have spoken  it shall be death bawn vociferated for that it hath brought worry upon us and shame  so be it scundoo replied and shut his door  now shall all be made clear and plain and content rest upon us once again lalah declaimed oracularly  because of scundoo the little man sime sneered  because of the medicine of scundoo the little man lalah corrected  children of foolishness these thlinket people sime smote his thigh a resounding blow it passeth understanding that grown women and strong men should get down in the dirt to dreamthings and wonder tales  i am a travelled man lalah answered i have journeyed on the deep seas and seen signs and wonders and i know that these things be so i am lalah  the cheater  so called but the farjourneyer rightnamed  i am not so great a traveller sime began  then hold thy tongue bawn cut in and they separated in anger  when the last silver moonlight had vanished beyond the world scundoo came among the people huddled about the house of hooniah he walked with a quick alert step and those who saw him in the light of hooniahs slushlamp noticed that he came emptyhanded without rattles masks or shamans paraphernalia save for a great sleepy raven carried under one arm  is there wood gathered for a fire so that all may see when the work be done he demanded  yea bawn answered there be wood in plenty  then let all listen for my words be few with me have i brought jelchs the raven diviner of mystery and seer of things him in his blackness shall i place under the big black pot of hooniah in the blackest corner of her house the slushlamp shall cease to burn and all remain in outer darkness it is very simple one by one shall ye go into the house lay hand upon the pot for the space of one long intake of the breath and withdraw again doubtless jelchs will make outcry when the hand of the evildoer is nigh him or who knows but otherwise he may manifest his wisdom are ye ready  we be ready came the multivoiced response  then will i call the name aloud each in his turn and hers till all are called  thereat lalah was first chosen and he passed in at once every ear strained and through the silence they could hear his footsteps creaking across the rickety floor but that was all jelchs made no outcry gave no sign bawn was next chosen for it well might be that a man should steal his own blankets with intent to cast shame upon his neighbors hooniah followed and other women and children but without result  sime scundoo called out  sime he repeated  but sime did not stir  art thou afraid of the dark lalah his own integrity being proved demanded fiercely  sime chuckled i laugh at it all for it is a great foolishness yet will i go in not in belief in wonders but in token that i am unafraid  and he passed in boldly and came out still mocking  some day shalt thou die with great suddenness lalah whispered righteously indignant  i doubt not the scoffer answered airily few men of us die in our beds what of the shamans and the deep sea  when half the villagers had safely undergone the ordeal the excitement because of its repression was painfully intense when twothirds had gone through a young woman close on her first childbed broke down and in nervous shrieks and laughter gave form to her terror  finally the turn came for the last of all to go in and nothing had happened and di ya was the last of all it must surely be he hooniah let out a lament to the stars while the rest drew back from the luckless lad he was halfdead from fright and his legs gave under him so that he staggered on the threshold and nearly fell scundoo shoved him inside and closed the door a long time went by during which could be heard only the boys weeping then very slowly came the creak of his steps to the far corner a pause and the creaking of his return the door opened and he came forth nothing had happened and he was the last  let the fire be lighted scundoo commanded  the bright flames rushed upward revealing faces yet marked with vanishing fear but also clouded with doubt  surely the thing has failed hooniah whispered hoarsely  yea bawn answered complacently scundoo groweth old and we stand in need of a new shaman  where now is the wisdom of jelchs sime snickered in lalahs ear  lalah brushed his brow in a puzzled manner and said nothing  sime threw his chest out arrogantly and strutted up to the little shaman hoh hoh as i said nothing has come of it  so it would seem so it would seem scundoo answered meekly and it would seem strange to those unskilled in the affairs of mystery  as thou sime queried audaciously  mayhap even as i scundoo spoke quite softly his eyelids drooping slowly drooping down down till his eyes were all but hidden so i am minded of another test let every man woman and child now and at once hold their hands well up above their heads  so unexpected was the order and so imperatively was it given that it was obeyed without question every hand was in the air  let each look on the others hands and let all look scundoo commanded so that  but a noise of laughter which was more of wrath drowned his voice all eyes had come to rest upon sime every hand but his was black with soot and his was guiltless of the smirch of hooniahs pot  a stone hurtled through the air and struck him on the cheek  it is a lie he yelled a lie i know naught of hooniahs blankets  a second stone gashed his brow a third whistled past his head the great bloodcry went up and everywhere were people groping on the ground for missiles he staggered and half sank down  it was a joke only a joke he shrieked i but took them for a joke  where hast thou hidden them scundoos shrill sharp voice cut through the tumult like a knife  in the large skinbale in my house the one slung by the ridgepole came the answer but it was a joke i say only  scundoo nodded his head and the air went thick with flying stones simes wife was crying silently her head upon her knees but his little boy with shrieks and laughter was flinging stones with the rest  hooniah came waddling back with the precious blankets scundoo stopped her  we be poor people and have little she whimpered so be not hard upon us o scundoo  the people ceased from the quivering stonepile they had builded and looked on  nay it was never my way good hooniah scundoo made answer reaching for the blankets in token that i am not hard these only shall i take  am i not wise my children he demanded  thou art indeed wise o scundoo they cried in one voice  and he went away into the darkness the blankets around him and jelchs nodding sleepily under his arm     the sunlanders   mandell is an obscure village on the rim of the polar sea it is not large and the people are peaceable more peaceable even than those of the adjacent tribes there are few men in mandell and many women wherefore a wholesome and necessary polygamy is in practice the women bear children with ardor and the birth of a manchild is hailed with acclamation then there is aabwaak whose head rests always on one shoulder as though at some time the neck had become very tired and refused forevermore its wonted duty  the cause of all these thingsthe peaceableness and the polygamy and the tired neck of aabwaakgoes back among the years to the time when the schooner search dropped anchor in mandell bay and when tyee chief man of the tribe conceived a scheme of sudden wealth to this day the story of things that happened is remembered and spoken of with bated breath by the people of mandell who are cousins to the hungry folk who live in the west children draw closer when the tale is told and marvel sagely to themselves at the madness of those who might have been their forebears had they not provoked the sunlanders and come to bitter ends  it began to happen when six men came ashore from the search with heavy outfits as though they had come to stay and quartered themselves in neegahs igloo not but that they paid well in flour and sugar for the lodging but neegah was aggrieved because mesahchie his daughter elected to cast her fortunes and seek food and blanket with billman who was leader of the party of white men  she is worth a price neegah complained to the gathering by the councilfire when the six white men were asleep she is worth a price for we have more men than women and the men be bidding high the hunter ounenk offered me a kayak newmade and a gun which he got in trade from the hungry folk this was i offered and behold now she is gone and i have nothing  i too did bid for mesahchie grumbled a voice in tones not altogether joyless and peelo shoved his broadcheeked jovial face for a moment into the light  thou too neegah affirmed and there were others why is there such a restlessness upon the sunlanders he demanded petulantly why do they not stay at home the snow people do not wander to the lands of the sunlanders  better were it to ask why they come cried a voice from the darkness and aabwaak pushed his way to the front  ay why they come clamored many voices and aabwaak waved his hand for silence  men do not dig in the ground for nothing he began and i have it in mind of the whale people who are likewise sunlanders and who lost their ship in the ice you all remember the whale people who came to us in their broken boats and who went away into the south with dogs and sleds when the frost arrived and snow covered the land and you remember while they waited for the frost that one man of them dug in the ground and then two men and three and then all men of them with great excitement and much disturbance what they dug out of the ground we do not know for they drove us away so we could not see but afterward when they were gone we looked and found nothing yet there be much ground and they did not dig it all  ay aabwaak ay cried the people in admiration  wherefore i have it in mind he concluded that one sunlander tells another and that these sunlanders have been so told and are come to dig in the ground  but how can it be that billman speaks our tongue demanded a little weazened old hunterbillman upon whom never before our eyes have rested  billman has been other times in the snow lands aabwaak answered else would he not speak the speech of the bear people which is like the speech of the hungry folk which is very like the speech of the mandells for there have been many sunlanders among the bear people few among the hungry folk and none at all among the mandells save the whale people and those who sleep now in the igloo of neegah  their sugar is very good neegah commented and their flour  they have great wealth ounenk added yesterday i was to their ship and beheld most cunning tools of iron and knives and guns and flour and sugar and strange foods without end  it is so brothers tyee stood up and exulted inwardly at the respect and silence his people accorded him they be very rich these sunlanders also they be fools for behold they come among us boldly blindly and without thought for all of their great wealth even now they snore and we are many and unafraid  mayhap they too are unafraid being great fighters the weazened little old hunter objected  but tyee scowled upon him nay it would not seem so they live to the south under the path of the sun and are soft as their dogs are soft you remember the dog of the whale people our dogs ate him the second day for he was soft and could not fight the sun is warm and life easy in the sun lands and the men are as women and the women as children  heads nodded in approval and the women craned their necks to listen  it is said they are good to their women who do little work tittered likeeta a broadhipped healthy young woman daughter to tyee himself  thou wouldst follow the feet of mesahchie eh he cried angrily then he turned swiftly to the tribesmen look you brothers this is the way of the sunlanders they have eyes for our women and take them one by one as mesahchie has gone cheating neegah of her price so will likeeta go so will they all go and we be cheated i have talked with a hunter from the bear people and i know there be hungry folk among us let them speak if my words be true  the six hunters of the hungry folk attested the truth and fell each to telling his neighbor of the sunlanders and their ways there were mutterings from the younger men who had wives to seek and from the older men who had daughters to fetch prices and a low hum of rage rose higher and clearer  they are very rich and have cunning tools of iron and knives and guns without end tyee suggested craftily his dream of sudden wealth beginning to take shape  i shall take the gun of billman for myself aabwaak suddenly proclaimed  nay it shall be mine shouted neegah for there is the price of mesahchie to be reckoned  peace o brothers tyee swept the assembly with his hands let the women and children go to their igloos this is the talk of men let it be for the ears of men  there be guns in plenty for all he said when the women had unwillingly withdrawn i doubt not there will be two guns for each man without thought of the flour and sugar and other things and it is easy the six sunlanders in neegahs igloo will we kill tonight while they sleep tomorrow will we go in peace to the ship to trade and there when the time favors kill all their brothers and tomorrow night there shall be feasting and merriment and division of wealth and the least man shall possess more than did ever the greatest before is it wise that which i have spoken brothers  a low growl of approval answered him and preparation for the attack was begun the six hungry folk as became members of a wealthier tribe were armed with rifles and plenteously supplied with ammunition but it was only here and there that a mandell possessed a gun many of which were broken and there was a general slackness of powder and shells this poverty of war weapons however was relieved by myriads of boneheaded arrows and castingspears for work at a distance and for close quarters steel knives of russian and yankee make  let there be no noise tyee finally instructed but be there many on every side of the igloo and close so that the sunlanders may not break through then do you neegah with six of the young men behind crawl in to where they sleep take no guns which be prone to go off at unexpected times but put the strength of your arms into the knives  and be it understood that no harm befall mesahchie who is worth a price neegah whispered hoarsely  flat upon the ground the small army concentred on the igloo and behind deliciously expectant crouched many women and children come out to witness the murder the brief august night was passing and in the gray of dawn could be dimly discerned the creeping forms of neegah and the young men without pause on hands and knees they entered the long passageway and disappeared tyee rose up and rubbed his hands all was going well head after head in the big circle lifted and waited each man pictured the scene according to his naturethe sleeping men the plunge of the knives and the sudden death in the dark  a loud hail in the voice of a sunlander rent the silence and a shot rang out then an uproar broke loose inside the igloo without premeditation the circle swept forward into the passageway on the inside half a dozen repeating rifles began to chatter and the mandells jammed in the confined space were powerless those at the front strove madly to retreat from the firespitting guns in their very faces and those in the rear pressed as madly forward to the attack the bullets from the big 4590s drove through half a dozen men at a shot and the passageway gorged with surging helpless men became a shambles the rifles pumped without aim into the mass withered it away like a machine gun and against that steady stream of death no man could advance  never was there the like panted one of the hungry folk i did but look in and the dead were piled like seals on the ice after a killing  did i not say mayhap they were fighters cackled the weazened old hunter  it was to be expected aabwaak answered stoutly we fought in a trap of our making  o ye fools tyee chided ye sons of fools it was not planned this thing ye have done to neegah and the six young men only was it given to go inside my cunning is superior to the cunning of the sunlanders but ye take away its edge and rob me of its strength and make it worse than no cunning at all  no one made reply and all eyes centred on the igloo which loomed vague and monstrous against the clear northeast sky through a hole in the roof the smoke from the rifles curled slowly upward in the pulseless air and now and again a wounded man crawled painfully through the gray  let each ask of his neighbor for neegah and the six young men tyee commanded  and after a time the answer came back neegah and the six young men are not  and many more are not wailed a woman to the rear  the more wealth for those who are left tyee grimly consoled then turning to aabwaak he said go thou and gather together many sealskins filled with oil let the hunters empty them on the outside wood of the igloo and of the passage and let them put fire to it ere the sunlanders make holes in the igloo for their guns  even as he spoke a hole appeared in the dirt plastered between the logs a rifle muzzle protruded and one of the hungry folk clapped hand to his side and leaped in the air a second shot through the lungs brought him to the ground tyee and the rest scattered to either side out of direct range and aabwaak hastened the men forward with the skins of oil avoiding the loopholes which were making on every side of the igloo they emptied the skins on the dry driftlogs brought down by the mandell river from the treelands to the south ounenk ran forward with a blazing brand and the flames leaped upward many minutes passed without sign and they held their weapons ready as the fire gained headway  tyee rubbed his hands gleefully as the dry structure burned and crackled now we have them brothers in the trap  and no one may gainsay me the gun of billman aabwaak announced  save billman squeaked the old hunter for behold he cometh now  covered with a singed and blackened blanket the big white man leaped out of the blazing entrance and on his heels likewise shielded came mesahchie and the five other sunlanders the hungry folk tried to check the rush with an illdirected volley while the mandells hurled in a cloud of spears and arrows but the sunlanders cast their flaming blankets from them as they ran and it was seen that each bore on his shoulders a small pack of ammunition of all their possessions they had chosen to save that running swiftly and with purpose they broke the circle and headed directly for the great cliff which towered blackly in the brightening day a halfmile to the rear of the village  but tyee knelt on one knee and lined the sights of his rifle on the rearmost sunlander a great shout went up when he pulled the trigger and the man fell forward struggled partly up and fell again without regard for the rain of arrows another sunlander ran back bent over him and lifted him across his shoulders but the mandell spearmen were crowding up into closer range and a strong cast transfixed the wounded man he cried out and became swiftly limp as his comrade lowered him to the ground in the meanwhile billman and the three others had made a stand and were driving a leaden hail into the advancing spearmen the fifth sunlander bent over his stricken fellow felt the heart and then coolly cut the straps of the pack and stood up with the ammunition and extra gun  now is he a fool cried tyee leaping high as he ran forward to clear the squirming body of one of the hungry folk  his own rifle was clogged so that he could not use it and he called out for some one to spear the sunlander who had turned and was running for safety under the protecting fire the little old hunter poised his spear on the throwingstick swept his arm back as he ran and delivered the cast  by the body of the wolf say i it was a good throw tyee praised as the fleeing man pitched forward the spear standing upright between his shoulders and swaying slowly forward and back  the little weazened old man coughed and sat down a streak of red showed on his lips and welled into a thick stream he coughed again and a strange whistling came and went with his breath  they too are unafraid being great fighters he wheezed pawing aimlessly with his hands and behold billman comes now  tyee glanced up four mandells and one of the hungry folk had rushed upon the fallen man and were spearing him from his knees back to the earth in the twinkling of an eye tyee saw four of them cut down by the bullets of the sunlanders the fifth as yet unhurt seized the two rifles but as he stood up to make off he was whirled almost completely around by the impact of a bullet in the arm steadied by a second and overthrown by the shock of a third a moment later and billman was on the spot cutting the packstraps and picking up the guns  this tyee saw and his own people falling as they straggled forward and he was aware of a quick doubt and resolved to lie where he was and see more for some unaccountable reason mesahchie was running back to billman but before she could reach him tyee saw peelo run out and throw arms about her he essayed to sling her across his shoulder but she grappled with him tearing and scratching at his face then she tripped him and the pair fell heavily when they regained their feet peelo had shifted his grip so that one arm was passed under her chin the wrist pressing into her throat and strangling her he buried his face in her breast taking the blows of her hands on his thick mat of hair and began slowly to force her off the field then it was retreating with the weapons of his fallen comrades that billman came upon them as mesahchie saw him she twirled the victim around and held him steady billman swung the rifle in his right hand and hardly easing his stride delivered the blow tyee saw peelo drive to the earth as smote by a falling star and the sunlander and neegahs daughter fleeing side by side  a bunch of mandells led by one of the hungry folk made a futile rush which melted away into the earth before the scorching fire  tyee caught his breath and murmured like the young frost in the morning sun  as i say they are great fighters the old hunter whispered weakly far gone in hemorrhage i know i have heard they be searobbers and hunters of seals and they shoot quick and true for it is their way of life and the work of their hands  like the young frost in the morning sun tyee repeated crouching for shelter behind the dying man and peering at intervals about him  it was no longer a fight for no mandell man dared venture forward and as it was they were too close to the sunlanders to go back three tried it scattering and scurrying like rabbits but one came down with a broken leg another was shot through the body and the third twisting and dodging fell on the edge of the village so the tribesmen crouched in the hollow places and burrowed into the dirt in the open while the sunlanders bullets searched the plain  move not tyee pleaded as aabwaak came worming over the ground to him move not good aabwaak else you bring death upon us  death sits upon many aabwaak laughed wherefore as you say there will be much wealth in division my father breathes fast and short behind the big rock yon and beyond twisted like in a knot lieth my brother but their share shall be my share and it is well  as you say good aabwaak and as i have said but before division must come that which we may divide and the sunlanders be not yet dead  a bullet glanced from a rock before them and singing shrilly rose low over their heads on its second flight tyee ducked and shivered but aabwaak grinned and sought vainly to follow it with his eyes  so swiftly they go one may not see them he observed  but many be dead of us tyee went on  and many be left was the reply and they hug close to the earth for they have become wise in the fashion of righting further they are angered moreover when we have killed the sunlanders on the ship there will remain but four on the land these may take long to kill but in the end it will happen  how may we go down to the ship when we cannot go this way or that tyee questioned  it is a bad place where lie billman and his brothers aabwaak explained we may come upon them from every side which is not good so they aim to get their backs against the cliff and wait until their brothers of the ship come to give them aid  never shall they come from the ship their brothers i have said it  tyee was gathering courage again and when the sunlanders verified the prediction by retreating to the cliff he was lighthearted as ever  there be only three of us complained one of the hungry folk as they came together for council  therefore instead of two shall you have four guns each was tyees rejoinder  we did good fighting  ay and if it should happen that two of you be left then will you have six guns each therefore fight well  and if there be none of them left aabwaak whispered slyly  then will we have the guns you and i tyee whispered back  however to propitiate the hungry folk he made one of them leader of the ship expedition this party comprised fully twothirds of the tribesmen and departed for the coast a dozen miles away laden with skins and things to trade the remaining men were disposed in a large halfcircle about the breastwork which billman and his sunlanders had begun to throw up tyee was quick to note the virtues of things and at once set his men to digging shallow trenches  the time will go before they are aware he explained to aabwaak and their minds being busy they will not think overmuch of the dead that are nor gather trouble to themselves and in the dark of night they may creep closer so that when the sunlanders look forth in the morning light they will find us very near  in the midday heat the men ceased from their work and made a meal of dried fish and seal oil which the women brought up there was some clamor for the food of the sunlanders in the igloo of neegah but tyee refused to divide it until the return of the ship party speculations upon the outcome became rife but in the midst of it a dull boom drifted up over the land from the sea the keeneyed ones made out a dense cloud of smoke which quickly disappeared and which they averred was directly over the ship of the sunlanders tyee was of the opinion that it was a big gun aabwaak did not know but thought it might be a signal of some sort anyway he said it was time something happened  five or six hours afterward a solitary man was descried coming across the wide flat from the sea and the women and children poured out upon him in a body it was ounenk naked winded and wounded the blood still trickled down his face from a gash on the forehead his left arm frightfully mangled hung helpless at his side but most significant of all there was a wild gleam in his eyes which betokened the women knew not what  where be peshack an old squaw queried sharply  and olitlie and polak and mahkook the voices took up the cry  but he said nothing brushing his way through the clamorous mass and directing his staggering steps toward tyee the old squaw raised the wail and one by one the women joined her as they swung in behind the men crawled out of their trenches and ran back to gather about tyee and it was noticed that the sunlanders climbed upon their barricade to see  ounenk halted swept the blood from his eyes and looked about he strove to speak but his dry lips were glued together likeeta fetched him water and he grunted and drank again  was it a fight tyee demanded finallya good fight  ho ho ho so suddenly and so fiercely did ounenk laugh that every voice hushed never was there such a fight so i say i ounenk fighter beforetime of beasts and men and ere i forget let me speak fat words and wise by fighting will the sunlanders teach us mandell folk how to fight and if we fight long enough we shall be great fighters even as the sunlanders or else we shall bedead ho ho ho it was a fight  where be thy brothers tyee shook him till he shrieked from the pain of his hurts  ounenk sobered my brothers they are not  and pomelee cried one of the two hungry folk pomelee the son of my mother  pomelee is not ounenk answered in a monotonous voice  and the sunlanders from aabwaak  the sunlanders are not  then the ship of the sunlanders and the wealth and guns and things tyee demanded  neither the ship of the sunlanders nor the wealth and guns and things was the unvarying response all are not nothing is i only am  and thou art a fool  it may be so ounenk answered unruffled  i have seen that which would well make me a fool  tyee held his tongue and all waited till it should please ounenk to tell the story in his own way  we took no guns o tyee he at last began no guns my brothersonly knives and hunting bows and spears and in twos and threes in our kayaks we came to the ship they were glad to see us the sunlanders and we spread our skins and they brought out their articles of trade and everything was well and pomelee waitedwaited till the sun was well overhead and they sat at meat when he gave the cry and we fell upon them never was there such a fight and never such fighters half did we kill in the quickness of surprise but the half that was left became as devils and they multiplied themselves and everywhere they fought like devils three put their backs against the mast of the ship and we ringed them with our dead before they died and some got guns and shot with both eyes wide open and very quick and sure and one got a big gun from which at one time he shot many small bullets and so behold  ounenk pointed to his ear neatly pierced by a buckshot  but i ounenk drove my spear through his back from behind and in such fashion one way and another did we kill them allall save the head man and him we were about many of us and he was alone when he made a great cry and broke through us five or six dragging upon him and ran down inside the ship and then when the wealth of the ship was ours and only the head man down below whom we would kill presently why then there was a sound as of all the guns in the worlda mighty sound and like a bird i rose up in the air and the living mandell folk and the dead sunlanders the little kayaks the big ship the guns the wealtheverything rose up in the air so i say i ounenk who tell the tale am the only one left  a great silence fell upon the assemblage tyee looked at aabwaak with awestruck eyes but forbore to speak even the women were too stunned to wail the dead  ounenk looked about him with pride i only am left he repeated  but at that instant a rifle cracked from billmans barricade and there was a sharp spat and thud on the chest of ounenk he swayed backward and came forward again a look of startled surprise on his face he gasped and his lips writhed in a grim smile there was a shrinking together of the shoulders and a bending of the knees he shook himself as might a drowsing man and straightened up but the shrinking and bending began again and he sank down slowly quite slowly to the ground  it was a clean mile from the pit of the sunlanders and death had spanned it a great cry of rage went up and in it there was much of bloodvengeance much of the unreasoned ferocity of the brute tyee and aabwaak tried to hold the mandell folk back were thrust aside and could only turn and watch the mad charge but no shots came from the sunlanders and ere half the distance was covered many affrighted by the mysterious silence of the pit halted and waited the wilder spirits bore on and when they had cut the remaining distance in half the pit still showed no sign of life at two hundred yards they slowed down and bunched at one hundred they stopped a score of them suspicious and conferred together  then a wreath of smoke crowned the barricade and they scattered like a handful of pebbles thrown at random four went down and four more and they continued swiftly to fall one and two at a time till but one remained and he in full flight with death singing about his ears it was nok a young hunter longlegged and tall and he ran as never before he skimmed across the naked open like a bird and soared and sailed and curved from side to side the rifles in the pit rang out in solid volley they flutflutflutflutted in ragged sequence and still nok rose and dipped and rose again unharmed there was a lull in the firing as though the sunlanders had given over and nok curved less and less in his flight till he darted straight forward at every leap and then as he leaped cleanly and well one lone rifle barked from the pit and he doubled up in midair struck the ground in a ball and like a ball bounced from the impact and came down in a broken heap  who so swift as the swiftwinged lead aabwaak pondered  tyee grunted and turned away the incident was closed and there was more pressing matter at hand one hungry man and forty fighters some of them hurt remained and there were four sunlanders yet to reckon with  we will keep them in their hole by the cliff he said and when famine has gripped them hard we will slay them like children  but of what matter to fight queried oloof one of the younger men the wealth of the sunlanders is not only remains that in the igloo of neegah a paltry quantity  he broke off hastily as the air by his ear split sharply to the passage of a bullet  tyee laughed scornfully let that be thy answer what else may we do with this mad breed of sunlanders which will not die  what a thing is foolishness oloof protested his ears furtively alert for the coming of other bullets it is not right that they should fight so these sunlanders why will they not die easily they are fools not to know that they are dead men and they give us much trouble  we fought before for great wealth we fight now that we may live aabwaak summed up succinctly  that night there was a clash in the trenches and shots exchanged and in the morning the igloo of neegah was found empty of the sunlanders possessions these they themselves had taken for the signs of their trail were visible to the sun oloof climbed to the brow of the cliff to hurl great stones down into the pit but the cliff overhung and he hurled down abuse and insult instead and promised bitter torture to them in the end billman mocked him back in the tongue of the bear folk and tyee lifting his head from a trench to see had his shoulder scratched deeply by a bullet  and in the dreary days that followed and in the wild nights when they pushed the trenches closer there was much discussion as to the wisdom of letting the sunlanders go but of this they were afraid and the women raised a cry always at the thought this much they had seen of the sunlanders they cared to see no more all the time the whistle and blubblub of bullets filled the air and all the time the deathlist grew in the golden sunrise came the faint far crack of a rifle and a stricken woman would throw up her hands on the distant edge of the village in the noonday heat men in the trenches heard the shrill singsong and knew their deaths or in the gray afterglow of evening the dirt kicked up in puffs by the winking fires and through the nights the long wahhoohaa wahhoohaa of mourning women held dolorous sway  as tyee had promised in the end famine gripped the sunlanders and once when an early fall gale blew one of them crawled through the darkness past the trenches and stole many dried fish  but he could not get back with them and the sun found him vainly hiding in the village so he fought the great fight by himself and in a narrow ring of mandell folk shot four with his revolver and ere they could lay hands on him for the torture turned it on himself and died  this threw a gloom upon the people oloof put the question if one man die so hard how hard will die the three who yet are left  then mesahchie stood up on the barricade and called in by name three dogs which had wandered closemeat and lifewhich set back the day of reckoning and put despair in the hearts of the mandell folk and on the head of mesahchie were showered the curses of a generation  the days dragged by the sun hurried south the nights grew long and longer and there was a touch of frost in the air and still the sunlanders held the pit hearts were breaking under the unending strain and tyee thought hard and deep then he sent forth word that all the skins and hides of all the tribe be collected these he had made into huge cylindrical bales and behind each bale he placed a man  when the word was given the brief day was almost spent and it was slow work and tedious rolling the big bales forward foot by foot the bullets of the sunlanders blubblubbed and thudded against them but could not go through and the men howled their delight but the dark was at hand and tyee secure of success called the bales back to the trenches  in the morning in the face of an unearthly silence from the pit the real advance began at first with large intervals between the bales slowly converged as the circle drew in at a hundred yards they were quite close together so that tyees order to halt was passed along in whispers the pit showed no sign of life they watched long and sharply but nothing stirred the advance was taken up and the manoeuvre repeated at fifty yards still no sign nor sound tyee shook his head and even aabwaak was dubious but the order was given to go on and go on they did till bale touched bale and a solid rampart of skin and hide bowed out from the cliff about the pit and back to the cliff again  tyee looked back and saw the women and children clustering blackly in the deserted trenches he looked ahead at the silent pit the men were wriggling nervously and he ordered every second bale forward this double line advanced till bale touched bale as before then aabwaak of his own will pushed one bale forward alone when it touched the barricade he waited a long while after that he tossed unresponsive rocks over into the pit and finally with great care stood up and peered in a carpet of empty cartridges a few whitepicked dog bones and a soggy place where water dripped from a crevice met his eyes that was all the sunlanders were gone  there were murmurings of witchcraft vague complaints dark looks which foreshadowed to tyee dread things which yet might come to pass and he breathed easier when aabwaak took up the trail along the base of the cliff  the cave tyee cried they foresaw my wisdom of the skinbales and fled away into the cave  the cliff was honeycombed with a labyrinth of subterranean passages which found vent in an opening midway between the pit and where the trench tapped the wall thither and with many exclamations the tribesmen followed aabwaak and arrived they saw plainly where the sunlanders had climbed to the mouth twenty and odd feet above  now the thing is done tyee said rubbing his hands let word go forth that rejoicing be made for they are in the trap now these sunlanders in the trap the young men shall climb up and the mouth of the cave be filled with stones so that billman and his brothers and mesahchie shall by famine be pinched to shadows and die cursing in the silence and dark  cries of delight and relief greeted this and howgah the last of the hungry folk swarmed up the steep slant and drew himself crouching upon the lip of the opening but as he crouched a muffled report rushed forth and as he clung desperately to the slippery edge a second his grip loosed with reluctant weakness and he pitched down at the feet of tyee quivered for a moment like some monstrous jelly and was still  how should i know they were great fighters and unafraid tyee demanded spurred to defence by recollection of the dark looks and vague complaints  we were many and happy one of the men stated baldly another fingered his spear with a prurient hand  but oloof cried them cease give ear my brothers there be another way as a boy i chanced upon it playing along the steep it is hidden by the rocks and there is no reason that a man should go there wherefore it is secret and no man knows it is very small and you crawl on your belly a long way and then you are in the cave tonight we will so crawl without noise on our bellies and come upon the sunlanders from behind and tomorrow we will be at peace and never again will we quarrel with the sunlanders in the years to come  never again chorussed the weary men never again and tyee joined with them  that night with the memory of their dead in their hearts and in their hands stones and spears and knives the horde of women and children collected about the known mouth of the cave down the twenty and odd precarious feet to the ground no sunlander could hope to pass and live in the village remained only the wounded men while every able manand there were thirty of themfollowed oloof to the secret opening a hundred feet of broken ledges and insecurely heaped rocks were between it and the earth and because of the rocks which might be displaced by the touch of hand or foot but one man climbed at a time oloof went up first called softly for the next to come on and disappeared inside a man followed a second and a third and so on till only tyee remained he received the call of the last man but a quick doubt assailed him and he stayed to ponder half an hour later he swung up to the opening and peered in he could feel the narrowness of the passage and the darkness before him took on solidity the fear of the walledin earth chilled him and he could not venture all the men who had died from neegah the first of the mandells to howgah the last of the hungry folk came and sat with him but he chose the terror of their company rather than face the horror which he felt to lurk in the thick blackness he had been sitting long when something soft and cold fluttered lightly on his cheek and he knew the first winters snow was falling the dim dawn came and after that the bright day when he heard a low guttural sobbing which came and went at intervals along the passage and which drew closer each time and more distinct he slipped over the edge dropped his feet to the first ledge and waited  that which sobbed made slow progress but at last after many halts it reached him and he was sure no sunlander made the noise so he reached a hand inside and where there should have been a head felt the shoulders of a man uplifted on bent arms the head he found later not erect but hanging straight down so that the crown rested on the floor of the passage  is it you tyee the head said for it is i aabwaak who am helpless and broken as a roughflung spear my head is in the dirt and i may not climb down unaided  tyee clambered in dragged him up with his back against the wall but the head hung down on the chest and sobbed and wailed  aiooo aiooo it went oloof forgot for mesahchie likewise knew the secret and showed the sunlanders else they would not have waited at the end of the narrow way wherefore i am a broken man and helplessaiooo aiooo  and did they die the cursed sunlanders at the end of the narrow way tyee demanded  how should i know they waited aabwaak gurgled for my brothers had gone before many of them and there was no sound of struggle how should i know why there should be no sound of struggle and ere i knew two hands were about my neck so that i could not cry out and warn my brothers yet to come and then there were two hands more on my head and two more on my feet in this fashion the three sunlanders had me and while the hands held my head in the one place the hands on my feet swung my body around and as we wring the neck of a duck in the marsh so my week was wrung  but it was not given that i should die he went on a remnant of pride yet glimmering i only am left oloof and the rest lie on their backs in a row and their faces turn this way and that and the faces of some be underneath where the backs of their heads should be it is not good to look upon for when life returned to me i saw them all by the light of a torch which the sunlanders left and i had been laid with them in the row  so so tyee mused too stunned for speech  he started suddenly and shivered for the voice of billman shot out at him from the passage  it is well it said i look for the man who crawls with the broken neck and lo do i find tyee throw down thy gun tyee so that i may hear it strike among the rocks  tyee obeyed passively and billman crawled forward into the light tyee looked at him curiously he was gaunt and worn and dirty and his eyes burned like twin coals in their cavernous sockets  i am hungry tyee he said very hungry  and i am dirt at thy feet tyee responded  thy word is my law further i commanded my people not to withstand thee i counselled  but billman had turned and was calling back into the passage hey charley jim fetch the woman along and come on  we go now to eat he said when his comrades and mesahchie had joined him  tyee rubbed his hands deprecatingly we have little but it is thine  after that we go south on the snow billman continued  may you go without hardship and the trail be easy  it is a long way we will need dogs and foodmuch  thine the pick of our dogs and the food they may carry  billman slipped over the edge of the opening and prepared to descend but we come again tyee we come again and our days shall be long in the land  and so they departed into the trackless south billman his brothers and mesahchie and when the next year came the search number two rode at anchor in mandell bay the few mandell men who survived because their wounds had prevented their crawling into the cave went to work at the best of the sunlanders and dug in the ground they hunt and fish no more but receive a daily wage with which they buy flour sugar calico and such things which the search number two brings on her yearly trip from the sunlands  and this mine is worked in secret as many northland mines have been worked and no white man outside the company which is billman jim and charley knows the whereabouts of mandell on the rim of the polar sea aabwaak still carries his head on one shoulder is become an oracle and preaches peace to the younger generation for which he receives a pension from the company tyee is foreman of the mine but he has achieved a new theory concerning the sunlanders  they that live under the path of the sun are not soft he says smoking his pipe and watching the dayshift take itself off and the nightshift go on for the sun enters into their blood and burns them with a great fire till they are filled with lusts and passions they burn always so that they may not know when they are beaten further there is an unrest in them which is a devil and they are flung out over the earth to toil and suffer and fight without end i know i am tyee     the sickness of lone chief   this is a tale that was told to me by two old men we sat in the smoke of a mosquitosmudge in the cool of the day which was midnight and ever and anon throughout the telling we smote lustily and with purpose at such of the winged pests as braved the smoke for a snack at our hides to the right beneath us twenty feet down the crumbling bank the yukon gurgled lazily to the left on the roseleaf rim of the lowlying hills smouldered the sleepy sun which saw no sleep that night nor was destined to see sleep for many nights to come  the old men who sat with me and valorously slew mosquitoes were lone chief and mutsak erstwhile comrades in arms and now withered repositories of tradition and ancient happening they were the last of their generation and without honor among the younger set which had grown up on the farthest fringe of a mining civilization who cared for tradition in these days when spirits could be evoked from black bottles and black bottles could be evoked from the complaisant white men for a few hours sweat or a mangy fur of what potency the fearful rites and masked mysteries of shamanism when daily that living wonder the steamboat coughed and spluttered up and down the yukon in defiance of all law a veritable firebreathing monster and of what value was hereditary prestige when he who now chopped the most wood or best conned a sternwheeler through the island mazes attained the chiefest consideration of his fellows  of a truth having lived too long they had fallen on evil days these two old men lone chief and mutsak and in the new order they were without honor or place so they waited drearily for death and the while their hearts warmed to the strange white man who shared with them the torments of the mosquitosmudge and lent ready ear to their tales of old time before the steamboat came  so a girl was chosen for me lone chief was saying his voice shrill and piping ever and again dropped plummetlike into a hoarse and rattling bass and just as one became accustomed to it soaring upward into the thin treblealternate cricket chirpings and bullfrog croakings as it were  so a girl was chosen for me he was saying for my father who was kasktaka the otter was angered because i looked not with a needful eye upon women he was an old man and chief of his tribe i was the last of his sons to be alive and through me only could he look to see his blood go down among those to come after and as yet unborn but know o white man that i was very sick and when neither the hunting nor the fishing delighted me and by meat my belly was not made warm how should i look with favor upon women or prepare for the feast of marriage or look forward to the prattle and troubles of little children  ay mutsak interrupted for had not lone chief fought in the arms of a great bear till his head was cracked and blood ran from out his ears  lone chief nodded vigorously mutsak speaks true in the time that followed my head was well and it was not well for though the flesh healed and the sore went away yet was i sick inside when i walked my legs shook under me and when i looked at the light my eyes became filled with tears and when i opened my eyes the world outside went around and around and when i closed my eyes my head inside went around and around and all the things i had ever seen went around and around inside my head and above my eyes there was a great pain as though something heavy rested always upon me or like a band that is drawn tight and gives much hurt and speech was slow to me and i waited long for each right word to come to my tongue and when i waited not long all manner of words crowded in and my tongue spoke foolishness i was very sick and when my father the otter brought the girl kasaan before me  who was a young girl and strong my sisters child mutsak broke in stronghipped for children was kasaan and straightlegged and quick of foot she made better moccasins than any of all the young girls and the barkrope she braided was the stoutest and she had a smile in her eyes and a laugh on her lips and her temper was not hasty nor was she unmindful that men give the law and women ever obey  as i say i was very sick lone chief went on and when my father the otter brought the girl kasaan before me i said rather should they make me ready for burial than for marriage whereat the face of my father went black with anger and he said that i should be served according to my wish and that i who was yet alive should be made ready for death as one already dead  which be not the way of our people o white man spoke up mutsak for know that these things that were done to lone chief it was our custom to do only to dead men but the otter was very angry  ay said lone chief my father the otter was a man short of speech and swift of deed and he commanded the people to gather before the lodge wherein i lay and when they were gathered he commanded them to mourn for his son who was dead  and before the lodge they sang the deathsongooooooahaahaaichklukukichklukuk wailed mutsak in so excellent an imitation that all the tendrils of my spine crawled and curved in sympathy  and inside the lodge continued lone chief my mother blackened her face with soot and flung ashes upon her head and mourned for me as one already dead for so had my father commanded so okiakuta my mother mourned with much noise and beat her breasts and tore her hair and likewise hooniak my sister and seenatah my mothers sister and the noise they made caused a great ache in my head and i felt that i would surely and immediately die  and the elders of the tribe gathered about me where i lay and discussed the journey my soul must take one spoke of the thick and endless forests where lost souls wandered crying and where i too might chance to wander and never see the end and another spoke of the big rivers rapid with bad water where evil spirits shrieked and lifted up their formless arms to drag one down by the hair for these rivers all said together a canoe must be provided me and yet another spoke of the storms such as no live man ever saw when the stars rained down out of the sky and the earth gaped wide in many cracks and all the rivers in the heart of the earth rushed out and in whereupon they that sat by me flung up their arms and wailed loudly and those outside heard and wailed more loudly and as to them i was as dead so was i to my own mind dead i did not know when or how yet did i know that i had surely died  and okiakuta my mother laid beside me my squirrelskin parka also she laid beside me my parka of caribou hide and my rain coat of seal gut and my wetweather muclucs that my soul should be warm and dry on its long journey further there was mention made of a steep hill thick with briers and devilsclub and she fetched heavy moccasins to make the way easy for my feet  and when the elders spoke of the great beasts i should have to slay the young men laid beside me my strongest bow and straightest arrows my throwingstick my spear and knife and when the elders spoke of the darkness and silence of the great spaces my soul must wander through my mother wailed yet more loudly and flung yet more ashes upon her head  and the girl kasaan crept in very timid and quiet and dropped a little bag upon the things for my journey and in the little bag i knew were the flint and steel and the welldried tinder for the fires my soul must build and the blankets were chosen which were to be wrapped around me also were the slaves selected that were to be killed that my soul might have company there were seven of these slaves for my father was rich and powerful and it was fit that i his son should have proper burial these slaves we had got in war from the mukumuks who live down the yukon on the morrow skolka the shaman would kill them one by one so that their souls should go questing with mine through the unknown among other things they would carry my canoe till we came to the big river rapid with bad water and there being no room and their work being done they would come no farther but remain and howl forever in the dark and endless forest  and as i looked on my fine warm clothes and my blankets and weapons of war and as i thought of the seven slaves to be slain i felt proud of my burial and knew that i must be the envy of many men and all the while my father the otter sat silent and black and all that day and night the people sang my deathsong and beat the drums till it seemed that i had surely died a thousand times  but in the morning my father arose and made talk he had been a fighting man all his days he said as the people knew also the people knew that it were a greater honor to die fighting in battle than on the soft skins by the fire and since i was to die anyway it were well that i should go against the mukumuks and be slain thus would i attain honor and chieftainship in the final abode of the dead and thus would honor remain to my father who was the otter wherefore he gave command that a war party be made ready to go down the river and that when we came upon the mukumuks i was to go forth alone from my party giving semblance of battle and so be slain  nay but hear o white man cried mutsak unable longer to contain himself skolka the shaman whispered long that night in the ear of the otter and it was his doing that lone chief should be sent forth to die for the otter being old and lone chief the last of his sons skolka had it in mind to become chief himself over the people and when the people had made great noise for a day and a night and lone chief was yet alive skolka was become afraid that he would not die so it was the counsel of skolka with fine words of honor and deeds that spoke through the mouth of the otter  ay replied lone chief well did i know it was the doing of skolka but i was unmindful being very sick i had no heart for anger nor belly for stout words and i cared little one way or the other only i cared to die and have done with it all so o white man the war party was made ready no tried fighters were there nor elders crafty and wisenaught but five score of young men who had seen little fighting and all the village gathered together above the bank of the river to see us depart and we departed amid great rejoicing and the singing of my praises even thou o white man wouldst rejoice at sight of a young man going forth to battle even though doomed to die  so we went forth the five score young men and mutsak came also for he was likewise young and untried and by command of my father the otter my canoe was lashed on either side to the canoe of mutsak and the canoe of kannakut thus was my strength saved me from the work of the paddles so that for all of my sickness i might make a brave show at the end and thus we went down the river  nor will i weary thee with the tale of the journey which was not long and not far above the village of the mukumuks we came upon two of their fighting men in canoes that fled at the sight of us and then according to the command of my father my canoe was cast loose and i was left to drift down all alone also according to his command were the young men to see me die so that they might return and tell the manner of my death upon this my father the otter and skolka the shaman had been very clear with stern promises of punishment in case they were not obeyed  i dipped my paddle and shouted words of scorn after the fleeing warriors and the vile things i shouted made them turn their heads in anger when they beheld that the young men held back and that i came on alone whereupon when they had made a safe distance the two warriors drew their canoes somewhat apart and waited side by side for me to come between and i came between spear in hand and singing the warsong of my people each flung a spear but i bent my body and the spears whistled over me and i was unhurt then and we were all together we three i cast my spear at the one to the right and it drove into his throat and he pitched backward into the water  great was my surprise thereat for i had killed a man i turned to the one on the left and drove strong with my paddle to meet death face to face but the mans second spear which was his last but bit into the flesh of my shoulder then was i upon him making no cast but pressing the point into his breast and working it through him with both my hands and while i worked pressing with all my strength he smote me upon my head once and twice with the broad of his paddle  even as the point of the spear sprang out beyond his back he smote me upon the head there was a flash as of bright light and inside my head i felt something give with a snapjust like that with a snap and the weight that pressed above my eyes so long was lifted and the band that bound my brows so tight was broken and a great gladness came upon me and my heart sang with joy  this be death i thought wherefore i thought that death was very good and then i saw the two empty canoes and i knew that i was not dead but well again the blows of the man upon my head had made me well i knew that i had killed and the taste of the blood made me fierce and i drove my paddle into the breast of the yukon and urged my canoe toward the village of the mukumuks the young men behind me gave a great cry i looked over my shoulder and saw the water foaming white from their paddles  ay it foamed white from our paddles said mutsak for we remembered the command of the otter and of skolka that we behold with our own eyes the manner of lone chiefs death a young man of the mukumuks on his way to a salmon trap beheld the coming of lone chief and of the five score men behind him and the young man fled in his canoe straight for the village that alarm might be given and preparation made but lone chief hurried after him and we hurried after lone chief to behold the manner of his death only in the face of the village as the young man leaped to the shore lone chief rose up in his canoe and made a mighty cast and the spear entered the body of the young man above the hips and the young man fell upon his face  whereupon lone chief leaped up the bank warclub in hand and a great warcry on his lips and dashed into the village the first man he met was itwilie chief over the mukumuks and him lone chief smote upon the head with his warclub so that he fell dead upon the ground and for fear we might not behold the manner of his death we too the five score young men leaped to the shore and followed lone chief into the village only the mukumuks did not understand and thought we had come to fight so their bowthongs sang and their arrows whistled among us whereat we forgot our errand and fell upon them with our spears and clubs and they being unprepared there was great slaughter  with my own hands i slew their shaman proclaimed lone chief his withered face awork with memory of that oldtime day with my own hands i slew him who was a greater shaman than skolka our own shaman and each time i faced a man i thought now cometh death and each time i slew the man and death came not it seemed the breath of life was strong in my nostrils and i could not die  and we followed lone chief the length of the village and back again continued mutsak like a pack of wolves we followed him back and forth and here and there till there were no more mukumuks left to fight then we gathered together five score menslaves and double as many women and countless children and we set fire and burned all the houses and lodges and departed and that was the last of the mukumuks  and that was the last of the mukumuks lone chief repeated exultantly and when we came to our own village the people were amazed at our burden of wealth and slaves and in that i was still alive they were more amazed and my father the otter came trembling with gladness at the things i had done for he was an old man and i the last of his sons and all the tried fighting men came and the crafty and wise till all the people were gathered together and then i arose and with a voice like thunder commanded skolka the shaman to stand forth  ay o white man exclaimed mutsak with a voice like thunder that made the people shake at the knees and become afraid  and when skolka had stood forth lone chief went on i said that i was not minded to die also i said it were not well that disappointment come to the evil spirits that wait beyond the grave wherefore i deemed it fit that the soul of skolka fare forth into the unknown where doubtless it would howl forever in the dark and endless forest and then i slew him as he stood there in the face of all the people even i lone chief with my own hands slew skolka the shaman in the face of all the people and when a murmuring arose i cried aloud  with a voice like thunder prompted mutsak  ay with a voice like thunder i cried aloud behold o ye people i am lone chief slayer of skolka the false shaman alone among men have i passed down through the gateway of death and returned again mine eyes have looked upon the unseen things mine ears have heard the unspoken words greater am i than skolka the shaman greater than all shamans am i likewise am i a greater chief than my father the otter all his days did he fight with the mukumuks and lo in one day have i destroyed them all as with the breathing of a breath have i destroyed them wherefore my father the otter being old and skolka the shaman being dead i shall be both chief and shaman henceforth shall i be both chief and shaman to you o my people and if any man dispute my word let that man stand forth  i waited but no man stood forth then i cried hoh i have tasted blood now bring meat for i am hungry break open the caches tear down the fishracks and let the feast be big let there be merriment and songs not of burial but marriage and last of all let the girl kasaan be brought the girl kasaan who is to be the mother of the children of lone chief  and at my words and because that he was very old my father the otter wept like a woman and put his arms about my knees and from that day i was both chief and shaman and great honor was mine and all men yielded me obedience  until the steamboat came mutsak prompted  ay said lone chief until the steamboat came     keesh the son of keesh   thus will i give six blankets warm and double six files large and hard six hudson bay knives keenedged and long two canoes the work of mogum the maker of things ten dogs heavyshouldered and strong in the harness and three gunsthe trigger of one be broken but it is a good gun and can doubtless be mended  keesh paused and swept his eyes over the circle of intent faces it was the time of the great fishing and he was bidding to gnob for susu his daughter the place was the st george mission by the yukon and the tribes had gathered for many a hundred miles from north south east and west they had come even from tozikakat and far tananaw  and further o gnob thou art chief of the tananaw and i keesh the son of keesh am chief of the thlunget wherefore when my seed springs from the loins of thy daughter there shall be a friendship between the tribes a great friendship and tananaw and thlunget shall be brothers of the blood in the time to come what i have said i will do that will i do and how is it with you o gnob in this matter  gnob nodded his head gravely his gnarled and agetwisted face inscrutably masking the soul that dwelt behind his narrow eyes burned like twin coals through their narrow slits as he piped in a highcracked voice but that is not all  what more keesh demanded have i not offered full measure was there ever yet a tananaw maiden who fetched so great a price then name her  an open snicker passed round the circle and keesh knew that he stood in shame before these people  nay nay good keesh thou dost not understand gnob made a soft stroking gesture the price is fair it is a good price nor do i question the broken trigger but that is not all what of the man  ay what of the man the circle snarled  it is said gnobs shrill voice piped it is said that keesh does not walk in the way of his fathers it is said that he has wandered into the dark after strange gods and that he is become afraid  the face of keesh went dark it is a lie he thundered keesh is afraid of no man  it is said old gnob piped on that he has harkened to the speech of the white man up at the big house and that he bends head to the white mans god and moreover that blood is displeasing to the white mans god  keesh dropped his eyes and his hands clenched passionately the savage circle laughed derisively and in the ear of gnob whispered madwan the shaman highpriest of the tribe and maker of medicine  the shaman poked among the shadows on the rim of the firelight and roused up a slender young boy whom he brought face to face with keesh and in the hand of keesh he thrust a knife  gnob leaned forward keesh o keesh darest thou to kill a man behold this be kitznoo a slave strike o keesh strike with the strength of thy arm  the boy trembled and waited the stroke keesh looked at him and thoughts of mr browns higher morality floated through his mind and strong upon him was a vision of the leaping flames of mr browns particular brand of hellfire the knife fell to the ground and the boy sighed and went out beyond the firelight with shaking knees at the feet of gnob sprawled a wolfdog which bared its gleaming teeth and prepared to spring after the boy but the shaman ground his foot into the brutes body and so doing gave gnob an idea  and then o keesh what wouldst thou do should a man do this thing to youas he spoke gnob held a ribbon of salmon to white fang and when the animal attempted to take it smote him sharply on the nose with a stick and afterward o keesh wouldst thou do thuswhite fang was cringing back on his belly and fawning to the hand of gnob  listenleaning on the arm of madwan gnob had risen to his feet i am very old and because i am very old i will tell thee things thy father keesh was a mighty man and he did love the song of the bowstring in battle and these eyes have beheld him cast a spear till the head stood out beyond a mans body but thou art unlike since thou left the raven to worship the wolf thou art become afraid of blood and thou makest thy people afraid this is not good for behold when i was a boy even as kitznoo there there was no white man in all the land but they came one by one these white men till now they are many and they are a restless breed never content to rest by the fire with a full belly and let the morrow bring its own meat a curse was laid upon them it would seem and they must work it out in toil and hardship  keesh was startled a recollection of a hazy story told by mr brown of one adam of old time came to him and it seemed that mr brown had spoken true  so they lay hands upon all they behold these white men and they go everywhere and behold all things and ever do more follow in their steps so that if nothing be done they will come to possess all the land and there will be no room for the tribes of the raven wherefore it is meet that we fight with them till none are left then will we hold the passes and the land and perhaps our children and our childrens children shall flourish and grow fat there is a great struggle to come when wolf and raven shall grapple but keesh will not fight nor will he let his people fight so it is not well that he should take to him my daughter thus have i spoken i gnob chief of the tananaw  but the white men are good and great keesh made answer the white men have taught us many things the white men have given us blankets and knives and guns such as we have never made and never could make i remember in what manner we lived before they came i was unborn then but i have it from my father when we went on the hunt we must creep so close to the moose that a spearcast would cover the distance today we use the white mans rifle and farther away than can a childs cry be heard we ate fish and meat and berriesthere was nothing else to eatand we ate without salt how many be there among you who care to go back to the fish and meat without salt  it would have sunk home had not madwan leaped to his feet ere silence could come and first a question to thee keesh the white man up at the big house tells you that it is wrong to kill yet do we not know that the white men kill have we forgotten the great fight on the koyokuk or the great fight at nuklukyeto where three white men killed twenty of the tozikakats do you think we no longer remember the three men of the tananaw that the white man macklewrath killed tell me o keesh why does the shaman brown teach you that it is wrong to fight when all his brothers fight  nay nay there is no need to answer gnob piped while keesh struggled with the paradox it is very simple the good man brown would hold the raven tight whilst his brothers pluck the feathers he raised his voice but so long as there is one tananaw to strike a blow or one maiden to bear a manchild the raven shall not be plucked  gnob turned to a husky young man across the fire and what sayest thou makamuk who art brother to susu  makamuk came to his feet a long facescar lifted his upper lip into a perpetual grin which belied the glowing ferocity of his eyes this day he began with cunning irrelevance i came by the trader macklewraths cabin and in the door i saw a child laughing at the sun and the child looked at me with the trader macklewraths eyes and it was frightened the mother ran to it and quieted it the mother was ziska the thlunget woman  a snarl of rage rose up and drowned his voice which he stilled by turning dramatically upon keesh with outstretched arm and accusing finger  so you give your women away you thlunget and come to the tananaw for more but we have need of our women keesh for we must breed men many men against the day when the raven grapples with the wolf  through the storm of applause gnobs voice shrilled clear and thou nossabok who art her favorite brother  the young fellow was slender and graceful with the strong aquiline nose and high brows of his type but from some nervous affliction the lid of one eye drooped at odd times in a suggestive wink even as he arose it so drooped and rested a moment against his cheek but it was not greeted with the accustomed laughter every face was grave i too passed by the trader macklewraths cabin he rippled in soft girlish tones wherein there was much of youth and much of his sister and i saw indians with the sweat running into their eyes and their knees shaking with wearinessi say i saw indians groaning under the logs for the store which the trader macklewrath is to build and with my eyes i saw them chopping wood to keep the shaman browns big house warm through the frost of the long nights this be squaw work never shall the tananaw do the like we shall be blood brothers to men not squaws and the thlunget be squaws  a deep silence fell and all eyes centred on keesh he looked about him carefully deliberately full into the face of each grown man so he said passionlessly and so he repeated then turned on his heel without further word and passed out into the darkness  wading among sprawling babies and bristling wolfdogs he threaded the great camp and on its outskirts came upon a woman at work by the light of a fire with strings of bark stripped from the long roots of creeping vines she was braiding rope for the fishing for some time without speech he watched her deft hands bringing law and order out of the unruly mass of curling fibres she was good to look upon swaying there to her task stronglimbed deepchested and with hips made for motherhood and the bronze of her face was golden in the flickering light her hair blueblack her eyes jet  o susu he spoke finally thou hast looked upon me kindly in the days that have gone and in the days yet young  i looked kindly upon thee for that thou wert chief of the thlunget she answered quickly and because thou wert big and strong  ay  but that was in the old days of the fishing she hastened to add before the shaman brown came and taught thee ill things and led thy feet on strange trails  but i would tell thee the  she held up one hand in a gesture which reminded him of her father nay i know already the speech that stirs in thy throat o keesh and i make answer now it so happeneth that the fish of the water and the beasts of the forest bring forth after their kind and this is good likewise it happeneth to women it is for them to bring forth their kind and even the maiden while she is yet a maiden feels the pang of the birth and the pain of the breast and the small hands at the neck and when such feeling is strong then does each maiden look about her with secret eyes for the manfor the man who shall be fit to father her kind so have i felt so did i feel when i looked upon thee and found thee big and strong a hunter and fighter of beasts and men well able to win meat when i should eat for two well able to keep danger afar off when my helplessness drew nigh but that was before the day the shaman brown came into the land and taught thee  but it is not right susu i have it on good word  it is not right to kill i know what thou wouldst say then breed thou after thy kind the kind that does not kill but come not on such quest among the tananaw for it is said in the time to come that the raven shall grapple with the wolf i do not know for this be the affair of men but i do know that it is for me to bring forth men against that time  susu keesh broke in thou must hear me  a man would beat me with a stick and make me hear she sneered but thou  here she thrust a bunch of bark into his hand i cannot give thee myself but this yes it looks fittest in thy hands it is squaw work so braid away  he flung it from him the angry blood pounding a muddy path under his bronze  one thing more she went on there be an old custom which thy father and mine were not strangers to when a man falls in battle his scalp is carried away in token very good but thou who have forsworn the raven must do more thou must bring me not scalps but heads two heads and then will i give thee not bark but a bravebeaded belt and sheath and long russian knife then will i look kindly upon thee once again and all will be well  so the man pondered so then he turned and passed out through the light  nay o keesh she called after him not two heads but three at least                                       but keesh remained true to his conversion lived uprightly and made his tribespeople obey the gospel as propounded by the rev jackson brown through all the time of the fishing he gave no heed to the tananaw nor took notice of the sly things which were said nor of the laughter of the women of the many tribes after the fishing gnob and his people with great store of salmon sundried and smokecured departed for the hunting on the head reaches of the tananaw keesh watched them go but did not fail in his attendance at mission service where he prayed regularly and led the singing with his deep bass voice  the rev jackson brown delighted in that deep bass voice and because of his sterling qualities deemed him the most promising convert macklewrath doubted this he did not believe in the efficacy of the conversion of the heathen and he was not slow in speaking his mind but mr brown was a large man in his way and he argued it out with such convincingness all of one long fall night that the trader driven from position after position finally announced in desperation knock out my brains with apples brown if i dont become a convert myself if keesh holds fast true blue for two years mr brown never lost an opportunity so he clinched the matter on the spot with a virile handgrip and thenceforth the conduct of keesh was to determine the ultimate abidingplace of macklewraths soul  but there came news one day after the winters rime had settled down over the land sufficiently for travel a tananaw man arrived at the st george mission in quest of ammunition and bringing information that susu had set eyes on neekoo a nervy young hunter who had bid brilliantly for her by old gnobs fire it was at about this time that the rev jackson brown came upon keesh by the woodtrail which leads down to the river keesh had his best dogs in the harness and shoved under the sledlashings was his largest and finest pair of snowshoes  where goest thou o keesh hunting mr brown asked falling into the indian manner  keesh looked him steadily in the eyes for a full minute then started up his dogs then again turning his deliberate gaze upon the missionary he answered no i go to hell                                       in an open space striving to burrow into the snow as though for shelter from the appalling desolateness huddled three dreary lodges ringed all about a dozen paces away was the sombre forest overhead there was no keen blue sky of naked space but a vague misty curtain pregnant with snow which had drawn between there was no wind no sound nothing but the snow and silence nor was there even the general stir of life about the camp for the hunting party had run upon the flank of the caribou herd and the kill had been large thus after the period of fasting had come the plenitude of feasting and thus in broad daylight they slept heavily under their roofs of moosehide  by a fire before one of the lodges five pairs of snowshoes stood on end in their element and by the fire sat susu the hood of her squirrelskin parka was about her hair and well drawn up around her throat but her hands were unmittened and nimbly at work with needle and sinew completing the last fantastic design on a belt of leather faced with bright scarlet cloth a dog somewhere at the rear of one of the lodges raised a short sharp bark then ceased as abruptly as it had begun once her father in the lodge at her back gurgled and grunted in his sleep bad dreams she smiled to herself he grows old and that last joint was too much  she placed the last bead knotted the sinew and replenished the fire then after gazing long into the flames she lifted her head to the harsh crunchcrunch of a moccasined foot against the flinty snow granules keesh was at her side bending slightly forward to a load which he bore upon his back this was wrapped loosely in a softtanned moosehide and he dropped it carelessly into the snow and sat down they looked at each other long and without speech  it is a far fetch o keesh she said at last a far fetch from st george mission by the yukon  ay he made answer absently his eyes fixed keenly upon the belt and taking note of its girth but where is the knife he demanded  here she drew it from inside her parka and flashed its naked length in the firelight it is a good knife  give it me he commanded  nay o keesh she laughed it may be that thou wast not born to wear it  give it me he reiterated without change of tone i was so born  but her eyes glancing coquettishly past him to the moosehide saw the snow about it slowly reddening it is blood keesh she asked  ay it is blood but give me the belt and the long russian knife  she felt suddenly afraid but thrilled when he took the belt roughly from her thrilled to the roughness she looked at him softly and was aware of a pain at the breast and of small hands clutching her throat  it was made for a smaller man he remarked grimly drawing in his abdomen and clasping the buckle at the first hole  susu smiled and her eyes were yet softer again she felt the soft hands at her throat he was good to look upon and the belt was indeed small made for a smaller man but what did it matter she could make many belts  but the blood she asked urged on by a hope newborn and growing the blood keesh is it  are they  heads  ay  they must be very fresh else would the blood be frozen  ay it is not cold and they be fresh quite fresh  oh keesh her face was warm and bright and for me  ay for thee  he took hold of a corner of the hide flirted it open and rolled the heads out before her  three he whispered savagely nay four at least  but she sat transfixed there they laythe softfeatured neekoo the gnarled old face of gnob makamuk grinning at her with his lifted upper lip and lastly nossabok his eyelid up to its old trick drooped on his girlish cheek in a suggestive wink there they lay the firelight flashing upon and playing over them and from each of them a widening circle dyed the snow to scarlet  thawed by the fire the white crust gave way beneath the head of gnob which rolled over like a thing alive spun around and came to rest at her feet but she did not move keesh too sat motionless his eyes unblinking centred steadfastly upon her  once in the forest an overburdened pine dropped its load of snow and the echoes reverberated hollowly down the gorge but neither stirred the short day had been waning fast and darkness was wrapping round the camp when white fang trotted up toward the fire he paused to reconnoitre but not being driven back came closer his nose shot swiftly to the side nostrils atremble and bristles rising along the spine and straight and true he followed the sudden scent to his masters head he sniffed it gingerly at first and licked the forehead with his red lolling tongue then he sat abruptly down pointed his nose up at the first faint star and raised the long wolfhowl  this brought susu to herself she glanced across at keesh who had unsheathed the russian knife and was watching her intently his face was firm and set and in it she read the law slipping back the hood of her parka she bared her neck and rose to her feet there she paused and took a long look about her at the rimming forest at the faint stars in the sky at the camp at the snowshoes in the snowa last long comprehensive look at life a light breeze stirred her hair from the side and for the space of one deep breath she turned her head and followed it around until she met it fullfaced  then she thought of her children ever to be unborn and she walked over to keesh and said i am ready     the death of ligoun  blood for blood rank for rank  thlinket code   hear now the death of ligoun  the speaker ceased or rather suspended utterance and gazed upon me with an eye of understanding i held the bottle between our eyes and the fire indicated with my thumb the depth of the draught and shoved it over to him for was he not palitlum the drinker many tales had he told me and long had i waited for this scriptless scribe to speak of the things concerning ligoun for he of all men living knew these things best  he tilted back his head with a grunt that slid swiftly into a gurgle and the shadow of a mans torso monstrous beneath a huge inverted bottle wavered and danced on the frown of the cliff at our backs palitlum released his lips from the glass with a caressing suck and glanced regretfully up into the ghostly vault of the sky where played the wan white light of the summer borealis  it be strange he said cold like water and hot like fire to the drinker it giveth strength and from the drinker it taketh away strength it maketh old men young and young men old to the man who is weary it leadeth him to get up and go onward and to the man unweary it burdeneth him into sleep my brother was possessed of the heart of a rabbit yet did he drink of it and forthwith slay four of his enemies my father was like a great wolf showing his teeth to all men yet did he drink of it and was shot through the back running swiftly away it be most strange  it is three star and a better than what they poison their bellies with down there i answered sweeping my hand as it were over the yawning chasm of blackness and down to where the beach fires glinted far belowtiny jets of flame which gave proportion and reality to the night  palitlum sighed and shook his head wherefore i am here with thee  and here he embraced the bottle and me in a look which told more eloquently than speech of his shameless thirst  nay i said snuggling the bottle in between my knees speak now of ligoun of the three star we will hold speech hereafter  there be plenty and i am not wearied he pleaded brazenly but the feel of it on my lips and i will speak great words of ligoun and his last days  from the drinker it taketh away strength i mocked and to the man unweary it burdeneth him into sleep  thou art wise he rejoined without anger and pridelessly like all of thy brothers thou art wise waking or sleeping the three star be with thee yet never have i known thee to drink overlong or overmuch and the while you gather to you the gold that hides in our mountains and the fish that swim in our seas and palitlum and the brothers of palitlum dig the gold for thee and net the fish and are glad to be made glad when out of thy wisdom thou deemest it fit that the three star should wet our lips  i was minded to hear of ligoun i said impatiently the night grows short and we have a sore journey tomorrow  i yawned and made as though to rise but palitlum betrayed a quick anxiety and with abruptness began  it was ligouns desire in his old age that peace should be among the tribes as a young man he had been first of the fighting men and chief over the warchiefs of the islands and the passes all his days had been full of fighting more marks he boasted of bone and lead and iron than any other man three wives he had and for each wife two sons and the sons eldest born and last and all died by his side in battle restless as the baldface he ranged wide and farnorth to unalaska and the shallow sea south to the queen charlottes ay even did he go with the kakes it is told to far puget sound and slay thy brothers in their sheltered houses  but as i say in his old age he looked for peace among the tribes not that he was become afraid or overfond of the corner by the fire and the wellfilled pot for he slew with the shrewdness and bloodhunger of the fiercest drew in his belly to famine with the youngest and with the stoutest faced the bitter seas and stinging trail but because of his many deeds and in punishment a warship carried him away even to thy country o hairface and boston man and the years were many ere he came back and i was grown to something more than a boy and something less than a young man and ligoun being childless in his old age made much of me and grown wise gave me of his wisdom  it be good to fight o palitlum said he nay o hairface for i was unknown as palitlum in those days being called olo the everhungry the drink was to come after it be good to fight spoke ligoun but it be foolish in the boston man country as i saw with mine eyes they are not given to fighting one with another and they be strong wherefore of their strength they come against us of the islands and passes and we are as camp smoke and sea mist before them wherefore i say it be good to fight most good but it be likewise foolish  and because of this though first always of the fighting men ligouns voice was loudest ever for peace and when he was very old being greatest of chiefs and richest of men he gave a potlatch never was there such a potlatch five hundred canoes were lined against the river bank and in each canoe there came not less than ten of men and women eight tribes were there from the first and oldest man to the last and youngest babe were they there and then there were men from fardistant tribes great travellers and seekers who had heard of the potlatch of ligoun and for the length of seven days they filled their bellies with his meat and drink eight thousand blankets did he give to them as i well know for who but i kept the tally and apportioned according to degree and rank and in the end ligoun was a poor man but his name was on all mens lips and other chiefs gritted their teeth in envy that he should be so great  and so because there was weight to his words he counselled peace and he journeyed to every potlatch and feast and tribal gathering that he might counsel peace and so it came that we journeyed together ligoun and i to the great feast given by niblack who was chief over the river indians of the skoot which is not far from the stickeen this was in the last days and ligoun was very old and very close to death he coughed of cold weather and camp smoke and often the red blood ran from out his mouth till we looked for him to die  nay he said once at such time it were better that i should die when the blood leaps to the knife and there is a clash of steel and smell of powder and men crying aloud what of the cold iron and quick lead so it be plain o hairface that his heart was yet strong for battle  it is very far from the chilcat to the skoot and we were many days in the canoes and the while the men bent to the paddles i sat at the feet of ligoun and received the law of small need for me to say the law o hairface for it be known to me that in this thou art well skilled yet do i speak of the law of blood for blood and rank for rank also did ligoun go deeper into the matter saying  but know this o olo that there be little honor in the killing of a man less than thee kill always the man who is greater and thy honor shall be according to his greatness but if of two men thou killest the lesser then is shame thine for which the very squaws will lift their lips at thee as i say peace be good but remember o olo if kill thou must that thou killest by the law  it is a way of the thlinketfolk palitlum vouchsafed half apologetically  and i remembered the gunfighters and bad men of my own western land and was not perplexed at the way of the thlinketfolk  in time palitlum continued we came to chief niblack and the skoots it was a feast great almost as the potlatch of ligoun there were we of the chilcat and the sitkas and the stickeens who are neighbors to the skoots and the wrangels and the hoonahs there were sundowns and tahkos from port houghton and their neighbors the awks from douglass channel the naass river people and the tongas from north of dixon and the kakes who come from the island called kupreanoff then there were siwashes from vancouver cassiars from the gold mountains teslin men and even sticks from the yukon country  it was a mighty gathering but first of all there was to be a meeting of the chiefs with niblack and a drowning of all enmities in quass the russians it was who showed us the way of making quass for so my father told memy father who got it from his father before him but to this quass had niblack added many things such as sugar flour dried apples and hops so that it was a mans drink strong and good not so good as three star o hairface yet good  this quassfeast was for the chiefs and the chiefs only and there was a score of them but ligoun being very old and very great it was given that i walk with him that he might lean upon my shoulder and that i might ease him down when he took his seat and raise him up when he arose at the door of niblacks house which was of logs and very big each chief as was the custom laid down his spear or rifle and his knife for as thou knowest o hairface strong drink quickens and old hates flame up and head and hand are swift to act but i noted that ligoun had brought two knives the one he left outside the door the other slipped under his blanket snug to the grip the other chiefs did likewise and i was troubled for what was to come  the chiefs were ranged sitting in a big circle about the room i stood at ligouns elbow in the middle was the barrel of quass and by it a slave to serve the drink first niblack made oration with much show of friendship and many fine words then he gave a sign and the slave dipped a gourd full of quass and passed it to ligoun as was fit for his was the highest rank  ligoun drank it to the last drop and i gave him my strength to get on his feet so that he too might make oration he had kind speech for the many tribes noted the greatness of niblack to give such a feast counselled for peace as was his custom and at the end said that the quass was very good  then niblack drank being next of rank to ligoun and after him one chief and another in degree and order and each spoke friendly words and said that the quass was good till all had drunk did i say all nay not all o hairface for last of them was one a lean and catlike man young of face with a quick and daring eye who drank darkly and spat forth upon the ground and spoke no word  to not say that the quass was good were insult to spit forth upon the ground were worse than insult and this very thing did he do he was known for a chief over the sticks of the yukon and further naught was known of him  as i say it was an insult but mark this o hairface it was an insult not to niblack the feastgiver but to the man chiefest of rank who sat among those of the circle and that man was ligoun there was no sound all eyes were upon him to see what he might do he made no movement his withered lips trembled not into speech nor did a nostril quiver nor an eyelid droop but i saw that he looked wan and gray as i have seen old men look of bitter mornings when famine pressed and the women wailed and the children whimpered and there was no meat nor sign of meat and as the old men looked so looked ligoun  there was no sound it were as a circle of the dead but that each chief felt beneath his blanket to make sure and that each chief glanced to his neighbor right and left with a measuring eye i was a stripling the things i had seen were few yet i knew it to be the moment one meets but once in all a lifetime  the stick rose up with every eye upon him and crossed the room till he stood before ligoun  i am opitsah the knife he said  but ligoun said naught nor looked at him but gazed unblinking at the ground  you are ligoun opitsah said you have killed many men i am still alive  and still ligoun said naught though he made the sign to me and with my strength arose and stood upright on his two feet he was as an old pine naked and gray but still ashoulder to the frost and storm his eyes were unblinking and as he had not heard opitsah so it seemed he did not see him  and opitsah was mad with anger and danced stifflegged before him as men do when they wish to give another shame and opitsah sang a song of his own greatness and the greatness of his people filled with bad words for the chilcats and for ligoun and as he danced and sang opitsah threw off his blanket and with his knife drew bright circles before the face of ligoun and the song he sang was the song of the knife  and there was no other sound only the singing of opitsah and the circle of chiefs that were as dead save that the flash of the knife seemed to draw smouldering fire from their eyes and ligoun also was very still yet did he know his death and was unafraid and the knife sang closer and yet closer to his face but his eyes were unblinking and he swayed not to right or left or this way or that  and opitsah drove in the knife so twice on the forehead of ligoun and the red blood leaped after it and then it was that ligoun gave me the sign to bear up under him with my youth that he might walk and he laughed with a great scorn full in the face of opitsah the knife and he brushed opitsah to the side as one brushes to the side a lowhanging branch on the trail and passes on  and i knew and understood for there was but shame in the killing of opitsah before the faces of a score of greater chiefs i remembered the law and knew ligoun had it in mind to kill by the law and who chiefest of rank but himself was there but niblack and toward niblack leaning on my arm he walked and to his other arm clinging and striking was opitsah too small to soil with his blood the hands of so great a man and though the knife of opitsah bit in again and again ligoun noted it not nor winced and in this fashion we three went our way across the room niblack sitting in his blanket and fearful of our coming  and now old hates flamed up and forgotten grudges were remembered lamuk a kake had had a brother drowned in the bad water of the stickeen and the stickeens had not paid in blankets for their bad water as was the custom to pay so lamuk drove straight with his long knife to the heart of klokkutz the stickeen and katchahook remembered a quarrel of the naass river people with the tongas of north of dixon and the chief of the tongas he slew with a pistol which made much noise and the bloodhunger gripped all the men who sat in the circle and chief slew chief or was slain as chance might be also did they stab and shoot at ligoun for whoso killed him won great honor and would be unforgotten for the deed and they were about him like wolves about a moose only they were so many they were in their own way and they slew one another to make room and there was great confusion  but ligoun went slowly without haste as though many years were yet before him it seemed that he was certain he would make his kill in his own way ere they could slay him and as i say he went slowly and knives bit into him and he was red with blood and though none sought after me who was a mere stripling yet did the knives find me and the hot bullets burn me and still ligoun leaned his weight on my youth and opitsah struck at him and we three went forward and when we stood by niblack he was afraid and covered his head with his blanket the skoots were ever cowards  and goolzug and kadishan the one a fisheater and the other a meatkiller closed together for the honor of their tribes and they raged madly about and in their battling swung against the knees of opitsah who was overthrown and trampled upon and a knife singing through the air smote skulpin of the sitkas in the throat and he flung his arms out blindly reeling and dragged me down in his fall  and from the ground i beheld ligoun bend over niblack and uncover the blanket from his head and turn up his face to the light and ligoun was in no haste being blinded with his own blood he swept it out of his eyes with the back of his hand so he might see and be sure and when he was sure that the upturned face was the face of niblack he drew the knife across his throat as one draws a knife across the throat of a trembling deer and then ligoun stood erect singing his deathsong and swaying gently to and fro and skulpin who had dragged me down shot with a pistol from where he lay and ligoun toppled and fell as an old pine topples and falls in the teeth of the wind  palitlum ceased his eyes smouldering moodily were bent upon the fire and his cheek was dark with blood  and thou palitlum i demanded and thou  i i did remember the law and i slew opitsah the knife which was well and i drew ligouns own knife from the throat of niblack and slew skulpin who had dragged me down for i was a stripling and i could slay any man and it were honor and further ligoun being dead there was no need for my youth and i laid about me with his knife choosing the chiefest of rank that yet remained  palitlum fumbled under his shirt and drew forth a beaded sheath and from the sheath a knife it was a knife homewrought and crudely fashioned from a whipsaw file a knife such as one may find possessed by old men in a hundred alaskan villages  the knife of ligoun i said and palitlum nodded  and for the knife of ligoun i said will i give thee ten bottles of three star  but palitlum looked at me slowly hairface i am weak as water and easy as a woman i have soiled my belly with quass and hooch and three star my eyes are blunted my ears have lost their keenness and my strength has gone into fat and i am without honor in these days and am called palitlum the drinker yet honor was mine at the potlatch of niblack on the skoot and the memory of it and the memory of ligoun be dear to me nay didst thou turn the sea itself into three star and say that it were all mine for the knife yet would i keep the knife i am palitlum the drinker but i was once olo the everhungry who bore up ligoun with his youth  thou art a great man palitlum i said and i honor thee  palitlum reached out his hand  the three star between thy knees be mine for the tale i have told he said  and as i looked on the frown of the cliff at our backs i saw the shadow of a mans torso monstrous beneath a huge inverted bottle     li wan the fair   the sun sinks canim and the heat of the day is gone  so called li wan to the man whose head was hidden beneath the squirrelskin robe but she called softly as though divided between the duty of waking him and the fear of him awake for she was afraid of this big husband of hers who was like unto none of the men she had known the moosemeat sizzled uneasily and she moved the fryingpan to one side of the red embers as she did so she glanced warily at the two hudson bay dogs dripping eager slaver from their scarlet tongues and following her every movement they were huge hairy fellows crouched to leeward in the thin smokewake of the fire to escape the swarming myriads of mosquitoes as li wan gazed down the steep to where the klondike flung its swollen flood between the hills one of the dogs bellied its way forward like a worm and with a deft catlike stroke of the paw dipped a chunk of hot meat out of the pan to the ground but li wan caught him from out the tail of her eye and he sprang back with a snap and a snarl as she rapped him over the nose with a stick of firewood  nay olo she laughed recovering the meat without removing her eye from him thou art ever hungry and for that thy nose leads thee into endless troubles  but the mate of olo joined him and together they defied the woman the hair on their backs and shoulders bristled in recurrent waves of anger and the thin lips writhed and lifted into ugly wrinkles exposing the fleshtearing fangs cruel and menacing their very noses serrulated and shook in brute passion and they snarled as the wolves snarl with all the hatred and malignity of the breed impelling them to spring upon the woman and drag her down  and thou too bash fierce as thy master and never at peace with the hand that feeds thee this is not thy quarrel so that be thine and that  as she cried she drove at them with the firewood but they avoided the blows and refused to retreat they separated and approached her from either side crouching low and snarling li wan had struggled with the wolfdog for mastery from the time she toddled among the skinbales of the teepee and she knew a crisis was at hand bash had halted his muscles stiff and tense for the spring olo was yet creeping into striking distance  grasping two blazing sticks by the charred ends she faced the brutes the one held back but bash sprang and she met him in midair with the flaming weapon there were sharp yelps of pain and swift odors of burning hair and flesh as he rolled in the dirt and the woman ground the fiery embers into his mouth snapping wildly he flung himself sidewise out of her reach and in a frenzy of fear scrambled for safety olo on the other side had begun his retreat when li wan reminded him of her primacy by hurling a heavy stick of wood into his ribs then the pair retreated under a rain of firewood and on the edge of the camp fell to licking their wounds and whimpering by turns and snarling  li wan blew the ashes off the meat and sat down again her heart had not gone up a beat and the incident was already old for this was the routine of life canim had not stirred during the disorder but instead had set up a lusty snoring  come canim she called the heat of the day is gone and the trail waits for our feet  the squirrelskin robe was agitated and cast aside by a brown arm then the mans eyelids fluttered and drooped again  his pack is heavy she thought and he is tired with the work of the morning  a mosquito stung her on the neck and she daubed the unprotected spot with wet clay from a ball she had convenient to hand all morning toiling up the divide and enveloped in a cloud of the pests the man and woman had plastered themselves with the sticky mud which drying in the sun covered their faces with masks of clay these masks broken in divers places by the movement of the facial muscles had constantly to be renewed so that the deposit was irregular of depth and peculiar of aspect  li wan shook canim gently but with persistence till he roused and sat up his first glance was to the sun and after consulting the celestial timepiece he hunched over to the fire and fellto ravenously on the meat he was a large indian fully six feet in height deepchested and heavymuscled and his eyes were keener and vested with greater mental vigor than the average of his kind the lines of will had marked his face deeply and this coupled with a sternness and primitiveness advertised a native indomitability unswerving of purpose and prone when thwarted to sullen cruelty  tomorrow li wan we shall feast he sucked a marrowbone clean and threw it to the dogs we shall have flapjacks fried in bacon grease and sugar which is more toothsome  flapjacks she questioned mouthing the word curiously  ay canim answered with superiority and i shall teach you new ways of cookery of these things i speak you are ignorant and of many more things besides you have lived your days in a little corner of the earth and know nothing but ihe straightened himself and looked at her pridefullyi am a great traveller and have been all places even among the white people and i am versed in their ways and in the ways of many peoples i am not a tree born to stand in one place always and know not what there be over the next hill for i am canim the canoe made to go here and there and to journey and quest up and down the length and breadth of the world  she bowed her head humbly it is true i have eaten fish and meat and berries all my days and lived in a little corner of the earth nor did i dream the world was so large until you stole me from my people and i cooked and carried for you on the endless trails she looked up at him suddenly tell me canim does this trail ever end  nay he answered my trail is like the world it never ends my trail is the world and i have travelled it since the time my legs could carry me and i shall travel it until i die my father and my mother may be dead but it is long since i looked upon them and i do not care my tribe is like your tribe it stays in the one placewhich is far from herebut i care naught for my tribe for i am canim the canoe  and must i li wan who am weary travel always your trail until i die  you li wan are my wife and the wife travels the husbands trail wheresoever it goes it is the law and were it not the law yet would it be the law of canim who is lawgiver unto himself and his  she bowed her head again for she knew no other law than that man was the master of woman  be not in haste canim cautioned her as she began to strap the meagre camp outfit to her pack the sun is yet hot and the trail leads down and the footing is good  she dropped her work obediently and resumed her seat  canim regarded her with speculative interest you do not squat on your hams like other women he remarked  no she answered it never came easy it tires me and i cannot take my rest that way  and why is it your feet point not straight before you  i do not know save that they are unlike the feet of other women  a satisfied light crept into his eyes but otherwise he gave no sign  like other women your hair is black but have you ever noticed that it is soft and fine softer and finer than the hair of other women  i have noticed she answered shortly for she was not pleased at such cold analysis of her sexdeficiencies  it is a year now since i took you from your people he went on and you are nigh as shy and afraid of me as when first i looked upon you how does this thing be  li wan shook her head i am afraid of you canim you are so big and strange and further before you looked upon me even i was afraid of all the young men i do not know  i cannot say  only it seemed somehow as though i should not be for them as though   ay he encouraged impatient at her faltering  as though they were not my kind  not your kind he demanded slowly then what is your kind  i do not know i  she shook her head in a bewildered manner i cannot put into words the way i felt it was strangeness in me i was unlike other maidens who sought the young men slyly i could not care for the young men that way it would have been a great wrong it seemed and an ill deed  what is the first thing you remember canim asked with abrupt irrelevance  powwahkaan my mother  and naught else before powwahkaan  naught else  but canim holding her eyes with his searched her secret soul and saw it waver  think and think hard li wan he threatened  she stammered and her eyes were piteous and pleading but his will dominated her and wrung from her lips the reluctant speech  but it was only dreams canim ill dreams of childhood shadows of things not real visions such as the dogs sleeping in the sunwarmth behold and whine out against  tell me he commanded of the things before powwahkaan your mother  they are forgotten memories she protested as a child i dreamed awake with my eyes open to the day and when i spoke of the strange things i saw i was laughed at and the other children were afraid and drew away from me and when i spoke of the things i saw to powwahkaan she chided me and said they were evil also she beat me it was a sickness i believe like the fallingsickness that comes to old men and in time i grew better and dreamed no more and now  i cannot remembershe brought her hand in a confused manner to her foreheadthey are there somewhere but i cannot find them only   only canim repeated holding her  only one thing but you will laugh at its foolishness it is so unreal  nay li wan dreams are dreams they may be memories of other lives we have lived i was once a moose i firmly believe i was once a moose what of the things i have seen in dreams and heard  strive as he would to hide it a growing anxiety was manifest but li wan groping after the words with which to paint the picture took no heed  i see a snowtramped space among the trees she began and across the snow the sign of a man where he has dragged himself heavily on hand and knee and i see too the man in the snow and it seems i am very close to him when i look he is unlike real men for he has hair on his face much hair and the hair of his face and head is yellow like the summer coat of the weasel his eyes are closed but they open and search about they are blue like the sky and look into mine and search no more and his hand moves slow as from weakness and i feel   ay canim whispered hoarsely you feel  no no she cried in haste i feel nothing did i say feel i did not mean it it could not be that i should mean it i see and i see only and that is all i seea man in the snow with eyes like the sky and hair like the weasel i have seen it many times and always it is the samea man in the snow  and do you see yourself he asked leaning forward and regarding her intently do you ever see yourself and the man in the snow  why should i see myself am i not real  his muscles relaxed and he sank back an exultant satisfaction in his eyes which he turned from her so that she might not see  i will tell you li wan he spoke decisively you were a little bird in some life before a little moosebird when you saw this thing and the memory of it is with you yet it is not strange i was once a moose and my fathers father afterward became a bearso said the shaman and the shaman cannot lie thus on the trail of the gods we pass from life to life and the gods know only and understand dreams and the shadows of dreams be memories nothing more and the dog whining asleep in the sunwarmth doubtless sees and remembers things gone before bash there was a warrior once i do firmly believe he was once a warrior  canim tossed a bone to the brute and got upon his feet come let us begone the sun is yet hot but it will get no cooler  and these white people what are they like li wan made bold to ask  like you and me he answered only they are less dark of skin you will be among them ere the day is dead  canim lashed the sleepingrobe to his onehundredandfiftypound pack smeared his face with wet clay and sat down to rest till li wan had finished loading the dogs olo cringed at sight of the club in her hand and gave no trouble when the bundle of forty pounds and odd was strapped upon him but bash was aggrieved and truculent and could not forbear to whimper and snarl as he was forced to receive the burden he bristled his back and bared his teeth as she drew the straps tight the while throwing all the malignancy of his nature into the glances shot at her sideways and backward and canim chuckled and said did i not say he was once a very great warrior  these furs will bring a price he remarked as he adjusted his headstrap and lifted his pack clear of the ground a big price the white men pay well for such goods for they have no time to hunt and are soft to the cold soon shall we feast li wan as you have feasted never in all the lives you have lived before  she grunted acknowledgment and gratitude for her lords condescension slipped into the harness and bent forward to the load  the next time i am born i would be born a white man he added and swung off down the trail which dived into the gorge at his feet  the dogs followed close at his heels and li wan brought up the rear but her thoughts were far away across the ice mountains to the east to the little corner of the earth where her childhood had been lived ever as a child she remembered she had been looked upon as strange as one with an affliction truly she had dreamed awake and been scolded and beaten for the remarkable visions she saw till after a time she had outgrown them but not utterly though they troubled her no more waking they came to her in her sleep grown woman that she was and many a night of nightmare was hers filled with fluttering shapes vague and meaningless the talk with canim had excited her and down all the twisted slant of the divide she harked back to the mocking fantasies of her dreams  let us take breath canim said when they had tapped midway the bed of the main creek  he rested his pack on a jutting rock slipped the headstrap and sat down li wan joined him and the dogs sprawled panting on the ground beside them at their feet rippled the glacial drip of the hills but it was muddy and discolored as if soiled by some commotion of the earth  why is this li wan asked  because of the white men who work in the ground listen he held up his hand and they heard the ring of pick and shovel and the sound of mens voices they are made mad by gold and work without ceasing that they may find it gold it is yellow and comes from the ground and is considered of great value it is also a measure of price  but li wans roving eyes had called her attention from him a few yards below and partly screened by a clump of young spruce the tiered logs of a cabin rose to meet its overhanging roof of dirt a thrill ran through her and all her dreamphantoms roused up and stirred about uneasily  canim she whispered in an agony of apprehension canim what is that  the white mans teepee in which he eats and sleeps  she eyed it wistfully grasping its virtues at a glance and thrilling again at the unaccountable sensations it aroused it must be very warm in time of frost she said aloud though she felt that she must make strange sounds with her lips  she felt impelled to utter them but did not and the next instant canim said it is called a cabin  her heart gave a great leap the sounds the very sounds she looked about her in sudden awe how should she know that strange word before ever she heard it what could be the matter and then with a shock half of fear and half of delight she realized that for the first time in her life there had been sanity and significance in the promptings of her dreams  cabin she repeated to herself cabin an incoherent flood of dreamstuff welled up and up till her head was dizzy and her heart seemed bursting shadows and looming bulks of things and unintelligible associations fluttered and whirled about and she strove vainly with her consciousness to grasp and hold them for she felt that there in that welter of memories was the key of the mystery could she but grasp and hold it all would be clear and plain  o canim o powwahkaan o shades and shadows what was that  she turned to canim speechless and trembling the dreamstuff in mad overwhelming riot she was sick and fainting and could only listen to the ravishing sounds which proceeded from the cabin in a wonderful rhythm  hum fiddle canim vouchsafed  but she did not hear him for in the ecstasy she was experiencing it seemed at last that all things were coming clear now now she thought a sudden moisture swept into her eyes and the tears trickled down her cheeks the mystery was unlocking but the faintness was overpowering her if only she could hold herself long enough if onlybut the landscape bent and crumpled up and the hills swayed back and forth across the sky as she sprang upright and screamed daddy daddy then the sun reeled and darkness smote her and she pitched forward limp and headlong among the rocks  canim looked to see if her neck had been broken by the heavy pack grunted his satisfaction and threw water upon her from the creek she came to slowly with choking sobs and sat up  it is not good the hot sun on the head he ventured  and she answered no it is not good and the pack bore upon me hard  we shall camp early so that you may sleep long and win strength he said gently and if we go now we shall be the quicker to bed  li wan said nothing but tottered to her feet in obedience and stirred up the dogs she took the swing of his pace mechanically and followed him past the cabin scarce daring to breathe but no sounds issued forth though the door was open and smoke curling upward from the sheetiron stovepipe  they came upon a man in the bend of the creek white of skin and blue of eye and for a moment li wan saw the other man in the snow but she saw dimly for she was weak and tired from what she had undergone still she looked at him curiously and stopped with canim to watch him at his work he was washing gravel in a large pan with a circular tilting movement and as they looked giving a deft flirt he flashed up the yellow gold in a broad streak across the bottom of the pan  very rich this creek canim told her as they went on sometime i will find such a creek and then i shall be a big man  cabins and men grew more plentiful till they came to where the main portion of the creek was spread out before them it was the scene of a vast devastation everywhere the earth was torn and rent as though by a titans struggles where there were no upthrown mounds of gravel great holes and trenches yawned and chasms where the thick rime of the earth had been peeled to bedrock there was no worn channel for the creek and its waters dammed up diverted flying through the air on giddy flumes trickling into sinks and low places and raised by huge waterwheels were used and used again a thousand times the hills had been stripped of their trees and their raw sides gored and perforated by great timberslides and prospect holes and over all like a monstrous race of ants was flung an army of menmudcovered dirty dishevelled men who crawled in and out of the holes of their digging crept like big bugs along the flumes and toiled and sweated at the gravelheaps which they kept in constant unrestmen as far as the eye could see even to the rims of the hilltops digging tearing and scouring the face of nature  li wan was appalled at the tremendous upheaval truly these men are mad she said to canim  small wonder the gold they dig after is a great thing he replied it is the greatest thing in the world  for hours they threaded the chaos of greed canim eagerly intent li wan weak and listless she knew she had been on the verge of disclosure and she felt that she was still on the verge of disclosure but the nervous strain she had undergone had tired her and she passively waited for the thing she knew not what to happen from every hand her senses snatched up and conveyed to her innumerable impressions each of which became a dull excitation to her jaded imagination somewhere within her responsive notes were answering to the things without forgotten and undreamedof correspondences were being renewed and she was aware of it in an incurious way and her soul was troubled but she was not equal to the mental exultation necessary to transmute and understand so she plodded wearily on at the heels of her lord content to wait for that which she knew somewhere somehow must happen  after undergoing the mad bondage of man the creek finally returned to its ancient ways all soiled and smirched from its toil and coiled lazily among the broad flats and timbered spaces where the valley widened to its mouth here the pay ran out and men were loth to loiter with the lure yet beyond and here as li wan paused to prod olo with her staff she heard the mellow silver of a womans laughter  before a cabin sat a woman fair of skin and rosy as a child dimpling with glee at the words of another woman in the doorway but the woman who sat shook about her great masses of dark wet hair which yielded up its dampness to the warm caresses of the sun  for an instant li wan stood transfixed then she was aware of a blinding flash and a snap as though something gave way and the woman before the cabin vanished and the cabin and the tall spruce timber and the jagged skyline and li wan saw another woman in the shine of another sun brushing great masses of black hair and singing as she brushed and li wan heard the words of the song and understood and was a child again she was smitten with a vision wherein all the troublesome dreams merged and became one and shapes and shadows took up their accustomed round and all was clear and plain and real many pictures jostled past strange scenes and trees and flowers and people and she saw them and knew them all  when you were a little bird a little moosebird canim said his eyes upon her and burning into her  when i was a little moosebird she whispered so faint and low he scarcely heard and she knew she lied as she bent her head to the strap and took the swing of the trail  and such was the strangeness of it the real now became unreal the mile tramp and the pitching of camp by the edge of the stream seemed like a passage in a nightmare she cooked the meat fed the dogs and unlashed the packs as in a dream and it was not until canim began to sketch his next wandering that she became herself again  the klondike runs into the yukon he was saying a mighty river mightier than the mackenzie of which you know so we go you and i down to fort o yukon with dogs in time of winter it is twenty sleeps then we follow the yukon away into the westone hundred sleeps two hundredi have never heard it is very far and then we come to the sea you know nothing of the sea so let me tell you as the lake is to the island so the sea is to the land all the rivers run to it and it is without end i have seen it at hudson bay i have yet to see it in alaska and then we may take a great canoe upon the sea you and i li wan or we may follow the land into the south many a hundred sleeps and after that i do not know save that i am canim the canoe wanderer and farjourneyer over the earth  she sat and listened and fear ate into her heart as she pondered over this plunge into the illimitable wilderness it is a weary way was all she said head bowed on knee in resignation  then it was a splendid thought came to her and at the wonder of it she was all aglow she went down to the stream and washed the dried clay from her face when the ripples died away she stared long at her mirrored features but sun and weatherbeat had done their work and what of roughness and bronze her skin was not soft and dimpled as a childs but the thought was still splendid and the glow unabated as she crept in beside her husband under the sleepingrobe  she lay awake staring up at the blue of the sky and waiting for canim to sink into the first deep sleep when this came about she wormed slowly and carefully away tucked the robe around him and stood up at her second step bash growled savagely she whispered persuasively to him and glanced at the man canim was snoring profoundly then she turned and with swift noiseless feet sped up the back trail  mrs evelyn van wyck was just preparing for bed bored by the duties put upon her by society her wealth and widowed blessedness she had journeyed into the northland and gone to housekeeping in a cosey cabin on the edge of the diggings here aided and abetted by her friend and companion myrtle giddings she played at living close to the soil and cultivated the primitive with refined abandon  she strove to get away from the generations of culture and parlor selection and sought the earthgrip her ancestors had forfeited likewise she induced mental states which she fondly believed to approximate those of the stonefolk and just now as she put up her hair for the pillow she was indulging her fancy with a palaeolithic wooing the details consisted principally of cavedwellings and cracked marrowbones intersprinkled with fierce carnivora hairy mammoths and combats with rude flaked knives of flint but the sensations were delicious and as evelyn van wyck fled through the sombre forest aisles before the too arduous advances of her slantbrowed skinclad wooer the door of the cabin opened without the courtesy of a knock and a skinclad woman savage and primitive came in  mercy  with a leap that would have done credit to a cavewoman miss giddings landed in safety behind the table but mrs van wyck held her ground she noticed that the intruder was laboring under a strong excitement and cast a swift glance backward to assure herself that the way was clear to the bunk where the big colts revolver lay beneath a pillow  greeting o woman of the wondrous hair said li wan  but she said it in her own tongue the tongue spoken in but a little corner of the earth and the women did not understand  shall i go for help miss giddings quavered  the poor creature is harmless i think mrs van wyck replied and just look at her skinclothes ragged and trailworn and all that they are certainly unique i shall buy them for my collection get my sack myrtle please and set up the scales  li wan followed the shaping of the lips but the words were unintelligible and then and for the first time she realized in a moment of suspense and indecision that there was no medium of communication between them  and at the passion of her dumbness she cried out with arms stretched wide apart o woman thou art sister of mine  the tears coursed down her cheeks as she yearned toward them and the break in her voice carried the sorrow she could not utter but miss giddings was trembling and even mrs van wyck was disturbed  i would live as you live thy ways are my ways and our ways be one my husband is canim the canoe and he is big and strange and i am afraid his trail is all the world and never ends and i am weary my mother was like you and her hair was as thine and her eyes and life was soft to me then and the sun warm  she knelt humbly and bent her head at mrs van wycks feet but mrs van wyck drew away frightened at her vehemence  li wan stood up panting for speech her dumb lips could not articulate her overmastering consciousness of kind  trade you trade mrs van wyck questioned slipping after the fashion of the superior peoples into pigeon tongue  she touched li wans ragged skins to indicate her choice and poured several hundreds of gold into the blower she stirred the dust about and trickled its yellow lustre temptingly through her fingers but li wan saw only the fingers milkwhite and shapely tapering daintily to the rosy jewellike nails she placed her own hand alongside all workworn and calloused and wept  mrs van wyck misunderstood gold she encouraged good gold you trade you changee for changee and she laid her hand again on li wans skin garments  how much you sell how much she persisted running her hand against the way of the hair so that she might make sure of the sinewthread seam  but li wan was deaf as well and the womans speech was without significance dismay at her failure sat upon her how could she identify herself with these women for she knew they were of the one breed bloodsisters among men and the women of men her eyes roved wildly about the interior taking in the soft draperies hanging around the feminine garments the oval mirror and the dainty toilet accessories beneath and the things haunted her for she had seen like things before and as she looked at them her lips involuntarily formed sounds which her throat trembled to utter then a thought flashed upon her and she steadied herself she must be calm she must control herself for there must be no misunderstanding this time or elseand she shook with a storm of suppressed tears and steadied herself again  she put her hand on the table table she clearly and distinctly enunciated table she repeated  she looked at mrs van wyck who nodded approbation li wan exulted but brought her will to bear and held herself steady stove she went on stove  and at every nod of mrs van wyck li wans excitement mounted now stumbling and halting and again in feverish haste as the recrudescence of forgotten words was fast or slow she moved about the cabin naming article after article and when she paused finally it was in triumph with body erect and head thrown back expectant waiting  cat mrs van wyck laughing spelled out in kindergarten fashion iseethecatcatchtherat  li wan nodded her head seriously they were beginning to understand her at last these women the blood flushed darkly under her bronze at the thought and she smiled and nodded her head still more vigorously  mrs van wyck turned to her companion received a smattering of mission education somewhere i fancy and has come to show it off  of course miss giddings tittered little fool we shall lose our sleep with her vanity  all the same i want that jacket if it is old the workmanship is gooda most excellent specimen she returned to her visitor changee for changee you changee for changee how much eh how much you  perhaps shed prefer a dress or something miss giddings suggested  mrs van wyck went up to li wan and made signs that she would exchange her wrapper for the jacket and to further the transaction she took li wans hand and placed it amid the lace and ribbons of the flowing bosom and rubbed the fingers back and forth so they might feel the texture but the jewelled butterfly which loosely held the fold in place was insecurely fastened and the front of the gown slipped to the side exposing a firm white breast which had never known the lipclasp of a child  mrs van wyck coolly repaired the mischief but li wan uttered a loud cry and ripped and tore at her skinshirt till her own breast showed firm and white as evelyn van wycks murmuring inarticulately and making swift signs she strove to establish the kinship  a halfbreed mrs van wyck commented i thought so from her hair  miss giddings made a fastidious gesture proud of her fathers white skin its beastly do give her something evelyn and make her go  but the other woman sighed poor creature i wish i could do something for her  a heavy foot crunched the gravel without then the cabin door swung wide and canim stalked in miss giddings saw a vision of sudden death and screamed but mrs van wyck faced him composedly  what do you want she demanded  how do canim answered suavely and directly pointing at the same time to li wan um my wife  he reached out for her but she waved him back  speak canim tell them that i am  daughter of powwahkaan nay of what is it to them that they should care better should i tell them thou art an ill wife given to creeping from thy husbands bed when sleep is heavy in his eyes  again he reached out for her but she fled away from him to mrs van wyck at whose feet she made frenzied appeal and whose knees she tried to clasp but the lady stepped back and gave permission with her eyes to canim he gripped li wan under the shoulders and raised her to her feet she fought with him in a madness of despair till his chest was heaving with the exertion and they had reeled about over half the room  let me go canim she sobbed  but he twisted her wrist till she ceased to struggle the memories of the little moosebird are overstrong and make trouble he began  i know i know she broke in i see the man in the snow and as never before i see him crawl on hand and knee and i who am a little child am carried on his back and this is before powwahkaan and the time i came to live in a little corner of the earth  you know he answered forcing her toward the door but you will go with me down the yukon and forget  never shall i forget so long as my skin is white shall i remember she clutched frantically at the doorpost and looked a last appeal to mrs evelyn van wyck  then will i teach thee to forget i canim the canoe  as he spoke he pulled her fingers clear and passed out with her upon the trail     the league of the old men   at the barracks a man was being tried for his life he was an old man a native from the whitefish river which empties into the yukon below lake le barge all dawson was wrought up over the affair and likewise the yukondwellers for a thousand miles up and down it has been the custom of the landrobbing and searobbing anglosaxon to give the law to conquered peoples and ofttimes this law is harsh but in the case of imber the law for once seemed inadequate and weak in the mathematical nature of things equity did not reside in the punishment to be accorded him the punishment was a foregone conclusion there could be no doubt of that and though it was capital imber had but one life while the tale against him was one of scores  in fact the blood of so many was upon his hands that the killings attributed to him did not permit of precise enumeration smoking a pipe by the trailside or lounging around the stove men made rough estimates of the numbers that had perished at his hand they had been whites all of them these poor murdered people and they had been slain singly in pairs and in parties and so purposeless and wanton had been these killings that they had long been a mystery to the mounted police even in the time of the captains and later when the creeks realized and a governor came from the dominion to make the land pay for its prosperity  but more mysterious still was the coming of imber to dawson to give himself up it was in the late spring when the yukon was growling and writhing under its ice that the old indian climbed painfully up the bank from the river trail and stood blinking on the main street men who had witnessed his advent noted that he was weak and tottery and that he staggered over to a heap of cabinlogs and sat down he sat there a full day staring straight before him at the unceasing tide of white men that flooded past many a head jerked curiously to the side to meet his stare and more than one remark was dropped anent the old siwash with so strange a look upon his face no end of men remembered afterward that they had been struck by his extraordinary figure and forever afterward prided themselves upon their swift discernment of the unusual  but it remained for dickensen little dickensen to be the hero of the occasion little dickensen had come into the land with great dreams and a pocketful of cash but with the cash the dreams vanished and to earn his passage back to the states he had accepted a clerical position with the brokerage firm of holbrook and mason across the street from the office of holbrook and mason was the heap of cabinlogs upon which imber sat dickensen looked out of the window at him before he went to lunch and when he came back from lunch he looked out of the window and the old siwash was still there  dickensen continued to look out of the window and he too forever afterward prided himself upon his swiftness of discernment he was a romantic little chap and he likened the immobile old heathen to the genius of the siwash race gazing calmeyed upon the hosts of the invading saxon the hours swept along but imber did not vary his posture did not by a hairsbreadth move a muscle and dickensen remembered the man who once sat upright on a sled in the main street where men passed to and fro they thought the man was resting but later when they touched him they found him stiff and cold frozen to death in the midst of the busy street to undouble him that he might fit into a coffin they had been forced to lug him to a fire and thaw him out a bit dickensen shivered at the recollection  later on dickensen went out on the sidewalk to smoke a cigar and cool off and a little later emily travis happened along emily travis was dainty and delicate and rare and whether in london or klondike she gowned herself as befitted the daughter of a millionnaire mining engineer little dickensen deposited his cigar on an outside window ledge where he could find it again and lifted his hat  they chatted for ten minutes or so when emily travis glancing past dickensens shoulder gave a startled little scream dickensen turned about to see and was startled too imber had crossed the street and was standing there a gaunt and hungrylooking shadow his gaze riveted upon the girl  what do you want little dickensen demanded tremulously plucky  imber grunted and stalked up to emily travis he looked her over keenly and carefully every square inch of her especially did he appear interested in her silky brown hair and in the color of her cheek faintly sprayed and soft like the downy bloom of a butterfly wing he walked around her surveying her with the calculating eye of a man who studies the lines upon which a horse or a boat is builded in the course of his circuit the pink shell of her ear came between his eye and the westering sun and he stopped to contemplate its rosy transparency then he returned to her face and looked long and intently into her blue eyes he grunted and laid a hand on her arm midway between the shoulder and elbow with his other hand he lifted her forearm and doubled it back disgust and wonder showed in his face and he dropped her arm with a contemptuous grunt then he muttered a few guttural syllables turned his back upon her and addressed himself to dickensen  dickensen could not understand his speech and emily travis laughed imber turned from one to the other frowning but both shook their heads he was about to go away when she called out  oh jimmy come here  jimmy came from the other side of the street he was a big hulking indian clad in approved whiteman style with an eldorado kings sombrero on his head he talked with imber haltingly with throaty spasms jimmy was a sitkan possessed of no more than a passing knowledge of the interior dialects  him whitefish man he said to emily travis me savve um talk no very much him want to look see chief white man  the governor suggested dickensen  jimmy talked some more with the whitefish man and his face went grave and puzzled  i tink um want capn alexander he explained him say um kill white man white woman white boy plenty kill um white people him want to die  insane i guess said dickensen  what you call dat queried jimmy  dickensen thrust a finger figuratively inside his head and imparted a rotary motion thereto  mebbe so mebbe so said jimmy returning to imber who still demanded the chief man of the white men  a mounted policeman unmounted for klondike service joined the group and heard imbers wish repeated he was a stalwart young fellow broadshouldered deepchested legs cleanly built and stretched wide apart and tall though imber was he towered above him by half a head his eyes were cool and gray and steady and he carried himself with the peculiar confidence of power that is bred of blood and tradition his splendid masculinity was emphasized by his excessive boyishnesshe was a mere ladand his smooth cheek promised a blush as willingly as the cheek of a maid  imber was drawn to him at once the fire leaped into his eyes at sight of a sabre slash that scarred his cheek he ran a withered hand down the young fellows leg and caressed the swelling thew he smote the broad chest with his knuckles and pressed and prodded the thick musclepads that covered the shoulders like a cuirass the group had been added to by curious passersbyhusky miners mountaineers and frontiersmen sons of the longlegged and broadshouldered generations imber glanced from one to another then he spoke aloud in the whitefish tongue  what did he say asked dickensen  him say um all the same one man dat pliceman jimmy interpreted  little dickensen was little and what of miss travis he felt sorry for having asked the question  the policeman was sorry for him and stepped into the breach i fancy there may be something in his story ill take him up to the captain for examination tell him to come along with me jimmy  jimmy indulged in more throaty spasms and imber grunted and looked satisfied  but ask him what he said jimmy and what he meant when he took hold of my arm  so spoke emily travis and jimmy put the question and received the answer  him say you no afraid said jimmy  emily travis looked pleased  him say you no skookum no strong all the same very soft like little baby him break you in um two hands to little pieces him tink much funny very strange how you can be mother of men so big so strong like dat pliceman  emily travers kept her eyes up and unfaltering but her cheeks were sprayed with scarlet little dickensen blushed and was quite embarrassed the policemans face blazed with his boys blood  come along you he said gruffly setting his shoulder to the crowd and forcing a way  thus it was that imber found his way to the barracks where he made full and voluntary confession and from the precincts of which he never emerged  imber looked very tired the fatigue of hopelessness and age was in his face his shoulders drooped depressingly and his eyes were lacklustre his mop of hair should have been white but sun and weatherbeat had burned and bitten it so that it hung limp and lifeless and colorless he took no interest in what went on around him the courtroom was jammed with the men of the creeks and trails and there was an ominous note in the rumble and grumble of their lowpitched voices which came to his ears like the growl of the sea from deep caverns  he sat close by a window and his apathetic eyes rested now and again on the dreary scene without the sky was overcast and a gray drizzle was falling it was floodtime on the yukon the ice was gone and the river was up in the town back and forth on the main street in canoes and polingboats passed the people that never rested often he saw these boats turn aside from the street and enter the flooded square that marked the barracks paradeground sometimes they disappeared beneath him and he heard them jar against the houselogs and their occupants scramble in through the window after that came the slush of water against mens legs as they waded across the lower room and mounted the stairs then they appeared in the doorway with doffed hats and dripping seaboots and added themselves to the waiting crowd  and while they centred their looks on him and in grim anticipation enjoyed the penalty he was to pay imber looked at them and mused on their ways and on their law that never slept but went on unceasing in good times and bad in flood and famine through trouble and terror and death and which would go on unceasing it seemed to him to the end of time  a man rapped sharply on a table and the conversation droned away into silence imber looked at the man he seemed one in authority yet imber divined the squarebrowed man who sat by a desk farther back to be the one chief over them all and over the man who had rapped another man by the same table uprose and began to read aloud from many fine sheets of paper at the top of each sheet he cleared his throat at the bottom moistened his fingers imber did not understand his speech but the others did and he knew that it made them angry sometimes it made them very angry and once a man cursed him in single syllables stinging and tense till a man at the table rapped him to silence  for an interminable period the man read his monotonous singsong utterance lured imber to dreaming and he was dreaming deeply when the man ceased a voice spoke to him in his own whitefish tongue and he roused up without surprise to look upon the face of his sisters son a young man who had wandered away years agone to make his dwelling with the whites  thou dost not remember me he said by way of greeting  nay imber answered thou art howkan who went away thy mother be dead  she was an old woman said howkan  but imber did not hear and howkan with hand upon his shoulder roused him again  i shall speak to thee what the man has spoken which is the tale of the troubles thou hast done and which thou hast told o fool to the captain alexander and thou shalt understand and say if it be true talk or talk not true it is so commanded  howkan had fallen among the mission folk and been taught by them to read and write in his hands he held the many fine sheets from which the man had read aloud and which had been taken down by a clerk when imber first made confession through the mouth of jimmy to captain alexander howkan began to read imber listened for a space when a wonderment rose up in his face and he broke in abruptly  that be my talk howkan yet from thy lips it comes when thy ears have not heard  howkan smirked with selfappreciation his hair was parted in the middle nay from the paper it comes o imber never have my ears heard from the paper it comes through my eyes into my head and out of my mouth to thee thus it comes  thus it comes it be there in the paper imbers voice sank in whisperful awe as he crackled the sheets twixt thumb and finger and stared at the charactery scrawled thereon it be a great medicine howkan and thou art a worker of wonders  it be nothing it be nothing the young man responded carelessly and pridefully he read at hazard from the document in that year before the break of the ice came an old man and a boy who was lame of one foot these also did i kill and the old man made much noise  it be true imber interrupted breathlessly he made much noise and would not die for a long time but how dost thou know howkan the chief man of the white men told thee mayhap no one beheld me and him alone have i told  howkan shook his head with impatience have i not told thee it be there in the paper o fool  imber stared hard at the inkscrawled surface as the hunter looks upon the snow and says here but yesterday there passed a rabbit and here by the willow scrub it stood and listened and heard and was afraid and here it turned upon its trail and here it went with great swiftness leaping wide and here with greater swiftness and wider leapings came a lynx and here where the claws cut deep into the snow the lynx made a very great leap and here it struck with the rabbit under and rolling belly up and here leads off the trail of the lynx alone and there is no more rabbitas the hunter looks upon the markings of the snow and says thus and so and here dost thou too look upon the paper and say thus and so and here be the things old imber hath done  even so said howkan and now do thou listen and keep thy womans tongue between thy teeth till thou art called upon for speech  thereafter and for a long time howkan read to him the confession and imber remained musing and silent at the end he said  it be my talk and true talk but i am grown old howkan and forgotten things come back to me which were well for the head man there to know first there was the man who came over the ice mountains with cunning traps made of iron who sought the beaver of the whitefish him i slew and there were three men seeking gold on the whitefish long ago them also i slew and left them to the wolverines and at the five fingers there was a man with a raft and much meat  at the moments when imber paused to remember howkan translated and a clerk reduced to writing the courtroom listened stolidly to each unadorned little tragedy till imber told of a redhaired man whose eyes were crossed and whom he had killed with a remarkably long shot  hell said a man in the forefront of the onlookers he said it soulfully and sorrowfully he was redhaired hell he repeated that was my brother bill and at regular intervals throughout the session his solemn hell was heard in the courtroom nor did his comrades check him nor did the man at the table rap him to order  imbers head drooped once more and his eyes went dull as though a film rose up and covered them from the world and he dreamed as only age can dream upon the colossal futility of youth  later howkan roused him again saying stand up o imber it be commanded that thou tellest why you did these troubles and slew these people and at the end journeyed here seeking the law  imber rose feebly to his feet and swayed back and forth he began to speak in a low and faintly rumbling voice but howkan interrupted him  this old man he is damn crazy he said in english to the squarebrowed man his talk is foolish and like that of a child  we will hear his talk which is like that of a child said the squarebrowed man and we will hear it word for word as he speaks it do you understand  howkan understood and imbers eyes flashed for he had witnessed the play between his sisters son and the man in authority and then began the story the epic of a bronze patriot which might well itself be wrought into bronze for the generations unborn the crowd fell strangely silent and the squarebrowed judge leaned head on hand and pondered his soul and the soul of his race only was heard the deep tones of imber rhythmically alternating with the shrill voice of the interpreter and now and again like the bell of the lord the wondering and meditative hell of the redhaired man  i am imber of the whitefish people so ran the interpretation of howkan whose inherent barbarism gripped hold of him and who lost his mission culture and veneered civilization as he caught the savage ring and rhythm of old imbers tale my father was otsbaok a strong man the land was warm with sunshine and gladness when i was a boy the people did not hunger after strange things nor hearken to new voices and the ways of their fathers were their ways the women found favor in the eyes of the young men and the young men looked upon them with content babes hung at the breasts of the women and they were heavyhipped with increase of the tribe men were men in those days in peace and plenty and in war and famine they were men  at that time there was more fish in the water than now and more meat in the forest our dogs were wolves warm with thick hides and hard to the frost and storm and as with our dogs so with us for we were likewise hard to the frost and storm and when the pellys came into our land we slew them and were slain for we were men we whitefish and our fathers and our fathers fathers had fought against the pellys and determined the bounds of the land  as i say with our dogs so with us and one day came the first white man he dragged himself so on hand and knee in the snow and his skin was stretched tight and his bones were sharp beneath never was such a man we thought and we wondered of what strange tribe he was and of its land and he was weak most weak like a little child so that we gave him a place by the fire and warm furs to lie upon and we gave him food as little children are given food  and with him was a dog large as three of our dogs and very weak the hair of this dog was short and not warm and the tail was frozen so that the end fell off and this strange dog we fed and bedded by the fire and fought from it our dogs which else would have killed him and what of the moose meat and the sundried salmon the man and dog took strength to themselves and what of the strength they became big and unafraid and the man spoke loud words and laughed at the old men and young men and looked boldly upon the maidens and the dog fought with our dogs and for all of his short hair and softness slew three of them in one day  when we asked the man concerning his people he said i have many brothers and laughed in a way that was not good and when he was in his full strength he went away and with him went noda daughter to the chief first after that was one of our bitches brought to pup and never was there such a breed of dogsbigheaded thickjawed and shorthaired and helpless well do i remember my father otsbaok a strong man his face was black with anger at such helplessness and he took a stone so and so and there was no more helplessness and two summers after that came noda back to us with a manchild in the hollow of her arm  and that was the beginning came a second white man with shorthaired dogs which he left behind him when he went and with him went six of our strongest dogs for which in trade he had given koosotee my mothers brother a wonderful pistol that fired with great swiftness six times and koosotee was very big what of the pistol and laughed at our bows and arrows womans things he called them and went forth against the baldface grizzly with the pistol in his hand now it be known that it is not good to hunt the baldface with a pistol but how were we to know and how was koosotee to know so he went against the baldface very brave and fired the pistol with great swiftness six times and the baldface but grunted and broke in his breast like it were an egg and like honey from a bees nest dripped the brains of koosotee upon the ground he was a good hunter and there was no one to bring meat to his squaw and children and we were bitter and we said that which for the white men is well is for us not well and this be true there be many white men and fat but their ways have made us few and lean  came the third white man with great wealth of all manner of wonderful foods and things and twenty of our strongest dogs he took from us in trade also what of presents and great promises ten of our young hunters did he take with him on a journey which fared no man knew where it is said they died in the snow of the ice mountains where man has never been or in the hills of silence which are beyond the edge of the earth be that as it may dogs and young hunters were seen never again by the whitefish people  and more white men came with the years and ever with pay and presents they led the young men away with them and sometimes the young men came back with strange tales of dangers and toils in the lands beyond the pellys and sometimes they did not come back and we said if they be unafraid of life these white men it is because they have many lives but we be few by the whitefish and the young men shall go away no more but the young men did go away and the young women went also and we were very wroth  it be true we ate flour and salt pork and drank tea which was a great delight only when we could not get tea it was very bad and we became short of speech and quick of anger so we grew to hunger for the things the white men brought in trade trade trade all the time was it trade one winter we sold our meat for clocks that would not go and watches with broken guts and files worn smooth and pistols without cartridges and worthless and then came famine and we were without meat and two score died ere the break of spring  now are we grown weak we said and the pellys will fall upon us and our bounds be overthrown but as it fared with us so had it fared with the pellys and they were too weak to come against us  my father otsbaok a strong man was now old and very wise and he spoke to the chief saying behold our dogs be worthless no longer are they thickfurred and strong and they die in the frost and harness let us go into the village and kill them saving only the wolf ones and these let us tie out in the night that they may mate with the wild wolves of the forest thus shall we have dogs warm and strong again  and his word was harkened to and we whitefish became known for our dogs which were the best in the land but known we were not for ourselves the best of our young men and women had gone away with the white men to wander on trail and river to far places and the young women came back old and broken as noda had come or they came not at all and the young men came back to sit by our fires for a time full of ill speech and rough ways drinking evil drinks and gambling through long nights and days with a great unrest always in their hearts till the call of the white men came to them and they went away again to the unknown places and they were without honor and respect jeering the oldtime customs and laughing in the faces of chief and shamans  as i say we were become a weak breed we whitefish we sold our warm skins and furs for tobacco and whiskey and thin cotton things that left us shivering in the cold and the coughing sickness came upon us and men and women coughed and sweated through the long nights and the hunters on trail spat blood upon the snow and now one and now another bled swiftly from the mouth and died and the women bore few children and those they bore were weak and given to sickness and other sicknesses came to us from the white men the like of which we had never known and could not understand smallpox likewise measles have i heard these sicknesses named and we died of them as die the salmon in the still eddies when in the fall their eggs are spawned and there is no longer need for them to live  and yet and here be the strangeness of it the white men come as the breath of death all their ways lead to death their nostrils are filled with it and yet they do not die theirs the whiskey and tobacco and shorthaired dogs theirs the many sicknesses the smallpox and measles the coughing and mouthbleeding theirs the white skin and softness to the frost and storm and theirs the pistols that shoot six times very swift and are worthless and yet they grow fat on their many ills and prosper and lay a heavy hand over all the world and tread mightily upon its peoples and their women too are soft as little babes most breakable and never broken the mothers of men and out of all this softness and sickness and weakness come strength and power and authority they be gods or devils as the case may be i do not know what do i know i old imber of the whitefish only do i know that they are past understanding these white men farwanderers and fighters over the earth that they be  as i say the meat in the forest became less and less it be true the white mans gun is most excellent and kills a long way off but of what worth the gun when there is no meat to kill when i was a boy on the whitefish there was moose on every hill and each year came the caribou uncountable but now the hunter may take the trail ten days and not one moose gladden his eyes while the caribou uncountable come no more at all small worth the gun i say killing a long way off when there be nothing to kill  and i imber pondered upon these things watching the while the whitefish and the pellys and all the tribes of the land perishing as perished the meat of the forest long i pondered i talked with the shamans and the old men who were wise i went apart that the sounds of the village might not disturb me and i ate no meat so that my belly should not press upon me and make me slow of eye and ear i sat long and sleepless in the forest wideeyed for the sign my ears patient and keen for the word that was to come and i wandered alone in the blackness of night to the river bank where was windmoaning and sobbing of water and where i sought wisdom from the ghosts of old shamans in the trees and dead and gone  and in the end as in a vision came to me the shorthaired and detestable dogs and the way seemed plain by the wisdom of otsbaok my father and a strong man had the blood of our own wolfdogs been kept clean wherefore had they remained warm of hide and strong in the harness so i returned to my village and made oration to the men this be a tribe these white men i said a very large tribe and doubtless there is no longer meat in their land and they are come among us to make a new land for themselves but they weaken us and we die they are a very hungry folk already has our meat gone from us and it were well if we would live that we deal by them as we have dealt by their dogs  and further oration i made counselling fight and the men of the whitefish listened and some said one thing and some another and some spoke of other and worthless things and no man made brave talk of deeds and war but while the young men were weak as water and afraid i watched that the old men sat silent and that in their eyes fires came and went and later when the village slept and no one knew i drew the old men away into the forest and made more talk and now we were agreed and we remembered the good young days and the free land and the times of plenty and the gladness and sunshine and we called ourselves brothers and swore great secrecy and a mighty oath to cleanse the land of the evil breed that had come upon it it be plain we were fools but how were we to know we old men of the whitefish  and to hearten the others i did the first deed i kept guard upon the yukon till the first canoe came down in it were two white men and when i stood upright upon the bank and raised my hand they changed their course and drove in to me and as the man in the bow lifted his head so that he might know wherefore i wanted him my arrow sang through the air straight to his throat and he knew the second man who held paddle in the stern had his rifle half to his shoulder when the first of my three spearcasts smote him  these be the first i said when the old men had gathered to me later we will bind together all the old men of all the tribes and after that the young men who remain strong and the work will become easy  and then the two dead white men we cast into the river and of the canoe which was a very good canoe we made a fire and a fire also of the things within the canoe but first we looked at the things and they were pouches of leather which we cut open with our knives and inside these pouches were many papers like that from which thou hast read o howkan with markings on them which we marvelled at and could not understand now i am become wise and i know them for the speech of men as thou hast told me  a whisper and buzz went around the courtroom when howkan finished interpreting the affair of the canoe and one mans voice spoke up that was the lost 91 mail peter james and delaney bringing it in and last spoken at le barge by matthews going out the clerk scratched steadily away and another paragraph was added to the history of the north  there be little more imber went on slowly it be there on the paper the things we did we were old men and we did not understand even i imber do not now understand secretly we slew and continued to slay for with our years we were crafty and we had learned the swiftness of going without haste when white men came among us with black looks and rough words and took away six of the young men with irons binding them helpless we knew we must slay wider and farther and one by one we old men departed up river and down to the unknown lands it was a brave thing old we were and unafraid but the fear of far places is a terrible fear to men who are old  so we slew without haste and craftily on the chilcoot and in the delta we slew from the passes to the sea wherever the white men camped or broke their trails it be true they died but it was without worth ever did they come over the mountains ever did they grow and grow while we being old became less and less i remember by the caribou crossing the camp of a white man he was a very little white man and three of the old men came upon him in his sleep and the next day i came upon the four of them the white man alone still breathed and there was breath in him to curse me once and well before he died  and so it went now one old man and now another sometimes the word reached us long after of how they died and sometimes it did not reach us and the old men of the other tribes were weak and afraid and would not join with us as i say one by one till i alone was left i am imber of the whitefish people my father was otsbaok a strong man there are no whitefish now of the old men i am the last the young men and young women are gone away some to live with the pellys some with the salmons and more with the white men i am very old and very tired and it being vain fighting the law as thou sayest howkan i am come seeking the law  o imber thou art indeed a fool said howkan  but imber was dreaming the squarebrowed judge likewise dreamed and all his race rose up before him in a mighty phantasmagoriahis steelshod mailclad race the lawgiver and worldmaker among the families of men he saw it dawn redflickering across the dark forests and sullen seas he saw it blaze bloody and red to full and triumphant noon and down the shaded slope he saw the bloodred sands dropping into night and through it all he observed the law pitiless and potent ever unswerving and ever ordaining greater than the motes of men who fulfilled it or were crushed by it even as it was greater than he his heart speaking for softness
