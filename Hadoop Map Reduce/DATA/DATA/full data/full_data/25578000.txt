preface by mrs robert louis stevenson 0   in our long voyage on the yacht casco we visited many islands i believe on every one we found the scourge of leprosy  in the marquesas there was a regular leper settlement though the persons living there seemed free to wander where they wished fishing on the beach or visiting friends in the villages  i remember one afternoon at anaho when my husband and i tired after a long quest for shells sat down on the sand to rest awhile a native man stepped out from under some cocoanut trees regarding us hesitatingly as though fearful of intruding my husband waved an invitation to the stranger to join us offering his cigarette to the man in the island fashion  the cigarette was accepted and after a puff or two courteously passed back again according to native etiquette  the hand that held it was the maimed hand of a leper to my consternation my husband took the cigarette and smoked it out afterwards when we were alone and i spoke of my horror he said ‘i could not mortify the man  and if you think i liked doing it—that was another reason because i didn’t want to’  another day while we were still anchored in anaho bay a messenger from round a distant headland came in a whaleboat with an urgent request that we go to see a young white girl who was ill with some mysterious malady we had supposed that with the beachcomber ‘charley the red’ we were the only white people on our side of the island  though there was much wind that day and the sea ran high we started at once impelled partly by curiosity and partly by the pathetic nature of the message fortunately we took our luncheon with us eating it on the beach before we went up to the house where the sick girl lay  our hostess the girl’s mother met us with regrets that we had already lunched saying ‘i have a most excellent cook here he is now’  she turned as she spoke to an elderly chinaman who was plainly in an advanced stage of leprosy  when the man was gone my husband asked if she had no fear of contagion  ‘i don’t believe in contagion’ was her reply  but there was little doubt as to what ailed her daughter  she was certainly suffering from leprosy we could only advise that the girl be taken to the french post at santa maria bay where there was a doctor  on our return to the casco we confessed to each other with what alarm and repugnance we touched the miserable girl  we talked long that evening of father damien his sublime heroism and his martyrdom which was already nearing its sad end  beyond all noble qualities my husband placed courage  the more he saw of leprosy and he saw much in the islands the higher rose his admiration for the simple priest of molokai ‘i must see molokai’ he said many times  ‘i must somehow manage to see molokai’  in january 1889 we arrived in honolulu settling in a pleasant cottage by the sea to rest until we were ready to return to england  the casco we sent back to san francisco with the captain  but the knowledge that every few days some vessel was leaving honolulu to cruise among islands we had not seen and now should never see was more than we could bear first we engaged passage on a missionary ship but changed our minds—my husband would not be allowed to smoke on board for one reason—and chartered the trading schooner equator  this was thought too rough a voyage for my motherinlaw as indeed it would have been so she was sent somewhat protesting back to scotland  my husband was still intent on seeing molokai  after the waste of much time and red tape he finally received an official permission to visit the leper settlement  it did not occur to him it would be necessary to get a separate official permission to leave molokai hence he was nearly left behind when the vessel sailed out  he only saved himself by a prodigious leap which landed him on board the boat whence nothing but force could dislodge him  by the doctor’s orders he took gloves to wear as a precautionary measure against contagion but they were never worn at first he avoided shaking hands but when he played croquet with the young leper girls he would not listen to the mother superior’s warning that he must wear gloves  he thought it might remind them of their condition  ‘what will you do if you find you have contracted leprosy’ i asked  ‘do’ he replied ‘why you and i would spend the rest of our lives in molokai and become humble followers of father damien’  as mr balfour says in the life of stevenson he was as stern with his family as he was with himself and as exacting  he talked very little to us of the tragedy of molokai though i could see it lay heavy on his spirits but of the great work begun by father damien and carried on by his successors he spoke fully  he had followed the life of the priest like a detective until there seemed nothing more to learn  mother mary ann the mother superior he could never mention without deep emotion  one of the first things he did on his return to honolulu was to send her a grand piano for the use of her girls—the girls with whom he had played croquet  he also sent toys sewing materials small tools for the younger children and other things that i have forgotten  after his death a letter was found among his papers of which i have only the last few lines  ‘i cannot suppose you remember me but i won’t forget you nor god won’t forget you for your kindness to the blind white leper at molokai’  during my husband’s absence i had made every preparation for our voyage on the equator so but little time was lost before we found ourselves on board our sails set for the south  the equator which had easily lived through the great samoan hurricane made no such phenomenal runs as the casco but we could trust her and she had no ‘tricks and ways’ that we did not understand  we liked the sailors we loved the ship and her captain so it was with heartfelt regret we said farewell in the harbour of apia after a long and perfect cruise  after reading the letters that awaited us in apia we looked over the newspapers  our indignation may be imagined when we read in one item that owing to the publication of a letter by a wellknown honolulu missionary depicting father damien as a dirty old peasant who had contracted leprosy through his immoral habits the project to erect a monument to his memory would be abandoned  ‘i’ll not believe it’ said my husband ‘unless i see it with my own eyes for it is too damnable for belief’  but see it he did in spite of his incredulity for in sydney a month or two later the very journal containing the letter condemnatory of father damien was among the first we chanced to open  i shall never forget my husband’s ferocity of indignation his leaping stride as he paced the room holding the offending paper at arm’slength before his eyes that burned and sparkled with a peculiar flashing light  his cousin mr balfour in his life of robert louis stevenson says ‘his eyes    when he was moved to anger or any fierce emotion seemed literally to blaze and glow with a burning light’  in another moment he disappeared through the doorway and i could hear him in his own room pulling his chair to the table and the sound of his inkstand being dragged towards him  that afternoon he called us together—my son my daughter and myself—saying that he had something serious to lay before us  he went over the circumstances succinctly and then we three had the incomparable experience of hearing its author read aloud the defence of father damien while it was still redhot from his indignant soul  as we sat dazed and overcome by emotion he pointed out to us that the subjectmatter was libellous in the highest degree and the publication of the article might cause the loss of his entire substance  without our concurrence he would not take such a risk  there was no dissenting voice how could there be  the paper was published with almost no change or revision though afterwards my husband said he considered this a mistake  he thought he should have waited for his anger to cool when he might have been more impersonal and less egotistic  the next day he consulted an eminent lawyer more from curiosity than from any other reason  mr moses—i think that was his name—was at first inclined to be jocular  i remember his smiling question ‘have you called him a hellhound or an atheist  otherwise there is no libel’ but when he looked over the manuscript his countenance changed  ‘this is a serious affair’ he said ‘however no one will publish it for you’ in that mr moses was right no one dared publish the pamphlet  but that difficulty was soon overcome  my husband hired a printer by the day and the work was rushed through  we then my daughter my son and myself were set to work helping address the pamphlets which were scattered far and wide  father damien was vindicated by a stranger a man of another country and another religion from his own

treatise on ethics were drafted at edinburgh in the spring of 1879  they are unrevised and must not be taken as representing either as to matter or form their author’s final thoughts but they contain much that is essentially characteristic of his mind                                                       copyright in the united states of america    chapter i   the problem of education is twofold first to know and then to utter every one who lives any semblance of an inner life thinks more nobly and profoundly than he speaks and the best of teachers can impart only broken images of the truth which they perceive  speech which goes from one to another between two natures and what is worse between two experiences is doubly relative  the speaker buries his meaning it is for the hearer to dig it up again and all speech written or spoken is in a dead language until it finds a willing and prepared hearer  such moreover is the complexity of life that when we condescend upon details in our advice we may be sure we condescend on error and the best of education is to throw out some magnanimous hints  no man was ever so poor that he could express all he has in him by words looks or actions his true knowledge is eternally incommunicable for it is a knowledge of himself and his best wisdom comes to him by no process of the mind but in a supreme selfdictation which keeps varying from hour to hour in its dictates with the variation of events and circumstances  a few men of picked nature full of faith courage and contempt for others try earnestly to set forth as much as they can grasp of this inner law but the vast majority when they come to advise the young must be content to retail certain doctrines which have been already retailed to them in their own youth  every generation has to educate another which it has brought upon the stage  people who readily accept the responsibility of parentship having very different matters in their eye are apt to feel rueful when that responsibility falls due  what are they to tell the child about life and conduct subjects on which they have themselves so few and such confused opinions  indeed i do not know the least said perhaps the soonest mended and yet the child keeps asking and the parent must find some words to say in his own defence  where does he find them and what are they when found  as a matter of experience and in nine hundred and ninetynine cases out of a thousand he will instil into his wideeyed brat three bad things the terror of public opinion and flowing from that as a fountain the desire of wealth and applause  besides these or what might be deduced as corollaries from these he will teach not much else of any effective value some dim notions of divinity perhaps and bookkeeping and how to walk through a quadrille  but you may tell me the young people are taught to be christians  it may be want of penetration but i have not yet been able to perceive it as an honest man whatever we teach and be it good or evil it is not the doctrine of christ  what he taught and in this he is like all other teachers worthy of the name was not a code of rules but a ruling spirit not truths but a spirit of truth not views but a view  what he showed us was an attitude of mind  towards the many considerations on which conduct is built each man stands in a certain relation  he takes life on a certain principle  he has a compass in his spirit which points in a certain direction  it is the attitude the relation the point of the compass that is the whole body and gist of what he has to teach us in this the details are comprehended out of this the specific precepts issue and by this and this only can they be explained and applied and thus to learn aright from any teacher we must first of all like a historical artist think ourselves into sympathy with his position and in the technical phrase create his character  a historian confronted with some ambiguous politician or an actor charged with a part have but one preoccupation they must search all round and upon every side and grope for some central conception which is to explain and justify the most extreme details until that is found the politician is an enigma or perhaps a quack and the part a tissue of fustian sentiment and big words but once that is found all enters into a plan a human nature appears the politician or the stageking is understood from point to point from end to end  this is a degree of trouble which will be gladly taken by a very humble artist but not even the terror of eternal fire can teach a business man to bend his imagination to such athletic efforts  yet without this all is vain until we understand the whole we shall understand none of the parts and otherwise we have no more than broken images and scattered words the meaning remains buried and the language in which our prophet speaks to us is a dead language in our ears  take a few of christ’s sayings and compare them with our current doctrines  ‘ye cannot’ he says ‘serve god and mammon’  cannot  and our whole system is to teach us how we can  ‘the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light’  are they  i had been led to understand the reverse that the christian merchant for example prospered exceedingly in his affairs that honesty was the best policy that an author of repute had written a conclusive treatise ‘how to make the best of both worlds’  of both worlds indeed  which am i to believe then—christ or the author of repute  ‘take no thought for the morrow’  ask the successful merchant interrogate your own heart and you will have to admit that this is not only a silly but an immoral position  all we believe all we hope all we honour in ourselves or our contemporaries stands condemned in this one sentence or if you take the other view condemns the sentence as unwise and inhumane  we are not then of the ‘same mind that was in christ’  we disagree with christ  either christ meant nothing or else he or we must be in the wrong  well says thoreau speaking of some texts from the new testament and finding a strange echo of another style which the reader may recognise ‘let but one of these sentences be rightly read from any pulpit in the land and there would not be left one stone of that meetinghouse upon another’  it may be objected that these are what are called ‘hard sayings’ and that a man or an education may be very sufficiently christian although it leave some of these sayings upon one side  but this is a very gross delusion  although truth is difficult to state it is both easy and agreeable to receive and the mind runs out to meet it ere the phrase be done  the universe in relation to what any man can say of it is plain patent and staringly comprehensible  in itself it is a great and travailing ocean unsounded unvoyageable an eternal mystery to man or let us say it is a monstrous and impassable mountain one side of which and a few near slopes and foothills we can dimly study with these mortal eyes  but what any man can say of it even in his highest utterance must have relation to this little and plain corner which is no less visible to us than to him  we are looking on the same map it will go hard if we cannot follow the demonstration  the longest and most abstruse flight of a philosopher becomes clear and shallow in the flash of a moment when we suddenly perceive the aspect and drift of his intention  the longest argument is but a finger pointed once we get our own finger rightly parallel and we see what the man meant whether it be a new star or an old streetlamp  and briefly if a saying is hard to understand it is because we are thinking of something else  but to be a true disciple is to think of the same things as our prophet and to think of different things in the same order  to be of the same mind with another is to see all things in the same perspective it is not to agree in a few indifferent matters near at hand and not much debated it is to follow him in his farthest flights to see the force of his hyperboles to stand so exactly in the centre of his vision that whatever he may express your eyes will light at once on the original that whatever he may see to declare your mind will at once accept  you do not belong to the school of any philosopher because you agree with him that theft is on the whole objectionable or that the sun is overhead at noon  it is by the hard sayings that discipleship is tested  we are all agreed about the middling and indifferent parts of knowledge and morality even the most soaring spirits too often take them tamely upon trust  but the man the philosopher or the moralist does not stand upon these chance adhesions and the purpose of any system looks towards those extreme points where it steps valiantly beyond tradition and returns with some covert hint of things outside  then only can you be certain that the words are not words of course nor mere echoes of the past then only are you sure that if he be indicating anything at all it is a star and not a streetlamp then only do you touch the heart of the mystery since it was for these that the author wrote his book  now every now and then and indeed surprisingly often christ finds a word that transcends all commonplace morality every now and then he quits the beaten track to pioneer the unexpressed and throws out a pregnant and magnanimous hyperbole for it is only by some bold poetry of thought that men can be strung up above the level of everyday conceptions to take a broader look upon experience or accept some higher principle of conduct  to a man who is of the same mind that was in christ who stands at some centre not too far from his and looks at the world and conduct from some not dissimilar or at least not opposing attitude—or shortly to a man who is of christ’s philosophy—every such saying should come home with a thrill of joy and corroboration he should feel each one below his feet as another sure foundation in the flux of time and chance each should be another proof that in the torrent of the years and generations where doctrines and great armaments and empires are swept away and swallowed he stands immovable holding by the eternal stars  but alas at this juncture of the ages it is not so with us on each and every such occasion our whole fellowship of christians falls back in disapproving wonder and implicitly denies the saying  christians the farce is impudently broad  let us stand up in the sight of heaven and confess the ethics that we hold are those of benjamin franklin  honesty is the best policy is perhaps a hard saying it is certainly one by which a wise man of these days will not too curiously direct his steps but i think it shows a glimmer of meaning to even our most dimmed intelligences i think we perceive a principle behind it i think without hyperbole we are of the same mind that was in benjamin franklin    chapter ii   but i may be told we teach the ten commandments where a world of morals lies condensed the very pith and epitome of all ethics and religion and a young man with these precepts engraved upon his mind must follow after profit with some conscience and christianity of method  a man cannot go very far astray who neither dishonours his parents nor kills nor commits adultery nor steals nor bears false witness for these things rightly thought out cover a vast field of duty  alas what is a precept  it is at best an illustration it is case law at the best which can be learned by precept  the letter is not only dead but killing the spirit which underlies and cannot be uttered alone is true and helpful  this is trite to sickness but familiarity has a cunning disenchantment in a day or two she can steal all beauty from the mountain tops and the most startling words begin to fall dead upon the ear after several repetitions  if you see a thing too often you no longer see it if you hear a thing too often you no longer hear it  our attention requires to be surprised and to carry a fort by assault or to gain a thoughtful hearing from the ruck of mankind are feats of about an equal difficulty and must be tried by not dissimilar means  the whole bible has thus lost its message for the common run of hearers it has become mere words of course and the parson may bawl himself scarlet and beat the pulpit like a thing possessed but his hearers will continue to nod they are strangely at peace they know all he has to say ring the old bell as you choose it is still the old bell and it cannot startle their composure  and so with this byword about the letter and the spirit  it is quite true no doubt but it has no meaning in the world to any man of us  alas it has just this meaning and neither more nor less that while the spirit is true the letter is eternally false  the shadow of a great oak lies abroad upon the ground at noon perfect clear and stable like the earth  but let a man set himself to mark out the boundary with cords and pegs and were he never so nimble and never so exact what with the multiplicity of the leaves and the progression of the shadow as it flees before the travelling sun long ere he has made the circuit the whole figure will have changed  life may be compared not to a single tree but to a great and complicated forest circumstance is more swiftly changing than a shadow language much more inexact than the tools of a surveyor from day to day the trees fall and are renewed the very essences are fleeting as we look and the whole world of leaves is swinging tempesttossed among the winds of time  look now for your shadows  o man of formulæ is this a place for you  have you fitted the spirit to a single case  alas in the cycle of the ages when shall such another be proposed for the judgment of man  now when the sun shines and the winds blow the wood is filled with an innumerable multitude of shadows tumultuously tossed and changing and at every gust the whole carpet leaps and becomes new  can you or your heart say more  look back now for a moment on your own brief experience of life and although you lived it feelingly in your own person and had every step of conduct burned in by pains and joys upon your memory tell me what definite lesson does experience hand on from youth to manhood or from both to age  the settled tenor which first strikes the eye is but the shadow of a delusion  this is gone that never truly was and you yourself are altered beyond recognition  times and men and circumstances change about your changing character with a speed of which no earthly hurricane affords an image  what was the best yesterday is it still the best in this changed theatre of a tomorrow  will your own past truly guide you in your own violent and unexpected future  and if this be questionable with what humble with what hopeless eyes should we not watch other men driving beside us on their unknown careers seeing with unlike eyes impelled by different gales doing and suffering in another sphere of things  and as the authentic clue to such a labyrinth and change of scene do you offer me these two score words these five bald prohibitions  for the moral precepts are no more than five the first four deal rather with matters of observance than of conduct the tenth thou shalt not covet stands upon another basis and shall be spoken of ere long  the jews to whom they were first given in the course of years began to find these precepts insufficient and made an addition of no less than six hundred and fifty others  they hoped to make a pocketbook of reference on morals which should stand to life in some such relation say as hoyle stands in to the scientific game of whist  the comparison is just and condemns the design for those who play by rule will never be more than tolerable players and you and i would like to play our game in life to the noblest and the most divine advantage  yet if the jews took a petty and huckstering view of conduct what view do we take ourselves who callously leave youth to go forth into the enchanted forest full of spells and dire chimeras with no guidance more complete than is afforded by these five precepts  honour thy father and thy mother  yes but does that mean to obey and if so how long and how far  thou shall not kill  yet the very intention and purport of the prohibition may be best fulfilled by killing  thou shall not commit adultery  but some of the ugliest adulteries are committed in the bed of marriage and under the sanction of religion and law  thou shalt not bear false witness  how by speech or by silence also or even by a smile  thou shalt not steal  ah that indeed  but what is to steal  to steal  it is another word to be construed and who is to be our guide  the police will give us one construction leaving the word only that least minimum of meaning without which society would fall in pieces but surely we must take some higher sense than this surely we hope more than a bare subsistence for mankind surely we wish mankind to prosper and go on from strength to strength and ourselves to live rightly in the eye of some more exacting potentate than a policeman  the approval or the disapproval of the police must be eternally indifferent to a man who is both valorous and good  there is extreme discomfort but no shame in the condemnation of the law  the law represents that modicum of morality which can be squeezed out of the ruck of mankind but what is that to me who aim higher and seek to be my own more stringent judge  i observe with pleasure that no brave man has ever given a rush for such considerations  the japanese have a nobler and more sentimental feeling for this social bond into which we all are born when we come into the world and whose comforts and protection we all indifferently share throughout our lives—but even to them no more than to our western saints and heroes does the law of the state supersede the higher law of duty  without hesitation and without remorse they transgress the stiffest enactments rather than abstain from doing right  but the accidental superior duty being thus fulfilled they at once return in allegiance to the common duty of all citizens and hasten to denounce themselves and value at an equal rate their just crime and their equally just submission to its punishment  the evading of the police will not long satisfy an active conscience or a thoughtful head  but to show you how one or the other may trouble a man and what a vast extent of frontier is left unridden by this invaluable eighth commandment let me tell you a few pages out of a young man’s life  he was a friend of mine a young man like others generous flighty as variable as youth itself but always with some high motions and on the search for higher thoughts of life  i should tell you at once that he thoroughly agrees with the eighth commandment  but he got hold of some unsettling works the new testament among others and this loosened his views of life and led him into many perplexities  as he was the son of a man in a certain position and well off my friend had enjoyed from the first the advantages of education nay he had been kept alive through a sickly childhood by constant watchfulness comforts and change of air for all of which he was indebted to his father’s wealth  at college he met other lads more diligent than himself who followed the plough in summertime to pay their college fees in winter and this inequality struck him with some force  he was at that age of a conversible temper and insatiably curious in the aspects of life and he spent much of his time scraping acquaintance with all classes of man and womankind  in this way he came upon many depressed ambitions and many intelligences stunted for want of opportunity and this also struck him he began to perceive that life was a handicap upon strange wrongsided principles and not as he had been told a fair and equal race  he began to tremble that he himself had been unjustly favoured when he saw all the avenues of wealth and power and comfort closed against so many of his superiors and equals and held unwearyingly open before so idle so desultory and so dissolute a being as himself  there sat a youth beside him on the college benches who had only one shirt to his back and at intervals sufficiently far apart must stay at home to have it washed  it was my friend’s principle to stay away as often as he dared for i fear he was no friend to learning  but there was something that came home to him sharply in this fellow who had to give over study till his shirt was washed and the scores of others who had never an opportunity at all  if one of these could take his place he thought and the thought tore away a bandage from his eyes  he was eaten by the shame of his discoveries and despised himself as an unworthy favourite and a creature of the backstairs of fortune  he could no longer see without confusion one of these brave young fellows battling uphill against adversity  had he not filched that fellow’s birthright  at best was he not coldly profiting by the injustice of society and greedily devouring stolen goods  the money indeed belonged to his father who had worked and thought and given up his liberty to earn it but by what justice could the money belong to my friend who had as yet done nothing but help to squander it  a more sturdy honesty joined to a more even and impartial temperament would have drawn from these considerations a new force of industry that this equivocal position might be brought as swiftly as possible to an end and some good services to mankind justify the appropriation of expense  it was not so with my friend who was only unsettled and discouraged and filled full of that trumpeting anger with which young men regard injustices in the first blush of youth although in a few years they will tamely acquiesce in their existence and knowingly profit by their complications  yet all this while he suffered many indignant pangs  and once when he put on his boots like any other unripe donkey to run away from home it was his best consolation that he was now at a single plunge to free himself from the responsibility of this wealth that was not his and do battle equally against his fellows in the warfare of life  some time after this falling into illhealth he was sent at great expense to a more favourable climate and then i think his perplexities were thickest  when he thought of all the other young men of singular promise upright good the prop of families who must remain at home to die and with all their possibilities be lost to life and mankind and how he by one more unmerited favour was chosen out from all these others to survive he felt as if there were no life no labour no devotion of soul and body that could repay and justify these partialities  a religious lady to whom he communicated these reflections could see no force in them whatever  ‘it was god’s will’ said she  but he knew it was by god’s will that joan of arc was burnt at rouen which cleared neither bedford nor bishop cauchon and again by god’s will that christ was crucified outside jerusalem which excused neither the rancour of the priests nor the timidity of pilate  he knew moreover that although the possibility of this favour he was now enjoying issued from his circumstances its acceptance was the act of his own will and he had accepted it greedily longing for rest and sunshine and hence this allegation of god’s providence did little to relieve his scruples  i promise you he had a very troubled mind  and i would not laugh if i were you though while he was thus making mountains out of what you think molehills he were still as perhaps he was contentedly practising many other things that to you seem black as hell  every man is his own judge and mountainguide through life  there is an old story of a mote and a beam apparently not true but worthy perhaps of some consideration  i should if i were you give some consideration to these scruples of his and if i were he i should do the like by yours for it is not unlikely that there may be something under both  in the meantime you must hear how my friend acted  like many invalids he supposed that he would die  now should he die he saw no means of repaying this huge loan which by the hands of his father mankind had advanced him for his sickness  in that case it would be lost money  so he determined that the advance should be as small as possible and so long as he continued to doubt his recovery lived in an upper room and grudged himself all but necessaries  but so soon as he began to perceive a change for the better he felt justified in spending more freely to speed and brighten his return to health and trusted in the future to lend a help to mankind as mankind out of its treasury had lent a help to him  i do not say but that my friend was a little too curious and partial in his view nor thought too much of himself and too little of his parents but i do say that here are some scruples which tormented my friend in his youth and still perhaps at odd times give him a prick in the midst of his enjoyments and which after all have some foundation in justice and point in their confused way to some more honourable honesty within the reach of man  and at least is not this an unusual gloss upon the eighth commandment  and what sort of comfort guidance or illumination did that precept afford my friend throughout these contentions  ‘thou shalt not steal’  with all my heart  but am i stealing  the truly quaint materialism of our view of life disables us from pursuing any transaction to an end  you can make no one understand that his bargain is anything more than a bargain whereas in point of fact it is a link in the policy of mankind and either a good or an evil to the world  we have a sort of blindness which prevents us from seeing anything but sovereigns  if one man agrees to give another so many shillings for so many hours’ work and then wilfully gives him a certain proportion of the price in bad money and only the remainder in good we can see with half an eye that this man is a thief  but if the other spends a certain proportion of the hours in smoking a pipe of tobacco and a certain other proportion in looking at the sky or the clock or trying to recall an air or in meditation on his own past adventures and only the remainder in downright work such as he is paid to do is he because the theft is one of time and not of money—is he any the less a thief  the one gave a bad shilling the other an imperfect hour but both broke the bargain and each is a thief  in piecework which is what most of us do the case is none the less plain for being even less material  if you forge a bad knife you have wasted some of mankind’s iron and then with unrivalled cynicism you pocket some of mankind’s money for your trouble  is there any man so blind who cannot see that this is theft  again if you carelessly cultivate a farm you have been playing fast and loose with mankind’s resources against hunger there will be less bread in consequence and for lack of that bread somebody will die next winter a grim consideration  and you must not hope to shuffle out of blame because you got less money for your less quantity of bread for although a theft be partly punished it is none the less a theft for that  you took the farm against competitors there were others ready to shoulder the responsibility and be answerable for the tale of loaves but it was you who took it  by the act you came under a tacit bargain with mankind to cultivate that farm with your best endeavour you were under no superintendence you were on parole and you have broke your bargain and to all who look closely and yourself among the rest if you have moral eyesight you are a thief  or take the case of men of letters  every piece of work which is not as good as you can make it which you have palmed off imperfect meagrely thought niggardly in execution upon mankind who is your paymaster on parole and in a sense your pupil every hasty or slovenly or untrue performance should rise up against you in the court of your own heart and condemn you for a thief have you a salary  if you trifle with your health and so render yourself less capable for duty and still touch and still greedily pocket the emolument—what are you but a thief  have you double accounts do you by any timehonoured juggle deceit or ambiguous process gain more from those who deal with you than it you were bargaining and dealing face to face in front of god—what are you but a thief  lastly if you fill an office or produce an article which in your heart of hearts you think a delusion and a fraud upon mankind and still draw your salary and go through the sham manœuvres of this office or still book your profits and keep on flooding the world with these injurious goods—though you were old and bald and the first at church and a baronet what are you but a thief  these may seem hard words and mere curiosities of the intellect in an age when the spirit of honesty is so sparingly cultivated that all business is conducted upon lies and socalled customs of the trade that not a man bestows two thoughts on the utility or honourableness of his pursuit  i would say less if i thought less  but looking to my own reason and the right of things i can only avow that i am a thief myself and that i passionately suspect my neighbours of the same guilt  where did you hear that it was easy to be honest  do you find that in your bible  easy  it is easy to be an ass and follow the multitude like a blind besotted bull in a stampede and that i am well aware is what you and mrs grundy mean by being honest  but it will not bear the stress of time nor the scrutiny of conscience  even before the lowest of all tribunals—before a court of law whose business it is not to keep men right or within a thousand miles of right but to withhold them from going so tragically wrong that they will pull down the whole jointed fabric of society by their misdeeds—even before a court of law as we begin to see in these last days our easy view of following at each other’s tails alike to good and evil is beginning to be reproved and punished and declared no honesty at all but open theft and swindling and simpletons who have gone on through life with a quiet conscience may learn suddenly from the lips of a judge that the custom of the trade may be a custom of the devil  you thought it was easy to be honest  did you think it was easy to be just and kind and truthful  did you think the whole duty of aspiring man was as simple as a hornpipe and you could walk through life like a gentleman and a hero with no more concern than it takes to go to church or to address a circular  and yet all this time you had the eighth commandment and what makes it richer you would not have broken it for the world  the truth is that these commandments by themselves are of little use in private judgment  if compression is what you want you have their whole spirit compressed into the golden rule and yet there expressed with more significance since the law is there spiritually and not materially stated  and in truth four out of these ten commands from the sixth to the ninth are rather legal than ethical  the policecourt is their proper home  a magistrate cannot tell whether you love your neighbour as yourself but he can tell more or less whether you have murdered or stolen or committed adultery or held up your hand and testified to that which was not and these things for rough practical tests are as good as can be found  and perhaps therefore the best condensation of the jewish moral law is in the maxims of the priests ‘neminem lædere’ and ‘suum cuique tribuere’  but all this granted it becomes only the more plain that they are inadequate in the sphere of personal morality that while they tell the magistrate roughly when to punish they can never direct an anxious sinner what to do  only polonius or the like solemn sort of ass can offer us a succinct proverb by way of advice and not burst out blushing in our faces  we grant them one and all and for all that they are worth it is something above and beyond that we desire  christ was in general a great enemy to such a way of teaching we rarely find him meddling with any of these plump commands but it was to open them out and lift his hearers from the letter to the spirit  for morals are a personal affair in the war of righteousness every man fights for his own hand all the six hundred precepts of the mishna cannot shake my private judgment my magistracy of myself is an indefeasible charge and my decisions absolute for the time and case  the moralist is not a judge of appeal but an advocate who pleads at my tribunal  he has to show not the law but that the law applies  can he convince me then he gains the cause  and thus you find christ giving various counsels to varying people and often jealously careful to avoid definite precept  is he asked for example to divide a heritage  he refuses and the best advice that he will offer is but a paraphrase of that tenth commandment which figures so strangely among the rest  take heed and beware of covetousness  if you complain that this is vague i have failed to carry you along with me in my argument for no definite precept can be more than an illustration though its truth were resplendent like the sun and it was announced from heaven by the voice of god  and life is so intricate and changing that perhaps not twenty times or perhaps not twice in the ages shall we find that nice consent of circumstances to which alone it can apply    chapter iii   although the world and life have in a sense become commonplace to our experience it is but in an external torpor the true sentiment slumbers within us and we have but to reflect on ourselves or our surroundings to rekindle our astonishment  no length of habit can blunt our first surprise  of the world i have but little to say in this connection a few strokes shall suffice  we inhabit a dead ember swimming wide in the blank of space dizzily spinning as it swims and lighted up from several million miles away by a more horrible hellfire than was ever conceived by the theological imagination  yet the dead ember is a green commodious dwellingplace and the reverberation of this hellfire ripens flower and fruit and mildly warms us on summer eves upon the lawn  far off on all hands other dead embers other flaming suns wheel and race in the apparent void the nearest is out of call the farthest so far that the heart sickens in the effort to conceive the distance  shipwrecked seamen on the deep though they bestride but the truncheon of a boom are safe and near at home compared with mankind on its bullet  even to us who have known no other it seems a strange if not an appalling place of residence  but far stranger is the resident man a creature compact of wonders that after centuries of custom is still wonderful to himself  he inhabits a body which he is continually outliving discarding and renewing  food and sleep by an unknown alchemy restore his spirits and the freshness of his countenance  hair grows on him like grass his eyes his brain his sinews thirst for action he joys to see and touch and hear to partake the sun and wind to sit down and intently ponder on his astonishing attributes and situation to rise up and run to perform the strange and revolting round of physical functions  the sight of a flower the note of a bird will often move him deeply yet he looks unconcerned on the impassable distances and portentous bonfires of the universe  he comprehends he designs he tames nature rides the sea ploughs climbs the air in a balloon makes vast inquiries begins interminable labours joins himself into federations and populous cities spends his days to deliver the ends of the earth or to benefit unborn posterity and yet knows himself for a piece of unsurpassed fragility and the creature of a few days  his sight which conducts him which takes notice of the farthest stars which is miraculous in every way and a thing defying explanation or belief is yet lodged in a piece of jelly and can be extinguished with a touch  his heart which all through life so indomitably so athletically labours is but a capsule and may be stopped with a pin  his whole body for all its savage energies its leaping and its winged desires may yet be tamed and conquered by a draught of air or a sprinkling of cold dew  what he calls death which is the seeming arrest of everything and the ruin and hateful transformation of the visible body lies in wait for him outwardly in a thousand accidents and grows up in secret diseases from within  he is still learning to be a man when his faculties are already beginning to decline he has not yet understood himself or his position before he inevitably dies  and yet this mad chimerical creature can take no thought of his last end lives as though he were eternal plunges with his vulnerable body into the shock of war and daily affronts death with unconcern  he cannot take a step without pain or pleasure  his life is a tissue of sensations which he distinguishes as they seem to come more directly from himself or his surroundings  he is conscious of himself as a joyer or a sufferer as that which craves chooses and is satisfied conscious of his surroundings as it were of an inexhaustible purveyor the source of aspects inspirations wonders cruel knocks and transporting caresses  thus he goes on his way stumbling among delights and agonies  matter is a farfetched theory and materialism is without a root in man to him everything is important in the degree to which it moves him  the telegraph wires and posts the electricity speeding from clerk to clerk the clerks the glad or sorrowful import of the message and the paper on which it is finally brought to him at home are all equally facts all equally exist for man  a word or a thought can wound him as acutely as a knife of steel  if he thinks he is loved he will rise up and glory to himself although he be in a distant land and short of necessary bread does he think he is not loved—he may have the woman at his beck and there is not a joy for him in all the world  indeed if we are to make any account of this figment of reason the distinction between material and immaterial we shall conclude that the life of each man as an individual is immaterial although the continuation and prospects of mankind as a race turn upon material conditions  the physical business of each man’s body is transacted for him like a sybarite he has attentive valets in his own viscera he breathes he sweats he digests without an effort or so much as a consenting volition for the most part he even eats not with a wakeful consciousness but as it were between two thoughts  his life is centred among other and more important considerations touch him in his honour or his love creatures of the imagination which attach him to mankind or to an individual man or woman cross him in his piety which connects his soul with heaven and he turns from his food he loathes his breath and with a magnanimous emotion cuts the knots of his existence and frees himself at a blow from the web of pains and pleasures  it follows that man is twofold at least that he is not a rounded and autonomous empire but that in the same body with him there dwell other powers tributary but independent  if i now behold one walking in a garden curiously coloured and illuminated by the sun digesting his food with elaborate chemistry breathing circulating blood directing himself by the sight of his eyes accommodating his body by a thousand delicate balancings to the wind and the uneven surface of the path and all the time perhaps with his mind engaged about america or the dogstar or the attributes of god—what am i to say or how am i to describe the thing i see  is that truly a man in the rigorous meaning of the word or is it not a man and something else  what then are we to count the centrebit and axle of a being so variously compounded  it is a question much debated  some read his history in a certain intricacy of nerve and the success of successive digestions others find him an exiled piece of heaven blown upon and determined by the breath of god and both schools of theorists will scream like scalded children at a word of doubt  yet either of these views however plausible is beside the question either may be right and i care not i ask a more particular answer and to a more immediate point  what is the man  there is something that was before hunger and that remains behind after a meal  it may or may not be engaged in any given act or passion but when it is it changes heightens and sanctifies  thus it is not engaged in lust where satisfaction ends the chapter and it is engaged in love where no satisfaction can blunt the edge of the desire and where age sickness or alienation may deface what was desirable without diminishing the sentiment  this something which is the man is a permanence which abides through the vicissitudes of passion now overwhelmed and now triumphant now unconscious of itself in the immediate distress of appetite or pain now rising unclouded above all  so to the man his own central self fades and grows clear again amid the tumult of the senses like a revolving pharos in the night  it is forgotten it is hid it seems for ever and yet in the next calm hour he shall behold himself once more shining and unmoved among changes and storm  mankind in the sense of the creeping mass that is born and eats that generates and dies is but the aggregate of the outer and lower sides of man  this inner consciousness this lantern alternately obscured and shining to and by which the individual exists and must order his conduct is something special to himself and not common to the race  his joys delight his sorrows wound him according as this is interested or indifferent in the affair according as they arise in an imperial war or in a broil conducted by the tributary chieftains of the mind  he may lose all and this not suffer he may lose what is materially a trifle and this leap in his bosom with a cruel pang  i do not speak of it to hardened theorists the living man knows keenly what it is i mean  ‘perceive at last that thou hast in thee something better and more divine than the things which cause the various effects and as it were pull thee by the strings  what is that now in thy mind is it fear or suspicion or desire or anything of that kind’  thus far marcus aurelius in one of the most notable passages in any book  here is a question worthy to be answered  what is in thy mind  what is the utterance of your inmost self when in a quiet hour it can be heard intelligibly  it is something beyond the compass of your thinking inasmuch as it is yourself but is it not of a higher spirit than you had dreamed betweenwhiles and erect above all base considerations  this soul seems hardly touched with our infirmities we can find in it certainly no fear suspicion or desire we are only conscious—and that as though we read it in the eyes of some one else—of a great and unqualified readiness  a readiness to what to pass over and look beyond the objects of desire and fear for something else  and this something else this something which is apart from desire and fear to which all the kingdoms of the world and the immediate death of the body are alike indifferent and beside the point and which yet regards conduct—by what name are we to call it  it may be the love of god or it may be an inherited and certainly well concealed instinct to preserve self and propagate the race i am not for the moment averse to either theory but it will save time to call it righteousness  by so doing i intend no subterfuge to beg a question i am indeed ready and more than willing to accept the rigid consequence and lay aside as far as the treachery of the reason will permit all former meanings attached to the word righteousness  what is right is that for which a man’s central self is ever ready to sacrifice immediate or distant interests what is wrong is what the central self discards or rejects as incompatible with the fixed design of righteousness  to make this admission is to lay aside all hope of definition  that which is right upon this theory is intimately dictated to each man by himself but can never be rigorously set forth in language and never above all imposed upon another  the conscience has then a vision like that of the eyes which is incommunicable and for the most part illuminates none but its possessor  when many people perceive the same or any cognate facts they agree upon a word as symbol and hence we have such words as tree star love honour or death hence also we have this word right which like the others we all understand most of us understand differently and none can express succinctly otherwise yet even on the straitest view we can make some steps towards comprehension of our own superior thoughts  for it is an incredible and most bewildering fact that a man through life is on variable terms with himself he is aware of tiffs and reconciliations the intimacy is at times almost suspended at times it is renewed again with joy  as we said before his inner self or soul appears to him by successive revelations and is frequently obscured  it is from a study of these alternations that we can alone hope to discover even dimly what seems right and what seems wrong to this veiled prophet of ourself  all that is in the man in the larger sense what we call impression as well as what we call intuition so far as my argument looks we must accept  it is not wrong to desire food or exercise or beautiful surroundings or the love of sex or interest which is the food of the mind  all these are craved all these should be craved to none of these in itself does the soul demur where there comes an undeniable want we recognise a demand of nature  yet we know that these natural demands may be superseded for the demands which are common to mankind make but a shadowy consideration in comparison to the demands of the individual soul  food is almost the first prerequisite and yet a high character will go without food to the ruin and death of the body rather than gain it in a manner which the spirit disavows  pascal laid aside mathematics origen doctored his body with a knife every day some one is thus mortifying his dearest interests and desires and in christ’s words entering maim into the kingdom of heaven  this is to supersede the lesser and less harmonious affections by renunciation and though by this ascetic path we may get to heaven we cannot get thither a whole and perfect man  but there is another way to supersede them by reconciliation in which the soul and all the faculties and senses pursue a common route and share in one desire  thus man is tormented by a very imperious physical desire it spoils his rest it is not to be denied the doctors will tell you not i how it is a physical need like the want of food or slumber  in the satisfaction of this desire as it first appears the soul sparingly takes part nay it oft unsparingly regrets and disapproves the satisfaction  but let the man learn to love a woman as far as he is capable of love and for this random affection of the body there is substituted a steady determination a consent of all his powers and faculties which supersedes adopts and commands the other the desire survives strengthened perhaps but taught obedience and changed in scope and character  life is no longer a tale of betrayals and regrets for the man now lives as a whole his consciousness now moves on uninterrupted like a river through all the extremes and ups and downs of passion he remains approvingly conscious of himself  now to me this seems a type of that rightness which the soul demands it demands that we shall not live alternately with our opposing tendencies in continual seesaw of passion and disgust but seek some path on which the tendencies shall no longer oppose but serve each other to a common end  it demands that we shall not pursue broken ends but great and comprehensive purposes in which soul and body may unite like notes in a harmonious chord  that were indeed a way of peace and pleasure that were indeed a heaven upon earth  it does not demand however or to speak in measure it does not demand of me that i should starve my appetites for no purpose under heaven but as a purpose in itself or in a weak despair pluck out the eye that i have not yet learned to guide and enjoy with wisdom  the soul demands unity of purpose not the dismemberment of man it seeks to roll up all his strength and sweetness all his passion and wisdom into one and make of him a perfect man exulting in perfection  to conclude ascetically is to give up and not to solve the problem  the ascetic and the creeping hog although they are at different poles have equally failed in life the one has sacrificed his crew the other brings back his seamen in a cockboat and has lost the ship  i believe there are not many seacaptains who would plume themselves on either result as a success  but if it is righteousness thus to fuse together our divisive impulses and march with one mind through life there is plainly one thing more unrighteous than all others and one declension which is irretrievable and draws on the rest  and this is to lose consciousness of oneself  in the best of times it is but by flashes when our whole nature is clear strong and conscious and events conspire to leave us free that we enjoy communion with our soul  at the worst we are so fallen and passive that we may say shortly we have none  an arctic torpor seizes upon men although built of nerves and set adrift in a stimulating world they develop a tendency to go bodily to sleep consciousness becomes engrossed among the reflex and mechanical parts of life and soon loses both the will and power to look higher considerations in the face  this is ruin this is the last failure in life this is temporal damnation damnation on the spot and without the form of judgment  ‘what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose himself’  it is to keep a man awake to keep him alive to his own soul and its fixed design of righteousness that the better part of moral and religious education is directed not only that of words and doctors but the sharp ferule of calamity under which we are all god’s scholars till we die  if as teachers we are to say anything to the purpose we must say what will remind the pupil of his soul we must speak that soul’s dialect we must talk of life and conduct as his soul would have him think of them  if from some conformity between us and the pupil or perhaps among all men we do in truth speak in such a dialect and express such views beyond question we shall touch in him a spring beyond question he will recognise the dialect as one that he himself has spoken in his better hours beyond question he will cry ‘i had forgotten but now i remember i too have eyes and i had forgot to use them  i too have a soul of my own arrogantly upright and to that i will listen and conform’  in short say to him anything that he has once thought or been upon the point of thinking or show him any view of life that he has once clearly seen or been upon the point of clearly seeing and you have done your part and may leave him to complete the education for himself  now the view taught at the present time seems to me to want greatness and the dialect in which alone it can be intelligibly uttered is not the dialect of my soul  it is a sort of postponement of life nothing quite is but something different is to be we are to keep our eyes upon the indirect from the cradle to the grave  we are to regulate our conduct not by desire but by a politic eye upon the future and to value acts as they will bring us money or good opinion as they will bring us in one word profit  we must be what is called respectable and offend no one by our carriage it will not do to make oneself conspicuous—who knows even in virtue says the christian parent  and we must be what is called prudent and make money not only because it is pleasant to have money but because that also is a part of respectability and we cannot hope to be received in society without decent possessions  received in society as if that were the kingdom of heaven  there is dear mr soandso—look at him—so much respected—so much looked up to—quite the christian merchant  and we must cut our conduct as strictly as possible after the pattern of mr soandso and lay our whole lives to make money and be strictly decent  besides these holy injunctions which form by far the greater part of a youth’s training in our christian homes there are at least two other doctrines  we are to live just now as well as we can but scrape at last into heaven where we shall be good  we are to worry through the week in a lay disreputable way but to make matters square live a different life on sunday  the train of thought we have been following gives us a key to all these positions without stepping aside to justify them on their own ground it is because we have been disgusted fifty times with physical squalls and fifty times torn between conflicting impulses that we teach people this indirect and tactical procedure in life and to judge by remote consequences instead of the immediate face of things  the very desire to act as our own souls would have us coupled with a pathetic disbelief in ourselves moves us to follow the example of others perhaps who knows they may be on the right track and the more our patterns are in number the better seems the chance until if we be acting in concert with a whole civilised nation there are surely a majority of chances that we must be acting right  and again how true it is that we can never behave as we wish in this tormented sphere and can only aspire to different and more favourable circumstances in order to stand out and be ourselves wholly and rightly  and yet once more if in the hurry and pressure of affairs and passions you tend to nod and become drowsy here are twentyfour hours of sunday set apart for you to hold counsel with your soul and look around you on the possibilities of life  this is not of course all that is to be or even should be said for these doctrines  only in the course of this chapter the reader and i have agreed upon a few catchwords and been looking at morals on a certain system it was a pity to lose an opportunity of testing the catchwords and seeing whether by this system as well as by others current doctrines could show any probable justification  if the doctrines had come too badly out of the trial it would have condemned the system  our sight of the world is very narrow the mind but a pedestrian instrument there’s nothing new under the sun as solomon says except the man himself and though that changes the aspect of everything else yet he must see the same things as other people only from a different side  and now having admitted so much let us turn to criticism  if you teach a man to keep his eyes upon what others think of him unthinkingly to lead the life and hold the principles of the majority of his contemporaries you must discredit in his eyes the one authoritative voice of his own soul  he may be a docile citizen he will never be a man  it is ours on the other hand to disregard this babble and chattering of other men better and worse than we are and to walk straight before us by what light we have  they may be right but so before heaven are we  they may know but we know also and by that knowledge we must stand or fall  there is such a thing as loyalty to a man’s own better self and from those who have not that god help me how am i to look for loyalty to others  the most dull the most imbecile at a certain moment turn round at a certain point will hear no further argument but stand unflinching by their own dumb irrational sense of right  it is not only by steel or fire but through contempt and blame that the martyr fulfils the calling of his dear soul  be glad if you are not tried by such extremities  but although all the world ranged themselves in one line to tell you ‘this is wrong’ be you your own faithful vassal and the ambassador of god—throw down the glove and answer ‘this is right’  do you think you are only declaring yourself  perhaps in some dim way like a child who delivers a message not fully understood you are opening wider the straits of prejudice and preparing mankind for some truer and more spiritual grasp of truth perhaps as you stand forth for your own judgment you are covering a thousand weak ones with your body perhaps by this declaration alone you have avoided the guilt of false witness against humanity and the little ones unborn  it is good i believe to be respectable but much nobler to respect oneself and utter the voice of god  god if there be any god speaks daily in a new language by the tongues of men the thoughts and habits of each fresh generation and each newcoined spirit throw another light upon the universe and contain another commentary on the printed bibles every scruple every true dissent every glimpse of something new is a letter of god’s alphabet and though there is a grave responsibility for all who speak is there none for those who unrighteously keep silence and conform  is not that also to conceal and cloak god’s counsel  and how should we regard the man of science who suppressed all facts that would not tally with the orthodoxy of the hour  wrong  you are as surely wrong as the sun rose this morning round the revolving shoulder of the world  not truth but truthfulness is the good of your endeavour  for when will men receive that first part and prerequisite of truth that by the order of things by the greatness of the universe by the darkness and partiality of man’s experience by the inviolate secrecy of god kept close in his most open revelations every man is and to the end of the ages must be wrong  wrong to the universe wrong to mankind wrong to god  and yet in another sense and that plainer and nearer every man of men who wishes truly must be right  he is right to himself and in the measure of his sagacity and candour  that let him do in all sincerity and zeal not sparing a thought for contrary opinions that for what it is worth let him proclaim  be not afraid although he be wrong so also is the dead stuffed dagon he insults  for the voice of god whatever it is is not that stammering inept tradition which the people holds  these truths survive in travesty swamped in a world of spiritual darkness and confusion and what a few comprehend and faithfully hold the many in their dead jargon repeat degrade and misinterpret  so far of respectability what the covenanters used to call ‘rank conformity’ the deadliest gag and wet blanket that can be laid on men and now of profit  and this doctrine is perhaps the more redoubtable because it harms all sorts of men not only the heroic and selfreliant but the obedient cowlike squadrons  a man by this doctrine looks to consequences at the second or third or fiftieth turn  he chooses his end and for that with wily turns and through a great sea of tedium steers this mortal bark  there may be political wisdom in such a view but i am persuaded there can spring no great moral zeal  to look thus obliquely upon life is the very recipe for moral slumber  our intention and endeavour should be directed not on some vague end of money or applause which shall come to us by a ricochet in a month or a year or twenty years but on the act itself not on the approval of others but on the rightness of that act  at every instant at every step in life the point has to be decided our soul has to be saved heaven has to be gained or lost  at every step our spirits must applaud at every step we must set down the foot and sound the trumpet  ‘this have i done’ we must say ‘right or wrong this have i done in unfeigned honour of intention as to myself and god’  the profit of every act should be this that it was right for us to do it  any other profit than that if it involved a kingdom or the woman i love ought if i were god’s upright soldier to leave me untempted  it is the mark of what we call a righteous decision that it is made directly and for its own sake  the whole man mind and body having come to an agreement tyrannically dictates conduct  there are two dispositions eternally opposed that in which we recognise that one thing is wrong and another right and that in which not seeing any clear distinction we fall back on the consideration of consequences  the truth is by the scope of our present teaching nothing is thought very wrong and nothing very right except a few actions which have the disadvantage of being disrespectable when found out the more serious part of men inclining to think all things rather wrong the more jovial to suppose them right enough for practical purposes  i will engage my head they do not find that view in their own hearts they have taken it up in a dark despair they are but troubled sleepers talking in their sleep  the soul or my soul at least thinks very distinctly upon many points of right and wrong and often differs flatly with what is held out as the thought of corporate humanity in the code of society or the code of law  am i to suppose myself a monster  i have only to read books the christian gospels for example to think myself a monster no longer and instead i think the mass of people are merely speaking in their sleep  it is a commonplace enshrined if i mistake not even in school copybooks that honour is to be sought and not fame  i ask no other admission we are to seek honour upright walking with our own conscience every hour of the day and not fame the consequence the faroff reverberation of our footsteps  the walk not the rumour of the walk is what concerns righteousness  better disrespectable honour than dishonourable fame  better useless or seemingly hurtful honour than dishonour ruling empires and filling the mouths of thousands  for the man must walk by what he sees and leave the issue with god who made him and taught him by the fortune of his life  you would not dishonour yourself for money which is at least tangible would you do it then for a doubtful forecast in politics or another person’s theory in morals  so intricate is the scheme of our affairs that no man can calculate the bearing of his own behaviour even on those immediately around him how much less upon the world at large or on succeeding generations  to walk by external prudence and the rule of consequences would require not a man but god  all that we know to guide us in this changing labyrinth is our soul with its fixed design of righteousness and a few old precepts which commend themselves to that  the precepts are vague when we endeavour to apply them consequences are more entangled than a wisp of string and their confusion is unrestingly in change we must hold to what we know and walk by it  we must walk by faith indeed and not by knowledge  you do not love another because he is wealthy or wise or eminently respectable you love him because you love him that is love and any other only a derision and grimace  it should be the same with all our actions  if we were to conceive a perfect man it should be one who was never torn between conflicting impulses but who on the absolute consent of all his parts and faculties submitted in every action of his life to a selfdictation as absolute and unreasoned as that which bids him love one woman and be true to her till death  but we should not conceive him as sagacious ascetical playing off his appetites against each other turning the wing of public respectable immorality instead of riding it directly down or advancing toward his end through a thousand sinister compromises and considerations  the one man might be wily might be adroit might be wise might be respectable might be gloriously useful it is the other man who would be good  the soul asks honour and not fame to be upright not to be successful to be good not prosperous to be essentially not outwardly respectable  does your soul ask profit  does it ask money  does it ask the approval of the indifferent herd  i believe not  for my own part i want but little money i hope and i do not want to be decent at all but to be good    chapter iv   we have spoken of that supreme selfdictation which keeps varying from hour to hour in its dictates with the variation of events and circumstances  now for us that is ultimate  it may be founded on some reasonable process but it is not a process which we can follow or comprehend  and moreover the dictation is not continuous or not continuous except in very lively and wellliving natures and betweenwhiles we must brush along without it  practice is a more intricate and desperate business than the toughest theorising life is an affair of cavalry where rapid judgment and prompt action are alone possible and right  as a matter of fact there is no one so upright but he is influenced by the world’s chatter and no one so headlong but he requires to consider consequences and to keep an eye on profit  for the soul adopts all affections and appetites without exception and cares only to combine them for some common purpose which shall interest all now respect for the opinion of others the study of consequences and the desire of power and comfort are all undeniably factors in the nature of man and the more undeniably since we find that in our current doctrines they have swallowed up the others and are thought to conclude in themselves all the worthy parts of man  these then must also be suffered to affect conduct in the practical domain much or little according as they are forcibly or feebly present to the mind of each  now a man’s view of the universe is mostly a view of the civilised society in which he lives  other men and women are so much more grossly and so much more intimately palpable to his perceptions that they stand between him and all the rest they are larger to his eye than the sun he hears them more plainly than thunder with them by them and for them he must live and die  and hence the laws that affect his intercourse with his fellowmen although merely customary and the creatures of a generation are more clearly and continually before his mind than those which bind him into the eternal system of things support him in his upright progress on this whirling ball or keep up the fire of his bodily life  and hence it is that money stands in the first rank of considerations and so powerfully affects the choice  for our society is built with money for mortar money is present in every joint of circumstance it might be named the social atmosphere since in society it is by that alone that men continue to live and only through that or chance that they can reach or affect one another  money gives us food shelter and privacy it permits us to be clean in person opens for us the doors of the theatre gains us books for study or pleasure enables us to help the distresses of others and puts us above necessity so that we can choose the best in life  if we love it enables us to meet and live with the loved one or even to prolong her health and life if we have scruples it gives us an opportunity to be honest if we have any bright designs here is what will smooth the way to their accomplishment penury is the worst slavery and will soon lead to death  but money is only a means it presupposes a man to use it  the rich can go where he pleases but perhaps please himself nowhere  he can buy a library or visit the whole world but perhaps has neither patience to read nor intelligence to see  the table may be loaded and the appetite wanting the purse may be full and the heart empty  he may have gained the world and lost himself and with all his wealth around him in a great house and spacious and beautiful demesne he may live as blank a life as any tattered ditcher  without an appetite without an aspiration void of appreciation bankrupt of desire and hope there in his great house let him sit and look upon his fingers  it is perhaps a more fortunate destiny to have a taste for collecting shells than to be born a millionaire  although neither is to be despised it is always better policy to learn an interest than to make a thousand pounds for the money will soon be spent or perhaps you may feel no joy in spending it but the interest remains imperishable and ever new  to become a botanist a geologist a social philosopher an antiquary or an artist is to enlarge one’s possessions in the universe by an incalculably higher degree and by a far surer sort of property than to purchase a farm of many acres  you had perhaps two thousand a year before the transaction perhaps you have two thousand five hundred after it  that represents your gain in the one case  but in the other you have thrown down a barrier which concealed significance and beauty  the blind man has learned to see  the prisoner has opened up a window in his cell and beholds enchanting prospects he will never again be a prisoner as he was he can watch clouds and changing seasons ships on the river travellers on the road and the stars at night happy prisoner his eyes have broken jail  and again he who has learned to love an art or science has wisely laid up riches against the day of riches if prosperity come he will not enter poor into his inheritance he will not slumber and forget himself in the lap of money or spend his hours in counting idle treasures but be up and briskly doing he will have the true alchemic touch which is not that of midas but which transmutes dead money into living delight and satisfaction  Être et pas avoir—to be not to possess—that is the problem of life  to be wealthy a rich nature is the first requisite and money but the second  to be of a quick and healthy blood to share in all honourable curiosities to be rich in admiration and free from envy to rejoice greatly in the good of others to love with such generosity of heart that your love is still a dear possession in absence or unkindness—these are the gifts of fortune which money cannot buy and without which money can buy nothing  for what can a man possess or what can he enjoy except himself  if he enlarge his nature it is then that he enlarges his estates  if his nature be happy and valiant he will enjoy the universe as if it were his park and orchard  but money is not only to be spent it has also to be earned  it is not merely a convenience or a necessary in social life but it is the coin in which mankind pays his wages to the individual man  and from this side the question of money has a very different scope and application  for no man can be honest who does not work  service for service  if the farmer buys corn and the labourer ploughs and reaps and the baker sweats in his hot bakery plainly you who eat must do something in your turn  it is not enough to take off your hat or to thank god upon your knees for the admirable constitution of society and your own convenient situation in its upper and more ornamental stories  neither is it enough to buy the loaf with a sixpence for then you are only changing the point of the inquiry and you must first have bought the sixpence  service for service how have you bought your sixpences  a man of spirit desires certainty in a thing of such a nature he must see to it that there is some reciprocity between him and mankind that he pays his expenditure in service that he has not a lion’s share in profit and a drone’s in labour and is not a sleeping partner and mere costly incubus on the great mercantile concern of mankind  services differ so widely with different gifts and some are so inappreciable to external tests that this is not only a matter for the private conscience but one which even there must be leniently and trustfully considered  for remember how many serve mankind who do no more than meditate and how many are precious to their friends for no more than a sweet and joyous temper  to perform the function of a man of letters it is not necessary to write nay it is perhaps better to be a living book  so long as we love we serve so long as we are loved by others i would almost say that we are indispensable and no man is useless while he has a friend  the true services of life are inestimable in money and are never paid  kind words and caresses high and wise thoughts humane designs tender behaviour to the weak and suffering and all the charities of man’s existence are neither bought nor sold  yet the dearest and readiest if not the most just criterion of a man’s services is the wage that mankind pays him or briefly what he earns there at least there can be no ambiguity  st paul is fully and freely entitled to his earnings as a tentmaker and socrates fully and freely entitled to his earnings as a sculptor although the true business of each was not only something different but something which remained unpaid  a man cannot forget that he is not superintended and serves mankind on parole  he would like when challenged by his own conscience to reply ‘i have done so much work and no less with my own hands and brain and taken so much profit and no more for my own personal delight’  and though st paul if he had possessed a private fortune would probably have scorned to waste his time in making tents yet of all sacrifices to public opinion none can be more easily pardoned than that by which a man already spiritually useful to the world should restrict the field of his chief usefulness to perform services more apparent and possess a livelihood that neither stupidity nor malice could call in question  like all sacrifices to public opinion and mere external decency this would certainly be wrong for the soul should rest contented with its own approval and indissuadably pursue its own calling yet so grave and delicate is the question that a man may well hesitate before he decides it for himself he may well fear that he sets too high a valuation on his own endeavours after good he may well condescend upon a humbler duty where others than himself shall judge the service and proportion the wage  and yet it is to this very responsibility that the rich are born  they can shuffle off the duty on no other they are their own paymasters on parole and must pay themselves fair wages and no more  for i suppose that in the course of ages and through reform and civil war and invasion mankind was pursuing some other and more general design than to set one or two englishmen of the nineteenth century beyond the reach of needs and duties  society was scarce put together and defended with so much eloquence and blood for the convenience of two or three millionaires and a few hundred other persons of wealth and position  it is plain that if mankind thus acted and suffered during all these generations they hoped some benefit some ease some wellbeing for themselves and their descendants that if they supported law and order it was to secure fairplay for all that if they denied themselves in the present they must have had some designs upon the future  now a great hereditary fortune is a miracle of man’s wisdom and mankind’s forbearance it has not only been amassed and handed down it has been suffered to be amassed and handed down and surely in such a consideration as this its possessor should find only a new spur to activity and honour that with all this power of service he should not prove unserviceable and that this mass of treasure should return in benefits upon the race  if he had twenty or thirty or a hundred thousand at his banker’s or if all yorkshire or all california were his to manage or to sell he would still be morally penniless and have the world to begin like whittington until he had found some way of serving mankind  his wage is physically in his own hand but in honour that wage must still be earned  he is only steward on parole of what is called his fortune  he must honourably perform his stewardship  he must estimate his own services and allow himself a salary in proportion for that will be one among his functions  and while he will then be free to spend that salary great or little on his own private pleasures the rest of his fortune he but holds and disposes under trust for mankind it is not his because he has not earned it it cannot be his because his services have already been paid but year by year it is his to distribute whether to help individuals whose birthright and outfit have been swallowed up in his or to further public works and institutions  at this rate short of inspiration it seems hardly possible to be both rich and honest and the millionaire is under a far more continuous temptation to thieve than the labourer who gets his shilling daily for despicable toils  are you surprised  it is even so  and you repeat it every sunday in your churches  ‘it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god’  i have heard this and similar texts ingeniously explained away and brushed from the path of the aspiring christian by the tender greatheart of the parish  one excellent clergyman told us that the ‘eye of a needle’ meant a low oriental postern through which camels could not pass till they were unloaded—which is very likely just and then went on bravely confounding the ‘kingdom of god’ with heaven the future paradise to show that of course no rich person could expect to carry his riches beyond the grave—which of course he could not and never did  various greedy sinners of the congregation drank in the comfortable doctrine with relief  it was worth the while having come to church that sunday morning  all was plain  the bible as usual meant nothing in particular it was merely an obscure and figurative schoolcopybook and if a man were only respectable he was a man after god’s own heart  alas i fear not  and though this matter of a man’s services is one for his own conscience there are some cases in which it is difficult to restrain the mind from judging  thus i shall be very easily persuaded that a man has earned his daily bread and if he has but a friend or two to whom his company is delightful at heart i am more than persuaded at once  but it will be very hard to persuade me that any one has earned an income of a hundred thousand  what he is to his friends he still would be if he were made penniless tomorrow for as to the courtiers of luxury and power i will neither consider them friends nor indeed consider them at all  what he does for mankind there are most likely hundreds who would do the same as effectually for the race and as pleasurably to themselves for the merest fraction of this monstrous wage  why it is paid i am therefore unable to conceive and as the man pays it himself out of funds in his detention i have a certain backwardness to think him honest  at least we have gained a very obvious point that what a man spends upon himself he shall have earned by services to the race  thence flows a principle for the outset of life which is a little different from that taught in the present day  i am addressing the middle and the upper classes those who have already been fostered and prepared for life at some expense those who have some choice before them and can pick professions and above all those who are what is called independent and need do nothing unless pushed by honour or ambition  in this particular the poor are happy among them when a lad comes to his strength he must take the work that offers and can take it with an easy conscience  but in the richer classes the question is complicated by the number of opportunities and a variety of considerations  here then this principle of ours comes in helpfully  the young man has to seek not a road to wealth but an opportunity of service not money but honest work  if he has some strong propensity some calling of nature some overweening interest in any special field of industry inquiry or art he will do right to obey the impulse and that for two reasons the first external because there he will render the best services the second personal because a demand of his own nature is to him without appeal whenever it can be satisfied with the consent of his other faculties and appetites  if he has no such elective taste by the very principle on which he chooses any pursuit at all he must choose the most honest and serviceable and not the most highly remunerated  we have here an external problem not from or to ourself but flowing from the constitution of society and we have our own soul with its fixed design of righteousness  all that can be done is to present the problem in proper terms and leave it to the soul of the individual  now the problem to the poor is one of necessity to earn wherewithal to live they must find remunerative labour  but the problem to the rich is one of honour having the wherewithal they must find serviceable labour each has to earn his daily bread the one because he has not yet got it to eat the other who has already eaten it because he has not yet earned it  of course what is true of bread is true of luxuries and comforts whether for the body or the mind  but the consideration of luxuries leads us to a new aspect of the whole question and to a second proposition no less true and maybe no less startling than the last  at the present day we of the easier classes are in a state of surfeit and disgrace after meat  plethora has filled us with indifference and we are covered from head to foot with the callosities of habitual opulence  born into what is called a certain rank we live as the saying is up to our station  we squander without enjoyment because our fathers squandered  we eat of the best not from delicacy but from brazen habit  we do not keenly enjoy or eagerly desire the presence of a luxury we are unaccustomed to its absence  and not only do we squander money from habit but still more pitifully waste it in ostentation  i can think of no more melancholy disgrace for a creature who professes either reason or pleasure for his guide than to spend the smallest fraction of his income upon that which he does not desire and to keep a carriage in which you do not wish to drive or a butler of whom you are afraid is a pathetic kind of folly  money being a means of happiness should make both parties happy when it changes hands rightly disposed it should be twice blessed in its employment and buyer and seller should alike have their twenty shillings worth of profit out of every pound benjamin franklin went through life an altered man because he once paid too dearly for a penny whistle  my concern springs usually from a deeper source to wit from having bought a whistle when i did not want one  i find i regret this or would regret it if i gave myself the time not only on personal but on moral and philanthropical considerations  for first in a world where money is wanting to buy books for eager students and food and medicine for pining children and where a large majority are starved in their most immediate desires it is surely base stupid and cruel to squander money when i am pushed by no appetite and enjoy no return of genuine satisfaction  my philanthropy is wide enough in scope to include myself and when i have made myself happy i have at least one good argument that i have acted rightly but where that is not so and i have bought and not enjoyed my mouth is closed and i conceive that i have robbed the poor  and second anything i buy or use which i do not sincerely want or cannot vividly enjoy disturbs the balance of supply and demand and contributes to remove industrious hands from the production of what is useful or pleasurable and to keep them busy upon ropes of sand and things that are a weariness to the flesh  that extravagance is truly sinful and a very silly sin to boot in which we impoverish mankind and ourselves  it is another question for each man’s heart  he knows if he can enjoy what he buys and uses if he cannot he is a dog in the manger nay it he cannot i contend he is a thief for nothing really belongs to a man which he cannot use  proprietor is connected with propriety and that only is the man’s which is proper to his wants and faculties  a youth in choosing a career must not be alarmed by poverty  want is a sore thing but poverty does not imply want  it remains to be seen whether with half his present income or a third he cannot in the most generous sense live as fully as at present  he is a fool who objects to luxuries but he is also a fool who does not protest against the waste of luxuries on those who do not desire and cannot enjoy them  it remains to be seen by each man who would live a true life to himself and not a merely specious life to society how many luxuries he truly wants and to how many he merely submits as to a social propriety and all these last he will immediately forswear  let him do this and he will be surprised to find how little money it requires to keep him in complete contentment and activity of mind and senses  life at any level among the easy classes is conceived upon a principle of rivalry where each man and each household must ape the tastes and emulate the display of others  one is delicate in eating another in wine a third in furniture or works of art or dress and i who care nothing for any of these refinements who am perhaps a plain athletic creature and love exercise beef beer flannel shirts and a camp bed am yet called upon to assimilate all these other tastes and make these foreign occasions of expenditure my own  it may be cynical i am sure i shall be told it is selfish but i will spend my money as i please and for my own intimate personal gratification and should count myself a nincompoop indeed to lay out the colour of a halfpenny on any fancied social decency or duty  i shall not wear gloves unless my hands are cold or unless i am born with a delight in them dress is my own affair and that of one other in the world that in fact and for an obvious reason of any woman who shall chance to be in love with me  i shall lodge where i have a mind  if i do not ask society to live with me they must be silent and even if i do they have no further right but to refuse the invitation  there is a kind of idea abroad that a man must live up to his station that his house his table and his toilette shall be in a ratio of equivalence and equally imposing to the world  if this is in the bible the passage has eluded my inquiries  if it is not in the bible it is nowhere but in the heart of the fool throw aside this fancy  see what you want and spend upon that distinguish what you do not care about and spend nothing upon that there are not many people who can differentiate wines above a certain and that not at all a high price  are you sure you are one of these  are you sure you prefer cigars at sixpence each to pipes at some fraction of a farthing  are you sure you wish to keep a gig  do you care about where you sleep or are you not as much at your ease in a cheap lodging as in an elizabethan manorhouse  do you enjoy fine clothes  it is not possible to answer these questions without a trial and there is nothing more obvious to my mind than that a man who has not experienced some ups and downs and been forced to live more cheaply than in his father’s house has still his education to begin  let the experiment be made and he will find to his surprise that he has been eating beyond his appetite up to that hour that the cheap lodging the cheap tobacco the rough country clothes the plain table have not only no power to damp his spirits but perhaps give him as keen pleasure in the using as the dainties that he took betwixt sleep and waking in his former callous and somnambulous submission to wealth  the true bohemian a creature lost to view under the imaginary bohemians of literature is exactly described by such a principle of life  the bohemian of the novel who drinks more than is good for him and prefers anything to work and wears strange clothes is for the most part a respectable bohemian respectable in disrespectability living for the outside and an adventurer  but the man i mean lives wholly to himself does what he wishes and not what is thought proper buys what he wants for himself and not what is thought proper works at what he believes he can do well and not what will bring him in money or favour  you may be the most respectable of men and yet a true bohemian  and the test is this a bohemian for as poor as he may be is always openhanded to his friends he knows what he can do with money and how he can do without it a far rarer and more useful knowledge he has had less and continued to live in some contentment and hence he cares not to keep more and shares his sovereign or his shilling with a friend  the poor if they are generous are bohemian in virtue of their birth  do you know where beggars go  not to the great houses where people sit dazed among their thousands but to the doors of poor men who have seen the world and it was the widow who had only two mites who cast half her fortune into the treasury  but a young man who elects to save on dress or on lodging or who in any way falls out of the level of expenditure which is common to his level in society falls out of society altogether  i suppose the young man to have chosen his career on honourable principles he finds his talents and instincts can be best contented in a certain pursuit in a certain industry he is sure that he is serving mankind with a healthy and becoming service and he is not sure that he would be doing so or doing so equally well in any other industry within his reach  then that is his true sphere in life not the one in which he was born to his father but the one which is proper to his talents and instincts  and suppose he does fall out of society is that a cause of sorrow  is your heart so dead that you prefer the recognition of many to the love of a few  do you think society loves you  put it to the proof  decline in material expenditure and you will find they care no more for you than for the khan of tartary  you will lose no friends  if you had any you will keep them  only those who were friends to your coat and equipage will disappear the smiling faces will disappear as by enchantment but the kind hearts will remain steadfastly kind  are you so lost are you so dead are you so little sure of your own soul and your own footing upon solid fact that you prefer before goodness and happiness the countenance of sundry dinersout who will flee from you at a report of ruin who will drop you with insult at a shadow of disgrace who do not know you and do not care to know you but by sight and whom you in your turn neither know nor care to know in a more human manner  is it not the principle of society openly avowed that friendship must not interfere with business which being paraphrased means simply that a consideration of money goes before any consideration of affection known to this coldblooded gang that they have not even the honour of thieves and will rook their nearest and dearest as readily as a stranger  i hope i would go as far as most to serve a friend but i declare openly i would not put on my hat to do a pleasure to society  i may starve my appetites and control my temper for the sake of those i love but society shall take me as i choose to be or go without me  neither they nor i will lose for where there is no love it is both laborious and unprofitable to associate  but it is obvious that if it is only right for a man to spend money on that which he can truly and thoroughly enjoy the doctrine applies with equal force to the rich and to the poor to the man who has amassed many thousands as well as to the youth precariously beginning life  and it may be asked is not this merely preparing misers who are not the best of company  but the principle was this that which a man has not fairly earned and further that which he cannot fully enjoy does not belong to him but is a part of mankind’s treasure which he holds as steward on parole  to mankind then it must be made profitable and how this should be done is once more a problem which each man must solve for himself and about which none has a right to judge him  yet there are a few considerations which are very obvious and may here be stated mankind is not only the whole in general but every one in particular every man or woman is one of mankind’s dear possessions to his or her just brain and kind heart and active hands mankind intrusts some of its hopes for the future he or she is a possible wellspring of good acts and source of blessings to the race  this money which you do not need which in a rigid sense you do not want may therefore be returned not only in public benefactions to the race but in private kindnesses your wife your children your friends stand nearest to you and should be helped the first  there at least there can be little imposture for you know their necessities of your own knowledge  and consider if all the world did as you did and according to their means extended help in the circle of their affections there would be no more crying want in times of plenty and no more cold mechanical charity given with a doubt and received with confusion  would not this simple rule make a new world out of the old and cruel one which we inhabit                                                  after two more sentences the fragment breaks off     father damien an open letter to the reverend dr hyde of honolulu                                                                      sydney                                                       february 25 1890  sir—it may probably occur to you that we have met and visited and conversed on my side with interest  you may remember that you have done me several courtesies for which i was prepared to be grateful  but there are duties which come before gratitude and offences which justly divide friends far more acquaintances  your letter to the reverend h b gage is a document which in my sight if you had filled me with bread when i was starving if you had sat up to nurse my father when he lay adying would yet absolve me from the bonds of gratitude  you know enough doubtless of the process of canonisation to be aware that a hundred years after the death of damien there will appear a man charged with the painful office of the devil’s advocate  after that noble brother of mine and of all frail clay shall have lain a century at rest one shall accuse one defend him  the circumstance is unusual that the devil’s advocate should be a volunteer should be a member of a sect immediately rival and should make haste to take upon himself his ugly office ere the bones are cold unusual and of a taste which i shall leave my readers free to qualify unusual and to me inspiring  if i have at all learned the trade of using words to convey truth and to arouse emotion you have at last furnished me with a subject  for it is in the interest of all mankind and the cause of public decency in every quarter of the world not only that damien should be righted but that you and your letter should be displayed at length in their true colours to the public eye  to do this properly i must begin by quoting you at large i shall then proceed to criticise your utterance from several points of view divine and human in the course of which i shall attempt to draw again and with more specification the character of the dead saint whom it has pleased you to vilify so much being done i shall say farewell to you for ever                                                                  ‘honolulu                                                         ‘august 2 1889      ‘rev h b gage      ‘dear brother—in answer to your inquiries about father damien i can     only reply that we who knew the man are surprised at the extravagant     newspaper laudations as if he was a most saintly philanthropist     the simple truth is he was a coarse dirty man headstrong and     bigoted  he was not sent to molokai but went there without orders     did not stay at the leper settlement before he became one himself     but circulated freely over the whole island less than half the     island is devoted to the lepers and he came often to honolulu  he     had no hand in the reforms and improvements inaugurated which were     the work of our board of health as occasion required and means were     provided  he was not a pure man in his relations with women and the     leprosy of which he died should be attributed to his vices and     carelessness  others have done much for the lepers our own     ministers the government physicians and so forth but never with     the catholic idea of meriting eternal life—yours etc                                                          ‘c m hyde’ 65  to deal fitly with a letter so extraordinary i must draw at the outset on my private knowledge of the signatory and his sect  it may offend others scarcely you who have been so busy to collect so bold to publish gossip on your rivals  and this is perhaps the moment when i may best explain to you the character of what you are to read i conceive you as a man quite beyond and below the reticences of civility with what measure you mete with that shall it be measured you again with you at last i rejoice to feel the button off the foil and to plunge home  and if in aught that i shall say i should offend others your colleagues whom i respect and remember with affection i can but offer them my regret i am not free i am inspired by the consideration of interests far more large and such pain as can be inflicted by anything from me must be indeed trifling when compared with the pain with which they read your letter  it is not the hangman but the criminal that brings dishonour on the house  you belong sir to a sect—i believe my sect and that in which my ancestors laboured—which has enjoyed and partly failed to utilise an exceptional advantage in the islands of hawaii  the first missionaries came they found the land already selfpurged of its old and bloody faith they were embraced almost on their arrival with enthusiasm what troubles they supported came far more from whites than from hawaiians and to these last they stood in a rough figure in the shoes of god this is not the place to enter into the degree or causes of their failure such as it is  one element alone is pertinent and must here be plainly dealt with  in the course of their evangelical calling they—or too many of them—grew rich  it may be news to you that the houses of missionaries are a cause of mocking on the streets of honolulu  it will at least be news to you that when i returned your civil visit the driver of my cab commented on the size the taste and the comfort of your home  it would have been news certainly to myself had any one told me that afternoon that i should live to drag such matter into print  but you see sir how you degrade better men to your own level and it is needful that those who are to judge betwixt you and me betwixt damien and the devil’s advocate should understand your letter to have been penned in a house which could raise and that very justly the envy and the comments of the passersby  i think to employ a phrase of yours which i admire it ‘should be attributed’ to you that you have never visited the scene of damien’s life and death  if you had and had recalled it and looked about your pleasant rooms even your pen perhaps would have been stayed  your sect and remember as far as any sect avows me it is mine has not done ill in a worldly sense in the hawaiian kingdom  when calamity befell their innocent parishioners when leprosy descended and took root in the eight islands a quid pro quo was to be looked for  to that prosperous mission and to you as one of its adornments god had sent at last an opportunity  i know i am touching here upon a nerve acutely sensitive  i know that others of your colleagues look back on the inertia of your church and the intrusive and decisive heroism of damien with something almost to be called remorse  i am sure it is so with yourself i am persuaded your letter was inspired by a certain envy not essentially ignoble and the one human trait to be espied in that performance  you were thinking of the lost chance the past day of that which should have been conceived and was not of the service due and not rendered  time was said the voice in your ear in your pleasant room as you sat raging and writing and if the words written were base beyond parallel the rage i am happy to repeat—it is the only compliment i shall pay you—the rage was almost virtuous  but sir when we have failed and another has succeeded when we have stood by and another has stepped in when we sit and grow bulky in our charming mansions and a plain uncouth peasant steps into the battle under the eyes of god and succours the afflicted and consoles the dying and is himself afflicted in his turn and dies upon the field of honour—the battle cannot be retrieved as your unhappy irritation has suggested  it is a lost battle and lost for ever  one thing remained to you in your defeat—some rags of common honour and these you have made haste to cast away  common honour not the honour of having done anything right but the honour of not having done aught conspicuously foul the honour of the inert that was what remained to you  we are not all expected to be damiens a man may conceive his duty more narrowly he may love his comforts better and none will cast a stone at him for that  but will a gentleman of your reverend profession allow me an example from the fields of gallantry  when two gentlemen compete for the favour of a lady and the one succeeds and the other is rejected and as will sometimes happen matter damaging to the successful rival’s credit reaches the ear of the defeated it is held by plain men of no pretensions that his mouth is in the circumstance almost necessarily closed  your church and damien’s were in hawaii upon a rivalry to do well to help to edify to set divine examples  you having in one huge instance failed and damien succeeded i marvel it should not have occurred to you that you were doomed to silence that when you had been outstripped in that high rivalry and sat inglorious in the midst of your wellbeing in your pleasant room—and damien crowned with glories and horrors toiled and rotted in that pigsty of his under the cliffs of kalawao—you the elect who would not were the last man on earth to collect and propagate gossip on the volunteer who would and did  i think i see you—for i try to see you in the flesh as i write these sentences—i think i see you leap at the word pigsty a hyperbolical expression at the best  ‘he had no hand in the reforms’ he was ‘a coarse dirty man’ these were your own words and you may think it possible that i am come to support you with fresh evidence  in a sense it is even so  damien has been too much depicted with a conventional halo and conventional features so drawn by men who perhaps had not the eye to remark or the pen to express the individual or who perhaps were only blinded and silenced by generous admiration such as i partly envy for myself—such as you if your soul were enlightened would envy on your bended knees  it is the least defect of such a method of portraiture that it makes the path easy for the devil’s advocate and leaves for the misuse of the slanderer a considerable field of truth  for the truth that is suppressed by friends is the readiest weapon of the enemy  the world in your despite may perhaps owe you something if your letter be the means of substituting once for all a credible likeness for a wax abstraction  for if that world at all remember you on the day when damien of molokai shall be named saint it will be in virtue of one work your letter to the reverend h b gage  you may ask on what authority i speak  it was my inclement destiny to become acquainted not with damien but with dr hyde  when i visited the lazaretto damien was already in his resting grave  but such information as i have i gathered on the spot in conversation with those who knew him well and long some indeed who revered his memory but others who had sparred and wrangled with him who beheld him with no halo who perhaps regarded him with small respect and through whose unprepared and scarcely partial communications the plain human features of the man shone on me convincingly  these gave me what knowledge i possess and i learnt it in that scene where it could be most completely and sensitively understood—kalawao which you have never visited about which you have never so much as endeavoured to inform yourself for brief as your letter is you have found the means to stumble into that confession  ‘less than onehalf of the island’ you say ‘is devoted to the lepers’  molokai—‘molokai ahina’ the ‘grey’ lofty and most desolate island—along all its northern side plunges a front of precipice into a sea of unusual profundity  this range of cliff is from east to west the true end and frontier of the island  only in one spot there projects into the ocean a certain triangular and rugged down grassy stony windy and rising in the midst into a hill with a dead crater the whole bearing to the cliff that overhangs it somewhat the same relation as a bracket to a wall  with this hint you will now be able to pick out the leper station on a map you will be able to judge how much of molokai is thus cut off between the surf and precipice whether less than a half or less than a quarter or a fifth or a tenth—or say a twentieth and the next time you burst into print you will be in a position to share with us the issue of your calculations  i imagine you to be one of those persons who talk with cheerfulness of that place which oxen and wainropes could not drag you to behold  you who do not even know its situation on the map probably denounce sensational descriptions stretching your limbs the while in your pleasant parlour on beretania street  when i was pulled ashore there one early morning there sat with me in the boat two sisters bidding farewell in humble imitation of damien to the lights and joys of human life  one of these wept silently i could not withhold myself from joining her  had you been there it is my belief that nature would have triumphed even in you and as the boat drew but a little nearer and you beheld the stairs crowded with abominable deformations of our common manhood and saw yourself landing in the midst of such a population as only now and then surrounds us in the horror of a nightmare—what a haggard eye you would have rolled over your reluctant shoulder towards the house on beretania street  had you gone on had you found every fourth face a blot upon the landscape had you visited the hospital and seen the buttends of human beings lying there almost unrecognisable but still breathing still thinking still remembering you would have understood that life in the lazaretto is an ordeal from which the nerves of a man’s spirit shrink even as his eye quails under the brightness of the sun you would have felt it was even today a pitiful place to visit and a hell to dwell in  it is not the fear of possible infection that seems a little thing when compared with the pain the pity and the disgust of the visitor’s surroundings and the atmosphere of affliction disease and physical disgrace in which he breathes  i do not think i am a man more than usually timid but i never recall the days and nights i spent upon that island promontory eight days and seven nights without heartfelt thankfulness that i am somewhere else  i find in my diary that i speak of my stay as a ‘grinding experience’ i have once jotted in the margin ‘harrowing is the word’ and when the mokolii bore me at last towards the outer world i kept repeating to myself with a new conception of their pregnancy those simple words of the song—      ‘’tis the most distressful country that ever yet was seen’  and observe that which i saw and suffered from was a settlement purged bettered beautified the new village built the hospital and the bishophome excellently arranged the sisters the doctor and the missionaries all indefatigable in their noble tasks  it was a different place when damien came there and made his great renunciation and slept that first night under a tree amidst his rotting brethren alone with pestilence and looking forward with what courage with what pitiful sinkings of dread god only knows to a lifetime of dressing sores and stumps  you will say perhaps i am too sensitive that sights as painful abound in cancer hospitals and are confronted daily by doctors and nurses  i have long learned to admire and envy the doctors and the nurses  but there is no cancer hospital so large and populous as kalawao and kalaupapa and in such a matter every fresh case like every inch of length in the pipe of an organ deepens the note of the impression for what daunts the onlooker is that monstrous sum of human suffering by which he stands surrounded  lastly no doctor or nurse is called upon to enter once for all the doors of that gehenna they do not say farewell they need not abandon hope on its sad threshold they but go for a time to their high calling and can look forward as they go to relief to recreation and to rest  but damien shutto with his own hand the doors of his own sepulchre  i shall now extract three passages from my diary at kalawao  a  ‘damien is dead and already somewhat ungratefully remembered in the field of his labours and sufferings  “he was a good man but very officious” says one  another tells me he had fallen as other priests so easily do into something of the ways and habits of thought of a kanaka but he had the wit to recognise the fact and the good sense to laugh at’ over ‘it  a plain man it seems he was i cannot find he was a popular’  b  ‘after ragsdale’s death’ ragsdale was a famous luna or overseer of the unruly settlement ‘there followed a brief term of office by father damien which served only to publish the weakness of that noble man  he was rough in his ways and he had no control  authority was relaxed damien’s life was threatened and he was soon eager to resign’  c  ‘of damien i begin to have an idea  he seems to have been a man of the peasant class certainly of the peasant type shrewd ignorant and bigoted yet with an open mind and capable of receiving and digesting a reproof if it were bluntly administered superbly generous in the least thing as well as in the greatest and as ready to give his last shirt although not without human grumbling as he had been to sacrifice his life essentially indiscreet and officious which made him a troublesome colleague domineering in all his ways which made him incurably unpopular with the kanakas but yet destitute of real authority so that his boys laughed at him and he must carry out his wishes by the means of bribes  he learned to have a mania for doctoring and set up the kanakas against the remedies of his regular rivals perhaps if anything matter at all in the treatment of such a disease the worst thing that he did and certainly the easiest  the best and worst of the man appear very plainly in his dealings with mr chapman’s money he had originally laid it out’ intended to lay it out ‘entirely for the benefit of catholics and even so not wisely but after a long plain talk he admitted his error fully and revised the list  the sad state of the boys’ home is in part the result of his lack of control in part of his own slovenly ways and false ideas of hygiene  brother officials used to call it “damien’s chinatown”  “well” they would say “your chinatown keeps growing” and he would laugh with perfect goodnature and adhere to his errors with perfect obstinacy  so much i have gathered of truth about this plain noble human brother and father of ours his imperfections are the traits of his face by which we know him for our fellow his martyrdom and his example nothing can lessen or annul and only a person here on the spot can properly appreciate their greatness’  i have set down these private passages as you perceive without correction thanks to you the public has them in their bluntness  they are almost a list of the man’s faults for it is rather these that i was seeking with his virtues with the heroic profile of his life i and the world were already sufficiently acquainted  i was besides a little suspicious of catholic testimony in no ill sense but merely because damien’s admirers and disciples were the least likely to be critical  i know you will be more suspicious still and the facts set down above were one and all collected from the lips of protestants who had opposed the father in his life  yet i am strangely deceived or they build up the image of a man with all his weaknesses essentially heroic and alive with rugged honesty generosity and mirth  take it for what it is rough private jottings of the worst sides of damien’s character collected from the lips of those who had laboured with and in your own phrase ‘knew the man’—though i question whether damien would have said that he knew you  take it and observe with wonder how well you were served by your gossips how ill by your intelligence and sympathy in how many points of fact we are at one and how widely our appreciations vary  there is something wrong here either with you or me  it is possible for instance that you who seem to have so many ears in kalawao had heard of the affair of mr chapman’s money and were singly struck by damien’s intended wrongdoing  i was struck with that also and set it fairly down but i was struck much more by the fact that he had the honesty of mind to be convinced  i may here tell you that it was a long business that one of his colleagues sat with him late into the night multiplying arguments and accusations that the father listened as usual with ‘perfect goodnature and perfect obstinacy’ but at the last when he was persuaded—‘yes’ said he ‘i am very much obliged to you you have done me a service it would have been a theft’  there are many not catholics merely who require their heroes and saints to be infallible to these the story will be painful not to the true lovers patrons and servants of mankind  and i take it this is a type of our division that you are one of those who have an eye for faults and failures that you take a pleasure to find and publish them and that having found them you make haste to forget the overvailing virtues and the real success which had alone introduced them to your knowledge  it is a dangerous frame of mind  that you may understand how dangerous and into what a situation it has already brought you we will if you please go handinhand through the different phrases of your letter and candidly examine each from the point of view of its truth its appositeness and its charity  damien was coarse  it is very possible  you make us sorry for the lepers who had only a coarse old peasant for their friend and father  but you who were so refined why were you not there to cheer them with the lights of culture  or may i remind you that we have some reason to doubt if john the baptist were genteel and in the case of peter on whose career you doubtless dwell approvingly in the pulpit no doubt at all he was a ‘coarse headstrong’ fisherman  yet even in our protestant bibles peter is called saint  damien was dirty  he was  think of the poor lepers annoyed with this dirty comrade  but the clean dr hyde was at his food in a fine house  damien was headstrong  i believe you are right again and i thank god for his strong head and heart  damien was bigoted  i am not fond of bigots myself because they are not fond of me  but what is meant by bigotry that we should regard it as a blemish in a priest  damien believed his own religion with the simplicity of a peasant or a child as i would i could suppose that you do  for this i wonder at him some way off and had that been his only character should have avoided him in life  but the point of interest in damien which has caused him to be so much talked about and made him at last the subject of your pen and mine was that in him his bigotry his intense and narrow faith wrought potently for good and strengthened him to be one of the world’s heroes and exemplars  damien was not sent to molokai but went there without orders  is this a misreading or do you really mean the words for blame  i have heard christ in the pulpits of our church held up for imitation on the ground that his sacrifice was voluntary  does dr hyde think otherwise  damien did not stay at the settlement etc  it is true he was allowed many indulgences  am i to understand that you blame the father for profiting by these or the officers for granting them  in either case it is a mighty spartan standard to issue from the house on beretania street and i am convinced you will find yourself with few supporters  damien had no hand in the reforms etc  i think even you will admit that i have already been frank in my description of the man i am defending but before i take you up upon this head i will be franker still and tell you that perhaps nowhere in the world can a man taste a more pleasurable sense of contrast than when he passes from damien’s ‘chinatown’ at kalawao to the beautiful bishophome at kalaupapa  at this point in my desire to make all fair for you i will break my rule and adduce catholic testimony  here is a passage from my diary about my visit to the chinatown from which you will see how it is even now regarded by its own officials ‘we went round all the dormitories refectories etc—dark and dingy enough with a superficial cleanliness which he’ mr dutton the laybrother ‘did not seek to defend  “it is almost decent” said he “the sisters will make that all right when we get them here”’  and yet i gathered it was already better since damien was dead and far better than when he was there alone and had his own not always excellent way  i have now come far enough to meet you on a common ground of fact and i tell you that to a mind not prejudiced by jealousy all the reforms of the lazaretto and even those which he most vigorously opposed are properly the work of damien  they are the evidence of his success they are what his heroism provoked from the reluctant and the careless  many were before him in the field mr meyer for instance of whose faithful work we hear too little there have been many since and some had more worldly wisdom though none had more devotion than our saint  before his day even you will confess they had effected little  it was his part by one striking act of martyrdom to direct all men’s eyes on that distressful country  at a blow and with the price of his life he made the place illustrious and public  and that if you will consider largely was the one reform needful pregnant of all that should succeed  it brought money it brought best individual addition of them all the sisters it brought supervision for public opinion and public interest landed with the man at kalawao  if ever any man brought reforms and died to bring them it was he  there is not a clean cup or towel in the bishophome but dirty damien washed it  damien was not a pure man in his relations with women etc  how do you know that  is this the nature of the conversation in that house on beretania street which the cabman envied driving past—racy details of the misconduct of the poor peasant priest toiling under the cliffs of molokai  many have visited the station before me they seem not to have heard the rumour  when i was there i heard many shocking tales for my informants were men speaking with the plainness of the laity and i heard plenty of complaints of damien  why was this never mentioned and how came it to you in the retirement of your clerical parlour  but i must not even seem to deceive you  this scandal when i read it in your letter was not new to me  i had heard it once before and i must tell you how  there came to samoa a man from honolulu he in a publichouse on the beach volunteered the statement that damien had ‘contracted the disease from having connection with the female lepers’ and i find a joy in telling you how the report was welcomed in a publichouse  a man sprang to his feet i am not at liberty to give his name but from what i heard i doubt if you would care to have him to dinner in beretania street  ‘you miserable little—’ here is a word i dare not print it would so shock your ears  ‘you miserable little—’ he cried ‘if the story were a thousand times true can’t you see you are a million times a lower—for daring to repeat it’  i wish it could be told of you that when the report reached you in your house perhaps after family worship you had found in your soul enough holy anger to receive it with the same expressions ay even with that one which i dare not print it would not need to have been blotted away like uncle toby’s oath by the tears of the recording angel it would have been counted to you for your brightest righteousness  but you have deliberately chosen the part of the man from honolulu and you have played it with improvements of your own  the man from honolulu—miserable leering creature—communicated the tale to a rude knot of beachcombing drinkers in a publichouse where i will so far agree with your temperance opinions man is not always at his noblest and the man from honolulu had himself been drinking—drinking we may charitably fancy to excess  it was to your ‘dear brother the reverend h b gage’ that you chose to communicate the sickening story and the blue ribbon which adorns your portly bosom forbids me to allow you the extenuating plea that you were drunk when it was done  your ‘dear brother’—a brother indeed—made haste to deliver up your letter as a means of grace perhaps to the religious papers where after many months i found and read and wondered at it and whence i have now reproduced it for the wonder of others  and you and your dear brother have by this cycle of operations built up a contrast very edifying to examine in detail  the man whom you would not care to have to dinner on the one side on the other the reverend dr hyde and the reverend h b gage the apia barroom the honolulu manse  but i fear you scarce appreciate how you appear to your fellowmen and to bring it home to you i will suppose your story to be true  i will suppose—and god forgive me for supposing it—that damien faltered and stumbled in his narrow path of duty i will suppose that in the horror of his isolation perhaps in the fever of incipient disease he who was doing so much more than he had sworn failed in the letter of his priestly oath—he who was so much a better man than either you or me who did what we have never dreamed of daring—he too tasted of our common frailty  ‘o iago the pity of it’  the least tender should be moved to tears the most incredulous to prayer  and all that you could do was to pen your letter to the reverend h b gage  is it growing at all clear to you what a picture you have drawn of your own heart  i will try yet once again to make it clearer  you had a father suppose this tale were about him and some informant brought it to you proof in hand i am not making too high an estimate of your emotional nature when i suppose you would regret the circumstance that you would feel the tale of frailty the more keenly since it shamed the author of your days and that the last thing you would do would be to publish it in the religious press  well the man who tried to do what damien did is my father and the father of the man in the apia bar and the father of all who love goodness and he was your father too if god had given you grace to see it     the pentland rising a page of history 1666       ‘a cloud of witnesses lyes here     who for christ’s interest did appear’                              inscription on battlefield at rullion green    chapter i—the causes of the revolt       ‘halt passenger take heed what thou dost see     this tomb doth show for what some men did die’                          monument greyfriars’ churchyard edinburgh                                                            1661–1668 85  two hundred years ago a tragedy was enacted in scotland the memory whereof has been in great measure lost or obscured by the deep tragedies which followed it  it is as it were the evening of the night of persecution—a sort of twilight dark indeed to us but light as the noonday when compared with the midnight gloom which followed  this fact of its being the very threshold of persecution lends it however an additional interest  the prejudices of the people against episcopacy were ‘out of measure increased’ says bishop burnet ‘by the new incumbents who were put in the places of the ejected preachers and were generally very mean and despicable in all respects  they were the worst preachers i ever heard they were ignorant to a reproach and many of them were openly vicious they    were indeed the dreg and refuse of the northern parts  those of them who arose above contempt or scandal were men of such violent tempers that they were as much hated as the others were despised’ 86 it was little to be wondered at from this account that the countryfolk refused to go to the parish church and chose rather to listen to outed ministers in the fields  but this was not to be allowed and their persecutors at last fell on the method of calling a roll of the parishioners’ names every sabbath and marking a fine of twenty shillings scots to the name of each absenter  in this way very large debts were incurred by persons altogether unable to pay  besides this landlords were fined for their tenants’ absences tenants for their landlords’ masters for their servants’ servants for their masters’ even though they themselves were perfectly regular in their attendance  and as the curates were allowed to fine with the sanction of any common soldier it may be imagined that often the pretexts were neither very sufficient nor well proven  when the fines could not be paid at once bibles clothes and household utensils were seized upon or a number of soldiers proportionate to his wealth were quartered on the offender  the coarse and drunken privates filled the houses with woe snatched the bread from the children to feed their dogs shocked the principles scorned the scruples and blasphemed the religion of their humble hosts and when they had reduced them to destitution sold the furniture and burned down the rooftree which was consecrated to the peasants by the name of home  for all this attention each of these soldiers received from his unwilling landlord a certain sum of money per day—three shillings sterling according to naphtali  and frequently they were forced to pay quartering money for more men than were in reality ‘cessed on them’  at that time it was no strange thing to behold a strong man begging for money to pay his fines and many others who were deep in arrears or who had attracted attention in some other way were forced to flee from their homes and take refuge from arrest and imprisonment among the wild mosses of the uplands 87a  one example in particular we may cite  john neilson the laird of corsack a worthy man was unfortunately for himself a nonconformist  first he was fined in four hundred pounds scots and then through cessing he lost nineteen hundred and ninetythree pounds scots  he was next obliged to leave his house and flee from place to place during which wanderings he lost his horse  his wife and children were turned out of doors and then his tenants were fined till they too were almost ruined  as a final stroke they drove away all his cattle to glasgow and sold them 87b  surely it was time that something were done to alleviate so much sorrow to overthrow such tyranny  about this time too there arrived in galloway a person calling himself captain andrew gray and advising the people to revolt  he displayed some documents purporting to be from the northern covenanters and stating that they were prepared to join in any enterprise commenced by their southern brethren  the leader of the persecutors was sir james turner an officer afterwards degraded for his share in the matter  ‘he was naturally fierce but was mad when he was drunk and that was very often’ said bishop burnet  ‘he was a learned man but had always been in armies and knew no other rule but to obey orders  he told me he had no regard to any law but acted as he was commanded in a military way’ 88  this was the state of matters when an outrage was committed which gave spirit and determination to the oppressed countrymen lit the flame of insubordination and for the time at least recoiled on those who perpetrated it with redoubled force    chapter ii—the beginning       i love no warres     i

the clachan of dalry and demanded the payment of his fines  on the old man’s refusing to pay they forced a large party of his neighbours to go with them and thresh his corn  the field was a certain distance out of the clachan and four persons disguised as countrymen who had been out on the moors all night met this mournful drove of slaves compelled by the four soldiers to work for the ruin of their friend  however chided to the bone by their night on the hills and worn out by want of food they proceeded to the village inn to refresh themselves  suddenly some people rushed into the room where they were sitting and told them that the soldiers were about to roast the old man naked on his own girdle  this was too much for them to stand and they repaired immediately to the scene of this gross outrage and at first merely requested that the captive should be released  on the refusal of the two soldiers who were in the front room high words were given and taken on both sides and the other two rushed forth from an adjoining chamber and made at the countrymen with drawn swords  one of the latter john m‘lellan of barscob drew a pistol and shot the corporal in the body  the pieces of tobaccopipe with which it was loaded to the number of ten at least entered him and he was so much disturbed that he never appears to have recovered for we find long afterwards a petition to the privy council requesting a pension for him the other soldiers then laid down their arms the old man was rescued and the rebellion was commenced 90  and now we must turn to sir james turner’s memoirs of himself for strange to say this extraordinary man was remarkably fond of literary composition and wrote besides the amusing account of his own adventures just mentioned a large number of essays and short biographies and a work on war entitled pallas armata  the following are some of the shorter pieces ‘magick’ ‘friendship’ ‘imprisonment’ ‘anger’ ‘revenge’ ‘duells’ ‘cruelty’ ‘a defence of some of the ceremonies of the english liturgie—to wit—bowing at the name of jesus the frequent repetition of the lord’s prayer and good lord deliver us of the doxologie of surplesses rotchets canonnicall coats’ etc  from what we know of his character we should expect ‘anger’ and ‘cruelty’ to be very full and instructive  but what earthly right he had to meddle with ecclesiastical subjects it is hard to see  upon the 12th of the month he had received some information concerning gray’s proceedings but as it was excessively indefinite in its character he paid no attention to it  on the evening of the 14th corporal deanes was brought into dumfries who affirmed stoutly that he had been shot while refusing to sign the covenant—a story rendered singularly unlikely by the after conduct of the rebels  sir james instantly dispatched orders to the cessed soldiers either to come to dumfries or meet him on the way to dalry and commanded the thirteen or fourteen men in the town with him to come at nine next morning to his lodging for supplies  on the morning of thursday the rebels arrived at dumfries with 50 horse and 150 foot  neilson of corsack and gray who commanded with a considerable troop entered the town and surrounded sir james turner’s lodging  though it was between eight and nine o’clock that worthy being unwell was still in bed but rose at once and went to the window  neilson and some others cried ‘you may have fair quarter’  ‘i need no quarter’ replied sir james ‘nor can i be a prisoner seeing there is no war declared’  on being told however that he must either be a prisoner or die he came down and went into the street in his nightshirt  here gray showed himself very desirous of killing him but he was overruled by corsack  however he was taken away a prisoner captain gray mounting him on his own horse though as turner naively remarks ‘there was good reason for it for he mounted himself on a farre better one of mine’  a large coffer containing his clothes and money together with all his papers were taken away by the rebels  they robbed master chalmers the episcopalian minister of dumfries of his horse drank the king’s health at the market cross and then left dumfries 92    chapter iii—the march of the rebels       ‘stay passenger take notice what thou reads     at edinburgh lie our bodies here our heads     our right hands stood at lanark these we want     because with them we signed the covenant’                                  epitaph on a tombstone at hamilton 93  on friday the 16th bailie irvine of dumfries came to the council at edinburgh and gave information concerning this ‘horrid rebellion’  in the absence of rothes sharpe presided—much to the wrath of some members and as he imagined his own safety endangered his measures were most energetic  dalzell was ordered away to the west the guards round the city were doubled officers and soldiers were forced to take the oath of allegiance and all lodgers were commanded to give in their names sharpe surrounded with all these guards and precautions trembled—trembled as he trembled when the avengers of blood drew him from his chariot on magus muir—for he knew how he had sold his trust how he had betrayed his charge and he felt that against him must their chiefest hatred be directed against him their direst thunderbolts be forged but even in his fear the apostate presbyterian was unrelenting unpityingly harsh he published in his manifesto no promise of pardon no inducement to submission  he said ‘if you submit not you must die’ but never added ‘if you submit you may live’ 94a  meantime the insurgents proceeded on their way  at carsphairn they were deserted by captain gray who doubtless in a fit of oblivion neglected to leave behind him the coffer containing sir james’s money  who he was is a mystery unsolved by any historian his papers were evidently forgeries—that and his final flight appear to indicate that he was an agent of the royalists for either the king or the duke of york was heard to say ‘that if he might have his wish he would have them all turn rebels and go to arms’ 94b  upon the 18th day of the month they left carsphairn and marched onwards  turner was always lodged by his captors at a good inn frequently at the best of which their haltingplace could boast  here many visits were paid to him by the ministers and officers of the insurgent force  in his description of these interviews he displays a vein of satiric severity admitting any kindness that was done to him with some qualifying souvenir of former harshness and gloating over any injury mistake or folly which it was his chance to suffer or to hear  he appears notwithstanding all this to have been on pretty good terms with his cruel ‘phanaticks’ as the following extract sufficiently proves  ‘most of the foot were lodged about the church or churchyard and order given to ring bells next morning for a sermon to be preached by mr welch  maxwell of morith and major m‘cullough invited me to heare “that phanatick sermon” for soe they merrilie called it  they said that preaching might prove an effectual meane to turne me which they heartilie wished  i answered to them that i was under guards and that if they intended to heare that sermon it was probable i might likewise for it was not like my guards wold goe to church and leave me alone at my lodgeings  bot to what they said of my conversion i said it wold be hard to turne a turner  bot because i founde them in a merrie humour i said if i did not come to heare mr welch preach then they might fine me in fortie shillings scots which was double the suome of what i had exacted from the phanatics’ 95  this took place at ochiltree on the 22nd day of the month  the following is recounted by this personage with malicious glee and certainly if authentic it is a sad proof of how chaff is mixed with wheat and how ignorant almost impious persons were engaged in this movement nevertheless we give it for we wish to present with impartiality all the alleged facts to the reader  ‘towards the evening mr robinsone and mr crukshank gaue me a visite i called for some ale purposelie to heare one of them blesse it  it fell mr robinsone to seeke the blessing who said one of the most bombastick graces that ever i heard in my life  he summoned god allmightie very imperiouslie to be their secondarie for that was his language  “and if” said he “thou wilt not be our secondarie we will not fight for thee at all for it is not our cause bot thy cause and if thou wilt not fight for our cause and thy oune cause then we are not obliged to fight for it  they say” said he “that dukes earles and lords are coming with the king’s general against us bot they shall be nothing bot a threshing to us”  this grace did more fullie satisfie me of the folly and injustice of their cause then the ale did quench my thirst’ 96a  frequently the rebels made a halt near some roadside alehouse or in some convenient park where colonel wallace who had now taken the command would review the horse and foot during which time turner was sent either into the alehouse or round the shoulder of the hill to prevent him from seeing the disorders which were likely to arise  he was at last on the 25th day of the month between douglas and lanark permitted to behold their evolutions  ‘i found their horse did consist of four hundreth and fortie and the foot of five hundreth and upwards    the horsemen were armed for most part with suord and pistoll some onlie with suord the foot with musket pike sith scythe forke and suord and some with suords great and long’  he admired much the proficiency of their cavalry and marvelled how they had attained to it in so short a time 96b  at douglas which they had just left on the morning of this great wapinshaw they were charged—awful picture of depravity—with the theft of a silver spoon and a nightgown  could it be expected that while the whole country swarmed with robbers of every description such a rare opportunity for plunder should be lost by rogues—that among a thousand men even though fighting for religion there should not be one achan in the camp  at lanark a declaration was drawn up and signed by the chief rebels  in it occurs the following  ‘the just sense whereof ’—the sufferings of the country—‘made us choose rather to betake ourselves to the fields for selfdefence than to stay at home burdened daily with the calamities of others and tortured with the fears of our own approaching misery’ 97  the whole body too swore the covenant to which ceremony the epitaph at the head of this chapter seems to refer  a report that dalzell was approaching drove them from lanark to bathgate where on the evening of monday the 26th the wearied army stopped  but at twelve o’clock the cry which served them for a trumpet of ‘horse horse’ and ‘mount the prisoner’ resounded through the nightshrouded town and called the peasants from their wellearned rest to toil onwards in their march  the wind howled fiercely over the moorland a close thick wetting rain descended  chilled to the bone worn out with long fatigue sinking to the knees in mire onward they marched to destruction  one by one the weary peasants fell off from their ranks to sleep and die in the rainsoaked moor or to seek some house by the wayside wherein to hide till daybreak  one by one at first then in gradually increasing numbers at every shelter that was seen whole troops left the waning squadrons and rushed to hide themselves from the ferocity of the tempest  to right and left nought could be descried but the broad expanse of the moor and the figures of their fellowrebels seen dimly through the murky night plodding onwards through the sinking moss  those who kept together—a miserable few—often halted to rest themselves and to allow their lagging comrades to overtake them  then onward they went again still hoping for assistance reinforcement and supplies onward again through the wind and the rain and the darkness—onward to their defeat at pentland and their scaffold at edinburgh  it was calculated that they lost one half of their army on that disastrous nightmarch  next night they reached the village of colinton four miles from edinburgh where they halted for the last time 98    chapter iv—rullion green       ‘from covenanters with uplifted hands     from remonstrators with associate bands              good lord deliver us’                                          royalist rhyme kirkton p 127  late on the fourth night of november exactly twentyfour days before rullion green richard and george chaplain merchants in haddington beheld four men clad like westcountry whigamores standing round some object on the ground  it was at the twomile cross and within that distance from their homes  at last to their horror they discovered that the recumbent figure was a livid corpse swathed in a bloodstained windingsheet 99  many thought that this apparition was a portent of the deaths connected with the pentland rising  on the morning of wednesday the 28th of november 1666 they left colinton and marched to rullion green  there they arrived about sunset the position was a strong one  on the summit of a bare heathery spur of the pentlands are two hillocks and between them lies a narrow band of flat marshy ground  on the highest of the two mounds—that nearest the pentlands and on the left hand of the main body—was the greater part of the cavalry under major learmont on the other barscob and the galloway gentlemen and in the centre colonel wallace and the weak halfarmed infantry  their position was further strengthened by the depth of the valley below and the deep chasmlike course of the rullion burn  the sun going down behind the pentlands cast golden lights and blue shadows on their snowclad summits slanted obliquely into the rich plain before them bathing with rosy splendour the leafless snowsprinkled trees and fading gradually into shadow in the distance  to the south too they beheld a deepshaded amphitheatre of heather and bracken the course of the esk near penicuik winding about at the foot of its gorge the broad brown expanse of maw moss and fading into blue indistinctness in the south the wild heathclad peeblesshire hills  in sooth that scene was fair and many a yearning glance was cast over that peaceful evening scene from the spot where the rebels awaited their defeat and when the fight was over many a noble fellow lifted his head from the bloodstained heather to strive with darkening eyeballs to behold that landscape over which as over his life and his cause the shadows of night and of gloom were falling and thickening  it was while waiting on this spot that the fearinspiring cry was raised ‘the enemy  here come the enemy’  unwilling to believe their own doom—for our insurgents still hoped for success in some negotiations for peace which had been carried on at colinton—they called out ‘they are some of our own’  ‘they are too blacke’ ie numerous ‘fie fie for ground to draw up on’ cried wallace fully realising the want of space for his men and proving that it was not till after this time that his forces were finally arranged 101a  first of all the battle was commenced by fifty royalist horse sent obliquely across the hill to attack the left wing of the rebels  an equal number of learmont’s men met them and after a struggle drove them back  the course of the rullion burn prevented almost all pursuit and wallace on perceiving it dispatched a body of foot to occupy both the burn and some ruined sheepwalls on the farther side  dalzell changed his position and drew up his army at the foot of the hill on the top of which were his foes  he then dispatched a mingled body of infantry and cavalry to attack wallace’s outpost but they also were driven back  a third charge produced a still more disastrous effect for dalzell had to check the pursuit of his men by a reinforcement  these repeated checks bred a panic in the lieutenantgeneral’s ranks for several of his men flung down their arms  urged by such fatal symptoms and by the approaching night he deployed his men and closed in overwhelming numbers on the centre and right flank of the insurgent army in the increasing twilight the burning matches of the firelocks shimmering on barrel halbert and cuirass lent to the approaching army a picturesque effect like a huge manyarmed giant breathing flame into the darkness  placed on an overhanging hill welch and semple cried aloud ‘the god of jacob the god of jacob’ and prayed with uplifted hands for victory 101b  but still the royalist troops closed in  captain john paton was observed by dalzell who determined to capture him with his own hands  accordingly he charged forward presenting his pistols  paton fired but the balls hopped off dalzell’s buff coat and fell into his boot  with the superstition peculiar to his age the nonconformist concluded that his adversary was rendered bulletproof by enchantment and pulling some small silver coins from his pocket charged his pistol therewith  dalzell seeing this and supposing it is likely that paton was putting in larger balls hid behind his servant who was killed 102  meantime the outposts were forced and the army of wallace was enveloped in the embrace of a hideous boaconstrictor—tightening closing crushing every semblance of life from the victim enclosed in his toils  the flanking parties of horse were forced in upon the centre and though as even turner grants they fought with desperation a general flight was the result  but when they fell there was none to sing their coronach or wail the deathwail over them  those who sacrificed themselves for the peace the liberty and the religion of their fellowcountrymen lay bleaching in the field of death for long and when at last they were buried by charity the peasants dug up their bodies desecrated their graves and cast them once more upon the open heath for the sorry value of their windingsheets  inscription on stone at rullion green                                       here

he gazed out  with colours flying and with music sounding dalzell victorious entered edinburgh  but his banners were dyed in blood and a band of prisoners were marched within his ranks  the old man knew it all  that martial and triumphant strain was the deathknell of his friends and of their cause the rusthued spots upon the flags were the tokens of their courage and their death and the prisoners were the miserable remnant spared from death in battle to die upon the scaffold  poor old man he had outlived all joy  had he lived longer he would have seen increasing torment and increasing woe he would have seen the clouds then but gathering in mist cast a more than midnight darkness over his native hills and have fallen a victim to those bloody persecutions which later sent their red memorials to the sea by many a burn  by a merciful providence all this was spared to him—he fell beneath the first blow and ere four days had passed since rullion green the aged minister of god was gathered to is fathers 105a  when sharpe first heard of the rebellion he applied to sir alexander ramsay the provost for soldiers to guard his house  disliking their occupation the soldiers gave him an ugly time of it  all the night through they kept up a continuous series of ‘alarms and incursions’ ‘cries of “stand” “give fire”’ etc which forced the prelate to flee to the castle in the morning hoping there to find the rest which was denied him at home 105b  now however when all danger to himself was past sharpe came out in his true colours and scant was the justice likely to be shown to the foes of scottish episcopacy when the primate was by  the prisoners were lodged in haddo’s hole a part of st giles’ cathedral where by the kindness of bishop wishart to his credit be it spoken they were amply supplied with food 105c  some people urged in the council that the promise of quarter which had been given on the field of battle should protect the lives of the miserable men  sir john gilmoure the greatest lawyer gave no opinion—certainly a suggestive circumstance—but lord lee declared that this would not interfere with their legal trial ‘so to bloody executions they went’ 105d  to the number of thirty they were condemned and executed while two of them hugh m‘kail a young minister and neilson of corsack were tortured with the boots  the goods of those who perished were confiscated and their bodies were dismembered and distributed to different parts of the country ‘the heads of major m‘culloch and the two gordons’ it was resolved says kirkton ‘should be pitched on the gate of kirkcudbright the two hamiltons and strong’s head should be affixed at hamilton and captain arnot’s sett on the watter gate at edinburgh  the armes of all the ten because they hade with uplifted hands renewed the covenant at lanark were sent to the people of that town to expiate that crime by placing these arms on the top of the prison’ 106  among these was john neilson the laird of corsack who saved turner’s life at dumfries in return for which service sir james attempted though without success to get the poor man reprieved  one of the condemned died of his wounds between the day of condemnation and the day of execution  ‘none of them’ says kirkton ‘would save their life by taking the declaration and renouncing the covenant though it was offered to them    but never men died in scotland so much lamented by the people not only spectators but those in the country  when knockbreck and his brother were turned over they clasped each other in their armes and so endured the pangs of death when humphrey colquhoun died he spoke not like an ordinary citizen but like a heavenly minister relating his comfortable christian experiences and called for his bible and laid it on his wounded arm and read john iii 8 and spoke upon it to the admiration of all  but most of all when mr m‘kail died there was such a lamentation as was never known in scotland before not one dry cheek upon all the street or in all the numberless windows in the mercate place’ 107a  the following passage from this speech speaks for itself and its author  ‘hereafter i will not talk with flesh and blood nor think on the world’s consolations  farewell to all my friends whose company hath been refreshful to me in my pilgrimage  i have done with the light of the sun and the moon welcome eternal light eternal life everlasting love everlasting praise everlasting glory  praise to him that sits upon the throne and to the lamb for ever  bless the lord o my soul that hath pardoned all my iniquities in the blood of his son and healed all my diseases  bless him o all ye his angels that excel in strength ye ministers of his that do his pleasure  bless the lord o my soul’ 107b  after having ascended the gallows ladder he again broke forth in the following words of touching eloquence ‘and now i leave off to speak any more to creatures and begin my intercourse with god which shall never be broken off  farewell father and mother friends and relations farewell the world and all delights  farewell meat and drink  farewell sun moon and stars—welcome god and father  welcome sweet jesus christ the mediator of the new covenant  welcome blessed spirit of grace and god of all consolation  welcome glory  welcome eternal life welcome death’ 107c  at glasgow too where some were executed they caused the soldiers to beat the drums and blow the trumpets on their closing ears  hideous refinement of revenge  even the last words which drop from the lips of a dying man—words surely the most sincere and the most unbiassed which mortal mouth can utter—even these were looked upon as poisoned and as poisonous  ‘drown their last accents’ was the cry ‘lest they should lead the crowd to take their part or at the least to mourn their doom’ 108a  but after all perhaps it was more merciful than one would think—unintentionally so of course perhaps the storm of harsh and fiercely jubilant noises the clanging of trumpets the rattling of drums and the hootings and jeerings of an unfeeling mob which were the last they heard on earth might when the mortal fight was over when the river of death was passed add tenfold sweetness to the hymning of the angels tenfold peacefulness to the shores which they had reached  not content with the cruelty of these executions some even of the peasantry though these were confined to the shire of midlothian pursued captured plundered and murdered the miserable fugitives who fell in their way  one strange story have we of these times of blood and persecution kirkton the historian and popular tradition tell us alike of a flame which often would arise from the grave in a moss near carnwath of some of those poor rebels of how it crept along the ground of how it covered the house of their murderer and of how it scared him with its lurid glare  hear daniel defoe 108b      ‘if the poor people were by these insupportable violences made     desperate and driven to all the extremities of a wild despair who     can justly reflect on them when they read in the word of god “that     oppression makes a wise man mad”  and therefore were there no other     original of the insurrection known by the name of the rising of     pentland it was nothing but what the intolerable oppressions of     those times might have justified to all the world nature having     dictated to all people a right of defence when illegally and     arbitrarily attacked in a manner not justifiable either by laws of     nature the laws of god or the laws of the country’  bear this remonstrance of defoe’s in mind and though it is the fashion of the day to jeer and to mock to execrate and to contemn the noble band of covenanters—though the bitter laugh at their oldworld religious views the curl of the lip at their merits and the chilling silence on their bravery and their determination are but too rife through all society—be charitable to what was evil and honest to what was good about the pentland insurgents who fought for life and liberty for country and religion on the 28th of november 1666 now just two hundred years ago                                        edinburgh 28th november 1866     the day after tomorrow   history is much decried it is a tissue of errors we are told no doubt correctly and rival historians expose each other’s blunders with gratification  yet the worst historian has a clearer view of the period he studies than the best of us can hope to form of that in which we live the obscurest epoch is today and that for a thousand reasons of inchoate tendency conflicting report and sheer mass and multiplicity of experience but chiefly perhaps by reason of an insidious shifting of landmarks  parties and ideas continually move but not by measurable marches on a stable course the political soil itself steals forth by imperceptible degrees like a travelling glacier carrying on its bosom not only political parties but their flagposts and cantonments so that what appears to be an eternal city founded on hills is but a flying island of laputa  it is for this reason in particular that we are all becoming socialists without knowing it by which i would not in the least refer to the acute case of mr hyndman and his hornblowing supporters sounding their trumps of a sunday within the walls of our individualist jericho—but to the stealthy change that has come over the spirit of englishmen and english legislation  a little while ago and we were still for liberty ‘crowd a few more thousands on the bench of government’ we seemed to cry ‘keep her head direct on liberty and we cannot help but come to port’  this is over laisser faire declines in favour our legislation grows authoritative grows philanthropical bristles with new duties and new penalties and casts a spawn of inspectors who now begin notebook in hand to darken the face of england  it may be right or wrong we are not trying that but one thing it is beyond doubt it is socialism in action and the strange thing is that we scarcely know it  liberty has served us a long while and it may be time to seek new altars  like all other principles she has been proved to be selfexclusive in the long run  she has taken wages besides like all other virtues and dutifully served mammon so that many things we were accustomed to admire as the benefits of freedom and common to all were truly benefits of wealth and took their value from our neighbours’ poverty  a few shocks of logic a few disclosures in the journalistic phrase of what the freedom of manufacturers landlords or shipowners may imply for operatives tenants or seamen and we not unnaturally begin to turn to that other pole of hope beneficent tyranny  freedom to be desirable involves kindness wisdom and all the virtues of the free but the free man as we have seen him in action has been as of yore only the master of many helots and the slaves are still illfed illclad illtaught illhoused insolently treated and driven to their mines and workshops by the lash of famine  so much in other men’s affairs we have begun to see clearly we have begun to despair of virtue in these other men and from our seat in parliament begin to discharge upon them thick as arrows the host of our inspectors  the landlord has long shaken his head over the manufacturer those who do business on land have lost all trust in the virtues of the shipowner the professions look askance upon the retail traders and have even started their cooperative stores to ruin them and from out the smokewreaths of birmingham a finger has begun to write upon the wall the condemnation of the landlord thus piece by piece do we condemn each other and yet not perceive the conclusion that our whole estate is somewhat damnable  thus piece by piece each acting against his neighbour each sawing away the branch on which some other interest is seated do we apply in detail our socialistic remedies and yet not perceive that we are all labouring together to bring in socialism at large  a tendency so stupid and so selfish is like to prove invincible and if socialism be at all a practicable rule of life there is every chance that our grandchildren will see the day and taste the pleasures of existence in something far liker an antheap than any previous human polity  and this not in the least because of the voice of mr hyndman or the horns of his followers but by the mere glacier movement of the political soil bearing forward on its bosom apparently undisturbed the proud camps of whig and tory if mr hyndman were a man of keen humour which is far from my conception of his character he might rest from his troubling and look on the walls of jericho begin already to crumble and dissolve  that great servile war the armageddon of money and numbers to which we looked forward when young becomes more and more unlikely and we may rather look to see a peaceable and blindfold evolution the work of dull men immersed in political tactics and dead to political results  the principal scene of this comedy lies of course in the house of commons it is there besides that the details of this new evolution if it proceed will fall to be decided so that the state of parliament is not only diagnostic of the present but fatefully prophetic of the future well we all know what parliament is and we are all ashamed of it  we may pardon it some faults indeed on the ground of irish obstruction—a bitter trial which it supports with notable good humour  but the excuse is merely local it cannot apply to similar bodies in america and france and what are we to say of these  president cleveland’s letter may serve as a picture of the one a glance at almost any paper will convince us of the weakness of the other  decay appears to have seized on the organ of popular government in every land and this just at the moment when we begin to bring to it as to an oracle of justice the whole skein of our private affairs to be unravelled and ask it like a new messiah to take upon itself our frailties and play for us the part that should be played by our own virtues  for that in few words is the case  we cannot trust ourselves to behave with decency we cannot trust our consciences and the remedy proposed is to elect a round number of our neighbours pretty much at random and say to these ‘be ye our conscience make laws so wise and continue from year to year to administer them so wisely that they shall save us from ourselves and make us righteous and happy world without end  amen’  and who can look twice at the british parliament and then seriously bring it such a task  i am not advancing this as an argument against socialism once again nothing is further from my mind  there are great truths in socialism or no one not even mr hyndman would be found to hold it and if it came and did onetenth part of what it offers i for one should make it welcome  but if it is to come we may as well have some notion of what it will be like and the first thing to grasp is that our new polity will be designed and administered to put it courteously with something short of inspiration it will be made or will grow in a human parliament and the one thing that will not very hugely change is human nature  the anarchists think otherwise from which it is only plain that they have not carried to the study of history the lamp of human sympathy  given then our new polity with its new waggonload of laws what headmarks must we look for in the life  we chafe a good deal at that excellent thing the incometax because it brings into our affairs the prying fingers and exposes us to the tart words of the official  the official in all degrees is already something of a terror to many of us i would not willingly have to do with even a policeconstable in any other spirit than that of kindness  i still remember in my dreams the eyeglass of a certain attaché at a certain embassy—an eyeglass that was a standing indignity to all on whom it looked and my next most disagreeable remembrance is of a bracing republican postman in the city of san francisco  i lived in that city among working folk and what my neighbours accepted at the postman’s hands—nay what i took from him myself—it is still distasteful to recall  the bourgeois residing in the upper parts of society has but few opportunities of tasting this peculiar bowl but about the incometax as i have said or perhaps about a patent or in the halls of an embassy at the hands of my friend of the eyeglass he occasionally sets his lips to it and he may thus imagine if he has that faculty of imagination without which most faculties are void how it tastes to his poorer neighbours who must drain it to the dregs  in every contact with authority with their employer with the police with the school board officer in the hospital or in the workhouse they have equally the occasion to appreciate the lighthearted civility of the man in office and as an experimentalist in several outoftheway provinces of life i may say it has but to be felt to be appreciated  well this golden age of which we are speaking will be the golden age of officials  in all our concerns it will be their beloved duty to meddle with what tact with what obliging words analogy will aid us to imagine  it is likely these gentlemen will be periodically elected they will therefore have their turn of being underneath which does not always sweeten men’s conditions  the laws they will have to administer will be no clearer than those we know today and the body which is to regulate their administration no wiser than the british parliament  so that upon all hands we may look for a form of servitude most galling to the blood—servitude to many and changing masters and for all the slights that accompany the rule of jackinoffice  and if the socialistic programme be carried out with the least fulness we shall have lost a thing in most respects not much to be regretted but as a moderator of oppression a thing nearly invaluable—the newspaper  for the independent journal is a creature of capital and competition it stands and falls with millionaires and railway bonds and all the abuses and glories of today and as soon as the state has fairly taken its bent to authority and philanthropy and laid the least touch on private property the days of the independent journal are numbered  state railways may be good things and so may state bakeries but a state newspaper will never be a very trenchant critic of the state officials  but again these officials would have no sinecure  crime would perhaps be less for some of the motives of crime we may suppose would pass away but if socialism were carried out with any fulness there would be more contraventions  we see already new sins ringing up like mustard—school board sins factory sins merchant shipping act sins—none of which i would be thought to except against in particular but all of which taken together show us that socialism can be a hard master even in the beginning  if it go on to such heights as we hear proposed and lauded if it come actually to its ideal of the antheap ruled with iron justice the number of new contraventions will be out of all proportion multiplied  take the case of work alone  man is an idle animal  he is at least as intelligent as the ant but generations of advisers have in vain recommended him the ant’s example  of those who are found truly indefatigable in business some are misers some are the practisers of delightful industries like gardening some are students artists inventors or discoverers men lured forward by successive hopes and the rest are those who live by games of skill or hazard—financiers billiardplayers gamblers and the like  but in unloved toils even under the prick of necessity no man is continually sedulous  once eliminate the fear of starvation once eliminate or bound the hope of riches and we shall see plenty of skulking and malingering  society will then be something not wholly unlike a cotton plantation in the old days with cheerful careless demoralised slaves with elected overseers and instead of the planter a chaotic popular assembly  if the blood be purposeful and the soil strong such a plantation may succeed and be indeed a busy antheap with full granaries and long hours of leisure  but even then i think the whip will be in the overseer’s hands and not in vain  for when it comes to be a question of each man doing his own share or the rest doing more prettiness of sentiment will be forgotten  to dock the skulker’s food is not enough many will rather eat haws and starve on petty pilferings than put their shoulder to the wheel for one hour daily  for such as these then the whip will be in the overseer’s hand and his own sense of justice and the superintendence of a chaotic popular assembly will be the only checks on its employment  now you may be an industrious man and a good citizen and yet not love nor yet be loved by dr fell the inspector  it is admitted by private soldiers that the disfavour of a sergeant is an evil not to be combated offend the sergeant they say and in a brief while you will either be disgraced or have deserted  and the sergeant can no longer appeal to the lash  but if these things go on we shall see or our sons shall see what it is to have offended an inspector  this for the unfortunate  but with the fortunate also even those whom the inspector loves it may not be altogether well  it is concluded that in such a state of society supposing it to be financially sound the level of comfort will be high  it does not follow there are strange depths of idleness in man a tooeasilygot sufficiency as in the case of the sagoeaters often quenching the desire for all besides and it is possible that the men of the richest antheaps may sink even into squalor  but suppose they do not suppose our tricksy instrument of human nature when we play upon it this new tune should respond kindly suppose no one to be damped and none exasperated by the new conditions the whole enterprise to be financially sound—a vaulting supposition—and all the inhabitants to dwell together in a golden mean of comfort we have yet to ask ourselves if this be what man desire or if it be what man will even deign to accept for a continuance  it is certain that man loves to eat it is not certain that he loves that only or that best  he is supposed to love comfort it is not a love at least that he is faithful to  he is supposed to love happiness it is my contention that he rather loves excitement  danger enterprise hope the novel the aleatory are dearer to man than regular meals  he does not think so when he is hungry but he thinks so again as soon as he is fed and on the hypothesis of a successful antheap he would never go hungry  it would be always after dinner in that society as in the land of the lotoseaters it was always afternoon and food which when we have it not seems allimportant drops in our esteem as soon as we have it to a mere prerequisite of living  that for which man lives is not the same thing for all individuals nor in all ages yet it has a common base what he seeks and what he must have is that which will seize and hold his attention  regular meals and weatherproof lodgings will not do this long  play in its wide sense as the artificial induction of sensation including all games and all arts will indeed go far to keep him conscious of himself but in the end he wearies for realities  study or experiment to some rare natures is the unbroken pastime of a life  these are enviable natures people shut in the house by sickness often bitterly envy them but the commoner man cannot continue to exist upon such altitudes his feet itch for physical adventure his blood boils for physical dangers pleasures and triumphs his fancy the looker after new things cannot continue to look for them in books and crucibles but must seek them on the breathing stage of life  pinches buffets the glow of hope the shock of disappointment furious contention with obstacles these are the true elixir for all vital spirits these are what they seek alike in their romantic enterprises and their unromantic dissipations  when they are taken in some pinch closer than the common they cry ‘catch me here again’ and sure enough you catch them there again—perhaps before the week is out it is as old as robinson crusoe as old as man  our race has not been strained for all these ages through that sieve of dangers that we call natural selection to sit down with patience in the tedium of safety the voices of its fathers call it forth  already in our society as it exists the bourgeois is too much cottoned about for any zest in living he sits in his parlour out of reach of any danger often out of reach of any vicissitude but one of health and there he yawns  if the people in the next villa took potshots at him he might be killed indeed but so long as he escaped he would find his blood oxygenated and his views of the world brighter  if mr mallock on his way to the publishers should have his skirts pinned to a wall by a javelin it would not occur to him—at least for several hours—to ask if life were worth living and if such peril were a daily matter he would ask it never more he would have other things to think about he would be living indeed—not lying in a box with cotton safe but immeasurably dull  the aleatory whether it touch life or fortune or renown—whether we explore africa or only toss for halfpence—that is what i conceive men to love best and that is what we are seeking to exclude from men’s existences  of all forms of the aleatory that which most commonly attends our working men—the danger of misery from want of work—is the least inspiriting it does not whip the blood it does not evoke the glory of contest it is tragic but it is passive and yet in so far as it is aleatory and a peril sensibly touching them it does truly season the men’s lives  of those who fail i do not speak—despair should be sacred but to those who even modestly succeed the changes of their life bring interest a job found a shilling saved a dainty earned all these are wells of pleasure springing afresh for the successful poor and it is not from these but from the villadweller that we hear complaints of the unworthiness of life  much then as the average of the proletariat would gain in this new state of life they would also lose a certain something which would not be missed in the beginning but would be missed progressively and progressively lamented  soon there would be a looking back there would be tales of the old world humming in young men’s ears tales of the tramp and the pedlar and the hopeful emigrant  and in the stallfed life of the successful antheap—with its regular meals regular duties regular pleasures an even course of life and fear excluded—the vicissitudes delights and havens of today will seem of epic breadth  this may seem a shallow observation but the springs by which men are moved lie much on the surface  bread i believe has always been considered first but the circus comes close upon its heels  bread we suppose to be given amply the cry for circuses will be the louder and if the life of our descendants be such as we have conceived there are two beloved pleasures on which they will be likely to fall back the pleasures of intrigue and of sedition  in all this i have supposed the antheap to be financially sound  i am no economist only a writer of fiction but even as such i know one thing that bears on the economic question—i know the imperfection of man’s faculty for business  the anarchists who count some rugged elements of common sense among what seem to me their tragic errors have said upon this matter all that i could wish to say and condemned beforehand great economical polities  so far it is obvious that they are right they may be right also in predicting a period of communal independence and they may even be right in thinking that desirable  but the rise of communes is none the less the end of economic equality just when we were told it was beginning  communes will not be all equal in extent nor in quality of soil nor in growth of population nor will the surplus produce of all be equally marketable  it will be the old story of competing interests only with a new unit and as it appears to me a new inevitable danger  for the merchant and the manufacturer in this new world will be a sovereign commune it is a sovereign power that will see its crops undersold and its manufactures worsted in the market  and all the more dangerous that the sovereign power should be small  great powers are slow to stir national affronts even with the aid of newspapers filter slowly into popular consciousness national losses are so unequally shared that one part of the population will be counting its gains while another sits by a cold hearth  but in the sovereign commune all will be centralised and sensitive  when jealousy springs up when let us say the commune of poole has overreached the commune of dorchester irritation will run like quicksilver throughout the body politic each man in dorchester will have to suffer directly in his diet and his dress even the secretary who drafts the official correspondence will sit down to his task embittered as a man who has dined ill and may expect to dine worse and thus a business difference between communes will take on much the same colour as a dispute between diggers in the lawless west and will lead as directly to the arbitrament of blows  so that the establishment of the communal system will not only reintroduce all the injustices and heartburnings of economic inequality but will in all human likelihood inaugurate a world of hedgerow warfare  dorchester will march on poole sherborne on dorchester wimborne on both the waggons will be fired on as they follow the highway the trains wrecked on the lines the ploughman will go armed into the field of tillage and if we have not a return of ballad literature the local press at least will celebrate in a high vein the victory of cerne abbas or the reverse of toller porcorum  at least this will not be dull when i was younger i could have welcomed such a world with relief but it is the newold with a vengeance and irresistibly suggests the growth of military powers and the foundation of new empires     college papers   chapter i—edinburgh students in 1824   on the 2nd of january 1824 was issued the prospectus of the lapsus linguæ or the college tatler and on the 7th the first number appeared  on friday the 2nd of april ‘mr tatler became speechless’ its history was not all one success for the editor who applies to himself the words of iago ‘i am nothing if i am not critical’ overstepped the bounds of caution and found himself seriously embroiled with the powers that were  there appeared in no xvi a most bitter satire upon sir john leslie in which he was compared to falstaff charged with puffing himself and very prettily censured for publishing only the first volume of a classbook and making all purchasers pay for both  sir john leslie took up the matter angrily visited carfrae the publisher and threatened him with an action till he was forced to turn the hapless lapsus out of doors  the maltreated periodical found shelter in the shop of huie infirmary street and no xvii was duly issued from the new office  no xvii beheld mr tatler’s humiliation in which with fulsome apology and not very credible assurances of respect and admiration he disclaims the article in question and advertises a new issue of no xvi with all objectionable matter omitted this with pleasing euphemism he terms in a later advertisement ‘a new and improved edition’  this was the only remarkable adventure of mr tatler’s brief existence unless we consider as such a silly chaldee manuscript in imitation of blackwood and a letter of reproof from a divinity student on the impiety of the same dull effusion  he laments the near approach of his end in pathetic terms  ‘how shall we summon up sufficient courage’ says he ‘to look for the last time on our beloved little devil and his inestimable proofsheet  how shall we be able to pass no 14 infirmary street and feel that all its attractions are over how shall we bid farewell for ever to that excellent man with the long greatcoat wooden leg and wooden board who acts as our representative at the gate of alma mater’  but alas he had no choice mr tatler whose career he says himself had been successful passed peacefully away and has ever since dumbly implored ‘the bringing home of bell and burial’  alter et idem  a very different affair was the lapsus linguæ from the edinburgh university magazine  the two prospectuses alone laid side by side would indicate the march of luxury and the repeal of the paper duty  the penny biweekly broadside of session 1828–4 was almost wholly dedicated to momus  epigrams pointless letters amorous verses and university grievances are the continual burthen of the song  but mr tatler was not without a vein of hearty humour and his pages afford what is much better to wit a good picture of student life as it then was  the students of those polite days insisted on retaining their hats in the classroom  there was a cabstance in front of the college and ‘carriage entrance’ was posted above the main arch on what the writer pleases to call ‘coarse unclassic boards’  the benches of the ‘speculative’ then as now were red but all other societies the ‘dialectic’ is the only survivor met downstairs in some rooms of which it is pointedly said that ‘nothing else could conveniently be made of them’  however horrible these dungeons may have been it is certain that they were paid for and that far too heavily for the taste of session 1823–4 which found enough calls upon its purse for porter and toasted cheese at ambrose’s or cranberry tarts and gingerwine at doull’s duelling was still a possibility so much so that when two medicals fell to fisticuffs in adam square it was seriously hinted that single combat would be the result  last and most wonderful of all gall and spurzheim were in every one’s mouth and the law student after having exhausted byron’s poetry and scott’s novels informed the ladies of his belief in phrenology  in the present day he would dilate on ‘red as a rose is she’ and then mention that he attends old greyfriars’ as a tacit claim to intellectual superiority  i do not know that the advance is much  but mr tatler’s best performances were three short papers in which he hit off pretty smartly the idiosyncrasies of the ‘divinity’ the ‘medical’ and the ‘law’ of session 1823–4  the fact that there was no notice of the ‘arts’ seems to suggest that they stood in the same intermediate position as they do now—the epitome of studentkind  mr tatler’s satire is on the whole goodhumoured and has not grown superannuated in all its limbs  his descriptions may limp at some points but there are certain broad traits that apply equally well to session 1870–1  he shows us the divinity of the period—tall pale and slender—his collar greasy and his coat bare about the seams—‘his white neckcloth serving four days and regularly turned the third’—‘the rim of his hat deficient in wool’—and ‘a weighty volume of theology under his arm’  he was the man to buy cheap ‘a snuffbox or a dozen of pencils or a sixbladed knife or a quarter of a hundred quills’ at any of the public salerooms  he was noted for cheap purchases and for exceeding the legal tender in halfpence  he haunted ‘the darkest and remotest corner of the theatre gallery’  he was to be seen issuing from ‘aerial lodginghouses’  withal says mine author ‘there were many good points about him he paid his landlady’s bill read his bible went twice to church on sunday seldom swore was not often tipsy and bought the lapsus linguæ’  the medical again ‘wore a white greatcoat and consequently talked loud’—there is something very delicious in that consequently  he wore his hat on one side  he was active volatile and went to the top of arthur’s seat on the sunday forenoon  he was as quiet in a debating society as he was loud in the streets  he was reckless and imprudent yesterday he insisted on your sharing a bottle of claret with him and claret was claret then before the cheapandnasty treaty and tomorrow he asks you for the loan of a penny to buy the last number of the lapsus  the student of law again was a learned man  ‘he had turned over the leaves of justinian’s institutes and knew that they were written in latin  he was well acquainted with the titlepage of blackstone’s commentaries and argal as the gravedigger in hamlet says he was not a person to be laughed at’  he attended the parliament house in the character of a critic and could give you stale sneers at all the celebrated speakers  he was the terror of essayists at the speculative or the forensic  in social qualities he seems to have stood unrivalled even in the policeoffice we find him shining with undiminished lustre ‘if a charlie should find him rather noisy at an untimely hour and venture to take him into custody he appears next morning like a daniel come to judgment  he opens his mouth to speak and the divine precepts of unchanging justice and scots law flow from his tongue  the magistrate listens in amazement and fines him only a couple of guineas’  such then were our predecessors and their college magazine  barclay ambrose young amos and fergusson were to them what the café the rainbow and rutherford’s are to us  an hour’s reading in these old pages absolutely confuses us there is so much that is similar and so much that is different the follies and amusements are so like our own and the manner of frolicking and enjoying are so changed that one pauses and looks about him in philosophic judgment  the muddy quadrangle is thick with living students but in our eyes it swarms also with the phantasmal white greatcoats and tilted hats of 1824  two races meet races alike and diverse  two performances are played before our eyes but the change seems merely of impersonators of scenery of costume plot and passion are the same  it is the fall of the spun shilling whether seventyone or twentyfour has the best of it  in a future number we hope to give a glance at the individualities of the present and see whether the cast shall be head or tail—whether we or the readers of the lapsus stand higher in the balance    chapter ii—the modern student considered generally   we have now reached the difficult portion of our task  mr tatler for all that we care may have been as virulent as he liked about the students of a former but for the iron to touch our sacred selves for a brother of the guild to betray its most privy infirmities let such a judas look to himself as he passes on his way to the scots law or the diagnostic below the solitary lamp at the corner of the dark quadrangle we confess that this idea alarms us  we enter a protest  we bind ourselves over verbally to keep the peace  we hope moreover that having thus made you secret to our misgivings you will excuse us if we be dull and set that down to caution which you might before have charged to the account of stupidity  the natural tendency of civilisation is to obliterate those distinctions which are the best salt of life  all the fine old professional flavour in language has evaporated  your very gravedigger has forgotten his avocation in his electorship and would quibble on the franchise over ophelia’s grave instead of more appropriately discussing the duration of bodies under ground  from this tendency from this gradual attrition of life in which everything pointed and characteristic is being rubbed down till the whole world begins to slip between our fingers in smooth undistinguishable sands from this we say it follows that we must not attempt to join mr taller in his simple division of students into law divinity and medical  nowadays the faculties may shake hands over their follies and like mrs frail and mrs foresight in love for love they may stand in the doors of opposite classrooms crying ‘sister sister—sister everyway’  a few restrictions indeed remain to influence the followers of individual branches of study  the divinity for example must be an avowed believer and as this in the present day is unhappily considered by many as a confession of weakness he is fain to choose one of two ways of gilding the distasteful orthodox bolus some swallow it in a thin jelly of metaphysics for it is even a credit to believe in god on the evidence of some crackjaw philosopher although it is a decided slur to believe in him on his own authority  others again and this we think the worst method finding german grammar a somewhat dry morsel run their own little heresy as a proof of independence and deny one of the cardinal doctrines that they may hold the others without being laughed at  besides however such influences as these there is little more distinction between the faculties than the traditionary ideal handed down through a long sequence of students and getting rounder and more featureless at each successive session  the plague of uniformity has descended on the college  students and indeed all sorts and conditions of men now require their faculty and character hung round their neck on a placard like the scenes in shakespeare’s theatre  and in the midst of all this weary sameness not the least common feature is the gravity of every face  no more does the merry medical run eagerly in the clear winter morning up the rugged sides of arthur’s seat and hear the church bells begin and thicken and die away below him among the gathered smoke of the city  he will not break sunday to so little purpose  he no longer finds pleasure in the mere output of his surplus energy  he husbands his strength and lays out walks and reading and amusement with deep consideration so that he may get as much work and pleasure out of his body as he can and waste none of his energy on mere impulse or such flat enjoyment as an excursion in the country  see the quadrangle in the interregnum of classes in those two or three minutes when it is full of passing students and we think you will admit that if we have not made it ‘an habitation of dragons’ we have at least transformed it into ‘a court for owls’  solemnity broods heavily over the enclosure and wherever you seek it you will find a dearth of merriment an absence of real youthful enjoyment  you might as well try      ‘to move wild laughter in the throat of death’  as to excite any healthy stir among the bulk of this staid company  the studious congregate about the doors of the different classes debating the matter of the lecture or comparing notebooks  a reserved rivalry sunders them  here are some deep in greek particles there others are already inhabitants of that land      ‘where entity and quiddity     ‘like ghosts of defunct bodies fly—     where truth in person does appear     like words congealed in northern air’  but none of them seem to find any relish for their studies—no pedantic love of this subject or that lights up their eyes—science and learning are only means for a livelihood which they have considerately embraced and which they solemnly pursue  ‘labour’s pale priests’ their lips seem incapable of laughter except in the way of polite recognition of professorial wit  the stains of ink are chronic on their meagre fingers they walk like saul among the asses  the dandies are not less subdued  in 1824 there was a noisy dapper dandyism abroad  vulgar as we should now think but yet genial—a matter of white greatcoats and loud voices—strangely different from the stately frippery that is rife at present  these men are out of their element in the quadrangle  even the small remains of boisterous humour which still clings to any collection of young men jars painfully on their morbid sensibilities and they beat a hasty retreat to resume their perfunctory march along princes street  flirtation is to them a great social duty a painful obligation which they perform on every occasion in the same chill official manner and with the same commonplace advances the same dogged observance of traditional behaviour  the shape of their raiment is a burden almost greater than they can bear and they halt in their walk to preserve the due adjustment of their trouserknees till one would fancy he had mixed in a procession of jacobs  we speak of course for ourselves but we would as soon associate with a herd of sprightly apes as with these gloomy modern beaux  alas that our mirabels our valentines even our brummels should have left their mantles upon nothing more amusing  nor are the fast men less constrained  solemnity even in dissipation is the order of the day and they go to the devil with a perverse seriousness a systematic rationalism of wickedness that would have surprised the simpler sinners of old  some of these men whom we see gravely conversing on the steps have but a slender acquaintance with each other  their intercourse consists principally of mutual bulletins of depravity and week after week as they meet they reckon up their items of transgression and give an abstract of their downward progress for approval and encouragement  these folk form a freemasonry of their own an oath is the shibboleth of their sinister fellowship  once they hear a man swear it is wonderful how their tongues loosen and their bashful spirits take enlargement under the consciousness of brotherhood  there is no folly no pardoning warmth of temper about them they are as steadygoing and systematic in their own way as the studious in theirs  not that we are without merry men  no  we shall not be ungrateful to those whose grimaces whose ironical laughter whose active feet in the ‘college anthem’ have beguiled so many weary hours and added a pleasant variety to the strain of close attention  but even these are too evidently professional in their antics  they go about cogitating puns and inventing tricks  it is their vocation hal  they are the gratuitous jesters of the classroom and like the clown when he leaves the stage their merriment too often sinks as the bell rings the hour of liberty and they pass forth by the postoffice grave and sedate and meditating fresh gambols for the morrow  this is the impression left on the mind of any observing student by too many of his fellows  they seem all frigid old men and one pauses to think how such an unnatural state of matters is produced  we feel inclined to blame for it the unfortunate absence of university feeling which is so marked a characteristic of our edinburgh students academical interests are so few and far between—students as students have so little in common except a peevish rivalry—there is such an entire want of broad college sympathies and ordinary college friendships that we fancy that no university in the kingdom is in so poor a plight our system is full of anomalies  a who cut b whilst he was a shabby student curries sedulously up to him and cudgels his memory for anecdotes about him when he becomes the great soandso  let there be an end of this shy proud reserve on the one hand and this shuddering fine ladyism on the other and we think we shall find both ourselves and the college bettered  let it be a sufficient reason for intercourse that two men sit together on the same benches  let the great a be held excused for nodding to the shabby b in princes street if he can say ‘that fellow is a student’  once this could be brought about we think you would find the whole heart of the university beat faster  we think you would find a fusion among the students a growth of common feelings an increasing sympathy between class and class whose influence in such a heterogeneous company as ours might be of incalculable value in all branches of politics and social progress  it would do more than this if we could find some method of making the university a real mother to her sons—something beyond a building of classrooms a senatus and a lottery of somewhat shabby prizes—we should strike a deathblow at the constrained and unnatural attitude of our society  at present we are not a united body but a loose gathering of individuals whose inherent attraction is allowed to condense them into little knots and coteries our last snowball riot read us a plain lesson on our condition  there was no party spirit—no unity of interests  a few who were mischievously inclined marched off to the college of surgeons in a pretentious file but even before they reached their destination the feeble inspiration had died out in many and their numbers were sadly thinned  some followed strange gods in the direction of drummond street and others slunk back to meek goodboyism at the feet of the professors  the same is visible in better things  as you send a man to an english university that he may have his prejudices rubbed off you might send him to edinburgh that he may have them ingrained—rendered indelible—fostered by sympathy into living principles of his spirit  and the reason of it is quite plain from this absence of university feeling it comes that a man’s friendships are always the direct and immediate results of these very prejudices  a common weakness is the best master of ceremonies in our quadrangle a mutual vice is the readiest introduction  the studious associate with the studious alone—the dandies with the dandies  there is nothing to force them to rub shoulders with the others and so they grow day by day more wedded to their own original opinions and affections  they see through the same spectacles continually  all broad sentiments all real catholic humanity expires and the mind gets gradually stiffened into one position—becomes so habituated to a contracted atmosphere that it shudders and withers under the least draught of the free air that circulates in the general field of mankind  specialism in society then is we think one cause of our present state specialism in study is another  we doubt whether this has ever been a good thing since the world began but we are sure it is much worse now than it was  formerly when a man became a specialist it was out of affection for his subject  with a somewhat grand devotion he left all the world of science to follow his true love and he contrived to find that strange pedantic interest which inspired the man who      ‘settled hoti’s business—let it be—        properly based oun—     gave us the doctrine of the enclitic de        dead from the waist down’  nowadays it is quite different  our pedantry wants even the saving clause of enthusiasm  the election is now matter of necessity and not of choice  knowledge is now too broad a field for your jackofalltrades and from beautifully utilitarian reasons he makes his choice draws his pen through a dozen branches of study and behold—john the specialist that this is the way to be wealthy we shall not deny but we hold that it is not the way to be healthy or wise  the whole mind becomes narrowed and circumscribed to one ‘punctual spot’ of knowledge  a rank unhealthy soil breeds a harvest of prejudices  feeling himself above others in his one little branch—in the classification of toadstools or carthaginian history—he waxes great in his own eyes and looks down on others  having all his sympathies educated in one way they die out in every other and he is apt to remain a peevish narrow and intolerant bigot  dilettante is now a term of reproach but there is a certain form of dilettantism to which no one can object  it is this that we want among our students  we wish them to abandon no subject until they have seen and felt its merit—to act under a general interest in all branches of knowledge not a commercial eagerness to excel in one  in both these directions our sympathies are constipated  we are apostles of our own caste and our own subject of study instead of being as we should true men and loving students  of course both of these could be corrected by the students themselves but this is nothing to the purpose it is more important to ask whether the senatus or the body of alumni could do nothing towards the growth of better feeling and wider sentiments  perhaps in another paper we may say something upon this head  one other word however before we have done  what shall we be when we grow really old  of yore a man was thought to lay on restrictions and acquire new deadweight of mournful experience with every year till he looked back on his youth as the very summer of impulse and freedom  we please ourselves with thinking that it cannot be so with us  we would fain hope that as we have begun in one way we may end in another and that when we are in fact the octogenarians that we seem at present there shall be no merrier men on earth  it is pleasant to picture us sunning ourselves in princes street of a morning or chirping over our evening cups with all the merriment that we wanted in youth    chapter iii—debating societies   a debating society is at first somewhat of a disappointment  you do not often find the youthful demosthenes chewing his pebbles in the same room with you or even if you do you will probably think the performance little to be admired  as a general rule the members speak shamefully ill  the subjects of debate are heavy and so are the fines  the ballot question—oldest of dialectic nightmares—is often found astride of a somnolent sederunt  the greeks and romans too are reserved as sort of generalutility men to do all the dirty work of illustration and they fill as many functions as the famous waterfall scene at the ‘princess’s’ which i found doing duty on one evening as a gorge in peru a haunt of german robbers and a peaceful vale in the scottish borders  there is a sad absence of striking argument or real lively discussion  indeed you feel a growing contempt for your fellowmembers and it is not until you rise yourself to hawk and hesitate and sit shamefully down again amid eleemosynary applause that you begin to find your level and value others rightly  even then even when failure has damped your critical ardour you will see many things to be laughed at in the deportment of your rivals  most laughable perhaps are your indefatigable strivers after eloquence they are of those who ‘pursue with eagerness the phantoms of hope’ and who since they expect that ‘the deficiencies of last sentence will be supplied by the next’ have been recommended by dr samuel johnson to ‘attend to the history of rasselas prince of abyssinia’  they are characterised by a hectic hopefulness  nothing damps them  they rise from the ruins of one abortive sentence to launch forth into another with unabated vigour  they have all the manner of an orator  from the tone of their voice you would expect a splendid period—and lo a string of brokenbacked disjointed clauses eked out with stammerings and throatclearings  they possess the art learned from the pulpit of rounding an uneuphonious sentence by dwelling on a single syllable—of striking a balance in a topheavy period by lengthening out a word into a melancholy quaver  withal they never cease to hope  even at last even when they have exhausted all their ideas even after the wouldbe peroration has finally refused to perorate they remain upon their feet with their mouths open waiting for some further inspiration like chaucer’s widow’s son in the dunghole after      ‘his throat was kit unto the nekké bone’  in vain expectation of that seed that was to be laid upon his tongue and give him renewed and clearer utterance  these men may have something to say if they could only say it—indeed they generally have but the next class are people who having nothing to say are cursed with a facility and an unhappy command of words that makes them the prime nuisances of the society they affect  they try to cover their absence of matter by an unwholesome vitality of delivery they look triumphantly round the room as if courting applause after a torrent of diluted truism  they talk in a circle harping on the same dull round of argument and returning again and again to the same remark with the same sprightliness the same irritating appearance of novelty  after this set any one is tolerable so we shall merely hint at a few other varieties  there is your man who is preeminently conscientious whose face beams with sincerity as he opens on the negative and who votes on the affirmative at the end looking round the room with an air of chastened pride  there is also the irrelevant speaker who rises emits a joke or two and then sits down again without ever attempting to tackle the subject of debate  again we have men who ride pickaback on their family reputation or if their family have none identify themselves with some wellknown statesman use his opinions and lend him their patronage on all occasions  this is a dangerous plan and serves oftener i am afraid to point a difference than to adorn a speech  but alas a striking failure may be reached without tempting providence by any of these ambitious tricks  our own stature will be found high enough for shame  the success of three simple sentences lures us into a fatal parenthesis in the fourth from whose shut brackets we may never disentangle the thread of our discourse  a momentary flush tempts us into a quotation and we may be left helpless in the middle of one of pope’s couplets a white film gathering before our eyes and our kind friends charitably trying to cover our disgrace by a feeble round of applause  amis lecteurs this is a painful topic  it is possible that we too we the ‘potent grave and reverend’ editor may have suffered these things and drunk as deep as any of the cup of shameful failure let us dwell no longer on so delicate a subject  in spite however of these disagreeables i should recommend any student to suffer them with spartan courage as the benefits he receives should repay him an hundredfold for them all  the life of the debating society is a handy antidote to the life of the classroom and quadrangle  nothing could be conceived more excellent as a weapon against many of those peccant humours that we have been railing against in the jeremiad of our last ‘college paper’—particularly in the field of intellect  it is a sad sight to see our heatherscented students our boys of seventeen coming up to college with determined views—roués in speculation—having gauged the vanity of philosophy or learned to shun it as the middleman of heresy—a company of determined deliberate opinionists not to be moved by all the sleights of logic  what have such men to do with study if their minds are made up irrevocably why burn the ‘studious lamp’ in search of further confirmation  every set opinion i hear a student deliver i feel a certain lowering of my regard  he who studies he who is yet employed in groping for his premises should keep his mind fluent and sensitive keen to mark flaws and willing to surrender untenable positions  he should keep himself teachable or cease the expensive farce of being taught  it is to further this docile spirit that we desire to press the claims of debating societies  it is as a means of melting down this museum of premature petrifactions into living and impressionable soul that we insist on their utility  if we could once prevail on our students to feel no shame in avowing an uncertain attitude towards any subject if we could teach them that it was unnecessary for every lad to have his opinionette on every topic we should have gone a far way towards bracing the intellectual tone of the coming race of thinkers and this it is which debating societies are so well fitted to perform  we there meet people of every shade of opinion and make friends with them  we are taught to rail against a man the whole session through and then hobanob with him at the concluding entertainment  we find men of talent far exceeding our own whose conclusions are widely different from ours and we are thus taught to distrust ourselves  but the best means of all towards catholicity is that wholesome rule which some folk are most inclined to condemn—i mean the law of obliged speeches  your senior member commands and you must take the affirmative or the negative just as suits his best convenience  this tends to the most perfect liberality  it is no good hearing the arguments of an opponent for in good verity you rarely follow them and even if you do take the trouble to listen it is merely in a captious search for weaknesses this is proved i fear in every debate when you hear each speaker arguing out his own prepared spécialité he never intended speaking of course until some remarks of etc arguing out i say his own coachedup subject without the least attention to what has gone before as utterly at sea about the drift of his adversary’s speech as panurge when he argued with thaumaste and merely linking his own prelection to the last by a few flippant criticisms  now as the rule stands you are saddled with the side you disapprove and so you are forced by regard for your own fame to argue out to feel with to elaborate completely the case as it stands against yourself and what a fund of wisdom do you not turn up in this idle digging of the vineyard  how many new difficulties take form before your eyes how many superannuated arguments cripple finally into limbo under the glance of your enforced eclecticism  nor is this the only merit of debating societies  they tend also to foster taste and to promote friendship between university men  this last as we have had occasion before to say is the great requirement of our student life and it will therefore be no waste of time if we devote a paragraph to this subject in its connection with debating societies at present they partake too much of the nature of a clique  friends propose friends and mutual friends second them until the society degenerates into a sort of family party  you may confirm old acquaintances but you can rarely make new ones  you find yourself in the atmosphere of your own daily intercourse  now this is an unfortunate circumstance which it seems to me might readily be rectified  our principal has shown himself so friendly towards all college improvements that i cherish the hope of seeing shortly realised a certain suggestion which is not a new one with me and which must often have been proposed and canvassed heretofore—i mean a real university debating society patronised by the senatus presided over by the professors to which every one might gain ready admittance on sight of his matriculation ticket where it would be a favour and not a necessity to speak and where the obscure student might have another object for attendance besides the mere desire to save his fines to wit the chance of drawing on himself the favourable consideration of his teachers  this would be merely following in the good tendency which has been so noticeable during all this session to increase and multiply student societies and clubs of every sort  nor would it be a matter of much difficulty  the united societies would form a nucleus one of the classrooms at first and perhaps afterwards the great hall above the library might be the place of meeting  there would be no want of attendance or enthusiasm i am sure for it is a very different thing to speak under the bushel of a private club on the one hand and on the other in a public place where a happy period or a subtle argument may do the speaker permanent service in after life  such a club might end perhaps by rivalling the ‘union’ at cambridge or the ‘union’ at oxford    chapter iv—the philosophy of umbrellas 151   it is wonderful to think what a turn has been given to our whole society by the fact that we live under the sign of aquarius—that our climate is essentially wet  a mere arbitrary distinction like the walkingswords of yore might have remained the symbol of foresight and respectability had not the raw mists and dropping showers of our island pointed the inclination of society to another exponent of those virtues  a ribbon of the legion of honour or a string of medals may prove a person’s courage a title may prove his birth a professorial chair his study and acquirement but it is the habitual carriage of the umbrella that is the stamp of respectability  the umbrella has become the acknowledged index of social position  robinson crusoe presents us with a touching instance of the hankering after them inherent in the civilised and educated mind  to the superficial the hot suns of juan fernandez may sufficiently account for his quaint choice of a luxury but surely one who had borne the hard labour of a seaman under the tropics for all these years could have supported an excursion after goats or a peaceful constitutional arm in arm with the nude friday  no it was not this the memory of a vanished respectability called for some outward manifestation and the result was—an umbrella  a pious castaway might have rigged up a belfry and solaced his sunday mornings with the mimicry of churchbells but crusoe was rather a moralist than a pietist and his leafumbrella is as fine an example of the civilised mind striving to express itself under adverse circumstances as we have ever met with  it is not for nothing either that the umbrella has become the very foremost badge of modern civilisation—the urim and thummim of respectability  its pregnant symbolism has taken its rise in the most natural manner  consider for a moment when umbrellas were first introduced into this country what manner of men would use them and what class would adhere to the useless but ornamental cane  the first without doubt would be the hypochondriacal out of solicitude for their health or the frugal out of care for their raiment the second it is equally plain would include the fop the fool and the bobadil  any one acquainted with the growth of society and knowing out of what small seeds of cause are produced great revolutions and wholly new conditions of intercourse sees from this simple thought how the carriage of an umbrella came to indicate frugality judicious regard for bodily welfare and scorn for mere outward adornment and in one word all those homely and solid virtues implied in the term respectability  not that the umbrella’s costliness has nothing to do with its great influence  its possession besides symbolising as we have already indicated the change from wild esau to plain jacob dwelling in tents implies a certain comfortable provision of fortune  it is not every one that can expose twentysix shillings’ worth of property to so many chances of loss and theft  so strongly do we feel on this point indeed that we are almost inclined to consider all who possess really wellconditioned umbrellas as worthy of the franchise  they have a qualification standing in their lobbies they carry a sufficient stake in the commonweal below their arm  one who bears with him an umbrella—such a complicated structure of whalebone of silk and of cane that it becomes a very microcosm of modern industry—is necessarily a man of peace  a halfcrown cane may be applied to an offender’s head on a very moderate provocation but a sixandtwenty shilling silk is a possession too precious to be adventured in the shock of war  these are but a few glances at how umbrellas in the general came to their present high estate  but the true umbrellaphilosopher meets with far stranger applications as he goes about the streets  umbrellas like faces acquire a certain sympathy with the individual who carries them indeed they are far more capable of betraying his trust for whereas a face is given to us so far ready made and all our power over it is in frowning and laughing and grimacing during the first three or four decades of life each umbrella is selected from a whole shopful as being most consonant to the purchaser’s disposition  an undoubted power of diagnosis rests with the practised umbrellaphilosopher  o you who lisp and amble and change the fashion of your countenances—you who conceal all these how little do you think that you left a proof of your weakness in our umbrellastand—that even now as you shake out the folds to meet the thickening snow we read in its ivory handle the outward and visible sign of your snobbery or from the exposed gingham of its cover detect through coat and waistcoat the hidden hypocrisy of the ‘dickey’  but alas even the umbrella is no certain criterion  the falsity and the folly of the human race have degraded that graceful symbol to the ends of dishonesty and while some umbrellas from carelessness in selection are not strikingly characteristic for it is only in what a man loves that he displays his real nature others from certain prudential motives are chosen directly opposite to the person’s disposition  a mendacious umbrella is a sign of great moral degradation  hypocrisy naturally shelters itself below a silk while the fast youth goes to visit his religious friends armed with the decent and reputable gingham  may it not be said of the bearers of these inappropriate umbrellas that they go about the streets ‘with a lie in their right hand’  the kings of siam as we read besides having a graduated social scale of umbrellas which was a good thing prevented the great bulk of their subjects from having any at all which was certainly a bad thing  we should be sorry to believe that this eastern legislator was a fool—the idea of an aristocracy of umbrellas is too philosophic to have originated in a nobody—and we have accordingly taken exceeding pains to find out the reason of this harsh restriction  we think we have succeeded but while admiring the principle at which he aimed and while cordially recognising in the siamese potentate the only man before ourselves who had taken a real grasp of the umbrella we must be allowed to point out how unphilosophically the great man acted in this particular  his object plainly was to prevent any unworthy persons from bearing the sacred symbol of domestic virtues  we cannot excuse his limiting these virtues to the circle of his court  we must only remember that such was the feeling of the age in which he lived  liberalism had not yet raised the warcry of the working classes  but here was his mistake it was a needless regulation  except in a very few cases of hypocrisy joined to a powerful intellect men not by nature umbrellarians have tried again and again to become so by art and yet have failed—have expended their patrimony in the purchase of umbrella after umbrella and yet have systematically lost them and have finally with contrite spirits and shrunken purses given up their vain struggle and relied on theft and borrowing for the remainder of their lives  this is the most remarkable fact that we have had occasion to notice and yet we challenge the candid reader to call it in question  now as there cannot be any moral selection in a mere dead piece of furniture—as the umbrella cannot be supposed to have an affinity for individual men equal and reciprocal to that which men certainly feel toward individual umbrellas—we took the trouble of consulting a scientific friend as to whether there was any possible physical explanation of the phenomenon  he was unable to supply a plausible theory or even hypothesis but we extract from his letter the following interesting passage relative to the physical peculiarities of umbrellas ‘not the least important and by far the most curious property of the umbrella is the energy which it displays in affecting the atmospheric strata  there is no fact in meteorology better established—indeed it is almost the only one on which meteorologists are agreed—than that the carriage of an umbrella produces desiccation of the air while if it be left at home aqueous vapour is largely produced and is soon deposited in the form of rain  no theory’ my friend continues ‘competent to explain this hygrometric law has been given as far as i am aware by herschel dove glaisher tait buchan or any other writer nor do i pretend to supply the defect  i venture however to throw out the conjecture that it will be ultimately found to belong to the same class of natural laws as that agreeable to which a slice of toast always descends with the buttered surface downwards’  but it is time to draw to a close  we could expatiate much longer upon this topic but want of space constrains us to leave unfinished these few desultory remarks—slender contributions towards a subject which has fallen sadly backward and which we grieve to say was better understood by the king of siam in 1686 than by all the philosophers of today  if however we have awakened in any rational mind an interest in the symbolism of umbrellas—in any generous heart a more complete sympathy with the dumb companion of his daily walk—or in any grasping spirit a pure notion of respectability strong enough to make him expend his sixandtwenty shillings—we shall have deserved well of the world to say nothing of the many industrious persons employed in the manufacture of the article    chapter v—the philosophy of nomenclature       ‘how many cæsars and pompeys by mere inspirations of the names have     been rendered worthy of them  and how many are there who might have     done exceeding well in the world had not their characters and     spirits been totally depressed and nicodemus’d into     nothing’—tristram shandy vol i chap xix  such were the views of the late walter shandy esq turkey merchant  to the best of my belief mr shandy is the first who fairly pointed out the incalculable influence of nomenclature upon the whole life—who seems first to have recognised the one child happy in an heroic appellation soaring upwards on the wings of fortune and the other like the dead sailor in his shotted hammock haled down by sheer weight of name into the abysses of social failure  solomon possibly had his eye on some such theory when he said that ‘a good name is better than precious ointment’ and perhaps we may trace a similar spirit in the compilers of the english catechism and the affectionate interest with which they linger round the catechumen’s name at the very threshold of their work  but be these as they may i think no one can censure me for appending in pursuance of the expressed wish of his son the turkey merchant’s name to his system and pronouncing without further preface a short epitome of the ‘shandean philosophy of nomenclature’  to begin then the influence of our name makes itself felt from the very cradle  as a schoolboy i remember the pride with which i hailed robin hood robert bruce and robert le diable as my namefellows and the feeling of sore disappointment that fell on my heart when i found a freebooter or a general who did not share with me a single one of my numerous prænomina  look at the delight with which two children find they have the same name  they are friends from that moment forth they have a bond of union stronger than exchange of nuts and sweetmeats  this feeling i own wears off in later life  our names lose their freshness and interest become trite and indifferent  but this dear reader is merely one of the sad effects of those ‘shades of the prisonhouse’ which come gradually betwixt us and nature with advancing years it affords no weapon against the philosophy of names  in after life although we fail to trace its working that name which careless godfathers lightly applied to your unconscious infancy will have been moulding your character and influencing with irresistible power the whole course of your earthly fortunes  but the last name overlooked by mr shandy is no whit less important as a condition of success  family names we must recollect are but inherited nicknames and if the sobriquet were applicable to the ancestor it is most likely applicable to the descendant also  you would not expect to find mr m‘phun acting as a mute or mr m‘lumpha excelling as a professor of dancing therefore in what follows we shall consider names independent of whether they are first or last  and to begin with look what a pull cromwell had over pym—the one name full of a resonant imperialism the other mean pettifogging and unheroic to a degree  who would expect eloquence from pym—who would read poems by pym—who would bow to the opinion of pym  he might have been a dentist but he should never have aspired to be a statesman  i can only wonder that he succeeded as he did  pym and habakkuk stand first upon the roll of men who have triumphed by sheer force of genius over the most unfavourable appellations  but even these have suffered and had they been more fitly named the one might have been lord protector and the other have shared the laurels with isaiah  in this matter we must not forget that all our great poets have borne great names  chaucer spenser shakespeare milton pope wordsworth shelley—what a constellation of lordly words  not a single commonplace name among them—not a brown not a jones not a robinson they are all names that one would stop and look at on a doorplate  now imagine if pepys had tried to clamber somehow into the enclosure of poetry what a blot would that word have made upon the list  the thing was impossible  in the first place a certain natural consciousness that men would have held him down to the level of his name would have prevented him from rising above the pepsine standard and so haply withheld him altogether from attempting verse next the booksellers would refuse to publish and the world to read them on the mere evidence of the fatal appellation  and now before i close this section i must say one word as to punnable names names that stand alone that have a significance and life apart from him that bears them  these are the bitterest of all  one friend of mine goes bowed and humbled through life under the weight of this misfortune for it is an awful thing when a man’s name is a joke when he cannot be mentioned without exciting merriment and when even the intimation of his death bids fair to carry laughter into many a home  so much for people who are badly named  now for people who are too well named who go topheavy from the font who are baptized into a false position and find themselves beginning life eclipsed under the fame of some of the great ones of the past  a man for instance called william shakespeare could never dare to write plays  he is thrown into too humbling an apposition with the author of hamlet  its own name coming after is such an anticlimax  ‘the plays of william shakespeare’ says the reader—‘o no  the plays of william shakespeare cockerill’ and he throws the book aside  in wise pursuance of such views mr john milton hengler who not long since delighted us in this favoured town has never attempted to write an epic but has chosen a new path and has excelled upon the tightrope  a marked example of triumph over this is the case of mr dante gabriel rossetti  on the face of the matter i should have advised him to imitate the pleasing modesty of the lastnamed gentleman and confine his ambition to the sawdust  but mr rossetti has triumphed he has even dared to translate from his mighty namefather and the voice of fame supports him in his boldness  dear readers one might write a year upon this matter  a lifetime of comparison and research could scarce suffice for its elucidation  so here if it please you we shall let it rest  slight as these notes have been i would that the great founder of the system had been alive to see them  how he had warmed and brightened how his persuasive eloquence would have fallen on the ears of toby and what a letter of praise and sympathy would not the editor have received before the month was out alas the thing was not to be  walter shandy died and was duly buried while yet his theory lay forgotten and neglected by his fellowcountrymen  but reader the day will come i hope when a paternal government will stamp out as seeds of national weakness all depressing patronymics and when godfathers and godmothers will soberly and earnestly debate the interest of the nameless one and not rush blindfold to the christening  in these days there shall be written a ‘godfather’s assistant’ in shape of a dictionary of names with their concomitant virtues and vices and this book shall be scattered broadcast through the land and shall be on the table of every one eligible for godfathership until such a thing as a vicious or untoward appellation shall have ceased from off the face of the earth     criticisms   chapter i—lord lytton’s ‘fables in song’   it seems as if lord lytton in this new book of his had found the form most natural to his talent  in some ways indeed it may be held inferior to chronicles and characters we look in vain for anything like the terrible intensity of the nightscene in irene or for any such passages of massive and memorable writing as appeared here and there in the earlier work and made it not altogether unworthy of its model hugo’s legend of the ages  but it becomes evident on the most hasty retrospect that this earlier work was a step on the way towards the later  it seems as if the author had been feeling about for his definite medium and was already in the language of the child’s game growing hot  there are many pieces in chronicles and characters that might be detached from their original setting and embodied as they stand among the fables in song  for the term fable is not very easy to define rigorously  in the most typical form some moral precept is set forth by means of a conception purely fantastic and usually somewhat trivial into the bargain there is something playful about it that will not support a very exacting criticism and the lesson must be apprehended by the fancy at half a hint  such is the great mass of the old stories of wise animals or foolish men that have amused our childhood  but we should expect the fable in company with other and more important literary forms to be more and more loosely or at least largely comprehended as time went on and so to degenerate in conception from this original type  that depended for much of its piquancy on the very fact that it was fantastic the point of the thing lay in a sort of humorous inappropriateness and it is natural enough that pleasantry of this description should become less common as men learn to suspect some serious analogy underneath thus a comical story of an ape touches us quite differently after the proposition of mr darwin’s theory  moreover there lay perhaps at the bottom of this primitive sort of fable a humanity a tenderness of rough truths so that at the end of some story in which vice or folly had met with its destined punishment the fabulist might be able to assure his auditors as we have often to assure tearful children on the like occasions that they may dry their eyes for none of it was true  but this benefit of fiction becomes lost with more sophisticated hearers and authors a man is no longer the dupe of his own artifice and cannot deal playfully with truths that are a matter of bitter concern to him in his life  and hence in the progressive centralisation of modern thought we should expect the old form of fable to fall gradually into desuetude and be gradually succeeded by another which is a fable in all points except that it is not altogether fabulous  and this new form such as we should expect and such as we do indeed find still presents the essential character of brevity as in any other fable also there is underlying and animating the brief action a moral idea and as in any other fable the object is to bring this home to the reader through the intellect rather than through the feelings so that without being very deeply moved or interested by the characters of the piece we should recognise vividly the hinges on which the little plot revolves  but the fabulist now seeks analogies where before he merely sought humorous situations  there will be now a logical nexus between the moral expressed and the machinery employed to express it  the machinery in fact as this change is developed becomes less and less fabulous  we find ourselves in presence of quite a serious if quite a miniature division of creative literature and sometimes we have the lesson embodied in a sober everyday narration as in the parables of the new testament and sometimes merely the statement or at most the collocation of significant facts in life the reader being left to resolve for himself the vague troublesome and not yet definitely moral sentiment which has been thus created  and step by step with the development of this change yet another is developed the moral tends to become more indeterminate and large  it ceases to be possible to append it in a tag to the bottom of the piece as one might write the name below a caricature and the fable begins to take rank with all other forms of creative literature as something too ambitious in spite of its miniature dimensions to be resumed in any succinct formula without the loss of all that is deepest and most suggestive in it  now it is in this widest sense that lord lytton understands the term there are examples in his two pleasant volumes of all the forms already mentioned and even of another which can only be admitted among fables by the utmost possible leniency of construction  ‘composure’ ‘et cætera’ and several more are merely similes poetically elaborated  so too is the pathetic story of the grandfather and grandchild the child having treasured away an icicle and forgotten it for ten minutes comes back to find it already nearly melted and no longer beautiful at the same time the grandfather has just remembered and taken out a bundle of loveletters which he too had stored away in years gone by and then long neglected and behold the letters are as faded and sorrowfully disappointing as the icicle  this is merely a simile poetically worked out and yet it is in such as these and some others to be mentioned further on that the author seems at his best  wherever he has really written after the old model there is something to be deprecated in spite of all the spirit and freshness in spite of his happy assumption of that cheerful acceptation of things as they are which rightly or wrongly we come to attribute to the ideal fabulist there is ever a sense as of something a little out of place  a form of literature so very innocent and primitive looks a little overwritten in lord lytton’s conscious and highlycoloured style  it may be bad taste but sometimes we should prefer a few sentences of plain prose narration and a little bewick by way of tailpiece  so that it is not among those fables that conform most nearly to the old model but one had nearly said among those that most widely differ from it that we find the most satisfactory examples of the author’s manner  in the mere matter of ingenuity the metaphysical fables are the most remarkable such as that of the windmill who imagined that it was he who raised the wind or that of the grocer’s balance ‘cogito ergo sum’ who considered himself endowed with freewill reason and an infallible practical judgment until one fine day the police made a descent upon the shop and find the weights false and the scales unequal and the whole thing is broken up for old iron  capital fables also in the same ironical spirit are ‘prometheus unbound’ the tale of the vainglorying of a champagnecork and ‘teleology’ where a nettle justifies the ways of god to nettles while all goes well with it and upon a change of luck promptly changes its divinity  in all these there is still plenty of the fabulous if you will although even here there may be two opinions possible but there is another group of an order of merit perhaps still higher where we look in vain for any such playful liberties with nature  thus we have ‘conservation of force’ where a musician thinking of a certain picture improvises in the twilight a poet hearing the music goes home inspired and writes a poem and then a painter under the influence of this poem paints another picture thus lineally descended from the first  this is fiction but not what we have been used to call fable  we miss the incredible element the point of audacity with which the fabulist was wont to mock at his readers  and still more so is this the case with others  ‘the horse and the fly’ states one of the unanswerable problems of life in quite a realistic and straightforward way  a fly startles a cabhorse the coach is overset a newlymarried pair within and the driver a man with a wife and family are all killed  the horse continues to gallop off in the loose traces and ends the tragedy by running over an only child and there is some little pathetic detail here introduced in the telling that makes the reader’s indignation very whitehot against some one  it remains to be seen who that some one is to be the fly  nay but on closer inspection it appears that the fly actuated by maternal instinct was only seeking a place for her eggs is maternal instinct then ‘sole author of these mischiefs all’  ‘who’s in the right’ one of the best fables in the book is somewhat in the same vein  after a battle has been won a group of officers assemble inside a battery and debate together who should have the honour of the success the prince the general staff the cavalry the engineer who posted the battery in which they then stand talking are successively named the sergeant who pointed the guns sneers to himself at the mention of the engineer and close by the gunner who had applied the match passes away with a smile of triumph since it was through his hand that the victorious blow had been dealt  meanwhile the cannon claims the honour over the gunner the cannonball who actually goes forth on the dread mission claims it over the cannon who remains idly behind the powder reminds the cannonball that but for him it would still be lying on the arsenal floor and the match caps the discussion powder cannonball and cannon would be all equally vain and ineffectual without fire  just then there comes on a shower of rain which wets the powder and puts out the match and completes this lesson of dependence by indicating the negative conditions which are as necessary for any effect in their absence as is the presence of this great fraternity of positive conditions not any one of which can claim priority over any other  but the fable does not end here as perhaps in all logical strictness it should  it wanders off into a discussion as to which is the truer greatness that of the vanquished fire or that of the victorious rain and the speech of the rain is charming      ‘lo with my little drops i bless again     and beautify the fields which thou didst blast     rend wither waste and ruin what thou wilt     but call not greatness what the gods call guilt     blossoms and grass from blood in battle spilt     and poppied corn i bring     ‘mid mouldering babels to oblivion built     my violets spring     little by little my small drops have strength     to deck with green delights the grateful earth’  and so forth not quite germane it seems to me to the matter in hand but welcome for its own sake  best of all are the fables that deal more immediately with the emotions there is for instance that of ‘the two travellers’ which is profoundly moving in conception although by no means as well written as some others  in this one of the two fearfully frostbitten saves his life out of the snow at the cost of all that was comely in his body just as long before the other who has now quietly resigned himself to death had violently freed himself from love at the cost of all that was finest and fairest in his character  very graceful and sweet is the fable if so it should be called in which the author sings the praises of that ‘kindly perspective’ which lets a wheatstalk near the eye cover twenty leagues of distant country and makes the humble circle about a man’s hearth more to him than all the possibilities of the external world  the companion fable to this is also excellent  it tells us of a man who had all his life through entertained a passion for certain blue hills on the far horizon and had promised himself to travel thither ere he died and become familiar with these distant friends  at last in some political trouble he is banished to the very place of his dreams  he arrives there overnight and when he rises and goes forth in the morning there sure enough are the blue hills only now they have changed places with him and smile across to him distant as ever from the old home whence he has come  such a story might have been very cynically treated but it is not so done the whole tone is kindly and consolatory and the disenchanted man submissively takes the lesson and understands that things far away are to be loved for their own sake and that the unattainable is not truly unattainable when we can make the beauty of it our own  indeed throughout all these two volumes though there is much practical scepticism and much irony on abstract questions this kindly and consolatory spirit is never absent  there is much that is cheerful and after a sedate fireside fashion hopeful  no one will be discouraged by reading the book but the ground of all this hopefulness and cheerfulness remains to the end somewhat vague  it does not seem to arise from any practical belief in the future either of the individual or the race but rather from the profound personal contentment of the writer  this is i suppose all we must look for in the case  it is as much as we can expect if the fabulist shall prove a shrewd and cheerful fellowwayfarer one with whom the world does not seem to have gone much amiss but who has yet laughingly learned something of its evil  it will depend much of course upon our own character and circumstances whether the encounter will be agreeable and bracing to the spirits or offend us as an illtimed mockery  but where as here there is a little tincture of bitterness along with the goodnature where it is plainly not the humour of a man cheerfully ignorant but of one who looks on tolerant and superior and smilingly attentive upon the good and bad of our existence it will go hardly if we do not catch some reflection of the same spirit to help us on our way  there is here no impertinent and lying proclamation of peace—none of the cheap optimism of the welltodo what we find here is a view of life that would be even grievous were it not enlivened with this abiding cheerfulness and ever and anon redeemed by a stroke of pathos  it is natural enough i suppose that we should find wanting in this book some of the intenser qualities of the author’s work and their absence is made up for by much happy description after a quieter fashion  the burst of jubilation over the departure of the snow which forms the prelude to ‘the thistle’ is full of spirit and of pleasant images  the speech of the forest in ‘sans souci’ is inspired by a beautiful sentiment for nature of the modern sort and pleases us more i think as poetry should please us than anything in chronicles and characters  there are some admirable felicities of expression here and there as that of the hill whose summit               ‘did print     the azure air with pines’  moreover i do not recollect in the author’s former work any symptom of that sympathetic treatment of still life which is noticeable now and again in the fables and perhaps most noticeably when he sketches the burned letters as they hover along the gusty flue ‘thin sable veils wherein a restless spark yet trembled’  but the description is at its best when the subjects are unpleasant or even grisly  there are a few capital lines in this key on the last spasm of the battle before alluded to  surely nothing could be better in its own way than the fish in ‘the last cruise of the arrogant’ ‘the shadowy sidefaced silent things’ that come butting and staring with lidless eyes at the sunken steamengine  and although in yet another we are told pleasantly enough how the water went down into the valleys where it set itself gaily to saw wood and on into the plains where it would soberly carry grain to town yet the real strength of the fable is when it dealt with the shut pool in which certain unfortunate raindrops are imprisoned among slugs and snails and in the company of an old toad  the sodden contentment of the fallen acorn is strangely significant and it is astonishing how unpleasantly we are startled by the appearance of her horrible lover the maggot  and now for a last word about the style  this is not easy to criticise it is impossible to deny to it rapidity spirit and a full sound the lines are never lame and the sense is carried forward with an uninterrupted impetuous rush  but it is not equal  after passages of really admirable versification the author falls back upon a sort of loose cavalry manner not unlike the style of some of mr browning’s minor pieces and almost inseparable from wordiness and an easy acceptation of somewhat cheap finish  there is nothing here of that compression which is the note of a really sovereign style  it is unfair perhaps to set a not remarkable passage from lord lytton side by side with one of the signal masterpieces of another and a very perfect poet and yet it is interesting when we see how the portraiture of a dog detailed through thirty odd lines is frittered down and finally almost lost in the mere laxity of the style to compare it with the clear simple vigorous delineation that burns in four couplets has given us of the ploughman’s collie  it is interesting at first and then it becomes a little irritating for when we think of other passages so much more finished and adroit we cannot help feeling that with a little more ardour after perfection of form criticism would have found nothing left for her to censure  a similar mark of precipitate work is the number of adjectives tumultuously heaped together sometimes to help out the sense and sometimes as one cannot but suspect to help out the sound of the verses  i do not believe for instance that lord lytton himself would defend the lines in which we are told how laocoön ‘revealed to roman crowds now christian grown that pagan anguish which in parian stone the rhodian artist’ and so on  it is not only that this is bad in itself but that it is unworthy of the company in which it is found that such verses should not have appeared with the name of a good versifier like lord lytton  we must take exception also in conclusion to the excess of alliteration  alliteration is so liable to be abused that we can scarcely be too sparing of it and yet it is a trick that seems to grow upon the author with years  it is a pity to see fine verses such as some in ‘demos’ absolutely spoiled by the recurrence of one wearisome consonant    chapter ii—salvini’s macbeth   salvini closed his short visit to edinburgh by a performance of macbeth  it was perhaps from a sentiment of local colour that he chose to play the scottish usurper for the first time before scotsmen and the audience were not insensible of the privilege  few things indeed can move a stronger interest than to see a great creation taking shape for the first time  if it is not purely artistic the sentiment is surely human  and the thought that you are before all the world and have the start of so many others as eager as yourself at least keeps you in a more unbearable suspense before the curtain rises if it does not enhance the delight with which you follow the performance and see the actor ‘bend up each corporal agent’ to realise a masterpiece of a few hours’ duration  with a player so variable as salvini who trusts to the feelings of the moment for so much detail and who night after night does the same thing differently but always well it can never be safe to pass judgment after a single hearing  and this is more particularly true of last week’s macbeth for the whole third act was marred by a grievously humorous misadventure  several minutes too soon the ghost of banquo joined the party and after having sat helpless a while at a table was ignominiously withdrawn  twice was this ghostly jackinthebox obtruded on the stage before his time twice removed again and yet he showed so little hurry when he was really wanted that after an awkward pause macbeth had to begin his apostrophe to empty air the arrival of the belated spectre in the middle with a jerk that made him nod all over was the last accident in the chapter and worthily topped the whole  it may be imagined how lamely matters went throughout these cross purposes  in spite of this and some other hitches salvini’s macbeth had an emphatic success  the creation is worthy of a place beside the same artist’s othello and hamlet  it is the simplest and most unsympathetic of the three but the absence of the finer lineaments of hamlet is redeemed by gusto breadth and a headlong unity  salvini sees nothing great in macbeth beyond the royalty of muscle and that courage which comes of strong and copious circulation  the moral smallness of the man is insisted on from the first in the shudder of uncontrollable jealousy with which he sees duncan embracing banquo  he may have some northern poetry of speech but he has not much logical understanding  in his dealings with the supernatural powers he is like a savage with his fetich trusting them beyond bounds while all goes well and whenever he is crossed casting his belief aside and calling ‘fate into the list’ for his wife he is little more than an agent a frame of bone and sinew for her fiery spirit to command  the nature of his feeling towards her is rendered with a most precise and delicate touch  he always yields to the woman’s fascination and yet his caresses and we know how much meaning salvini can give to a caress are singularly hard and unloving sometimes he lays his hand on her as he might take hold of any one who happened to be nearest to him at a moment of excitement  love has fallen out of this marriage by the way and left a curious friendship  only once—at the very moment when she is showing herself so little a woman and so much a highspirited man—only once is he very deeply stirred towards her and that finds expression in the strange and horrible transport of admiration doubly strange and horrible on salvini’s lips—‘bring forth menchildren only’  the murder scene as was to be expected pleased the audience best macbeth’s voice in the talk with his wife was a thing not to be forgotten and when he spoke of his hangman’s hands he seemed to have blood in his utterance  never for a moment even in the very article of the murder does he possess his own soul  he is a man on wires  from first to last it is an exhibition of hideous cowardice  for after all it is not here but in broad daylight with the exhilaration of conflict where he can assure himself at every blow he has the longest sword and the heaviest hand that this man’s physical bravery can keep him up he is an unwieldy ship and needs plenty of way on before he will steer  in the banquet scene while the first murderer gives account of what he has done there comes a flash of truculent joy at the ‘twenty trenchèd gashes’ on banquo’s head  thus macbeth makes welcome to his imagination those very details of physical horror which are so soon to turn sour in him  as he runs out to embrace these cruel circumstances as he seeks to realise to his mind’s eye the reassuring spectacle of his dead enemy he is dressing out the phantom to terrify himself and his imagination playing the part of justice is to ‘commend to his own lips the ingredients of his poisoned chalice’  with the recollection of hamlet and his father’s spirit still fresh upon him and the holy awe with which that good man encountered things not dreamt of in his philosophy it was not possible to avoid looking for resemblances between the two apparitions and the two men haunted  but there are none to be found macbeth has a purely physical dislike for banquo’s spirit and the ‘twenty trenchèd gashes’  he is afraid of he knows not what  he is abject and again blustering  in the end he so far forgets himself his terror and the nature of what is before him that he rushes upon it as he would upon a man  when his wife tells him he needs repose there is something really childish in the way he looks about the room and seeing nothing with an expression of almost sensual relief plucks up heart enough to go to bed  and what is the upshot of the visitation  it is written in shakespeare but should be read with the commentary of salvini’s voice and expression—‘o siam nell’ opra ancor fanciulli’—‘we are yet but young in deed’  circle below circle  he is looking with horrible satisfaction into the mouth of hell  there may still be a prick today but tomorrow conscience will be dead and he may move untroubled in this element of blood  in the fifth act we see this lowest circle reached and it is salvini’s finest moment throughout the play  from the first he was admirably made up and looked macbeth to the full as perfectly as ever he looked othello  from the first moment he steps upon the stage you can see this character is a creation to the fullest meaning of the phrase for the man before you is a type you know well already  he arrives with banquo on the heath fair and redbearded sparing of gesture full of pride and the sense of animal wellbeing and satisfied after the battle like a beast who has eaten his fill  but in the fifth act there is a change this is still the big burly fleshly handsomelooking thane here is still the same face which in the earlier acts could be superficially goodhumoured and sometimes royally courteous  but now the atmosphere of blood which pervades the whole tragedy has entered into the man and subdued him to its own nature and an indescribable degradation a slackness and puffiness has overtaken his features  he has breathed the air of carnage and supped full of horrors  lady macbeth complains of the smell of blood on her hand macbeth makes no complaint—he has ceased to notice it now but the same smell is in his nostrils  a contained fury and disgust possesses him  he taunts the messenger and the doctor as people would taunt their mortal enemies  and indeed as he knows right well every one is his enemy now except his wife  about her he questions the doctor with something like a last human anxiety and in tones of grisly mystery asks him if he can ‘minister to a mind diseased’  when the news of her death is brought him he is staggered and falls into a seat but somehow it is not anything we can call grief that he displays  there had been two of them against god and man and now when there is only one it makes perhaps less difference than he had expected  and so her death is not only an affliction but one more disillusion and he redoubles in bitterness  the speech that follows given with tragic cynicism in every word is a dirge not so much for her as for himself  from that time forth there is nothing human left in him only ‘the fiend of scotland’ macduff’s ‘hellhound’ whom with a stern glee we see baited like a bear and hunted down like a wolf  he is inspired and set above fate by a demoniacal energy a lust of wounds and slaughter  even after he meets macduff his courage does not fail but when he hears the thane was not born of woman all virtue goes out of him and though he speaks sounding words of defiance the last combat is little better than a suicide  the whole performance is as i said so full of gusto and a headlong unity the personality of macbeth is so sharp and powerful and within these somewhat narrow limits there is so much play and saliency that so far as concerns salvini himself a third great success seems indubitable unfortunately however a great actor cannot fill more than a very small fraction of the boards and though banquo’s ghost will probably be more seasonable in his future apparitions there are some more inherent difficulties in the piece  the company at large did not distinguish themselves  macduff to the huge delight of the gallery outmacduff’d the average ranter  the lady who filled the principal female part has done better on other occasions but i fear she has not metal for what she tried last week  not to succeed in the sleepwalking scene is to make a memorable failure  as it was given it succeeded in being wrong in art without being true to nature  and there is yet another difficulty happily easy to reform which somewhat interfered with the success of the performance  at the end of the incantation scene the italian translator has made macbeth fall insensible upon the stage  this is a change of questionable propriety from a psychological point of view while in point of view of effect it leaves the stage for some moments empty of all business  to remedy this a bevy of green balletgirls came forth and pointed their toes about the prostrate king  a dance of high church curates or a hornpipe by mr t p cooke would not be more out of the key though the gravity of a scots audience was not to be overcome and they merely expressed their disapprobation by a round of moderate hisses a similar irruption of christmas fairies would most likely convulse a london theatre from pit to gallery with inextinguishable laughter  it is i am told the italian tradition but it is one more honoured in the breach than the observance with the total disappearance of these damsels with a stronger lady macbeth and if possible with some compression of those scenes in which salvini does not appear and the spectator is left at the mercy of macduffs and duncans the play would go twice as well and we should be better able to follow and enjoy an admirable work of dramatic art    chapter iii—bagster’s ‘pilgrim’s progress’   i have here before me an edition of the pilgrim’s progress bound in green without a date and described as ‘illustrated by nearly three hundred engravings and memoir of bunyan’  on the outside it is lettered ‘bagster’s illustrated edition’ and after the author’s apology facing the first page of the tale a folding pictorial ‘plan of the road’ is marked as ‘drawn by the late mr t conder’ and engraved by j basire no further information is anywhere vouchsafed perhaps the publishers had judged the work too unimportant and we are still left ignorant whether or not we owe the woodcuts in the body of the volume to the same hand that drew the plan  it seems however more than probable  the literal particularity of mind which in the map laid down the flowerplots in the devil’s garden and carefully introduced the courthouse in the town of vanity is closely paralleled in many of the cuts and in both the architecture of the buildings and the disposition of the gardens have a kindred and entirely english air  whoever he was the author of these wonderful little pictures may lay claim to be the best illustrator of bunyan 183  they are not only good illustrations like so many others but they are like so few good illustrations of bunyan  their spirit in defect and quality is still the same as his own  the designer also has lain down and dreamed a dream as literal as quaint and almost as apposite as bunyan’s and text and pictures make but the two sides of the same homespun yet impassioned story  to do justice to the designs it will be necessary to say for the hundredth time a word or two about the masterpiece which they adorn  all allegories have a tendency to escape from the purpose of their creators and as the characters and incidents become more and more interesting in themselves the moral which these were to show forth falls more and more into neglect  an architect may command a wreath of vineleaves round the cornice of a monument but if as each leaf came from the chisel it took proper life and fluttered freely on the wall and if the vine grew and the building were hidden over with foliage and fruit the architect would stand in much the same situation as the writer of allegories  the faëry queen was an allegory i am willing to believe but it survives as an imaginative tale in incomparable verse the case of bunyan is widely different and yet in this also allegory poor nymph although never quite forgotten is sometimes rudely thrust against the wall  bunyan was fervently in earnest with ‘his fingers in his ears he ran on’ straight for his mark  he tells us himself in the conclusion to the first part that he did not fear to raise a laugh indeed he feared nothing and said anything and he was greatly served in this by a certain rustic privilege of his style which like the talk of strong uneducated men when it does not impress by its force still charms by its simplicity  the mere story and the allegorical design enjoyed perhaps his equal favour  he believed in both with an energy of faith that was capable of moving mountains  and we have to remark in him not the parts where inspiration fails and is supplied by cold and merely decorative invention but the parts where faith has grown to be credulity and his characters become so real to him that he forgets the end of their creation  we can follow him step by step into the trap which he lays for himself by his own entire good faith and triumphant literality of vision till the trap closes and shuts him in an inconsistency  the allegories of the interpreter and of the shepherds of the delectable mountains are all actually performed like stageplays before the pilgrims  the son of mr greatgrace visibly ‘tumbles hills about with his words’  adam the first has his condemnation written visibly on his forehead so that faithful reads it  at the very instant the net closes round the pilgrims ‘the white robe falls from the black man’s body’  despair ‘getteth him a grievous crabtree cudgel’ it was in ‘sunshiny weather’ that he had his fits and the birds in the grove about the house beautiful ‘our country birds’ only sing their little pious verses ‘at the spring when the flowers appear and the sun shines warm’  ‘i often’ says piety ‘go out to hear them we also ofttimes keep them tame on our house’  the post between beulah and the celestial city sounds his horn as you may yet hear in country places  madam bubble that ‘tall comely dame something of a swarthy complexion in very pleasant attire but old’ ‘gives you a smile at the end of each sentence’—a real woman she we all know her  christiana dying ‘gave mr standfast a ring’ for no possible reason in the allegory merely because the touch was human and affecting  look at greatheart with his soldierly ways garrison ways as i had almost called them with his taste in weapons his delight in any that ‘he found to be a man of his hands’ his chivalrous point of honour letting giant maul get up again when he was down a thing fairly flying in the teeth of the moral above all with his language in the inimitable tale of mr fearing ‘i thought i should have lost my man’—‘chickenhearted’—‘at last he came in and i will say that for my lord he carried it wonderful lovingly to him’ this is no independent minister this is a stout honest bigbusted ancient adjusting his shoulderbelts twirling his long moustaches as he speaks  last and most remarkable ‘my sword’ says the dying valiantfortruth he in whom greatheart delighted ‘my sword i give to him that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage and my courage and skill to him that can get it’  and after this boast more arrogantly unorthodox than was ever dreamed of by the rejected ignorance we are told that ‘all the trumpets sounded for him on the other side’  in every page the book is stamped with the same energy of vision and the same energy of belief  the quality is equally and indifferently displayed in the spirit of the fighting the tenderness of the pathos the startling vigour and strangeness of the incidents the natural strain of the conversations and the humanity and charm of the characters trivial talk over a meal the dying words of heroes the delights of beulah or the celestial city apollyon and my lord hategood greatheart and mr worldlywiseman all have been imagined with the same clearness all written of with equal gusto and precision all created in the same mixed element of simplicity that is almost comical and art that for its purpose is faultless  it was in much the same spirit that our artist sat down to his drawings he is by nature a bunyan of the pencil  he too will draw anything from a butcher at work on a dead sheep up to the courts of heaven  ‘a lamb for supper’ is the name of one of his designs ‘their glorious entry’ of another  he has the same disregard for the ridiculous and enjoys somewhat of the same privilege of style so that we are pleased even when we laugh the most  he is literal to the verge of folly  if dust is to be raised from the unswept parlour you may be sure it will ‘fly abundantly’ in the picture  if faithful is to lie ‘as dead’ before moses dead he shall lie with a warrant—dead and stiff like granite nay and here the artist must enhance upon the symbolism of the author it is with the identical stone tables of the law that moses fells the sinner  good and bad people whom we at once distinguish in the text by their names hopeful honest and valiantfortruth on the one hand as against byends sir having greedy and the lord oldman on the other are in these drawings as simply distinguished by their costume  good people when not armed capàpie wear a speckled tunic girt about the waist and low hats apparently of straw  bad people swagger in tailcoats and chimneypots a few with kneebreeches but the large majority in trousers and for all the world like guests at a gardenparty  worldlywiseman alone by some inexplicable quirk stands before christian in laced hat embroidered waistcoat and trunkhose but above all examples of this artist’s intrepidity commend me to the print entitled ‘christian finds it deep’  ‘a great darkness and horror’ says the text have fallen on the pilgrim it is the comfortless deathbed with which bunyan so strikingly concludes the sorrows and conflicts of his hero  how to represent this worthily the artist knew not and yet he was determined to represent it somehow  this was how he did hopeful is still shown to his neck above the water of death but christian has bodily disappeared and a blot of solid blackness indicates his place  as you continue to look at these pictures about an inch square for the most part sometimes printed three or more to the page and each having a printed legend of its own however trivial the event recorded you will soon become aware of two things first that the man can draw and second that he possesses the gift of an imagination  ‘obstinate reviles’ says the legend and you should see obstinate reviling  ‘he warily retraces his steps’ and there is christian posting through the plain terror and speed in every muscle  ‘mercy yearns to go’ shows you a plain interior with packing going forward and right in the middle mercy yearning to go—every line of the girl’s figure yearning  in ‘the chamber called peace’ we see a simple english room bed with white curtains window valance and door as may be found in many thousand unpretentious houses but far off through the open window we behold the sun uprising out of a great plain and christian hails it with his hand      ‘where am i now is this the love and care     of jesus for the men that pilgrims are     thus to provide  that i should be forgiven     and dwell already the next door to heaven’  a page or two further from the top of the house beautiful the damsels point his gaze toward the delectable mountains ‘the prospect’ so the cut is ticketed—and i shall be surprised if on less than a square inch of paper you can show me one so wide and fair  down a cross road on an english plain a cathedral city outlined on the horizon a hazel shaw upon the left comes madam wanton dancing with her fair enchanted cup and faithful book in hand half pauses  the cut is perfect as a symbol the giddy movement of the sorceress the uncertain poise of the man struck to the heart by a temptation the contrast of that even plain of life whereon he journeys with the bold ideal bearing of the wanton—the artist who invented and portrayed this had not merely read bunyan he had also thoughtfully lived  the delectable mountains—i continue skimming the first part—are not on the whole happily rendered  once and once only the note is struck when christian and hopeful are seen coming shoulderhigh through a thicket of green shrubs—box perhaps or perfumed nutmeg while behind them domed or pointed the hills stand ranged against the sky  a little further and we come to that masterpiece of bunyan’s insight into life the enchanted ground where in a few traits he has set down the latter end of such a number of the wouldbe good where his allegory goes so deep that to people looking seriously on life it cuts like satire  the true significance of this invention lies of course far out of the way of drawing only one feature the great tedium of the land the growing weariness in welldoing may be somewhat represented in a symbol  the pilgrims are near the end ‘two miles yet’ says the legend  the road goes ploughing up and down over a rolling heath the wayfarers with outstretched arms are already sunk to the knees over the brow of the nearest hill they have just passed a milestone with the cipher two from overhead a great piled summer cumulus as of a slumberous summer afternoon beshadows them two miles it might be hundreds  in dealing with the land of beulah the artist lags in both parts miserably behind the text but in the distant prospect of the celestial city more than regains his own you will remember when christian and hopeful ‘with desire fell sick’ ‘effect of the sunbeams’ is the artist’s title  against the sky upon a cliffy mountain the radiant temple beams upon them over deep subjacent woods they behind a mound as if seeking shelter from the splendour—one prostrate on his face one kneeling and with hands ecstatically lifted—yearn with passion after that immortal city  turn the page and we behold them walking by the very shores of death heaven from this nigher view has risen halfway to the zenith and sheds a wider glory and the two pilgrims dark against that brightness walk and sing out of the fulness of their hearts  no cut more thoroughly illustrates at once the merit and the weakness of the artist  each pilgrim sings with a book in his grasp—a family bible at the least for bigness tomes so recklessly enormous that our second impulse is to laughter  and yet that is not the first thought nor perhaps the last  something in the attitude of the manikins—faces they have none they are too small for that—something in the way they swing these monstrous volumes to their singing something perhaps borrowed from the text some subtle differentiation from the cut that went before and the cut that follows after—something at least speaks clearly of a fearful joy of heaven seen from the deathbed of the horror of the last passage no less than of the glorious coming home there is that in the action of one of them which always reminds me with a difference of that haunting last glimpse of thomas idle travelling to tyburn in the cart  next come the shining ones wooden and trivial enough the pilgrims pass into the river the blot already mentioned settles over and obliterates christian  in two more cuts we behold them drawing nearer to the other shore and then between two radiant angels one of whom points upward we see them mounting in new weeds their former lendings left behind them on the inky river  more angels meet them heaven is displayed and if no better certainly no worse than it has been shown by others—a place at least infinitely populous and glorious with light—a place that haunts solemnly the hearts of children and then this symbolic draughtsman once more strikes into his proper vein  three cuts conclude the first part  in the first the gates close black against the glory struggling from within  the second shows us ignorance—alas poor arminian—hailing in a sad twilight the ferryman vainhope and in the third we behold him bound hand and foot and black already with the hue of his eternal fate carried high over the mountaintops of the world by two angels of the anger of the lord ‘carried to another place’ the artist enigmatically names his plate—a terrible design  wherever he touches on the black side of the supernatural his pencil grows more daring and incisive  he has many true inventions in the perilous and diabolic he has many startling nightmares realised  it is not easy to select the best some may like one and some another the nude depilated devil bounding and casting darts against the wicket gate the scroll of flying horrors that hang over christian by the mouth of hell the horned shade that comes behind him whispering blasphemies the daylight breaking through that rent cavemouth of the mountains and falling chill adown the haunted tunnel christian’s further progress along the causeway between the two black pools where at every yard or two a gin a pitfall or a snare awaits the passerby—loathsome white devilkins harbouring close under the bank to work the springes christian himself pausing and pricking with his sword’s point at the nearest noose and pale discomfortable mountains rising on the farther side or yet again the two illfavoured ones that beset the first of christian’s journey with the froglike structure of the skull the froglike limberness of limbs—crafty slippery lustfullooking devils drawn always in outline as though possessed of a dim infernal luminosity horrid fellows are they one and all horrid fellows and horrific scenes in another spirit that goodconscience ‘to whom mr honest had spoken in his lifetime’ a cowled grey awful figure one hand pointing to the heavenly shore realises i will not say all but some at least of the strange impressiveness of bunyan’s words  it is no easy nor pleasant thing to speak in one’s lifetime with goodconscience he is an austere unearthly friend whom maybe torquemada knew and the folds of his raiment are not merely claustral but have something of the horror of the pall  be not afraid however with the hand of that appearance mr honest will get safe across  yet perhaps it is in sequences that this artist best displays himself he loves to look at either side of a thing as for instance when he shows us both sides of the wall—‘grace inextinguishable’ on the one side with the devil vainly pouring buckets on the flame and ‘the oil of grace’ on the other where the holy spirit vessel in hand still secretly supplies the fire  he loves also to show us the same event twice over and to repeat his instantaneous photographs at the interval of but a moment  so we have first the whole troop of pilgrims coming up to valiant and greatheart to the front spear in hand and parleying and next the same crossroads from a more distant view the convoy now scattered and looking safely and curiously on and valiant handing over for inspection his ‘right jerusalem blade’  it is true that this designer has no great care after consistency apollyon’s spear is laid by his quiver of darts will disappear whenever they might hinder the designer’s freedom and the fiend’s tail is blobbed or forked at his good pleasure  but this is not unsuitable to the illustration of the fervent bunyan breathing hurry and momentary inspiration  he with his hot purpose hunting sinners with a lasso shall himself forget the things that he has written yesterday  he shall first slay heedless in the valley of the shadow and then take leave of him talking in his sleep as if nothing had happened in an arbour on the enchanted ground  and again in his rhymed prologue he shall assign some of the glory of the siege of doubting castle to his favourite valiantforthetruth who did not meet with the besiegers till long after at that dangerous corner by deadman’s lane  and with all inconsistencies and freedoms there is a power shown in these sequences of cuts a power of joining on one action or one humour to another a power of following out the moods even of the dismal subterhuman fiends engendered by the artist’s fancy a power of sustained continuous realisation step by step in nature’s order that can tell a story in all its ins and outs its pauses and surprises fully and figuratively like the art of words  one such sequence is the fight of christian and apollyon—six cuts weird and fiery like the text  the pilgrim is throughout a pale and stockish figure but the devil covers a multitude of defects  there is no better devil of the conventional order than our artist’s apollyon with his mane his wings his bestial legs his changing and terrifying expression his infernal energy to slay  in cut the first you see him afar off still obscure in form but already formidable in suggestion cut the second ‘the fiend in discourse’ represents him not reasoning railing rather shaking his spear at the pilgrim his shoulder advanced his tail writhing in the air his foot ready for a spring while christian stands back a little timidly defensive  the third illustrates these magnificent words ‘then apollyon straddled quite over the whole breadth of the way and said i am void of fear in this matter prepare thyself to die for i swear by my infernal den that thou shalt go no farther here will i spill thy soul  and with that he threw a flaming dart at his breast’  in the cut he throws a dart with either hand belching pointed flames out of his mouth spreading his broad vans and straddling the while across the path as only a fiend can straddle who has just sworn by his infernal den  the defence will not be long against such vice such flames such redhot nether energy  and in the fourth cut to be sure he has leaped bodily upon his victim sped by foot and pinion and roaring as he leaps  the fifth shows the climacteric of the battle christian has reached nimbly out and got his sword and dealt that deadly homethrust the fiend still stretched upon him but ‘giving back as one that had received his mortal wound’  the raised head the bellowing mouth the paw clapped upon the sword the one wing relaxed in agony all realise vividly these words of the text  in the sixth and last the trivial armed figure of the pilgrim is seen kneeling with clasped hands on the betrodden scene of contest and among the shivers of the darts while just at the margin the hinder quarters and the tail of apollyon are whisking off indignant and discounted  in one point only do these pictures seem to be unworthy of the text and that point is one rather of the difference of arts than the difference of artists  throughout his best and worst in his highest and most divine imaginations as in the narrowest sallies of his sectarianism the humanhearted piety of bunyan touches and ennobles convinces accuses the reader  through no art beside the art of words can the kindness of a man’s affections be expressed  in the cuts you shall find faithfully parodied the quaintness and the power the triviality and the surprising freshness of the author’s fancy there you shall find him outstripped in ready symbolism and the art of bringing things essentially invisible before the eyes but to feel the contact of essential goodness to be made in love with piety the book must be read and not the prints examined  farewell should not be taken with a grudge nor can i dismiss in any other words than those of gratitude a series of pictures which have to one at least been the visible embodiment of bunyan from childhood up and shown him through all his years greatheart lungeing at giant maul and apollyon breathing fire at christian and every turn and town along the road to the celestial city and that bright place itself seen as to a stave of music shining afar off upon the hilltop the candle of the world     sketches   i  the satirist   my companion enjoyed a cheap reputation for wit and insight  he was by habit and repute a satirist  if he did occasionally condemn anything or anybody who richly deserved it and whose demerits had hitherto escaped it was simply because he condemned everything and everybody  while i was with him he disposed of st paul with an epigram shook my reverence for shakespeare in a neat antithesis and fell foul of the almighty himself on the score of one or two out of the ten commandments  nothing escaped his blighting censure  at every sentence he overthrew an idol or lowered my estimation of a friend  i saw everything with new eyes and could only marvel at my former blindness  how was it possible that i had not before observed a’s false hair b’s selfishness or c’s boorish manners  i and my companion methought walked the streets like a couple of gods among a swarm of vermin for every one we saw seemed to bear openly upon his brow the mark of the apocalyptic beast  i half expected that these miserable beings like the people of lystra would recognise their betters and force us to the altar in which case warned by the late of paul and barnabas i do not know that my modesty would have prevailed upon me to decline  but there was no need for such churlish virtue  more blinded than the lycaonians the people saw no divinity in our gait and as our temporary godhead lay more in the way of observing than healing their infirmities we were content to pass them by in scorn  i could not leave my companion not from regard or even from interest but from a very natural feeling inseparable from the case  to understand it let us take a simile  suppose yourself walking down the street with a man who continues to sprinkle the crowd out of a flask of vitriol  you would be much diverted with the grimaces and contortions of his victims and at the same time you would fear to leave his arm until his bottle was empty knowing that when once among the crowd you would run a good chance yourself of baptism with his biting liquor  now my companion’s vitriol was inexhaustible  it was perhaps the consciousness of this the knowledge that i was being anointed already out of the vials of his wrath that made me fall to criticising the critic whenever we had parted  after all i thought our satirist has just gone far enough into his neighbours to find that the outside is false without caring to go farther and discover what is really true  he is content to find that things are not what they seem and broadly generalises from it that they do not exist at all  he sees our virtues are not what they pretend they are and on the strength of that he denies us the possession of virtue altogether  he has learnt the first lesson that no man is wholly good but he has not even suspected that there is another equally true to wit that no man is wholly bad  like the inmate of a coloured star he has eyes for one colour alone  he has a keen scent after evil but his nostrils are plugged against all good as people plugged their nostrils before going about the streets of the plaguestruck city  why does he do this  it is most unreasonable to flee the knowledge of good like the infection of a horrible disease and batten and grow fat in the real atmosphere of a lazarhouse  this was my first thought but my second was not like unto it and i saw that our satirist was wise wise in his generation like the unjust steward  he does not want light because the darkness is more pleasant  he does not wish to see the good because he is happier without it  i recollect that when i walked with him i was in a state of divine exaltation such as adam and eve must have enjoyed when the savour of the fruit was still unfaded between their lips and i recognise that this must be the man’s habitual state  he has the forbidden fruit in his waistcoat pocket and can make himself a god as often and as long as he likes  he has raised himself upon a glorious pedestal above his fellows he has touched the summit of ambition and he envies neither king nor kaiser prophet nor priest content in an elevation as high as theirs and much more easily attained  yes certes much more easily attained  he has not risen by climbing himself but by pushing others down  he has grown great in his own estimation not by blowing himself out and risking the fate of Æsop’s frog but simply by the habitual use of a diminishing glass on everybody else  and i think altogether that his is a better a safer and a surer recipe than most others  after all however looking back on what i have written i detect a spirit suspiciously like his own  all through i have been comparing myself with our satirist and all through i have had the best of the comparison  well well contagion is as often mental as physical and i do not think my readers who have all been under his lash will blame me very much for giving the headsman a mouthful of his own sawdust    ii  nuits blanches   if any one should know the pleasure and pain of a sleepless night it should be i  i remember so long ago the sickly child that woke from his few hours’ slumber with the sweat of a nightmare on his brow to lie awake and listen and long for the first signs of life among the silent streets  these nights of pain and weariness are graven on my mind and so when the same thing happened to me again everything that i heard or saw was rather a recollection than a discovery  weighed upon by the opaque and almost sensible darkness i listened eagerly for anything to break the sepulchral quiet  but nothing came save perhaps an emphatic crack from the old cabinet that was made by deacon brodie or the dry rustle of the coals on the extinguished fire it was a calm or i know that i should have heard in the roar and clatter of the storm as i have not heard it for so many years the wild career of a horseman always scouring up from the distance and passing swiftly below the window yet always returning again from the place whence first he came as though baffled by some higher power he had retraced his steps to gain impetus for another and another attempt  as i lay there there arose out of the utter stillness the rumbling of a carriage a very great way off that drew near and passed within a few streets of the house and died away as gradually as it had arisen  this too was as a reminiscence  i rose and lifted a corner of the blind  over the black belt of the garden i saw the long line of queen street with here and there a lighted window  how often before had my nurse lifted me out of bed and pointed them out to me while we wondered together if there also there were children that could not sleep and if these lighted oblongs were signs of those that waited like us for the morning  i went out into the lobby and looked down into the great deep well of the staircase  for what cause i know not just as it used to be in the old days that the feverish child might be the better served a peep of gas illuminated a narrow circle far below me  but where i was all was darkness and silence save the dry monotonous ticking of the clock that came ceaselessly up to my ear  the final crown of it all however the last touch of reproduction on the pictures of my memory was the arrival of that time for which all night through i waited and longed of old  it was my custom as the hours dragged on to repeat the question ‘when will the carts come in’ and repeat it again and again until at last those sounds arose in the street that i have heard once more this morning  the road before our house is a great thoroughfare for early carts  i know not and i never have known what they carry whence they come or whither they go  but i know that long ere dawn and for hours together they stream continuously past with the same rolling and jerking of wheels and the same clink of horses’ feet  it was not for nothing that they made the burthen of my wishes all night through  they are really the first throbbings of life the harbingers of day and it pleases you as much to hear them as it must please a shipwrecked seaman once again to grasp a hand of flesh and blood after years of miserable solitude  they have the freshness of the daylight life about them  you can hear the carters cracking their whips and crying hoarsely to their horses or to one another and sometimes even a peal of healthy harsh horselaughter comes up to you through the darkness  there is now an end of mystery and fear  like the knocking at the door in macbeth 205 or the cry of the watchman in the tour de nesle they show that the horrible cæsura is over and the nightmares have fled away because the day is breaking and the ordinary life of men is beginning to bestir itself among the streets  in the middle of it all i fell asleep to be wakened by the officious knocking at my door and i find myself twelve years older than i had dreamed myself all night    iii  the wreath of immortelles   it is all very well to talk of death as ‘a pleasant potion of immortality’ but the most of us i suspect are of ‘queasy stomachs’ and find it none of the sweetest 206a  the graveyard may be cloakroom to heaven but we must admit that it is a very ugly and offensive vestibule in itself however fair may be the life to which it leads  and though enoch and elias went into the temple through a gate which certainly may be called beautiful the rest of us have to find our way to it through ezekiel’s lowbowed door and the vault full of creeping things and all manner of abominable beasts  nevertheless there is a certain frame of mind to which a cemetery is if not an antidote at least an alleviation  if you are in a fit of the blues go nowhere else  it was in obedience to this wise regulation that the other morning found me lighting my pipe at the entrance to old greyfriars’ thoroughly sick of the town the country and myself  two of the men were talking at the gate one of them carrying a spade in hands still crusted with the soil of graves  their very aspect was delightful to me and i crept nearer to them thinking to pick up some snatch of sexton gossip some ‘talk fit for a charnel’ 206b something in fine worthy of that fastidious logician that adept in coroner’s law who has come down to us as the patron of yaughan’s liquor and the very prince of gravediggers  scots people in general are so much wrapped up in their profession that i had a good chance of overhearing such conversation the talk of fishmongers running usually on stockfish and haddocks while of the scots sexton i could repeat stories and speeches that positively smell of the graveyard  but on this occasion i was doomed to disappointment  my two friends were far into the region of generalities  their profession was forgotten in their electorship politics had engulfed the narrower economy of gravedigging  ‘na na’ said the one ‘ye’re a’ wrang’  ‘the english and irish churches’ answered the other in a tone as if he had made the remark before and it had been called in question—‘the english and irish churches have impoverished the country’  ‘such are the results of education’ thought i as i passed beside them and came fairly among the tombs  here at least there were no commonplace politics no diluted thismorning’s leader to distract or offend me  the old shabby church showed as usual its quaint extent of roofage and the relievo skeleton on one gable still blackened with the fire of thirty years ago  a chill dank mist lay over all  the old greyfriars’ churchyard was in perfection that morning and one could go round and reckon up the associations with no fear of vulgar interruption on this stone the covenant was signed  in that vault as the story goes john knox took hiding in some reformation broil  from that window burke the murderer looked out many a time across the tombs and perhaps o’ nights let himself down over the sill to rob some newmade grave certainly he would have a selection here  the very walks have been carried over forgotten restingplaces and the whole ground is uneven because as i was once quaintly told ‘when the wood rots it stands to reason the soil should fall in’ which from the law of gravitation is certainly beyond denial  but it is round the boundary that there are the finest tombs  the whole irregular space is as it were fringed with quaint old monuments rich in death’sheads and scythes and hourglasses and doubly rich in pious epitaphs and latin mottoes—rich in them to such an extent that their proper space has run over and they have crawled endlong up the shafts of columns and ensconced themselves in all sorts of odd corners among the sculpture  these tombs raise their backs against the rabble of squalid dwellinghouses and every here and there a clothespole projects between two monuments its fluttering trophy of white and yellow and red  with a grim irony they recall the banners in the invalides banners as appropriate perhaps over the sepulchres of tailors and weavers as these others above the dust of armies  why they put things out to dry on that particular morning it was hard to imagine the grass was grey with drops of rain the headstones black with moisture  yet in despite of weather and common sense there they hung between the tombs and beyond them i could see through open windows into miserable rooms where whole families were born and fed and slept and died  at one a girl sat singing merrily with her back to the graveyard and from another came the shrill tones of a scolding woman  every here and there was a town garden full of sickly flowers or a pile of crockery inside upon the windowseat  but you do not grasp the full connection between these houses of the dead and the living the unnatural marriage of stately sepulchres and squalid houses till lower down where the road has sunk far below the surface of the cemetery and the very roofs are scarcely on a level with its wall you observe that a proprietor has taken advantage of a tall monument and trained a chimneystack against its back  it startles you to see the red modern pots peering over the shoulder of the tomb  a man was at work on a grave his spade clinking away the drift of bones that permeates the thin brown soil but my first disappointment had taught me to expect little from greyfriars’ sextons and i passed him by in silence  a slater on the slope of a neighbouring roof eyed me curiously  a lean black cat looking as if it had battened on strange meats slipped past me  a little boy at a window put his finger to his nose in so offensive a manner that i was put upon my dignity and turned grandly off to read old epitaphs and peer through the gratings into the shadow of vaults  just then i saw two women coming down a path one of them old and the other younger with a child in her arms  both had faces eaten with famine and hardened with sin and both had reached that stage of degradation much lower in a woman than a man when all care for dress is lost  as they came down they neared a grave where some pious friend or relative had laid a wreath of immortelles and put a bell glass over it as is the custom  the effect of that ring of dull yellow among so many blackened and dusty sculptures was more pleasant than it is in modern cemeteries where every second mound can boast a similar coronal and here where it was the exception and not the rule i could even fancy the drops of moisture that dimmed the covering were the tears of those who laid it where it was  as the two women came up to it one of them kneeled down on the wet grass and looked long and silently through the clouded shade while the second stood above her gently oscillating to and fro to lull the muling baby  i was struck a great way off with something religious in the attitude of these two unkempt and haggard women and i drew near faster but still cautiously to hear what they were saying  surely on them the spirit of death and decay had descended i had no education to dread here should i not have a chance of seeing nature  alas a pawnbroker could not have been more practical and commonplace for this was what the kneeling woman said to the woman upright—this and nothing more ‘eh what extravagance’  o nineteenth century wonderful art thou indeed—wonderful but wearisome in thy stale and deadly uniformity  thy men are more like numerals than men  they must bear their idiosyncrasies or their professions written on a placard about their neck like the scenery in shakespeare’s theatre thy precepts of economy have pierced into the lowest ranks of life and there is now a decorum in vice a respectability among the disreputable a pure spirit of philistinism among the waifs and strays of thy bohemia for lo thy very gravediggers talk politics and thy castaways kneel upon new graves to discuss the cost of the monument and grumble at the improvidence of love  such was the elegant apostrophe that i made as i went out of the gates again happily satisfied in myself and feeling that i alone of all whom i had seen was able to profit by the silent poem of these green mounds and blackened headstones    iv  nurses   i knew one once and the room where lonely and old she waited for death  it was pleasant enough high up above the lane and looking forth upon a hillside covered all day with sheets and yellow blankets and with long lines of underclothing fluttering between the battered posts there were any number of cheap prints and a drawing by one of ‘her children’ and there were flowers in the window and a sickly canary withered into consumption in an ornamental cage  the bed with its checked coverlid was in a closet  a great bible lay on the table and her drawers were full of ‘scones’ which it was her pleasure to give to young visitors such as i was then  you may not think this a melancholy picture but the canary and the cat and the white mouse that she had for a while and that died were all indications of the want that ate into her heart  i think i know a little of what that old woman felt and i am as sure as if i had seen her that she sat many an hour in silent tears with the big bible open before her clouded eyes  if you could look back upon her life and feel the great chain that had linked her to one child after another sometimes to be wrenched suddenly through and sometimes which is infinitely worse to be torn gradually off through years of growing neglect or perhaps growing dislike  she had like the mother overcome that natural repugnance—repugnance which no man can conquer—towards the infirm and helpless mass of putty of the earlier stage  she had spent her best and happiest years in tending watching and learning to love like a mother this child with which she has no connection and to which she has no tie  perhaps she refused some sweetheart such things have been or put him off and off until he lost heart and turned to some one else all for fear of leaving this creature that had wound itself about her heart  and the end of it all—her month’s warning and a present perhaps and the rest of the life to vain regret or worse still to see the child gradually forgetting and forsaking her fostered in disrespect and neglect on the plea of growing manliness and at last beginning to treat her as a servant whom he had treated a few years before as a mother  she sees the bible or the psalmbook which with gladness and love unutterable in her heart she had bought for him years ago out of her slender savings neglected for some newer gift of his father lying in dust in the lumberroom or given away to a poor child and the act applauded for its unfeeling charity  little wonder if she becomes hurt and angry and attempts to tyrannise and to grasp her old power back again  we are not all patient grizzels by good fortune but the most of us human beings with feelings and tempers of our own  and so in the end behold her in the room that i described  very likely and very naturally in some fling of feverish misery or recoil of thwarted love she has quarrelled with her old employers and the children are forbidden to see her or to speak to her or at best she gets her rent paid and a little to herself and now and then her late charges are sent up with another nurse perhaps to pay her a short visit  how bright these visits seem as she looks forward to them on her lonely bed  how unsatisfactory their realisation when the forgetful child half wondering checks with every word and action the outpouring of her maternal love  how bitter and restless the memories that they leave behind  and for the rest what else has she—to watch them with eager eyes as they go to school to sit in church where she can see them every sunday to be passed some day unnoticed in the street or deliberately cut because the great man or the great woman are with friends before whom they are ashamed to recognise the old woman that loved them  when she goes home that night how lonely will the room appear to her perhaps the neighbours may hear her sobbing to herself in the dark with the fire burnt out for want of fuel and the candle still unlit upon the table  and it is for this that they live these quasimothers—mothers in everything but the travail and the thanks  it is for this that they have remained virtuous in youth living the dull life of a household servant it is for this that they refused the old sweetheart and have no fireside or offspring of their own  i believe in a better state of things that there will be no more nurses and that every mother will nurse her own offspring for what can be more hardening and demoralising than to call forth the tenderest feelings of a woman’s heart and cherish them yourself as long as you need them as long as your children require a nurse to love them and then to blight and thwart and destroy them whenever your own use for them is at an end this may be utopian but it is always a little thing if one mother or two mothers can be brought to feel more tenderly to those who share their toil and have no part in their reward    v  a character   the man has a red bloated face and his figure is short and squat  so far there is nothing in him to notice but when you see his eyes you can read in these hard and shallow orbs a depravity beyond measure depraved a thirst after wickedness the pure disinterested love of hell for its own sake  the other night in the street i was watching an omnibus passing with litup windows when i heard some one coughing at my side as though he would cough his soul out and turning round i saw him stopping under a lamp with a brown greatcoat buttoned round him and his whole face convulsed  it seemed as if he could not live long and so the sight set my mind upon a train of thought as i finished my cigar up and down the lighted streets  he is old but all these years have not yet quenched his thirst for evil and his eyes still delight themselves in wickedness  he is dumb but he will not let that hinder his foul trade or perhaps i should say his yet fouler amusement and he has pressed a slate into the service of corruption  look at him and he will sign to you with his bloated head and when you go to him in answer to the sign thinking perhaps that the poor dumb man has lost his way you will see what he writes upon his slate  he haunts the doors of schools and shows such inscriptions as these to the innocent children that come out  he hangs about picturegalleries and makes the noblest pictures the text for some silent homily of vice  his industry is a lesson to ourselves  is it not wonderful how he can triumph over his infirmities and do such an amount of harm without a tongue  wonderful industry—strange fruitless pleasureless toil  must not the very devil feel a soft emotion to see his disinterested and laborious service  ah but the devil knows better than this he knows that this man is penetrated with the love of evil and that all his pleasure is shut up in wickedness he recognises him perhaps as a fit type for mankind of his satanic self and watches over his effigy as we might watch over a favourite likeness  as the business man comes to love the toil which he only looked upon at first as a ladder towards other desires and less unnatural gratifications so the dumb man has felt the charm of his trade and fallen captivated before the eyes of sin  it is a mistake when preachers tell us that vice is hideous and loathsome for even vice has her hörsel and her devotees who love her for her own sake     the great north road   chapter i—nance at the ‘green dragon’   nance holdaway was on her knees before the fire blowing the green wood that voluminously smoked upon the dogs and only now and then shot forth a smothered flame her knees already ached and her eyes smarted for she had been some while at this ungrateful task but her mind was gone far away to meet the coming stranger  now she met him in the wood now at the castle gate now in the kitchen by candlelight each fresh presentment eclipsed the one before a form so elegant manners so sedate a countenance so brave and comely a voice so winning and resolute—sure such a man was never seen  the thickcoming fancies poured and brightened in her head like the smoke and flames upon the hearth  presently the heavy foot of her uncle jonathan was heard upon the stair and as he entered the room she bent the closer to her work  he glanced at the green fagots with a sneer and looked askance at the bed and the white sheets at the strip of carpet laid like an island on the great expanse of the stone floor and at the broken glazing of the casement clumsily repaired with paper  ‘leave that fire abe’ he cried  ‘what have i toiled all my life to turn innkeeper at the hind end  leave it abe i say’  ‘la uncle it doesn’t burn a bit it only smokes’ said nance looking up from her position  ‘you are come of decent people on both sides’ returned the old man ‘who are you to blow the coals for any robinrunagate  get up get on your hood make yourself useful and be off to the “green dragon”’  ‘i thought you was to go yourself’ nance faltered  ‘so did i’ quoth jonathan ‘but it appears i was mistook’  the very excess of her eagerness alarmed her and she began to hang back ‘i think i would rather not dear uncle’ she said  ‘night is at hand and i think dear i would rather not’  ‘now you look here’ replied jonathan ‘i have my lord’s orders have i not  little he gives me but it’s all my livelihood  and do you fancy if i disobey my lord i’m likely to turn round for a lass like you  no i’ve that hellfire of pain in my old knee i wouldn’t walk a mile not for king george upon his bended knees’  and he walked to the window and looked down the steep scarp to where the river foamed in the bottom of the dell  nance stayed for no more bidding  in her own room by the glimmer of the twilight she washed her hands and pulled on her sunday mittens adjusted her black hood and tied a dozen times its cherry ribbons and in less than ten minutes with a fluttering heart and excellently bright eyes she passed forth under the arch and over the bridge into the thickening shadows of the groves  a wellmarked wheeltrack conducted her  the wood which upon both sides of the river dell was a mere scrambling thicket of hazel hawthorn and holly boasted on the level of more considerable timber  beeches came to a good growth with here and there an oak and the track now passed under a high arcade of branches and now ran under the open sky in glades  as the girl proceeded these glades became more frequent the trees began again to decline in size and the wood to degenerate into furzy coverts  last of all there was a fringe of elders and beyond that the track came forth upon an open rolling moorland dotted with windbowed and scanty bushes and all golden brown with the winter like a grouse  right over against the girl the last red embers of the sunset burned under horizontal clouds the night fell clear and still and frosty and the track in low and marshy passages began to crackle under foot with ice  some half a mile beyond the borders of the wood the lights of the ‘green dragon’ hove in sight and running close beside them very faint in the dying dusk the pale ribbon of the great north road  it was the back of the posthouse that was presented to nance holdaway and as she continued to draw near and the night to fall more completely she became aware of an unusual brightness and bustle  a postchaise stood in the yard its lamps already lighted light shone hospitably in the windows and from the open door moving lights and shadows testified to the activity of servants bearing lanterns  the clank of pails the stamping of hoofs on the firm causeway the jingle of harness and last of all the energetic hissing of a groom began to fall upon her ear  by the stir you would have thought the mail was at the door but it was still too early in the night  the down mail was not due at the ‘green dragon’ for hard upon an hour the up mail from scotland not before two in the black morning  nance entered the yard somewhat dazzled  sam the tall ostler was polishing a curbchain wit sand the lantern at his feet letting up spouts of candlelight through the holes with which its conical roof was peppered  ‘hey miss’ said he jocularly ‘you won’t look at me any more now you have gentry at the castle’  her cheeks burned with anger  ‘that’s my lord’s chay’ the man continued nodding at the chaise ‘lord windermoor’s  came all in a fluster—dinner bowl of punch and put the horses to for all the world like a runaway match my dear—bar the bride he brought mr archer in the chay with him’  ‘is that holdaway’ cried the landlord from the lighted entry where he stood shading his eyes  ‘only me sir’ answered nance  ‘o you miss nance’ he said  ‘well come in quick my pretty  my lord is waiting for your uncle’  and he ushered nance into a room cased with yellow wainscot and lighted by tall candles where two gentlemen sat at a table finishing a bowl of punch  one of these was stout elderly and irascible with a face like a full moon well dyed with liquor thick tremulous lips a short purple hand in which he brandished a long pipe and an abrupt and gobbling utterance  this was my lord windermoor  in his companion nance beheld a younger man tall quiet grave demurely dressed and wearing his own hair  her glance but lighted on him and she flushed for in that second she made sure that she had twice betrayed herself—betrayed by the involuntary flash of her black eyes her secret impatience to behold this new companion and what was far worse betrayed her disappointment in the realisation of her dreams  he meanwhile as if unconscious continued to regard her with unmoved decorum  ‘o a man of wood’ thought nance  ‘what—what’ said his lordship  ‘who is this’  ‘if you please my lord i am holdaway’s niece’ replied nance with a curtsey  ‘should have been here himself’ observed his lordship  ‘well you tell holdaway that i’m aground not a stiver—not a stiver  i’m running from the beagles—going abroad tell holdaway  and he need look for no more wages glad of ’em myself if i could get ’em  he can live in the castle if he likes or go to the devil  o and here is mr archer and i recommend him to take him in—a friend of mine—and mr archer will pay as i wrote  and i regard that in the light of a precious good thing for holdaway let me tell you and a setoff against the wages’  ‘but o my lord’ cried nance ‘we live upon the wages and what are we to do without’  ‘what am i to do—what am i to do’ replied lord windermoor with some exasperation  ‘i have no wages  and there is mr archer  and if holdaway doesn’t like it he can go to the devil and you with him—and you with him’  ‘and yet my lord’ said mr archer ‘these good people will have as keen a sense of loss as you or i keener perhaps since they have done nothing to deserve it’  ‘deserve it’ cried the peer  ‘what  what  if a rascally highwayman comes up to me with a confounded pistol do you say that i’ve deserved it  how often am i to tell you sir that i was cheated—that i was cheated’  ‘you are happy in the belief’ returned mr archer gravely  ‘archer you would be the death of me’ exclaimed his lordship  ‘you know you’re drunk you know it sir and yet you can’t get up a spark of animation’  ‘i have drunk fair my lord’ replied the younger man ‘but i own i am conscious of no exhilaration’  ‘if you had as black a lookout as me sir’ cried the peer ‘you would be very glad of a little innocent exhilaration let me tell you  i am glad of it—glad of it and i only wish i was drunker  for let me tell you it’s a cruel hard thing upon a man of my time of life and my position to be brought down to beggary because the world is full of thieves and rascals—thieves and rascals  what  for all i know you may be a thief and a rascal yourself and i would fight you for a pinch of snuff—a pinch of snuff’ exclaimed his lordship  here mr archer turned to nance holdaway with a pleasant smile so full of sweetness kindness and composure that at one bound her dreams returned to her  ‘my good miss holdaway’ said he ‘if you are willing to show me the road i am even eager to be gone  as for his lordship and myself compose yourself there is no fear this is his lordship’s way’  ‘what what’ cried his lordship  ‘my way  ish no such a thing my way’  ‘come my lord’ cried archer ‘you and i very thoroughly understand each other and let me suggest it is time that both of us were gone  the mail will soon be due  here then my lord i take my leave of you with the most earnest assurance of my gratitude for the past and a sincere offer of any services i may be able to render in the future’  ‘archer’ exclaimed lord windermoor ‘i love you like a son  le’ ’s have another bowl’  ‘my lord for both our sakes you will excuse me’ replied mr archer ‘we both require caution we must both for some while at least avoid the chance of a pursuit’  ‘archer’ quoth his lordship ‘this is a rank ingratishood  what  i’m to go firing away in the dark in the cold po’chaise and not so much as a game of écarté possible unless i stop and play with the postillion the postillion and the whole country swarming with thieves and rascals and highwaymen’  ‘i beg your lordship’s pardon’ put in the landlord who now appeared in the doorway to announce the chaise ‘but this part of the north road is known for safety  there has not been a robbery to call a robbery this five years’ time  further south of course it’s nearer london and another story’ he added  ‘well then if that’s so’ concluded my lord ‘le’ ’s have t’other bowl and a pack of cards’  ‘my lord you forget’ said archer ‘i might still gain but it is hardly possible for me to lose’  ‘think i’m a sharper’ inquired the peer  ‘gen’leman’s parole’s all i ask’  but mr archer was proof against these blandishments and said farewell gravely enough to lord windermoor shaking his hand and at the same time bowing very low  ‘you will never know’ says he ‘the service you have done me’  and with that and before my lord had finally taken up his meaning he had slipped about the table touched nance lightly but imperiously on the arm and left the room  in face of the outbreak of his lordship’s lamentations she made haste to follow the truant    chapter ii—in which mr archer is installed   the chaise had been driven round to the front door the courtyard lay all deserted and only lit by a lantern set upon a windowsill  through this nance rapidly led the way and began to ascend the swellings of the moor with a heart that somewhat fluttered in her bosom  she was not afraid but in the course of these last passages with lord windermoor mr archer had ascended to that pedestal on which her fancy waited to instal him the reality she felt excelled her dreams and this cold night walk was the first romantic incident in her experience  it was the rule in these days to see gentlemen unsteady after dinner yet nance was both surprised and amused when her companion who had spoken so soberly began to stumble and waver by her side with the most airy divagations  sometimes he would get so close to her that she must edge away and at others lurch clear out of the track and plough among deep heather  his courtesy and gravity meanwhile remained unaltered  he asked her how far they had to go whether the way lay all upon the moorland and when he learned they had to pass a wood expressed his pleasure  ‘for’ said he ‘i am passionately fond of trees  trees and fair lawns if you consider of it rightly are the ornaments of nature as palaces and fine approaches—’  and here he stumbled into a patch of slough and nearly fell  the girl had hard work not to laugh but at heart she was lost in admiration for one who talked so elegantly  they had got to about a quarter of a mile from the ‘green dragon’ and were near the summit of the rise when a sudden rush of wheels arrested them  turning and looking back they saw the posthouse now much declined in brightness and speeding away northward the two tremulous bright dots of my lord windermoor’s chaiselamps  mr archer followed these yellow and unsteady stars until they dwindled into points and disappeared  ‘there goes my only friend’ he said  ‘death has cut off those that loved me and change of fortune estranged my flatterers and but for you poor bankrupt my life is as lonely as this moor’  the tone of his voice affected both of them  they stood there on the side of the moor and became thrillingly conscious of the void waste of the night without a feature for the eye and except for the fainting whisper of the carriagewheels without a murmur for the ear  and instantly like a mockery there broke out very far away but clear and jolly the note of the mailguard’s horn  ‘over the hills’ was his air it rose to the two watchers on the moor with the most cheerful sentiment of human company and travel and at the same time in and around the ‘green dragon’ it woke up a great bustle of lights running to and fro and clattering hoofs  presently after out of the darkness to southward the mail grew near with a growing rumble  its lamps were very large and bright and threw their radiance forward in overlapping cones the four cantering horses swarmed and steamed the body of the coach followed like a great shadow and this lit picture slid with a sort of ineffectual swiftness over the black field of night and was eclipsed by the buildings of the ‘green dragon’  mr archer turned abruptly and resumed his former walk only that he was now more steady kept better alongside his young conductor and had fallen into a silence broken by sighs  nance waxed very pitiful over his fate contrasting an imaginary past of courts and great society and perhaps the king himself with the tumbledown ruin in a wood to which she was now conducting him  ‘you must try sir to keep your spirits up’ said she  ‘to be sure this is a great change for one like you but who knows the future’  mr archer turned towards her in the darkness and she could clearly perceive that he smiled upon her very kindly  ‘there spoke a sweet nature’ said he ‘and i must thank you for these words  but i would not have you fancy that i regret the past for any happiness found in it or that i fear the simplicity and hardship of the country  i am a man that has been much tossed about in life now up now down and do you think that i shall not be able to support what you support—you who are kind and therefore know how to feel pain who are beautiful and therefore hope who are young and therefore or am i the more mistaken discontented’  ‘nay sir not that at least’ said nance ‘not discontented  if i were to be discontented how should i look those that have real sorrows in the face  i have faults enough but not that fault and i have my merits too for i have a good opinion of myself  but for beauty i am not so simple but that i can tell a banter from a compliment’  ‘nay nay’ said mr archer ‘i had half forgotten grief is selfish and i was thinking of myself and not of you or i had never blurted out so bold a piece of praise  ’tis the best proof of my sincerity  but come now i would lay a wager you are no coward’  ‘indeed sir i am not more afraid than another’ said nance  ‘none of my blood are given to fear’  ‘and you are honest’ he returned  ‘i will answer for that’ said she  ‘well then to be brave to be honest to be kind and to be contented since you say you are so—is not that to fill up a great part of virtue’  ‘i fear you are but a flatterer’ said nance but she did not say it clearly for what with bewilderment and satisfaction her heart was quite oppressed  there could be no harm certainly in these grave compliments but yet they charmed and frightened her and to find favour for reasons however obscure in the eyes of this elegant serious and most unfortunate young gentleman was a giddy elevation was almost an apotheosis for a country maid  but she was to be no more exercised for mr archer disclaiming any thought of flattery turned off to other subjects and held her all through the wood in conversation addressing her with an air of perfect sincerity and listening to her answers with every mark of interest  had open flattery continued nance would have soon found refuge in good sense but the more subtle lure she could not suspect much less avoid it was the first time she had ever taken part in a conversation illuminated by any ideas  all was then true that she had heard and dreamed of gentlemen they were a race apart like deities knowing good and evil  and then there burst upon her soul a divine thought hope’s glorious sunrise since she could understand since it seemed that she too even she could interest this sorrowful apollo might she not learn or was she not learning  would not her soul awake and put forth wings was she not in fact an enchanted princess waiting but a touch to become royal  she saw herself transformed radiantly attired but in the most exquisite taste her face grown longer and more refined her tint etherealised and she heard herself with delighted wonder talking like a book  meanwhile they had arrived at where the track comes out above the river dell and saw in front of them the castle faintly shadowed on the night covering with its broken battlements a bold projection of the bank and showing at the extreme end where were the habitable tower and wing some crevices of candlelight  hence she called loudly upon her uncle and he was seen to issue lantern in hand from the tower door and where the ruins did not intervene to pick his way over the swarded courtyard avoiding treacherous cellars and winding among blocks of fallen masonry the arch of the great gate was still entire flanked by two tottering bastions and it was here that jonathan met them standing at the edge of the bridge bent somewhat forward and blinking at them through the glow of his own lantern  mr archer greeted him with civility but the old man was in no humour of compliance  he guided the newcomer across the courtyard looking sharply and quickly in his face and grumbling all the time about the cold and the discomfort and dilapidation of the castle  he was sure he hoped that mr archer would like it but in truth he could not think what brought him there  doubtless he had a good reason—this with a look of cunning scrutiny—but indeed the place was quite unfit for any person of repute he himself was eaten up with the rheumatics  it was the most rheumaticky place in england and some fine day the whole habitable part to call it habitable would fetch away bodily and go down the slope into the river  he had seen the cracks widening there was a plaguy issue in the bank below he thought a spring was mining it it might be tomorrow it might be next day but they were all sure of a comedown sooner or later  ‘and that is a poor death’ said he ‘for any one let alone a gentleman to have a whole old ruin dumped upon his belly  have a care to your left there these cellar vaults have all broke down and the grass and hemlock hide ’em  well sir here is welcome to you such as it is and wishing you well away’  and with that jonathan ushered his guest through the tower door and down three steps on the left hand into the kitchen or common room of the castle  it was a huge low room as large as a meadow occupying the whole width of the habitable wing with six barred windows looking on the court and two into the river valley  a dresser a table and a few chairs stood dotted here and there upon the uneven flags  under the great chimney a good fire burned in an iron firebasket a high old settee rudely carved with figures and gothic lettering flanked it on either side there was a hinge table and a stone bench in the chimney corner and above the arch hung guns axes lanterns and great sheaves of rusty keys  jonathan looked about him holding up the lantern and shrugged his shoulders with a pitying grimace  ‘here it is’ he said  ‘see the damp on the floor look at the moss where there’s moss you may be sure that it’s rheumaticky  try and get near that fire for to warm yourself it’ll blow the coat off your back  and with a young gentleman with a face like yours as pale as a tallowcandle i’d be afeard of a churchyard cough and a galloping decline’ says jonathan naming the maladies with gloomy gusto ‘or the cold might strike and turn your blood’ he added  mr archer fairly laughed  ‘my good mr holdaway’ said he ‘i was born with that same tallowcandle face and the only fear that you inspire me with is the fear that i intrude unwelcomely upon your private hours  but i think i can promise you that i am very little troublesome and i am inclined to hope that the terms which i can offer may still pay you the derangement’  ‘yes the terms’ said jonathan ‘i was thinking of that  as you say they are very small’ and he shook his head  ‘unhappily i can afford no more’ said mr archer  ‘but this we have arranged already’ he added with a certain stiffness ‘and as i am aware that miss holdaway has matter to communicate i will if you permit retire at once  tonight i must bivouac tomorrow my trunk is to follow from the “dragon”  so if you will show me to my room i shall wish you a good slumber and a better awakening’  jonathan silently gave the lantern to nance and she turning and curtseying in the doorway proceeded to conduct their guest up the broad winding staircase of the tower  he followed with a very brooding face  ‘alas’ cried nance as she entered the room ‘your fire black out’ and setting down the lantern she clapped upon her knees before the chimney and began to rearrange the charred and still smouldering remains  mr archer looked about the gaunt apartment with a sort of shudder  the great height the bare stone the shattered windows the aspect of the uncurtained bed with one of its four fluted columns broken short all struck a chill upon his fancy  from this dismal survey his eyes returned to nance crouching before the fire the candle in one hand and artfully puffing at the embers the flames as they broke forth played upon the soft outline of her cheek—she was alive and young coloured with the bright hues of life and a woman  he looked upon her softening and then sat down and continued to admire the picture  ‘there sir’ said she getting upon her feet ‘your fire is doing bravely now  goodnight’  he rose and held out his hand  ‘come’ said he ‘you are my only friend in these parts and you must shake hands’  she brushed her hand upon her skirt and offered it blushing  ‘god bless you my dear’ said he  and then when he was alone he opened one of the windows and stared down into the dark valley  a gentle wimpling of the river among stones ascended to his ear the trees upon the other bank stood very black against the sky farther away an owl was hooting  it was dreary and cold and as he turned back to the hearth and the fine glow of fire ‘heavens’ said he to himself ‘what an unfortunate destiny is mine’  he went to bed but sleep only visited his pillow in uneasy snatches outbreaks of loud speech came up the staircase he heard the old stones of the castle crack in the frosty night with sharp reverberations and the bed complained under his tossings  lastly far on into the morning he awakened from a doze to hear very far off in the extreme and breathless quiet a wailing flourish on the horn  the down mail was drawing near to the ‘green dragon’  he sat up in bed the sound was tragical by distance and the modulation appealed to his ear like human speech  it seemed to call upon him with a dreary insistence—to call him far away to address him personally and to have a meaning that he failed to seize  it was thus at least in this nodding castle in a cold miry woodland and so far from men and society that the traffic on the great north road spoke to him in the intervals of slumber    chapter iii—jonathan holdaway   nance descended the tower stair pausing at every step  she was in no hurry to confront her uncle with bad news and she must dwell a little longer on the rich note of mr archer’s voice the charm of his kind words and the beauty of his manner and person  but once at the stairfoot she threw aside the spell and recovered her sensible and workaday self  jonathan was seated in the middle of the settle a mug of ale beside him in the attitude of one prepared for trouble but he did not speak and suffered her to fetch her supper and eat of it with a very excellent appetite in silence  when she had done she too drew a tankard of homebrewed and came and planted herself in front of him upon the settle  ‘well’ said jonathan  ‘my lord has run away’ said nance  ‘what’ cried the old man  ‘abroad’ she continued ‘run away from creditors  he said he had not a stiver but he was drunk enough  he said you might live on in the castle and mr archer would pay you but you was to look for no more wages since he would be glad of them himself’  jonathan’s face contracted the flush of a black bilious anger mounted to the roots of his hair he gave an inarticulate cry leapt upon his feet and began rapidly pacing the stone floor  at first he kept his hands behind his back in a tight knot then he began to gesticulate as he turned  ‘this man—this lord’ he shouted ‘who is he  he was born with a gold spoon in his mouth and i with a dirty straw  he rolled in his coach when he was a baby  i have dug and toiled and laboured since i was that high—that high’  and he shouted again  ‘i’m bent and broke and full of pains  d’ ye think i don’t know the taste of sweat  many’s the gallon i’ve drunk of it—ay in the midwinter toiling like a slave  all through what has my life been  bend bend bend my old creaking back till it would ache like breaking wade about in the foul mire never a dry stitch empty belly sore hands hat off to my lord redface kicks and ha’pence and now here at the hind end when i’m worn to my poor bones a kick and done with it’  he walked a little while in silence and then extending his hand ‘now you nance holdaway’ says he ‘you come of my blood and you’re a good girl  when that man was a boy i used to carry his gun for him  i carried the gun all day on my two feet and many a stitch i had and chewed a bullet for  he rode upon a horse with feathers in his hat but it was him that had the shots and took the game home  did i complain  not i  i knew my station  what did i ask but just the chance to live and die honest  nance holdaway don’t let them deny it to me—don’t let them do it  i’ve been as poor as job and as honest as the day but now my girl you mark these words of mine i’m getting tired of it’  ‘i wouldn’t say such words at least’ said nance  ‘you wouldn’t’ said the old man grimly  ‘well and did i when i was your age  wait till your back’s broke and your hands tremble and your eyes fail and you’re weary of the battle and ask no more but to lie down in your bed and give the ghost up like an honest man and then let there up and come some insolent ungodly fellow—ah if i had him in these hands  “where’s my money that you gambled” i should say  “where’s my money that you drank and diced”  “thief” is what i would say “thief”’ he roared ‘“thief”’  ‘mr archer will hear you if you don’t take care’ said nance ‘and i would be ashamed for one that he should hear a brave old honest hardworking man like jonathan holdaway talk nonsense like a boy’  ‘d’ ye think i mind for mr archer’ he cried shrilly with a clack of laughter and then he came close up to her stooped down with his two palms upon his knees and looked her in the eyes with a strange hard expression something like a smile  ‘do i mind for god my girl’ he said ‘that’s what it’s come to be now do i mind for god’  ‘uncle jonathan’ she said getting up and taking him by the arm ‘you sit down again where you were sitting  there sit still i’ll have no more of this you’ll do yourself a mischief  come take a drink of this good ale and i’ll warm a tankard for you  la we’ll pull through you’ll see  i’m young as you say and it’s my turn to carry the bundle and don’t you worry your bile or we’ll have sickness too as well as sorrow’  ‘d’ ye think that i’d forgotten you’ said jonathan with something like a groan and thereupon his teeth clicked to and he sat silent with the tankard in his hand and staring straight before him  ‘why’ says nance setting on the ale to mull ‘men are always children they say however old and if ever i heard a thing like this to set to and make yourself sick just when the money’s failing  keep a good heart up you haven’t kept a good heart these seventy years nigh hand to break down about a pound or two  here’s this mr archer come to lodge that you disliked so much  well now you see it was a clear providence come let’s think upon our mercies  and here is the ale mulling lovely smell of it i’ll take a drop myself it smells so sweet  and uncle jonathan you let me say one word  you’ve lost more than money before now you lost my aunt and bore it like a man  bear this’  his face once more contracted his fist doubled and shot forth into the air and trembled  ‘let them look out’ he shouted  ‘here i warn all men i’ve done with this foul kennel of knaves  let them look out’  ‘hush hush for pity’s sake’ cried nance  and then all of a sudden he dropped his face into his hands and broke out with a great hiccoughing dry sob that was horrible to hear  ‘o’ he cried ‘my god if my son hadn’t left me if my dick was here’ and the sobs shook him nance sitting still and watching him with distress  ‘o if he were here to help his father’ he went on again  ‘if i had a son like other fathers he would save me now when all is breaking down o he would save me  ay but where is he  raking taverns a thief perhaps my curse be on him’ he added rising again into wrath  ‘hush’ cried nance springing to her feet ‘your boy your dead wife’s boy—aunt susan’s baby that she loved—would you curse him  o god forbid’  the energy of her address surprised him from his mood  he looked upon her tearless and confused  ‘let me go to my bed’ he said at last and he rose and shaking as with ague but quite silent lighted his candle and left the kitchen  poor nance the pleasant current of her dreams was all diverted  she beheld a golden city where she aspired to dwell she had spoken with a deity and had told herself that she might rise to be his equal and now the earthly ligaments that bound her down had been tightened  she was like a tree looking skyward her roots were in the ground  it seemed to her a thing so coarse so rustic to be thus concerned about a loss in money when mr archer fallen from the skylevel of counts and nobles faced his changed destiny with so immovable a courage  to weary of honesty that at least no one could do but even to name it was already a disgrace and she beheld in fancy her uncle and the young lad all laced and feathered hand upon hip bestriding his small horse  the opposition seemed to perpetuate itself from generation to generation one side still doomed to the clumsy and the servile the other born to beauty  she thought of the golden zones in which gentlemen were bred and figured with so excellent a grace zones in which wisdom and smooth words white linen and slim hands were the mark of the desired inhabitants where low temptations were unknown and honesty no virtue but a thing as natural as breathing    chapter iv—mingling threads   it was nearly seven before mr archer left his apartment  on the landing he found another door beside his own opening on a roofless corridor and presently he was walking on the top of the ruins  on one hand he could look down a good depth into the green courtyard on the other his eye roved along the downward course of the river the wet woods all smoking the shadows long and blue the mists golden and rosy in the sun here and there the water flashing across an obstacle  his heart expanded and softened to a grateful melancholy and with his eye fixed upon the distance and no thought of present danger he continued to stroll along the elevated and treacherous promenade  a terrorstricken cry rose to him from the courtyard  he looked down and saw in a glimpse nance standing below with hands clasped in horror and his own foot trembling on the margin of a gulf  he recoiled and leant against a pillar quaking from head to foot and covering his face with his hands and nance had time to run round by the stair and rejoin him where he stood before he had changed a line of his position  ‘ah’ he cried and clutched her wrist ‘don’t leave me  the place rocks i have no head for altitudes’  ‘sit down against that pillar’ said nance  ‘don’t you be afraid i won’t leave you and don’t look up or down look straight at me  how white you are’  ‘the gulf’ he said and closed his eyes again and shuddered  ‘why’ said nance ‘what a poor climber you must be  that was where my cousin dick used to get out of the castle after uncle jonathan had shut the gate  i’ve been down there myself with him helping me  i wouldn’t try with you’ she said and laughed merrily  the sound of her laughter was sincere and musical and perhaps its beauty barbed the offence to mr archer  the blood came into his face with a quick jet and then left it paler than before  ‘it is a physical weakness’ he said harshly ‘and very droll no doubt but one that i can conquer on necessity  see i am still shaking  well i advance to the battlements and look down  show me your cousin’s path’  ‘he would go surefoot along that little ledge’ said nance pointing as she spoke ‘then out through the breach and down by yonder buttress  it is easier coming back of course because you see where you are going from the buttress foot a sheepwalk goes along the scarp—see you can follow it from here in the dry grass  and now sir’ she added with a touch of womanly pity ‘i would come away from here if i were you for indeed you are not fit’  sure enough mr archer’s pallor and agitation had continued to increase his cheeks were deathly his clenched fingers trembled pitifully  ‘the weakness is physical’ he sighed and had nearly fallen  nance led him from the spot and he was no sooner back in the towerstair than he fell heavily against the wall and put his arm across his eyes  a cup of brandy had to be brought him before he could descend to breakfast and the perfection of nance’s dream was for the first time troubled  jonathan was waiting for them at table with yellow bloodshot eyes and a peculiar dusky complexion  he hardly waited till they found their seats before raising one hand and stooping with his mouth above his plate he put up a prayer for a blessing on the food and a spirit of gratitude in the eaters and thereupon and without more civility fell to  but it was notable that he was no less speedily satisfied than he had been greedy to begin  he pushed his plate away and drummed upon the table  ‘these are silly prayers’ said he ‘that they teach us  eat and be thankful that’s no such wonder  speak to me of starving—there’s the touch  you’re a man they tell me mr archer that has met with some reverses’  ‘i have met with many’ replied mr archer  ‘ha’ said jonathan  ‘none reckons but the last  now see i tried to make this girl here understand me’  ‘uncle’ said nance ‘what should mr archer care for your concerns  he hath troubles of his own and came to be at peace i think’  ‘i tried to make her understand me’ repeated jonathan doggedly ‘and now i’ll try you  do you think this world is fair’  ‘fair and false’ quoth mr archer  the old man laughed immoderately  ‘good’ said he ‘very good but what i mean is this do you know what it is to get up early and go to bed late and never take so much as a holiday but four and one of these your own marriage day and the other three the funerals of folk you loved and all that to have a quiet old age in shelter and bread for your old belly and a bed to lay your crazy bones upon with a clear conscience’  ‘sir’ said mr archer with an inclination of his head ‘you portray a very brave existence’  ‘well’ continued jonathan ‘and in the end thieves deceive you thieves rob and rook you thieves turn you out in your old age and send you begging  what have you got for all your honesty  a fine return  you that might have stole scores of pounds there you are out in the rain with your rheumatics’  mr archer had forgotten to eat with his hand upon his chin he was studying the old man’s countenance  ‘and you conclude’ he asked  ‘conclude’ cried jonathan  ‘i conclude i’ll be upsides with them’  ‘ay’ said the other ‘we are all tempted to revenge’  ‘you have lost money’ asked jonathan  ‘a great estate’ said archer quietly  ‘see now’ says jonathan ‘and where is it’  ‘nay i sometimes think that every one has had his share of it but me’ was the reply  ‘all england hath paid his taxes with my patrimony i was a sheep that left my wool on every briar’  ‘and you sit down under that’ cried the old man  ‘come now mr archer you and me belong to different stations and i know mine—no man better—but since we have both been rooked and are both sore with it why here’s my hand with a very good heart and i ask for yours and no offence i hope’  ‘there is surely no offence my friend’ returned mr archer as they shook hands across the table ‘for believe me my sympathies are quite acquired to you  this life is an arena where we fight with beasts and indeed’ he added sighing ‘i sometimes marvel why we go down to it unarmed’  in the meanwhile a creaking of ungreased axles had been heard descending through the wood and presently after the door opened and the tall ostler entered the kitchen carrying one end of mr archer’s trunk  the other was carried by an aged beggar man of that district known and welcome for some twenty miles about under the name of ‘old cumberland’ each was soon perched upon a settle with a cup of ale and the ostler who valued himself upon his affability began to entertain the company still with half an eye on nance to whom in gallant terms he expressly dedicated every sip of ale  first he told of the trouble they had to get his lordship started in the chaise and how he had dropped a rouleau of gold on the threshold and the passage and doorstep had been strewn with guineapieces  at this old jonathan looked at mr archer  next the visitor turned to news of a more thrilling character how the down mail had been stopped again near grantham by three men on horseback—a white and two bays how they had handkerchiefs on their faces how tom the guard’s blunderbuss missed fire but he swore he had winged one of them with a pistol and how they had got clean away with seventy pounds in money some valuable papers and a watch or two  ‘brave brave’ cried jonathan in ecstasy  ‘seventy pounds  o it’s brave’  ‘well i don’t see the great bravery’ observed the ostler misapprehending him  ‘three men and you may call that three to one i’ll call it brave when some one stops the mail singlehanded that’s a risk’  ‘and why should they hesitate’ inquired mr archer  ‘the poor souls who are fallen to such a way of life pray what have they to lose  if they get the money well but if a ball should put them from their troubles why so better’  ‘well sir’ said the ostler ‘i believe you’ll find they won’t agree with you  they count on a good fling you see or who would risk it—and here’s my best respects to you miss nance’  ‘and i forgot the part of cowardice’ resumed mr archer  ‘all men fear’  ‘o surely not’ cried nance  ‘all men’ reiterated mr archer  ‘ay that’s a true word’ observed old cumberland ‘and a thief anyway for it’s a coward’s trade’  ‘but these fellows now’ said jonathan with a curious appealing manner—‘these fellows with their seventy pounds  perhaps mr archer they were no true thieves after all but just people who had been robbed and tried to get their own again  what was that you said about all england and the taxes  one takes another gives why that’s almost fair  if i’ve been rooked and robbed and the coat taken off my back i call it almost fair to take another’s’  ‘ask old cumberland’ observed the ostler ‘you ask old cumberland miss nance’ and he bestowed a wink upon his favoured fair one  ‘why that’ asked jonathan  ‘he had his coat taken—ay and his shirt too’ returned the ostler  ‘is that so’ cried jonathan eagerly  ‘was you robbed too’  ‘that was i’ replied cumberland ‘with a warrant  i was a welltodo man when i was young’  ‘ay  see that’ says jonathan  ‘and you don’t long for a revenge’  ‘eh  not me’ answered the beggar  ‘it’s too long ago  but if you’ll give me another mug of your good ale my pretty lady i won’t say no to that’  ‘and shalt have  and shalt have’ cried jonathan  ‘or brandy even if you like it better’  and as cumberland did like it better and the ostler chimed in the party pledged each other in a dram of brandy before separating  as for nance she slipped forth into the ruins partly to avoid the ostler’s gallantries partly to lament over the defects of mr archer plainly he was no hero  she pitied him she began to feel a protecting interest mingle with and almost supersede her admiration and was at the same time disappointed and yet drawn to him  she was indeed conscious of such unshaken fortitude in her own heart that she was almost tempted by an occasion to be bold for two  she saw herself in a brave attitude shielding her imperfect hero from the world and she saw like a piece of heaven his gratitude for her protection    chapter v—life in the castle   from that day forth the life of these three persons in the ruin ran very smoothly  mr archer now sat by the fire with a book and now passed whole days abroad returning late dead weary  his manner was a mask but it was half transparent through the even tenor of his gravity and courtesy profound revolutions of feeling were betrayed seasons of numb despair of restlessness of aching temper  for days he would say nothing beyond his usual courtesies and solemn compliments and then all of a sudden some fine evening beside the kitchen fire he would fall into a vein of elegant gossip tell of strange and interesting events the secrets of families brave deeds of war the miraculous discovery of crime the visitations of the dead  nance and her uncle would sit till the small hours with eyes wide open jonathan applauding the unexpected incidents with many a slap of his big hand nance perhaps more pleased with the narrator’s eloquence and wise reflections and then again days would follow of abstraction of listless humming of frequent apologies and long hours of silence  once only and then after a week of unrelieved melancholy he went over to the ‘green dragon’ spent the afternoon with the landlord and a bowl of punch and returned as on the first night devious in step but courteous and unperturbed of speech  if he seemed more natural and more at his ease it was when he found nance alone and laying by some of his reserve talked before her rather than to her of his destiny character and hopes  to nance these interviews were but a doubtful privilege  at times he would seem to take a pleasure in her presence to consult her gravely to hear and to discuss her counsels at times even but these were rare and brief he would talk of herself praise the qualities that she possessed touch indulgently on her defects and lend her books to read and even examine her upon her reading but far more often he would fall into a half unconsciousness put her a question and then answer it himself drop into the veiled tone of voice of one soliloquising and leave her at last as though he had forgotten her existence  it was odd too that in all this random converse not a fact of his past life and scarce a name should ever cross his lips  a profound reserve kept watch upon his most unguarded moments  he spoke continually of himself indeed but still in enigmas a veiled prophet of egoism  the base of nance’s feelings for mr archer was admiration as for a superior being and with this his treatment consciously or not accorded happily  when he forgot her she took the blame upon herself his formal politeness was so exquisite that this essential brutality stood excused  his compliments besides were always grave and rational he would offer reason for his praise convict her of merit and thus disarm suspicion  nay and the very hours when he forgot and remembered her alternately could by the ardent fallacies of youth be read in the light of an attention  she might be far from his confidence but still she was nearer it than any one  he might ignore her presence but yet he sought it  moreover she upon her side was conscious of one point of superiority beside this rather dismal rather effeminate man who recoiled from a worm who grew giddy on the castle wall who bore so helplessly the weight of his misfortunes she felt herself a head and shoulders taller in cheerful and sterling courage  she could walk head in air along the most precarious rafter her hand feared neither the grossness nor the harshness of life’s web but was thrust cheerfully if need were into the briar bush and could take hold of any crawling horror  ruin was mining the walls of her cottage as already it had mined and subverted mr archer’s palace  well she faced it with a bright countenance and a busy hand  she had got some washing some rough seamstress work from the ‘green dragon’ and from another neighbour ten miles away across the moor  at this she cheerfully laboured and from that height she could afford to pity the useless talents and poor attitude of mr archer  it did not change her admiration but it made it bearable  he was above her in all ways but she was above him in one  she kept it to herself and hugged it  when like all young creatures she made long stories to justify to nourish and to forecast the course of her affection it was this private superiority that made all rosy that cut the knot and that at last in some great situation fetched to her knees the dazzling but imperfect hero  with this pretty exercise she beguiled the hours of labour and consoled herself for mr archer’s bearing  pity was her weapon and her weakness  to accept the loved one’s faults although it has an air of freedom is to kiss the chain and this pity it was which lying nearer to her heart lent the one element of true emotion to a fanciful and merely brainsick love  thus it fell out one day that she had gone to the ‘green dragon’ and brought back thence a letter to mr archer  he upon seeing it winced like a man under the knife pain shame sorrow and the most trenchant edge of mortification cut into his heart and wrung the steady composure of his face  ‘dear heart have you bad news’ she cried  but he only replied by a gesture and fled to his room and when later on she ventured to refer to it he stopped her on the threshold as if with words prepared beforehand  ‘there are some pains’ said he ‘too acute for consolation or i would bring them to my kind consoler  let the memory of that letter if you please be buried’  and then as she continued to gaze at him being in spite of herself pained by his elaborate phrase doubtfully sincere in word and manner ‘let it be enough’ he added haughtily ‘that if this matter wring my heart it doth not touch my conscience  i am a man i would have you to know who suffers undeservedly’  he had never spoken so directly never with so convincing an emotion and her heart thrilled for him  she could have taken his pains and died of them with joy  meanwhile she was left without support  jonathan now swore by his lodger and lived for him  he was a fine talker  he knew the finest sight of stories he was a man and a gentleman take him for all in all and a perfect credit to old england  such were the old man’s declared sentiments and sure enough he clung to mr archer’s side hung upon his utterance when he spoke and watched him with unwearing interest when he was silent  and yet his feeling was not clear in the partial wreck of his mind which was leaning to decay some afterthought was strongly present  as he gazed in mr archer’s face a sudden brightness would kindle in his rheumy eyes his eyebrows would lift as with a sudden thought his mouth would open as though to speak and close again on silence  once or twice he even called mr archer mysteriously forth into the dark courtyard took him by the button and laid a demonstrative finger on his chest but there his ideas or his courage failed him he would shufflingly excuse himself and return to his position by the fire without a word of explanation  ‘the good man was growing old’ said mr archer with a suspicion of a shrug  but the good man had his idea and even when he was alone the name of mr archer fell from his lips continually in the course of mumbled and gesticulative conversation    chapter vi—the bad halfcrown   however early nance arose and she was no sluggard the old man who had begun to outlive the earthly habit of slumber would usually have been up long before the fire would be burning brightly and she would see him wandering among the ruins lantern in hand and talking assiduously to himself  one day however after he had returned late from the market town she found that she had stolen a march upon that indefatigable early riser  the kitchen was all blackness  she crossed the castleyard to the woodcellar her steps printing the thick hoarfrost  a scathing breeze blew out of the northeast and slowly carried a regiment of black and tattered clouds over the face of heaven which was already kindled with the wild light of morning but where she walked in shelter of the ruins the flame of her candle burned steady  the extreme cold smote upon her conscience  she could not bear to think this bitter business fell usually to the lot of one so old as jonathan and made desperate resolutions to be earlier in the future  the fire was a good blaze before he entered limping dismally into the kitchen  ‘nance’ said he ‘i be all knotted up with the rheumatics will you rub me a bit’  she came and rubbed him where and how he bade her  ‘this is a cruel thing that old age should be rheumaticky’ said he  ‘when i was young i stood my turn of the teethache like a man for why because it couldn’t last for ever but these rheumatics come to live and die with you  your aunt was took before the time came never had an ache to mention  now i lie all night in my single bed and the blood never warms in me this knee of mine it seems like lighted up with rheumatics it seems as though you could see to sew by it and all the strings of my old body ache as if devils was pulling ’em  thank you kindly that’s someways easier now but an old man my dear has little to look for it’s pain pain pain to the end of the business and i’ll never be rightly warm again till i get under the sod’ he said and looked down at her with a face so aged and weary that she had nearly wept  ‘i lay awake all night’ he continued ‘i do so mostly and a long walk kills me  eh deary me to think that life should run to such a puddle and i remember long syne when i was strong and the blood all hot and good about me and i loved to run too—deary me to run  well that’s all by  you’d better pray to be took early nance and not live on till you get to be like me and are robbed in your grey old age your cold shivering dark old age that’s like a winter’s morning’ and he bitterly shuddered spreading his hands before the fire  ‘come now’ said nance ‘the more you say the less you’ll like it uncle jonathan but if i were you i would be proud for to have lived all your days honest and beloved and come near the end with your good name isn’t that a fine thing to be proud of  mr archer was telling me in some strange land they used to run races each with a lighted candle and the art was to keep the candle burning  well now i thought that was like life a man’s good conscience is the flame he gets to carry and if he comes to the winningpost with that still burning why take it how you will the man’s a hero—even if he was lowborn like you and me’  ‘did mr archer tell you that’ asked jonathan  ‘no dear’ said she ‘that’s my own thought about it  he told me of the race  but see now’ she continued putting on the porridge ‘you say old age is a hard season but so is youth  you’re half out of the battle i would say you loved my aunt and got her and buried her and some of these days soon you’ll go to meet her and take her my love and tell her i tried to take good care of you for so i do uncle jonathan’  jonathan struck with his fist upon the settle  ‘d’ ye think i want to die ye vixen’ he shouted  ‘i want to live ten hundred years’  this was a mystery beyond nance’s penetration and she stared in wonder as she made the porridge  ‘i want to live’ he continued ‘i want to live and to grow rich  i want to drive my carriage and to dice in hells and see the ring i do  is this a life that i lived  i want to be a rake d’ ye understand  i want to know what things are like  i don’t want to die like a blind kitten and me seventysix’  ‘o fie’ said nance  the old man thrust out his jaw at her with the grimace of an irreverent schoolboy  upon that aged face it seemed a blasphemy  then he took out of his bosom a long leather purse and emptying its contents on the settle began to count and recount the pieces ringing and examining each and suddenly he leapt like a young man  ‘what’ he screamed ‘bad  o lord  i’m robbed again’  and falling on his knees before the settle he began to pour forth the most dreadful curses on the head of his deceiver  his eyes were shut for to him this vile solemnity was prayer he held up the bad halfcrown in his right hand as though he were displaying it to heaven and what increased the horror of the scene the curses he invoked were those whose efficacy he had tasted—old age and poverty rheumatism and an ungrateful son  nance listened appalled then she sprang forward and dragged down his arm and laid her hand upon his mouth  ‘whist’ she cried  ‘whist ye for god’s sake  o my man whist ye  if heaven were to hear if poor aunt susan were to hear  think she may be listening’  and with the histrionism of strong emotion she pointed to a corner of the kitchen  his eyes followed her finger  he looked there for a little thinking blinking then he got stiffly to his feet and resumed his place upon the settle the bad piece still in his hand  so he sat for some time looking upon the halfcrown and now wondering to himself on the injustice and partiality of the law now computing again and again the nature of his loss  so he was still sitting when mr archer entered the kitchen  at this a light came into his face and after some seconds of rumination he dispatched nance upon an errand  ‘mr archer’ said he as soon as they were alone together ‘would you give me a guineapiece for silver’  ‘why sir i believe i can’ said mr archer  and the exchange was just effected when nance reentered the apartment the blood shot into her face  ‘what’s to do here’ she asked rudely  ‘nothing my dearie’ said old jonathan with a touch of whine  ‘what’s to do’ she said again  ‘your uncle was but changing me a piece of gold’ returned mr archer  ‘let me see what he hath given you mr archer’ replied the girl  ‘i had a bad piece and i fear it is mixed up among the good’  ‘well well’ replied mr archer smiling ‘i must take the merchant’s risk of it  the money is now mixed’  ‘i know my piece’ quoth nance  ‘come let me see your silver mr archer  if i have to get it by a theft i’ll see that money’ she cried  ‘nay child if you put as much passion to be honest as the world to steal i must give way though i betray myself’ said mr archer  ‘there it is as i received it’  nance quickly found the bad halfcrown  ‘give him another’ she said looking jonathan in the face and when that had been done she walked over to the chimney and flung the guilty piece into the reddest of the fire  its base constituents began immediately to run even as she watched it the disc crumbled and the lineaments of the king became confused  jonathan who had followed close behind beheld these changes from over her shoulder and his face darkened sorely  ‘now’ said she ‘come back to table and today it is i that shall say grace as i used to do in the old times day about with dick’ and covering her eyes with one hand ‘o lord’ said she with deep emotion ‘make us thankful and o lord deliver us from evil  for the love of the poor souls that watch for us in heaven o deliver us from evil’    chapter vii—the bleachinggreen   the year moved on to march and march though it blew bitter keen from the north sea yet blinked kindly between whiles on the river dell  the mire dried up in the closest covert life ran in the bare branches and the air of the afternoon would be suddenly sweet with the fragrance of new grass  above and below the castle the river crooked like the letter ‘s’  the lower loop was to the left and embraced the high and steep projection which was crowned by the ruins the upper loop enclosed a lawny promontory fringed by thorn and willow  it was easy to reach it from the castle side for the river ran in this part very quietly among innumerable boulders and over damlike walls of rock  the place was all enclosed the wind a stranger the turf smooth and solid so it was chosen by nance to be her bleachinggreen  one day she brought a bucketful of linen and had but begun to wring and lay them out when mr archer stepped from the thicket on the far side drew very deliberately near and sat down in silence on the grass  nance looked up to greet him with a smile but finding her smile was not returned she fell into embarrassment and stuck the more busily to her employment  man or woman the whole world looks well at any work to which they are accustomed but the girl was ashamed of what she did  she was ashamed besides of the sunbonnet that so well became her and ashamed of her bare arms which were her greatest beauty  ‘nausicaa’ said mr archer at last ‘i find you like nausicaa’  ‘and who was she’ asked nance and laughed in spite of herself an empty and embarrassed laugh that sounded in mr archer’s ears indeed like music but to her own like the last grossness of rusticity  ‘she was a princess of the grecian islands’ he replied  ‘a king being shipwrecked found her washing by the shore  certainly i too was shipwrecked’ he continued plucking at the grass  ‘there was never a more desperate castaway—to fall from polite life fortune a shrine of honour a grateful conscience duties willingly taken up and faithfully discharged and to fall to this—idleness poverty inutility remorse’ he seemed to have forgotten her presence but here he remembered her again  ‘nance’ said he ‘would you have a man sit down and suffer or rise up and strive’  ‘nay’ she said  ‘i would always rather see him doing’  ‘ha’ said mr archer ‘but yet you speak from an imperfect knowledge conceive a man damned to a choice of only evil—misconduct upon either side not a fault behind him and yet naught before him but this choice of sins  how would you say then’  ‘i would say that he was much deceived mr archer’ returned nance  ‘i would say there was a third choice and that the right one’  ‘i tell you’ said mr archer ‘the man i have in view hath two ways open and no more  one to wait like a poor mewling baby till fate save or ruin him the other to take his troubles in his hand and to perish or be saved at once  it is no point of morals both are wrong  either way this stepchild of providence must fall which shall he choose by doing or not doing’  ‘fall then is what i would say’ replied nance  ‘fall where you will but do it  for o mr archer’ she continued stooping to her work ‘you that are good and kind and so wise it doth sometimes go against my heart to see you live on here like a sheep in a turnipfield  if you were braver—’ and here she paused consciencesmitten  ‘do i indeed lack courage’ inquired mr archer of himself  ‘courage the footstool of the virtues upon which they stand  courage that a poor private carrying a musket has to spare of that does not fail a weasel or a rat that is a brutish faculty  i to fail there i wonder but what is courage then  the constancy to endure oneself or to see others suffer  the itch of illadvised activity mere shuttlewittedness or to be still and patient  to inquire of the significance of words is to rob ourselves of what we seem to know and yet of all things certainly to stand still is the least heroic nance’ he said ‘did you ever hear of hamlet’  ‘never’ said nance  ‘’tis an old play’ returned mr archer ‘and frequently enacted  this while i have been talking hamlet  you must know this hamlet was a prince among the danes’ and he told her the play in a very good style here and there quoting a verse or two with solemn emphasis  ‘it is strange’ said nance ‘he was then a very poor creature’  ‘that was what he could not tell’ said mr archer  ‘look at me am i as poor a creature’  she looked and what she saw was the familiar thought of all her hours the tall figure very plainly habited in black the spotless ruffles the slim hands the long wellshapen serious shaven face the wide and somewhat thinlipped mouth the dark eyes that were so full of depth and change and colour  he was gazing at her with his brows a little knit his chin upon one hand and that elbow resting on his knee  ‘ye look a man’ she cried ‘ay and should be a great one  the more shame to you to lie here idle like a dog before the fire’  ‘my fair holdaway’ quoth mr archer ‘you are much set on action  i cannot dig to beg i am ashamed’  he continued looking at her with a halfabsent fixity ‘’tis a strange thing certainly that in my years of fortune i should never taste happiness and now when i am broke enjoy so much of it for was i ever happier than today  was the grass softer the stream pleasanter in sound the air milder the heart more at peace why should i not sink  to dig—why after all it should be easy  to take a mate too  love is of all grades since jupiter love fails to none and children’—but here he passed his hand suddenly over his eyes ‘o fool and coward fool and coward’ he said bitterly ‘can you forget your fetters  you did not know that i was fettered nance’ he asked again addressing her  but nance was somewhat sore  ‘i know you keep talking’ she said and turning half away from him began to wring out a sheet across her shoulder  ‘i wonder you are not wearied of your voice  when the hands lie abed the tongue takes a walk’  mr archer laughed unpleasantly rose and moved to the water’s edge  in this part the body of the river poured across a little narrow fell ran some ten feet very smoothly over a bed of pebbles then getting wind as it were of another shelf of rock which barred the channel began by imperceptible degrees to separate towards either shore in dancing currents and to leave the middle clear and stagnant  the set towards either side was nearly equal about one half of the whole water plunged on the side of the castle through a narrow gullet about one half ran ripping past the margin of the green and slipped across a babbling rapid  ‘here’ said mr archer after he had looked for some time at the fine and shifting demarcation of these currents ‘come here and see me try my fortune’  ‘i am not like a man’ said nance ‘i have no time to waste’  ‘come here’ he said again  ‘i ask you seriously nance  we are not always childish when we seem so’  she drew a little nearer  ‘now’ said he ‘you see these two channels—choose one’  ‘i’ll choose the nearest to save time’ said nance  ‘well that shall be for action’ returned mr archer  ‘and since i wish to have the odds against me not only the other channel but yon stagnant water in the midst shall be for lying still  you see this’ he continued pulling up a withered rush  ‘i break it in three  i shall put each separately at the top of the upper fall and according as they go by your way or by the other i shall guide my life’  ‘this is very silly’ said nance with a movement of her shoulders  ‘i do not think it so’ said mr archer  ‘and then’ she resumed ‘if you are to try your fortune why not evenly’  ‘nay’ returned mr archer with a smile ‘no man can put complete reliance in blind fate he must still cog the dice’  by this time he had got upon the rock beside the upper fall and bidding her look out dropped a piece of rush into the middle of the intake  the rusty fragment was sucked at once over the fall came up again far on the right hand leaned ever more and more in the same direction and disappeared under the hanging grasses on the castle side  ‘one’ said mr archer ‘one for standing still’  but the next launch had a different fate and after hanging for a while about the edge of the stagnant water steadily approached the bleachinggreen and danced down the rapid under nance’s eyes  ‘one for me’ she cried with some exultation and then she observed that mr archer had grown pale and was kneeling on the rock with his hand raised like a person petrified  ‘why’ said she ‘you do not mind it do you’  ‘does a man not mind a throw of dice by which a fortune hangs’ said mr archer rather hoarsely  ‘and this is more than fortune  nance if you have any kindness for my fate put up a prayer before i launch the next one’  ‘a prayer’ she cried ‘about a game like this  i would not be so heathen’  ‘well’ said he ‘then without’ and he closed his eyes and dropped the piece of rush  this time there was no doubt  it went for the rapid as straight as any arrow  ‘action then’ said mr archer getting to his feet ‘and then god forgive us’ he added almost to himself  ‘god forgive us indeed’ cried nance ‘for wasting the good daylight but come mr archer if i see you look so serious i shall begin to think you was in earnest’  ‘nay’ he said turning upon her suddenly with a full smile ‘but is not this good advice  i have consulted god and demigod the nymph of the river and what i far more admire and trust my blueeyed minerva  both have said the same  my own heart was telling it already  action then be mine and into the deep sea with all this paralysing casuistry  i am happy today for the first time’    chapter viii—the mail guard   somewhere about two in the morning a squall had burst upon the castle a clap of screaming wind that made the towers rock and a copious drift of rain that streamed from the windows  the wind soon blew itself out but the day broke cloudy and dripping and when the little party assembled at breakfast their humours appeared to have changed with the change of weather  nance had been brooding on the scene at the riverside applying it in various ways to her particular aspirations and the result which was hardly to her mind had taken the colour out of her cheeks  mr archer too was somewhat absent his thoughts were of a mingled strain and even upon his usually impassive countenance there were betrayed successive depths of depression and starts of exultation which the girl translated in terms of her own hopes and fears  but jonathan was the most altered he was strangely silent hardly passing a word and watched mr archer with an eager and furtive eye  it seemed as if the idea that had so long hovered before him had now taken a more solid shape and while it still attracted somewhat alarmed his imagination  at this rate conversation languished into a silence which was only broken by the gentle and ghostly noises of the rain on the stone roof and about all that field of ruins and they were all relieved when the note of a man whistling and the sound of approaching footsteps in the grassy court announced a visitor  it was the ostler from the ‘green dragon’ bringing a letter for mr archer  nance saw her hero’s face contract and then relax again at sight of it and she thought that she knew why for the sprawling gross black characters of the address were easily distinguishable from the fine writing on the former letter that had so much disturbed him  he opened it and began to read while the ostler sat down to table with a pot of ale and proceeded to make himself agreeable after his fashion  ‘fine doings down our way miss nance’ said he  ‘i haven’t been abed this blessed night’  nance expressed a polite interest but her eye was on mr archer who was reading his letter with a face of such extreme indifference that she was tempted to suspect him of assumption  ‘yes’ continued the ostler ‘not been the like of it this fifteen years the north mail stopped at the three stones’  jonathan’s cup was at his lip but at this moment he choked with a great splutter and mr archer as if startled by the noise made so sudden a movement that one corner of the sheet tore off and stayed between his finger and thumb  it was some little time before the old man was sufficiently recovered to beg the ostler to go on and he still kept coughing and crying and rubbing his eyes  mr archer on his side laid the letter down and putting his hands in his pocket listened gravely to the tale  ‘yes’ resumed sam ‘the north mail was stopped by a single horseman dash my wig but i admire him  there were four insides and two out and poor tom oglethorpe the guard  tom showed himself a man let fly his blunderbuss at him had him covered too and could swear to that but the captain never let on up with a pistol and fetched poor tom a bullet through the body  tom he squelched upon the seat all over blood  up comes the captain to the window  “oblige me” says he “with what you have”  would you believe it  not a man says cheep—not them  “thy hands over thy head”  four watches rings snuffboxes sevenandforty pounds overhead in gold  one dicksee a grazier tries it on gives him a guinea  “beg your pardon” says the captain “i think too highly of you to take it at your hand  i will not take less than ten from such a gentleman”  this dicksee had his money in his stocking but there was the pistol at his eye  down he goes offs with his stocking and there was thirty golden guineas  “now” says the captain “you’ve tried it on with me but i scorns the advantage  ten i said” he says “and ten i take”  so dash my buttons i call that man a man’ cried sam in cordial admiration  ‘well and then’ says mr archer  ‘then’ resumed sam ‘that old fat fagot engleton him as held the ribbons and drew up like a lamb when he was told to picks up his cattle and drives off again  down they came to the “dragon” all singing like as if they was scalded and poor tom saying nothing  you would ‘a’ thought they had all lost the king’s crown to hear them  down gets this dicksee  “postmaster” he says taking him by the arm “this is a most abominable thing” he says  down gets a major clayton and gets the old man by the other arm  “we’ve been robbed” he cries “robbed”  down gets the others and all around the old man telling their story and what they had lost and how they was all as good as ruined till at last old engleton says says he “how about oglethorpe” says he  “ay” says the others “how about the guard”  well with that we bousted him down as white as a rag and all blooded like a sop  i thought he was dead  well he ain’t dead but he’s dying i fancy’  ‘did you say four watches’ said jonathan  ‘four i think  i wish it had been forty’ cried sam  ‘such a party of soused herrings i never did see—not a man among them bar poor tom  but us that are the servants on the road have all the risk and none of the profit’  ‘and this brave fellow’ asked mr archer very quietly ‘this oglethorpe—how is he now’  ‘well sir with my respects i take it he has a hole bang through him’ said sam  ‘the doctor hasn’t been yet  he’d ‘a’ been bright and early if it had been a passenger  but doctor or no i’ll make a good guess that tom won’t see tomorrow  he’ll die on a sunday will poor tom and they do say that’s fortunate’  ‘did tom see him that did it’ asked jonathan  ‘well he saw him’ replied sam ‘but not to swear by  said he was a very tall man and very big and had a ’ankerchief about his face and a very quick shot and sat his horse like a thorough gentleman as he is’  ‘a gentleman’ cried nance  ‘the dirty knave’  ‘well i calls a man like that a gentleman’ returned the ostler ‘that’s what i mean by a gentleman’  ‘you don’t know much of them then’ said nance  ‘a gentleman would scorn to stoop to such a thing  i call my uncle a better gentleman than any thief’  ‘and you would be right’ said mr archer  ‘how many snuffboxes did he get’ asked jonathan  ‘o dang me if i know’ said sam ‘i didn’t take an inventory’  ‘i will go back with you if you please’ said mr archer  ‘i should like to see poor oglethorpe  he has behaved well’  ‘at your service sir’ said sam jumping to his feet  ‘i dare to say a gentleman like you would not forget a poor fellow like tom—no nor a plain man like me sir that went without his sleep to nurse him  and excuse me sir’ added sam ‘you won’t forget about the letter neither’  ‘surely not’ said mr archer  oglethorpe lay in a low bed one of several in a long garret of the inn the rain soaked in places through the roof and fell in minute drops there was but one small window the beds were occupied by servants the air of the garret was both close and chilly  mr archer’s heart sank at the threshold to see a man lying perhaps mortally hurt in so poor a sickroom and as he drew near the low bed he took his hat off  the guard was a big blowsy innocentlooking soul with a thick lip and a broad nose comically turned up his cheeks were crimson and when mr archer laid a finger on his brow he found him burning with fever  ‘i fear you suffer much’ he said with a catch in his voice as he sat down on the bedside  ‘i suppose i do sir’ returned oglethorpe ‘it is main sore’  ‘i am used to wounds and wounded men’ returned the visitor  ‘i have been in the wars and nursed brave fellows before now and if you will suffer me i propose to stay beside you till the doctor comes’  ‘it is very good of you sir i am sure’ said oglethorpe  ‘the trouble is they won’t none of them let me drink’  ‘if you will not tell the doctor’ said mr archer ‘i will give you some water  they say it is bad for a green wound but in the low countries we all drank water when we found the chance and i could never perceive we were the worse for it’  ‘been wounded yourself sir perhaps’ called oglethorpe  ‘twice’ said mr archer ‘and was as proud of these hurts as any lady of her bracelets  ’tis a fine thing to smart for one’s duty even in the pangs of it there is contentment’  ‘ah well’ replied the guard ‘if you’ve been shot yourself that explains  but as for contentment why sir you see it smarts as you say  and then i have a good wife you see and a bit of a brat—a little thing so high’  ‘don’t move’ said mr archer  ‘no sir i will not and thank you kindly’ said oglethorpe  ‘at york they are  a very good lass is my wife—far too good for me  and the little rascal—well i don’t know how to say it but he sort of comes round you  if i were to go sir it would be hard on my poor girl—main hard on her’  ‘ay you must feel bitter hardly to the rogue that laid you here’ said archer  ‘why no sir more against engleton and the passengers’ replied the guard  ‘he played his hand if you come to look at it and i wish he had shot worse or me better  and yet i’ll go to my grave but what i covered him’ he cried  ‘it looks like witchcraft  i’ll go to my grave but what he was drove full of slugs like a pepperbox’  ‘quietly’ said mr archer ‘you must not excite yourself  these deceptions are very usual in war the eye in the moment of alert is hardly to be trusted and when the smoke blows away you see the man you fired at taking aim it may be at yourself  you should observe too that you were in the dark night and somewhat dazzled by the lamps and that the sudden stopping of the mail had jolted you  in such circumstances a man may miss ay even with a blunderbuss and no blame attach to his marksmanship’        the young chevalier   prologue—the wineseller’s wife   there was a wineseller’s shop as you went down to the river in the city of the antipopes  there a man was served with good wine of the country and plain country fare and the place being clean and quiet with a prospect on the river certain gentlemen who dwelt in that city in attendance on a great personage made it a practice when they had any silver in their purses to come and eat there and be private  they called the wineseller paradou  he was built more like a bullock than a man huge in bone and brawn high in colour and with a hand like a baby for size  mariemadeleine was the name of his wife she was of marseilles a city of entrancing women nor was any fairer than herself she was tall being almost of a height with paradou fullgirdled pointdevice in every form with an exquisite delicacy in the face her nose and nostrils a delight to look at from the fineness of the sculpture her eyes inclined a hair’sbreadth inward her colour between dark and fair and laid on even like a flower’s  a faint rose dwelt in it as though she had been found unawares bathing and had blushed from head to foot  she was of a grave countenance rarely smiling yet it seemed to be written upon every part of her that she rejoiced in life her husband loved the heels of her feet and the knuckles of her fingers he loved her like a glutton and a brute his love hung about her like an atmosphere one that came by chance into the wineshop was aware of that passion and it might be said that by the strength of it the woman had been drugged or spellbound  she knew not if she loved or loathed him he was always in her eyes like something monstrous—monstrous in his love monstrous in his person horrific but imposing in his violence and her sentiment swung back and forward from desire to sickness  but the mean where it dwelt chiefly was an apathetic fascination partly of horror as of europa in mid ocean with her bull  on the 10th november 1749 there sat two of the foreign gentlemen in the wineseller’s shop  they were both handsome men of a good presence richly dressed  the first was swarthy and long and lean with an alert black look and a mole upon his cheek  the other was more fair  he seemed very easy and sedate and a little melancholy for so young a man but his smile was charming  in his grey eyes there was much abstraction as of one recalling fondly that which was past and lost  yet there was strength and swiftness in his limbs and his mouth set straight across his face the under lip a thought upon side like that of a man accustomed to resolve  these two talked together in a rude outlandish speech that no frequenter of that wineshop understood  the swarthy man answered to the name of ballantrae he of the dreamy eyes was sometimes called balmile and sometimes my lord or my lord gladsmuir but when the title was given him he seemed to put it by as if in jesting not without bitterness  the mistral blew in the city  the first day of that wind they say in the countries where its voice is heard it blows away all the dust the second all the stones and the third it blows back others from the mountains  it was now come to the third day outside the pebbles flew like hail and the face of the river was puckered and the very buildingstones in the walls of houses seemed to be curdled with the savage cold and fury of that continuous blast  it could be heard to hoot in all the chimneys of the city it swept about the wineshop filling the room with eddies the chill and gritty touch of it passed between the nearest clothes and the bare flesh and the two gentlemen at the far table kept their mantles loose about their shoulders  the roughness of these outer hulls for they were plain travellers’ cloaks that had seen service set the greater mark of richness on what showed below of their laced clothes for the one was in scarlet and the other in violet and white like men come from a scene of ceremony as indeed they were  it chanced that these fine clothes were not without their influence on the scene which followed and which makes the prologue of our tale  for a long time balmile was in the habit to come to the wineshop and eat a meal or drink a measure of wine sometimes with a comrade more often alone when he would sit and dream and drum upon the table and the thoughts would show in the man’s face in little glooms and lightenings like the sun and the clouds upon a water  for a long time mariemadeleine had observed him apart  his sadness the beauty of his smile when by any chance he remembered her existence and addressed her the changes of his mind signalled forth by an abstruse play of feature the mere fact that he was foreign and a thing detached from the local and the accustomed insensibly attracted and affected her  kindness was ready in her mind it but lacked the touch of an occasion to effervesce and crystallise  now balmile had come hitherto in a very poor plain habit and this day of the mistral when his mantle was just open and she saw beneath it the glancing of the violet and the velvet and the silver and the clustering fineness of the lace it seemed to set the man in a new light with which he shone resplendent to her fancy  the high inhuman note of the wind the violence and continuity of its outpouring and the fierce touch of it upon man’s whole periphery accelerated the functions of the mind  it set thoughts whirling as it whirled the trees of the forest it stirred them up in flights as it stirred up the dust in chambers  as brief as sparks the fancies glittered and succeeded each other in the mind of mariemadeleine and the grave man with the smile and the bright clothes under the plain mantle haunted her with incongruous explanations  she considered him the unknown the speaker of an unknown tongue the hero as she placed him of an unknown romance the dweller upon unknown memories  she recalled him sitting there alone so immersed so stupefied yet she was sure he was not stupid  she recalled one day when he had remained a long time motionless with parted lips like one in the act of starting up his eyes fixed on vacancy  any one else must have looked foolish but not he  she tried to conceive what manner of memory had thus entranced him she forged for him a past she showed him to herself in every light of heroism and greatness and misfortune she brooded with petulant intensity on all she knew and guessed of him  yet though she was already gone so deep she was still unashamed still unalarmed her thoughts were still disinterested she had still to reach the stage at which—beside the image of that other whom we love to contemplate and to adorn—we place the image of ourself and behold them together with delight  she stood within the counter her hands clasped behind her back her shoulders pressed against the wall her feet braced out  her face was bright with the wind and her own thoughts as a fire in a similar day of tempest glows and brightens on a hearth so she seemed to glow standing there and to breathe out energy  it was the first time ballantrae had visited that wineseller’s the first time he had seen the wife and his eyes were true to her  ‘i perceive your reason for carrying me to this very draughty tavern’ he said at last  ‘i believe it is propinquity’ returned balmile  ‘you play dark’ said ballantrae ‘but have a care  be more frank with me or i will cut you out  i go through no form of qualifying my threat which would be commonplace and not conscientious  there is only one point in these campaigns that is the degree of admiration offered by the man and to our hostess i am in a posture to make victorious love’  ‘if you think you have the time or the game worth the candle’ replied the other with a shrug  ‘one would suppose you were never at the pains to observe her’ said ballantrae  ‘i am not very observant’ said balmile  ‘she seems comely’  ‘you very dear and dull dog’ cried ballantrae ‘chastity is the most besotting of the virtues  why she has a look in her face beyond singing  i believe if you was to push me hard i might trace it home to a trifle of a squint  what matters  the height of beauty is in the touch that’s wrong that’s the modulation in a tune  ’tis the devil we all love i owe many a conquest to my mole’—he touched it as he spoke with a smile and his eyes glittered—‘we are all hunchbacks and beauty is only that kind of deformity that i happen to admire  but come because you are chaste for which i am sure i pay you my respects that is no reason why you should be blind  look at her look at the delicious nose of her look at her cheek look at her ear look at her hand and wrist—look at the whole baggage from heels to crown and tell me if she wouldn’t melt on a man’s tongue’  as ballantrae spoke half jesting half enthusiastic balmile was constrained to do as he was bidden  he looked at the woman admired her excellences and was at the same time ashamed for himself and his companion  so it befell that when mariemadeleine raised her eyes she met those of the subject of her contemplations fixed directly on herself with a look that is unmistakable the look of a person measuring and valuing another—and to clench the false impression that his glance was instantly and guiltily withdrawn  the blood beat back upon her heart and leaped again her obscure thoughts flashed clear before her she flew in fancy straight to his arms like a wanton and fled again on the instant like a nymph  and at that moment there chanced an interruption which not only spared her embarrassment but set the last consecration on her now articulate love  into the wineshop there came a french gentleman arrayed in the last refinement of the fashion though a little tumbled by his passage in the wind  it was to be judged he had come from the same formal gathering at which the others had preceded him and perhaps that he had gone there in the hope to meet with them for he came up to ballantrae with unceremonious eagerness  ‘at last here you are’ he cried in french  ‘i thought i was to miss you altogether’  the scotsmen rose and ballantrae after the first greetings laid his hand on his companion’s shoulder  ‘my lord’ said he ‘allow me to present to you one of my best friends and one of our best soldiers the lord viscount gladsmuir’  the two bowed with the elaborate elegance of the period  ‘monseigneur’ said balmile ‘je n’ai pas la prétention de m’affubler d’un titre que la mauvaise fortune de mon roi ne me permet pas de porter comma il sied  je m’appelle pour vous servir blair de balmile tout court’  my lord i have not the effrontery to cumber myself with a title which the ill fortunes of my king will not suffer me to bear the way it should be  i call myself at your service plain blair of balmile  ‘monsieur le vicomte ou monsieur blèr’ de balmaïl’ replied the newcomer ‘le nom n’y fait rien et l’on connaît vos beaux faits’ the name matters nothing your gallant actions are known  a few more ceremonies and these three sitting down together to the table called for wine  it was the happiness of mariemadeleine to wait unobserved upon the prince of her desires  she poured the wine he drank of it and that link between them seemed to her for the moment close as a caress  though they lowered their tones she surprised great names passing in their conversation names of kings the names of de gesvre and belleisle and the man who dealt in these high matters and she who was now coupled with him in her own thoughts seemed to swim in mid air in a transfiguration  love is a crude core but it has singular and farreaching fringes in that passionate attraction for the stranger that now swayed and mastered her his harsh incomprehensible language and these names of grandees in his talk were each an element  the frenchman stayed not long but it was plain he left behind him matter of much interest to his companions they spoke together earnestly their heads down the woman of the wineshop totally forgotten and they were still so occupied when paradou returned  this man’s love was unsleeping  the even bluster of the mistral with which he had been combating some hours had not suspended though it had embittered that predominant passion  his first look was for his wife a look of hope and suspicion menace and humility and love that made the overblooming brute appear for the moment almost beautiful  she returned his glance at first as though she knew him not then with a swiftly waxing coldness of intent and at last without changing their direction she had closed her eyes  there passed across her mind during that period much that paradou could not have understood had it been told to him in words chiefly the sense of an enlightening contrast betwixt the man who talked of kings and the man who kept a wineshop betwixt the love she yearned for and that to which she had been long exposed like a victim bound upon the altar there swelled upon her swifter than the rhone a tide of abhorrence and disgust  she had succumbed to the monster humbling herself below animals and now she loved a hero aspiring to the semidivine  it was in the pang of that humiliating thought that she had closed her eyes  paradou—quick as beasts are quick to translate silence—felt the insult through his blood his inarticulate soul bellowed within him for revenge he glanced about the shop  he saw the two indifferent gentlemen deep in talk and passed them over his fancy flying not so high  there was but one other present a country lout who stood swallowing his wine equally unobserved by all and unobserving—to him he dealt a glance of murderous suspicion and turned direct upon his wife  the wineshop had lain hitherto a space of shelter the scene of a few ceremonial passages and some whispered conversation in the howling river of the wind the clock had not yet ticked a score of times since paradou’s appearance and now as he suddenly gave tongue it seemed as though the mistral had entered at his heels  ‘what ails you woman’ he cried smiting on the counter  ‘nothing ails me’ she replied  it was strange but she spoke and stood at that moment like a lady of degree drawn upward by her aspirations  ‘you speak to me by god as though you scorned me’ cried the husband  the man’s passion was always formidable she had often looked on upon its violence with a thrill it had been one ingredient in her fascination and she was now surprised to behold him as from afar off gesticulating but impotent  his fury might be dangerous like a torrent or a gust of wind but it was inhuman it might be feared or braved it should never be respected  and with that there came in her a sudden glow of courage and that readiness to die which attends so closely upon all strong passions  ‘i do scorn you’ she said  ‘what is that’ he cried  ‘i scorn you’ she repeated smiling  ‘you love another man’ said he  ‘with all my soul’ was her reply  the wineseller roared aloud so that the house rang and shook with it  ‘is this the—’ he cried using a foul word common in the south and he seized the young countryman and dashed him to the ground  there he lay for the least interval of time insensible thence fled from the house the most terrified person in the county  the heavy measure had escaped from his hands splashing the wine high upon the wall  paradou caught it  ‘and you’ he roared to his wife giving her the same name in the feminine and he aimed at her the deadly missile  she expected it motionless with radiant eyes  but before it sped paradou was met by another adversary and the unconscious rivals stood confronted  it was hard to say at that moment which appeared the more formidable  in paradou the whole muddy and truculent depths of the halfman were stirred to frenzy the lust of destruction raged in him there was not a feature in his face but it talked murder  balmile had dropped his cloak he shone out at once in his finery and stood to his full stature girt in mind and body all his resources all his temper perfectly in command in his face the light of battle  neither spoke there was no blow nor threat of one it was war reduced to its last element the spiritual and the huge wineseller slowly lowered his weapon  balmile was a noble he a commoner balmile exulted in an honourable cause  paradou already perhaps began to be ashamed of his violence  of a sudden at least the tortured brute turned and fled from the shop in the footsteps of his former victim to whose continued flight his reappearance added wings  so soon as balmile appeared between her husband and herself mariemadeleine transferred to him her eyes  it might be her last moment and she fed upon that face reading there inimitable courage and illimitable valour to protect  and when the momentary peril was gone by and the champion turned a little awkwardly towards her whom he had rescued it was to meet and quail before a gaze of admiration more distinct than words  he bowed he stammered his words failed him he who had crossed the floor a moment ago like a young god to smite returned like one discomfited got somehow to his place by the table muffled himself again in his discarded cloak and for a last touch of the ridiculous seeking for anything to restore his countenance drank of the wine before him deep as a porter after a heavy lift  it was little wonder if ballantrae reading the scene with malevolent eyes laughed out loud and brief and drank with raised glass ‘to the champion of the fair’  mariemadeleine stood in her old place within the counter she disdained the mocking laughter it fell on her ears but it did not reach her spirit  for her the world of living persons was all resumed again into one pair as in the days of eden there was but the one end in life the one hope before her the one thing needful the one thing possible—to be his    chapter i—the prince   that same night there was in the city of avignon a young man in distress of mind  now he sat now walked in a high apartment full of draughts and shadows  a single candle made the darkness visible and the light scarce sufficed to show upon the wall where they had been recently and rudely nailed a few miniatures and a copper medal of the young man’s head  the same was being sold that year in london to admiring thousands  the original was fair he had beautiful brown eyes a beautiful bright open face a little feminine a little hard a little weak still full of the light of youth but already beginning to be vulgarised a sordid bloom come upon it the lines coarsened with a touch of puffiness  he was dressed as for a gala in peachcolour and silver his breast sparkled with stars and was bright with ribbons for he had held a levee in the afternoon and received a distinguished personage incognito  now he sat with a bowed head now walked precipitately to and fro now went and gazed from the uncurtained window where the wind was still blowing and the lights winked in the darkness  the bells of avignon rose into song as he was gazing and the high notes and the deep tossed and drowned boomed suddenly near or were suddenly swallowed up in the current of the mistral  tears sprang in the pale blue eyes the expression of his face was changed to that of a more active misery it seemed as if the voices of the bells reached and touched and pained him in a waste of vacancy where even pain was welcome  outside in the night they continued to sound on swelling and fainting and the listener heard in his memory as it were their harmonies joybells clashing in a northern city and the acclamations of a multitude the cries of battle the gross voices of cannon the stridor of an animated life  and then all died away and he stood face to face with himself in the waste of vacancy and a horror came upon his mind and a faintness on his brain such as seizes men upon the brink of cliffs  on the table by the side of the candle stood a tray of glasses a bottle and a silver bell  he went thither swiftly then his hand lowered first above the bell then settled on the bottle  slowly he filled a glass slowly drank it out and as a tide of animal warmth recomforted the recesses of his nature stood there smiling at himself he remembered he was young the funeral curtains rose and he saw his life shine and broaden and flow out majestically like a river sunward the smile still on his lips he lit a second candle and a third a fire stood ready built in a chimney he lit that also and the fircones and the gnarled olive billets were swift to break in flame and to crackle on the hearth and the room brightened and enlarged about him like his hopes  to and fro to and fro he went his hands lightly clasped his breath deeply and pleasurably taken  victory walked with him he marched to crowns and empires among shouting followers glory was his dress  and presently again the shadows closed upon the solitary  under the gilt of flame and candlelight the stone walls of the apartment showed down bare and cold behind the depicted triumph loomed up the actual failure defeat the long distress of the flight exile despair broken followers mourning faces empty pockets friends estranged  the memory of his father rose in his mind he too estranged and defied despair sharpened into wrath  there was one who had led armies in the field who had staked his life upon the family enterprise a man of action and experience of the open air the camp the court the councilroom and he was to accept direction from an old pompous gentleman in a home in italy and buzzed about by priests  a pretty king if he had not a martial son to lean upon  a king at all  ‘there was a weaver of all people joined me at st ninians he was more of a man than my papa’ he thought  ‘i saw him lie doubled in his blood and a grenadier below him—and he died for my papa  all died for him or risked the dying and i lay for him all those months in the rain and skulked in heather like a fox and now he writes me his advice calls me carluccio—me the man of the house the only king in that king’s race’ he ground his teeth  ‘the only king in europe’  who else  who has done and suffered except me who has lain and run and hidden with his faithful subjects like a second bruce  not my accursed cousin louis of france at least the lewd effeminate traitor’  and filling the glass to the brim he drank a king’s damnation  ah if he had the power of louis what a king were here  the minutes followed each other into the past and still he persevered in this debilitating cycle of emotions still fed the fire of his excitement with driblets of rhine wine a boy at odds with life a boy with a spark of the heroic which he was now burning out and drowning down in futile reverie and solitary excess  from two rooms beyond the sudden sound of a raised voice attracted him  ‘by        heathercat   chapter i—traquairs of montroymont   the period of this tale is in the heat of the killingtime the scene laid for the most part in solitary hills and morasses haunted only by the socalled mountain wanderers the dragoons that came in chase of them the women that wept on their dead bodies and the wild birds of the moorland that have cried there since the beginning  it is a land of many rainclouds a land of much mute history written there in prehistoric symbols  strange green raths are to be seen commonly in the country above all by the kirkyards barrows of the dead standing stones beside these the faint durable footprints and handmarks of the roman and an antiquity older perhaps than any and still living and active—a complete celtic nomenclature and a scarcemingled celtic population  these rugged and grey hills were once included in the boundaries of the caledonian forest  merlin sat here below his appletree and lamented gwendolen here spoke with kentigern here fell into his enchanted trance  and the legend of his slumber seems to body forth the story of that celtic race deprived for so many centuries of their authentic speech surviving with their ancestral inheritance of melancholy perversity and patient unfortunate courage  the traquairs of montroymont mons romanus as the erudite expound it had long held their seat about the headwaters of the dule and in the back parts of the moorland parish of balweary  for two hundred years they had enjoyed in these upland quarters a certain decency almost to be named distinction of repute and the annals of their house or what is remembered of them were obscure and bloody  ninian traquair was ‘cruallie slochtered’ by the crozers at the kirkdoor of balweary anno 1482  francis killed simon ruthven of drumshoreland anno 1540 bought letters of slayers at the widow and heir and by a barbarous form of compounding married without tocher simon’s daughter grizzel which is the way the traquairs and ruthvens came first to an intermarriage  about the last traquair and ruthven marriage it is the business of this book among many other things to tell  the traquairs were always strong for the covenant for the king also but the covenant first and it began to be ill days for montroymont when the bishops came in and the dragoons at the heels of them  ninian then laird was an anxious husband of himself and the property as the times required and it may be said of him that he lost both  he was heavily suspected of the pentland hills rebellion  when it came the length of bothwell brig he stood his trial before the secret council and was convicted of talking with some insurgents by the wayside the subject of the conversation not very clearly appearing and of the reset and maintenance of one gale a gardener man who was seen before bothwell with a musket and afterwards for a continuance of months delved the garden at montroymont  matters went very ill with ninian at the council some of the lords were clear for treason and even the boot was talked of  but he was spared that torture and at last having pretty good friendship among great men he came off with a fine of seven thousand marks that caused the estate to groan  in this case as in so many others it was the wife that made the trouble  she was a great keeper of conventicles would ride ten miles to one and when she was fined rejoiced greatly to suffer for the kirk but it was rather her husband that suffered  she had their only son francis baptized privately by the hands of mr kidd there was that much the more to pay for  she could neither be driven nor wiled into the parish kirk as for taking the sacrament at the hands of any episcopalian curate and tenfold more at those of curate haddo there was nothing further from her purposes and montroymont had to put his hand in his pocket month by month and year by year  once indeed the little lady was cast in prison and the laird worthy heavy uninterested man had to ride up and take her place from which he was not discharged under nine months and a sharp fine  it scarce seemed she had any gratitude to him she came out of gaol herself and plunged immediately deeper in conventicles resetting recusants and all her old expensive folly only with greater vigour and openness because montroymont was safe in the tolbooth and she had no witness to consider  when he was liberated and came back with his fingers singed in december 1680 and late in the black night my lady was from home  he came into the house at his alighting with a ridingrod yet in his hand and on the servantmaid telling him caught her by the scruff of the neck beat her violently flung her down in the passageway and went upstairs to his bed fasting and without a light  it was three in the morning when my lady returned from that conventicle and hearing of the assault because the maid had sat up for her weeping went to their common chamber with a lantern in hand and stamping with her shoes so as to wake the dead it was supposed by those that heard her from a design to have it out with the good man at once  the houseservants gathered on the stair because it was a main interest with them to know which of these two was the better horse and for the space of two hours they were heard to go at the matter hammer and tongs  montroymont alleged he was at the end of possibilities it was no longer within his power to pay the annual rents she had served him basely by keeping conventicles while he lay in prison for her sake his friends were weary and there was nothing else before him but the entire loss of the family lands and to begin life again by the wayside as a common beggar  she took him up very sharp and high called upon him if he were a christian and which he most considered the loss of a few dirty miry glebes or of his soul presently he was heard to weep and my lady’s voice to go on continually like a running burn only the words indistinguishable whereupon it was supposed a victory for her ladyship and the domestics took themselves to bed  the next day traquair appeared like a man who had gone under the harrows and his lady wife thenceforward continued in her old course without the least deflection  thenceforward ninian went on his way without complaint and suffered his wife to go on hers without remonstrance  he still minded his estate of which it might be said he took daily a fresh farewell and counted it already lost looking ruefully on the acres and the graves of his fathers on the moorlands where the wildfowl consorted the low gurgling pool of the trout and the high windy place of the calling curlews—things that were yet his for the day and would be another’s tomorrow coming back again and sitting ciphering till the dusk at his approaching ruin which no device of arithmetic could postpone beyond a year or two  he was essentially the simple ancient man the farmer and landholder he would have been content to watch the seasons come and go and his cattle increase until the limit of age he would have been content at any time to die if he could have left the estates undiminished to an heirmale of his ancestors that duty standing first in his instinctive calendar  and now he saw everywhere the image of the new proprietor come to meet him and go sowing and reaping or fowling for his pleasure on the red moors or eating the very gooseberries in the place garden and saw always on the other hand the figure of francis go forth a beggar into the broad world  it was in vain the poor gentleman sought to moderate took every test and took advantage of every indulgence went and drank with the dragoons in balweary attended the communion and came regularly to the church to curate haddo with his son beside him  the mad raging presbyterian zealot of a wife at home made all of no avail and indeed the house must have fallen years before if it had not been for the secret indulgence of the curate who had a great sympathy with the laird and winked hard at the doings in montroymont  this curate was a man very ill reputed in the countryside and indeed in all scotland  ‘infamous haddo’ is shield’s expression  but patrick walker is more copious  ‘curate hall haddo’ says he sub voce peden ‘or hell haddo as he was more justly to be called a pokeful of old condemned errors and the filthy vile lusts of the flesh a published whoremonger a common gross drunkard continually and godlessly scraping and skirling on a fiddle continually breathing flames against the remnant of israel  but the lord put an end to his piping and all these offences were composed into one bloody grave’  no doubt this was written to excuse his slaughter and i have never heard it claimed for walker that he was either a just witness or an indulgent judge  at least in a merely human character haddo comes off not wholly amiss in the matter of these traquairs not that he showed any graces of the christian but had a sort of pagan decency which might almost tempt one to be concerned about his sudden violent and unprepared fate    chapter ii—francie   francie was eleven years old shy secret and rather childish of his age though not backward in schooling which had been pushed on far by a private governor one m‘brair a forfeited minister harboured in that capacity at montroymont  the boy already much employed in secret by his mother was the most apt hand conceivable to run upon a message to carry food to lurking fugitives or to stand sentry on the skyline above a conventicle  it seemed no place on the moorlands was so naked but what he would find cover there and as he knew every hag boulder and heatherbush in a circuit of seven miles about montroymont there was scarce any spot but what he could leave or approach it unseen  this dexterity had won him a reputation in that part of the country and among the many children employed in these dangerous affairs he passed under the byname of heathercat  how much his father knew of this employment might be doubted  he took much forethought for the boy’s future seeing he was like to be left so poorly and would sometimes assist at his lessons sighing heavily yawning deep and now and again patting francie on the shoulder if he seemed to be doing ill by way of a private kind encouragement  but a great part of the day was passed in aimless wanderings with his eyes sealed or in his cabinet sitting bemused over the particulars of the coming bankruptcy and the boy would be absent a dozen times for once that his father would observe it  on 2nd of july 1682 the boy had an errand from his mother which must be kept private from all the father included in the first of them crossing the braes he hears the clatter of a horse’s shoes and claps down incontinent in a hag by the wayside  and presently he spied his father come riding from one direction and curate haddo walking from another and montroymont leaning down from the saddle and haddo getting on his toes for he was a little ruddy baldpated man more like a dwarf they greeted kindly and came to a halt within two fathoms of the child  ‘montroymont’ the curate said ‘the deil’s in ’t but i’ll have to denunciate your leddy again’  ‘deil’s in ’t indeed’ says the laird  ‘man can ye no induce her to come to the kirk’ pursues haddo ‘or to a communion at the least of it  for the conventicles let be and the same for yon solemn fule m‘brair i can blink at them  but she’s got to come to the kirk montroymont’  ‘dinna speak of it’ says the laird  ‘i can do nothing with her’  ‘couldn’t ye try the stick to her it works wonders whiles’ suggested haddo  ‘no  i’m wae to hear it  and i suppose ye ken where you’re going’  ‘fine’ said montroymont  ‘fine do i ken where bankrup’cy and the bass rock’  ‘praise to my bones that i never married’ cried the curate  ‘well it’s a grievous thing to me to see an auld house dung down that was here before flodden field  but naebody can say it was with my wish’  ‘no more they can haddo’ says the laird  ‘a good friend ye’ve been to me first and last  i can give you that character with a clear conscience’  whereupon they separated and montroymont rode briskly down into the dule valley  but of the curate francis was not to be quit so easily  he went on with his little brisk steps to the corner of a dyke and stopped and whistled and waved upon a lassie that was herding cattle there  this janet m‘clour was a big lass being taller than the curate and what made her look the more so she was kilted very high  it seemed for a while she would not come and francie heard her calling haddo a ‘daft auld fule’ and saw her running and dodging him among the whins and hags till he was fairly blown  but at the last he gets a bottle from his plaidneuk and holds it up to her whereupon she came at once into a composition and the pair sat drinking of the bottle and daffing and laughing together on a mound of heather  the boy had scarce heard of these vanities or he might have been minded of a nymph and satyr if anybody could have taken longleggit janet for a nymph  but they seemed to be huge friends he thought and was the more surprised when the curate had taken his leave to see the lassie fling stones after him with screeches of laughter and haddo turn about and caper and shake his staff at her and laugh louder than herself  a wonderful merry pair they seemed and when francie had crawled out of the hag he had a great deal to consider in his mind  it was possible they were all fallen in error about mr haddo he reflected—having seen him so tender with montroymont and so kind and playful with the lass janet and he had a temptation to go out of his road and question her herself upon the matter  but he had a strong spirit of duty on him and plodded on instead over the braes till he came near the house of cairngorm  there in a hollow place by the burnside that was shaded by some birks he was aware of a barefoot boy perhaps a matter of three years older than himself  the two approached with the precautions of a pair of strange dogs looking at each other queerly  ‘it’s ill weather on the hills’ said the stranger giving the watchword  ‘for a season’ said francie ‘but the lord will appear’  ‘richt’ said the barefoot boy ‘wha’re ye frae’  ‘the leddy montroymont’ says francie  ‘ha’e then’ says the stranger and handed him a folded paper and they stood and looked at each other again  ‘it’s unco het’ said the boy  ‘dooms het’ says francie  ‘what do they ca’ ye’ says the other  ‘francie’ says he  ‘i’m young montroymont  they ca’ me heathercat’  ‘i’m jock crozer’ said the boy  and there was another pause while each rolled a stone under his foot  ‘cast your jaiket and i’ll fecht ye for a bawbee’ cried the elder boy with sudden violence and dramatically throwing back his jacket  ‘na i’ve nae time the now’ said francie with a sharp thrill of alarm because crozer was much the heavier boy  ‘ye’re feared  heathercat indeed’ said crozer for among this infantile army of spies and messengers the fame of crozer had gone forth and was resented by his rivals  and with that they separated  on his way home francie was a good deal occupied with the recollection of this untoward incident  the challenge had been fairly offered and basely refused the tale would be carried all over the country and the lustre of the name of heathercat be dimmed  but the scene between curate haddo and janet m‘clour had also given him much to think of and he was still puzzling over the case of the curate and why such ill words were said of him and why if he were so merryspirited he should yet preach so dry when coming over a knowe whom should he see but janet sitting with her back to him minding her cattle  he was always a great child for secret stealthy ways having been employed by his mother on errands when the same was necessary and he came behind the lass without her hearing  ‘jennet’ says he  ‘keep me’ cries janet springing up  ‘o it’s you maister francie save us what a fricht ye gied me’  ‘ay it’s me’ said francie  ‘i’ve been thinking jennet i saw you and the curate a while back—’  ‘brat’ cried janet and coloured up crimson and the one moment made as if she would have stricken him with a ragged stick she had to chase her bestial with and the next was begging and praying that he would mention it to none  it was ‘naebody’s business whatever’ she said ‘it would just start a clash in the country’ and there would be nothing left for her but to drown herself in dule water  ‘why’ says francie  the girl looked at him and grew scarlet again  ‘and it isna that anyway’ continued francie  ‘it was just that he seemed so good to ye—like our father in heaven i thought and i thought that mebbe perhaps we had all been wrong about him from the first  but i’ll have to tell mr m‘brair i’m under a kind of a bargain to him to tell him all’  ‘tell it to the divil if ye like for me’ cried the lass  ‘i’ve naething to be ashamed of  tell m‘brair to mind his ain affairs’ she cried again ‘they’ll be hot eneugh for him if haddie likes’  and so strode off shoving her beasts before her and ever and again looking back and crying angry words to the boy where he stood mystified  by the time he had got home his mind was made up that he would say nothing to his mother  my lady montroymont was in the keepingroom reading a godly book she was a wonderful frail little wife to make so much noise in the world and be able to steer about that patient sheep her husband her eyes were like sloes the fingers of her hands were like tobaccopipe shanks her mouth shut tight like a trap and even when she was the most serious and still more when she was angry there hung about her face the terrifying semblance of a smile  ‘have ye gotten the billet francie said she and when he had handed it over and she had read and burned it ‘did you see anybody’ she asked  ‘i saw the laird’ said francie  ‘he didna see you though’ asked his mother  ‘deil a fear’ from francie  ‘francie’ she cried  ‘what’s that i hear an aith  the lord forgive me have i broughten forth a brand for the burning a fagot for hellfire’  ‘i’m very sorry ma’am’ said francie  ‘i humbly beg the lord’s pardon and yours for my wickedness’  ‘h’m’ grunted the lady  ‘did ye see nobody else’  ‘no ma’am’ said francie with the face of an angel ‘except jock crozer that gied me the billet’  ‘jock crozer’ cried the lady  ‘i’ll crozer them  crozers indeed  what next  are we to repose the lives of a suffering remnant in crozers  the whole clan of them wants hanging and if i had my way of it they wouldna want it long  are you aware sir that these crozers killed your forebear at the kirkdoor’  ‘you see he was bigger ’n me’ said francie  ‘jock crozer’ continued the lady  ‘that’ll be clement’s son the biggest thief and reiver in the countryside  to trust a note to him but i’ll give the benefit of my opinions to lady whitecross when we two forgather  let her look to herself  i have no patience with halfhearted carlines that complies on the lord’s day morning with the kirk and comes taigling the same night to the conventicle  the one or the other is what i say hell or heaven—haddie’s abominations or the pure word of god dreeping from the lips of mr arnot      ‘“like honey from the honeycomb        that dreepeth sweeter far”’  my lady was now fairly launched and that upon two congenial subjects the deficiencies of the lady whitecross and the turpitudes of the whole crozer race—which indeed had never been conspicuous for respectability she pursued the pair of them for twenty minutes on the clock with wonderful animation and detail something of the pulpit manner and the spirit of one possessed  ‘o hellish compliance’ she exclaimed  ‘i would not suffer a complier to break bread with christian folk  of all the sins of this day there is not one so goddefying so christhumiliating as damnable compliance’ the boy standing before her meanwhile and brokenly pursuing other thoughts mainly of haddo and janet and jock crozer stripping off his jacket  and yet with all his distraction it might be argued that he heard too much his father and himself being ‘compliers’—that is to say attending the church of the parish as the law required  presently the lady’s passion beginning to decline or her flux of ill words to be exhausted she dismissed her audience  francie bowed low left the room closed the door behind him and then turned him about in the passageway and with a low voice but a prodigious deal of sentiment repeated the name of the evil one twenty times over to the end of which for the greater efficacy he tacked on ‘damnable’ and ‘hellish’  fas est ab hoste doceri—disrespect is made more pungent by quotation and there is no doubt but he felt relieved and went upstairs into his tutor’s chamber with a quiet mind  m‘brair sat by the cheek of the peatfire and shivered for he had a quartan ague and this was his day  the great nightcap and plaid the dark unshaven cheeks of the man and the white thin hands that held the plaid about his chittering body made a sorrowful picture  but francie knew and loved him came straight in nestled close to the refugee and told his story  m‘brair had been at the college with haddo the presbytery had licensed both on the same day and at this tale told with so much innocency by the boy the heart of the tutor was commoved  ‘woe upon him  woe upon that man’ he cried  ‘o the unfaithful shepherd  o the hireling and apostate minister  make my matters hot for me quo’ she the shameless limmer  and true it is that he could repose me in that nasty stinking hole the canongate tolbooth from which your mother drew me out—the lord reward her for it—or to that cold unbieldy marine place of the bass rock which with my delicate kist would be fair ruin to me  but i will be valiant in my master’s service  i have a duty here a duty to my god to myself and to haddo in his strength i will perform it’  then he straitly discharged francie to repeat the tale and bade him in the future to avert his very eyes from the doings of the curate  ‘you must go to his place of idolatry look upon him there’ says he ‘but nowhere else  avert your eyes close your ears pass him by like a three days’ corp  he is like that damnable monster basiliscus which defiles—yea poisons—by the sight’—all which was hardly claratory to the boy’s mind  presently montroymont came home and called up the stairs to francie traquair was a good shot and swordsman and it was his pleasure to walk with his son over the braes of the moorfowl or to teach him arms in the back court when they made a mighty comely pair the child being so lean and light and active and the laird himself a man of a manly pretty stature his hair the periwig being laid aside showing already white with many anxieties and his face of an even flaccid red  but this day francie’s heart was not in the fencing  ‘sir’ says he suddenly lowering his point ‘will ye tell me a thing if i was to ask it’  ‘ask away’ says the father  ‘well it’s this’ said francie ‘why do you and me comply if it’s so wicked’  ‘ay ye have the cant of it too’ cries montroymont  ‘but i’ll tell ye for all that  it’s to try and see if we can keep the rigging on this house francie  if she had her way we would be beggarfolk and hold our hands out by the wayside  when ye hear her—when ye hear folk’ he corrected himself briskly ‘call me a coward and one that betrayed the lord and i kenna what else just mind it was to keep a bed to ye to sleep in and a bite for ye to eat—on guard’ he cried and the lesson proceeded again till they were called to supper  ‘there’s another thing yet’ said francie stopping his father  ‘there’s another thing that i am not sure that i am very caring for  she—she sends me errands’  ‘obey her then as is your bounden duty’ said traquair  ‘ay but wait till i tell ye’ says the boy  ‘if i was to see you i was to hide’  montroymont sighed  ‘well and that’s good of her too’ said he  ‘the less that i ken of thir doings the better for me and the best thing you can do is just to obey her and see and be a good son to her the same as ye are to me francie’  at the tenderness of this expression the heart of francie swelled within his bosom and his remorse was poured out  ‘faither’ he cried ‘i said “deil” today many’s the time i said it and damnable too and hellitsh  i ken they’re all right they’re beeblical  but i didna say them beeblically i said them for sweir words—that’s the truth of it’  ‘hout ye silly bairn’ said the father ‘dinna do it nae mair and come in by to your supper’  and he took the boy and drew him close to him a moment as they went through the door with something very fond and secret like a caress between a pair of lovers  the next day m‘brair was abroad in the afternoon and had a long advising with janet on the braes where she herded cattle  what passed was never wholly known but the lass wept bitterly and fell on her knees to him among the whins  the same night as soon as it was dark he took the road again for balweary  in the kirkton where the dragoons quartered he saw many lights and heard the noise of a ranting song and people laughing grossly which was highly offensive to his mind  he gave it the wider berth keeping among fields and came down at last by the waterside where the manse stands solitary between the river and the road  he tapped at the back door and the old woman called upon him to come in and guided him through the house to the study as they still called it though there was little enough study there in haddo’s days and more songbooks than theology  ‘here’s yin to speak wi’ ye mr haddie’ cries the old wife  and m‘brair opening the door and entering found the little round red man seated in one chair and his feet upon another  a clear fire and a tallow dip lighted him barely  he was taking tobacco in a pipe and smiling to himself and a brandybottle and glass and his fiddle and bow were beside him on the table  ‘hech patey m‘briar is this you’ said he a trifle tipsily  ‘step in by man and have a drop brandy for the stomach’s sake  even the deil can quote scripture—eh patey’  ‘i will neither eat nor drink with you’ replied m‘brair  ‘i am come upon my master’s errand woe be upon me if i should anyways mince the same  hall haddo i summon you to quit this kirk which you encumber’  ‘muckle obleeged’ says haddo winking  ‘you and me have been to kirk and market together’ pursued m‘brair ‘we have had blessed seasons in the kirk we have sat in the same teachingrooms and read in the same book and i know you still retain for me some carnal kindness  it would be my shame if i denied it i live here at your mercy and by your favour and glory to acknowledge it  you have pity on my wretched body which is but grass and must soon be trodden under but o haddo how much greater is the yearning with which i yearn after and pity your immortal soul  come now let us reason together  i drop all points of controversy weighty though these be i take your defaced and damnified kirk on your own terms and i ask you are you a worthy minister  the communion season approaches how can you pronounce thir solemn words “the elders will now bring forrit the elements” and not quail  a parishioner may be summoned tonight you may have to rise from your miserable orgies and i ask you haddo what does your conscience tell you  are you fit  are you fit to smooth the pillow of a parting christian  and if the summons should be for yourself how then’  haddo was startled out of all composure and the better part of his temper  ‘what’s this of it’ he cried  ‘i’m no waur than my neebours i never set up to be speeritual i never did  i’m a plain canty creature godliness is cheerfulness says i give me my fiddle and a dram and i wouldna hairm a flee’  ‘and i repeat my question’ said m‘brair ‘are you fit—fit for this great charge fit to carry and save souls’  ‘fit  blethers  as fit’s yoursel’’ cried haddo  ‘are you so great a selfdeceiver’ said m‘brair  ‘wretched man trampler upon god’s covenants crucifier of your lord afresh  i will ding you to the earth with one word how about the young woman janet m‘clour’  ‘weel what about her what do i ken’ cries haddo  ‘m’brair ye daft auld wife i tell ye as true’s truth i never meddled her  it was just daffing i tell ye daffing and nae mair a piece of fun like  i’m no denying but what i’m fond of fun sma’ blame to me  but for onything sarious—hout man it might come to a deposeetion  i’ll sweir it to ye where’s a bible till you hear me sweir’  ‘there is nae bible in your study’ said m‘brair severely  and haddo after a few distracted turns was constrained to accept the fact  ‘weel and suppose there isna’ he cried stamping  ‘what mair can ye say of us but just that i’m fond of my joke and so’s she  i declare to god by what i ken she might be the virgin mary—if she would just keep clear of the dragoons  but me na deil haet o’ me’  ‘she is penitent at least’ says m‘brair  ‘do you mean to actually up and tell me to my face that she accused me’ cried the curate  ‘i canna just say that’ replied m‘brair  ‘but i rebuked her in the name of god and she repented before me on her bended knees’  ‘weel i daursay she’s been ower far wi’ the dragoons’ said haddo  ‘i never denied that  i ken naething by it’  ‘man you but show your nakedness the more plainly’ said m‘brair ‘poor blind besotted creature—and i see you stoytering on the brink of dissolution your light out and your hours numbered  awake man’ he shouted with a formidable voice ‘awake or it be ower late’  ‘be damned if i stand this’ exclaimed haddo casting his tobaccopipe violently on the table where it was smashed in pieces  ‘out of my house with ye or i’ll call for the dragoons’  ‘the speerit of the lord is upon me’ said m‘brair with solemn ecstasy ‘i sist you to compear before the great white throne and i warn you the summons shall be bloody and sudden’  and at this with more agility than could have been expected he got clear of the room and slammed the door behind him in the face of the pursuing curate  the next lord’s day the curate was ill and the kirk closed but for all his ill words mr m‘brair abode unmolested in the house of montroymont    chapter iii—the hillend of drumlowe   this was a bit of a steep broken hill that overlooked upon the west a moorish valley full of inkblack pools  these presently drained into a burn that made off with little noise and no celerity of pace about the corner of the hill  on the far side the ground swelled into a bare heath black with junipers and spotted with the presence of the standing stones for which the place was famous  they were many in that part shapeless white with lichen—you would have said with age and had made their abode there for untold centuries since first the heathens shouted for their installation  the ancients had hallowed them to some ill religion and their neighbourhood had long been avoided by the prudent before the fall of day but of late on the upspringing of new requirements these lonely stones on the moor had again become a place of assembly  a watchful picket on the hillend commanded all the northern and eastern approaches and such was the disposition of the ground that by certain cunningly posted sentries the west also could be made secure against surprise there was no place in the country where a conventicle could meet with more quiet of mind or a more certain retreat open in the case of interference from the dragoons  the minister spoke from a knowe close to the edge of the ring and poured out the words god gave him on the very threshold of the devils of yore  when they pitched a tent which was often in wet weather upon a communion occasion it was rigged over the huge isolated pillar that had the name of aneserrand none knew why  and the congregation sat partly clustered on the slope below and partly among the idolatrous monoliths and on the turfy soil of the ring itself  in truth the situation was well qualified to give a zest to christian doctrines had there been any wanted  but these congregations assembled under conditions at once so formidable and romantic as made a zealot of the most cold  they were the last of the faithful god who had averted his face from all other countries of the world still leaned from heaven to observe with swelling sympathy the doings of his moorland remnant christ was by them with his eternal wounds with dropping tears the holy ghost never perfectly realised nor firmly adopted by protestant imaginations was dimly supposed to be in the heart of each and on the lips of the minister  and over against them was the army of the hierarchies from the men charles and james stuart on to king lewie and the emperor and the scarlet pope and the muckle black devil himself peering out the red mouth of hell in an ecstasy of hate and hope  ‘one pull more’ he seemed to cry ‘one pull more and it’s done  there’s only clydesdale and the stewartry and the three bailiaries of ayr left for god’  and with such an august assistance of powers and principalities looking on at the last conflict of good and evil it was scarce possible to spare a thought to those old infirm debile ab agendo devils whose holy place they were now violating  there might have been three hundred to four hundred present  at least there were three hundred horses tethered for the most part in the ring though some of the hearers on the outskirts of the crowd stood with their bridles in their hand ready to mount at the first signal  the circle of faces was strangely characteristic long serious strongly marked the tackle standing out in the lean brown cheeks the mouth set and the eyes shining with a fierce enthusiasm the shepherd the labouring man and the rarer laird stood there in their broad blue bonnets or laced hats and presenting an essential identity of type  from time to time a longdrawn groan of adhesion rose in this audience and was propagated like a wave to the outskirts and died away among the keepers of the horses  it had a name it was called ‘a holy groan’  a squall came up a great volley of flying mist went out before it and whelmed the scene the wind stormed with a sudden fierceness that carried away the minister’s voice and twitched his tails and made him stagger and turned the congregation for a moment into a mere pother of blowing plaidends and prancing horses and the rain followed and was dashed straight into their faces  men and women panted aloud in the shock of that violent showerbath the teeth were bared along all the line in an involuntary grimace plaids mantles and ridingcoats were proved vain and the worshippers felt the water stream on their naked flesh  the minister reinforcing his great and shrill voice continued to contend against and triumph over the rising of the squall and the dashing of the rain  ‘in that day ye may go thirty mile and not hear a crawing cock’ he said ‘and fifty mile and not get a light to your pipe and an hundred mile and not see a smoking house  for there’ll be naething in all scotland but deid men’s banes and blackness and the living anger of the lord  o where to find a bield—o sirs where to find a bield from the wind of the lord’s anger  do ye call this a wind  bethankit  sirs this is but a temporary dispensation this is but a puff of wind this is but a spit of rain and by with it  already there’s a blue bow in the west and the sun will take the crown of the causeway again and your things’ll be dried upon ye and your flesh will be warm upon your bones  but o sirs sirs for the day of the lord’s anger’  his rhetoric was set forth with an earpiercing elocution and a voice that sometimes crashed like cannon  such as it was it was the gift of all hillpreachers to a singular degree of likeness or identity  their images scarce ranged beyond the red horizon of the moor and the rainy hilltop the shepherd and his sheep a fowlingpiece a spade a pipe a dunghill a crowing cock the shining and the withdrawal of the sun  an occasional pathos of simple humanity and frequent patches of big biblical words relieved the homely tissue  it was a poetry apart bleak austere but genuine and redolent of the soil  a little before the coming of the squall there was a different scene enacting at the outposts  for the most part the sentinels were faithful to their important duty the hillend of drumlowe was known to be a safe meetingplace and the outpickets on this particular day had been somewhat lax from the beginning and grew laxer during the inordinate length of the discourse  francie lay there in his appointed hidinghole looking abroad between two whinbushes  his view was across the course of the burn then over a piece of plain moorland to a gap between two hills nothing moved but grouse and some cattle who slowly traversed his field of view heading northward he heard the psalms and sang words of his own to the savage and melancholy music for he had his own design in hand and terror and cowardice prevailed in his bosom alternately like the hot and the cold fit of an ague  courage was uppermost during the singing which he accompanied through all its length with this impromptu strain      ‘and i will ding jock crozer down        no later than the day’  presently the voice of the preacher came to him in wafts at the wind’s will as by the opening and shutting of a door wild spasms of screaming as of some undiscerned gigantic hillbird stirred with inordinate passion succeeded to intervals of silence and francie heard them with a critical ear  ‘ay’ he thought at last ‘he’ll do he has the bit in his mou’ fairly’  he had observed that his friend or rather his enemy jock crozer had been established at a very critical part of the line of outposts namely where the burn issues by an abrupt gorge from the semicircle of high moors  if anything was calculated to nerve him to battle it was this the post was important next to the hillend itself it might be called the key to the position and it was where the cover was bad and in which it was most natural to place a child  it should have been heathercat’s why had it been given to crozer  an exquisite fear of what should be the answer passed through his marrow every time he faced the question  was it possible that crozer could have boasted that there were rumours abroad to his—heathercat’s—discredit that his honour was publicly sullied  all the world went dark about him at the thought he sank without a struggle into the midnight pool of despair and every time he so sank he brought back with him—not drowned heroism indeed but halfdrowned courage by the locks  his heart beat very slowly as he deserted his station and began to crawl towards that of crozer something pulled him back and it was not the sense of duty but a remembrance of crozer’s build and hateful readiness of fist  duty as he conceived it pointed him forward on the rueful path that he was travelling  duty bade him redeem his name if he were able at the risk of broken bones and his bones and every tooth in his head ached by anticipation  an awful subsidiary fear whispered him that if he were hurt he should disgrace himself by weeping  he consoled himself boylike with the consideration that he was not yet committed he could easily steal over unseen to crozer’s post and he had a continuous private idea that he would very probably steal back again  his course took him so near the minister that he could hear some of his words ‘what news minister of claver’se  he’s going round like a roaring rampaging lion                                                                                          printed by t and a
