29397621	the doliver romance and other pieces                           tales and sketches                         by nathaniel hawthorne                             brownes folly    the wayside august 28 1860  my dear cousini should be very glad to write a story as you request for the benefit of the essex institute or for any other purpose that might be deemed desirable by my native townspeople  but it is now many years since the epoch of the twicetold tales and the mosses from an old manse and my mind seems to have lost the plan and measure of those little narratives in which it was once so unprofitably fertile  i can write no story therefore but rather than be entirely wanting to the occasion i will endeavor to describe a spot near salem on which it was once my purpose to locate such a dreamy fiction as you now demand of me  it is no other than that conspicuous hill i really know not whether it lies in salem danvers or beverly which used in my younger days to be known by the name of browns folly  this eminence is a long ridge rising out of the level country around like a whales back out of a calm sea with the head and tail beneath the surface  along its base ran a green and seldomtrodden lane with which i was very familiar in my boyhood and there was a little brook which i remember to have dammed up till its overflow made a mimic ocean  when i last looked for this tiny streamlet which was still rippling freshly through my memory i found it strangely shrunken a mere ditch indeed and almost a dry one  but the green lane was still there precisely as i remembered it two wheeltracks and the beaten path of the horses feet and grassy strips between the whole overshadowed by tall locusttrees and the prevalent barberrybushes which are rooted so fondly into the recollections of every essex man  from this lane there is a steep ascent up the side of the hill the ridge of which affords two views of very wide extent and variety  on one side is the ocean and salem and beverly on its shores on the other a rural scene almost perfectly level so that each mans metes and bounds can be traced out as on a map  the beholder takes in at a glance the estates on which different families have long been situated and the houses where they have dwelt and cherished their various interests intermarrying agreeing together or quarrelling going to live annexing little bits of real estate acting out their petty parts in life and sleeping quietly under the sod at last  a mans individual affairs look not so very important when we can climb high enough to get the idea of a complicated neighborhood  but what made the hill particularly interesting to me were the traces of an old and longvanished edifice midway on the curving ridge and at its highest point  a prerevolutionary magnate the representative of a famous old salem family had here built himself a pleasure house on a scale of magnificence which combined with its airy site and difficult approach obtained for it and for the entire hill on which it stood the traditionary title of brownes folly  whether a folly or no the house was certainly an unfortunate one  while still in its glory it was so tremendously shaken by the earthquake of 1755 that the owner dared no longer reside in it and practically acknowledging that its ambitious site rendered it indeed a folly he proceeded to locate it onhumbler ground  the great house actually took up its march along the declining ridge of the bill and came safely to the bottom where it stood till within the memory of men now alive  the proprietor meanwhile had adhered to the royalist side and fled to england during the revolution  the mansion was left under the care of richard derby an ancestor of the present derby family who had a claim to the browne property through his wife but seems to have held the premises precisely as the refugee left them for a long term of years in the expectation of his eventual return  the house remained with all its furniture in its spacious rooms and chambers ready for the exiles occupancy as soon as he should reappear  as time went on however it began to be neglected and was accessible to whatever vagrant or idle schoolboy or berrying party might choose to enter through its illsecured windows  but there was one closet in the house which everybody was afraid to enter it being supposed that an evil spiritperhaps a domestic demon of the browne familywas confined in it  one day three or four score years ago some schoolboys happened to be playing in the deserted chambers and took it into their heads to develop the secrets of this mysterious closet  with great difficulty and tremor they succeeded in forcing the door  as it flew open there was a vision of people in garments of antique magnificencegentlemen in curled wigs and tarnished goldlace and ladies in brocade and quaint headdresses rushing tumultuously forth and tumbling upon the floor  the urchins took to their heels in huge dismay but crept back after a while and discovered that the apparition was composed of a mighty pile of family portraits  i had the story the better part of a hundred years afterwards from the very schoolboy who pried open the closet door  after standing many years at the foot of the hill the house was again removed in three portions and was fashioned into three separate dwellings which for aught i know are yet extant in danvers  the ancient site of this proud mansion may still be traced or could have been ten years ago upon the summit of the hill  it consisted of two spacious wings connected by an intermediate hall of entrance which fronted lengthwise upon the ridge  two shallow and grassgrown cavities remain of what were once the deep and richly stored cellars under the two wings and between them is the outline of the connecting hall about as deep as a plough furrow and somewhat greener than the surrounding sod  the two cellars are still deep enough to shelter a visitor from the fresh breezes that haunt the summit of the hill and barberryhushes clustering within them offer the harsh acidity of their fruits instead of the rich wines which the colonial magnate was wont to store there for his guests  there i have sometimes sat and tried to rebuild in my imagination the stately house or to fancy what a splendid show it must have made even so far off as in the streets of salem when the old proprietor illuminated his many windows to celebrate the kings birthday  i have quite forgotten what story i once purposed writing about browns folly and i freely offer the theme and site to any of my young townsmen who may be addicted with the same tendency towards fanciful narratives which haunted me in my youth and long afterwards  truly yours  nathaniel hawthorne
