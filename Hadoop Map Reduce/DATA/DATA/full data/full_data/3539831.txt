on his right against the opposite wall is a standing desk with an office stool the door is in the wall behind him half way between the table and the desk the table is not quite in the middle of the room it is nearer to the hearthrug than to the desk there is a chair at each end of it for persons having business with the general there is a telephone on the table long silence  a voice outside votes for women  the general starts convulsively snatches a revolver from a drawer and listens in an agony of apprehension nothing happens he puts the revolver back ashamed wipes his brow and resumes his work he is startled afresh by the entry of an orderly this orderly is an unsoldierly slovenly discontented young man  mitchener oh its only you well  the orderly another one sir shes chained herself  mitchener chained herself how to what weve taken away the railings and everything that a chain can be passed through  the orderly we forgot the doorscraper sir she laid down on the flags and got the chain through before she started hollerin shes lying there now and she says that youve got the key of the padlock in a letter in a buff envelope and that you will see her when you open it  mitchener shes mad have the scraper dug up and let her go home with it hanging round her neck  the orderly theres a buff envelope there sir  mitchener youre all afraid of these women picking the letter up it does seem to have a key in it he opens the letter and takes out a key and a note dear mitchwell im dashed  the orderly yes sir  mitchener what do you mean by yes sir  the orderly well you said you was dashed sir and you did look if youll excuse my saying it sirwell you looked it  mitchener who has been reading the letter and is too astonished to attend to the orderlys reply this is a letter from the prime minister asking me to release the woman with this key if she padlocks herself and to have her shown up and see her at once  the orderly tremulously dont do it governor  mitchener angrily how often have i ordered you not to address me as governor remember that you are a soldier and not a vulgar civilian remember also that when a man enters the army he leaves fear behind him heres the key unlock her and show her up  the orderly me unlock her i dursent lord knows what shed do to me  mitchener pepperily rising obey your orders instantly sir and dont presume to argue even if she kills you it is your duty to die for your country right about face march the orderly goes out trembling  the voice outside votes for women votes for women votes for women  mitchener mimicking her votes for women votes for women votes for women in his natural voice votes for children votes for babies votes for monkeys he posts himself on the hearthrug and awaits the enemy  the orderly outside in you go he pushes a panting suffraget into the room the person sir he withdraws  the suffraget takes off her tailor made skirt and reveals a pair of fashionable trousers  mitchener horrified stop madam what are you doing you must not undress in my presence i protest not even your letter from the prime minister  the suffraget my dear mitchener i am the prime minister he tears off his hat and cloak throws them on the desk and confronts the general in the ordinary costume of a cabinet minister  mitchener good heavens balsquith  balsquith throwing himself into mitcheners chair yes it is indeed balsquith it has come to this that the only way that the prime minister of england can get from downing street to the war office is by assuming this disguise shrieking votes for women and chaining himself to your doorscraper they were at the corner in force they cheered me bellachristina herself was there she shook my hand and told me to say i was a vegetarian as the diet was better in holloway for vegetarians  mitchener why didnt you telephone  balsquith they tap the telephone every switchboard in london is in their hands or in those of their young men  mitchener where on earth did you get that dress  balsquith i stole it from a little exhibition got up by my wife in downing street  mitchener you dont mean to say its a french dress  balsquith great heavens no my wife isnt allowed even to put on her gloves with french chalk everything labelled made in camberwell she advised me to come to you and what i have to say must be said here to you personally in the most intimate confidence with the most urgent persuasion mitchener sandstone has resigned  mitchener amazed old red resigned  balsquith resigned  mitchener but how why oh impossible the proclamation of martial law last tuesday made sandstone virtually dictator in the metropolis and to resign now is flat desertion  balsquith yes yes my dear mitchener i know all that as well as you do i argued with him until i was black in the face and he so red about the neck that if i had gone on he would have burst he is furious because we have abandoned his plan  mitchener but you accepted it unconditionally  balsquith yes before we knew what it was it was unworkable you know  mitchener i dont know why is it unworkable  balsquith i mean the part about drawing a cordon round westminster at a distance of two miles and turning all women out of it  mitchener a masterpiece of strategy let me explain the suffragets are a very small body but they are numerous enough to be troublesomeeven dangerouswhen they are all concentrated in one placesay in parliament square but by making a twomile radius and pushing them beyond it you scatter their attack over a circular line twelve miles long a superb piece of tactics just what wellington would have done  balsquith but the women wont go  mitchener nonsense they must go  balsquith they wont  mitchener what does sandstone say  balsquith he says shoot them down  mitchener of course  balsquith youre not serious  mitchener im perfectly serious  balsquith but you cant shoot them down women you know  mitchener straddling confidently yes you can strange as it may seem to you as a civilian balsquith if you point a rifle at a woman and fire it she will drop exactly as a man drops  balsquith but suppose your own daughtershelen and georgina  mitchener my daughters would not dream of disobeying the proclamation as an after thought at least helen wouldnt  balsquith but georgina  mitchener georgina would if she knew shed be shot if she didnt thats how the thing would work military methods are really the most merciful in the end you keep sending these misguided women to holloway and killing them slowly and inhumanely by ruining their health and it does no good they go on worse than ever shoot a few promptly and humanely and there will be an end at once of all resistance and of all the suffering that resistance entails  balsquith but public opinion would never stand it  mitchener walking about and laying down the law theres no such thing as public opinion  balsquith no such thing as public opinion  mitchener absolutely no such thing as public opinion there are certain persons who entertain certain opinions well shoot them down when you have shot them down there are no longer any persons entertaining those opinions alive consequently there is no longer any more of the public opinion you are so much afraid of grasp that fact my dear balsquith and you have grasped the secret of government public opinion is mind mind is inseparable from matter shoot down the matter and you kill the mind  balsquith but hang it all  mitchener intolerantly no i wont hang it all its no use coming to me and talking about public opinion you have put yourself into the hands of the army and you are committed to military methods and the basis of all military methods is that when people wont do what they are told to do you shoot them down  balsquith oh yes its all jolly fine for you and old red you dont depend on votes for your places what do you suppose will happen at the next election  mitchener have no next election bring in a bill at once repealing all the reform acts and vesting the government in a properly trained magistracy responsible only to a council of war it answers perfectly in india if anyone objects shoot him down  balsquith but none of the members of my party would be on the council of war neither should i do you expect us to vote for making ourselves nobodies  mitchener youll have to sooner or later or the socialists will make nobodies of the lot of you by collaring every penny you possess do you suppose this damned democracy can be allowed to go on now that the mob is beginning to take it seriously and using its power to lay hands on property parliament must abolish itself the irish parliament voted for its own extinction the english parliament will do the same if the same means are taken to persuade it  balsquith that would cost a lot of money  mitchener not money necessarily bribe them with titles  balsquith do you think we dare  mitchener scornfully dare dare what is life but daring man to dare to dare and again to dare  womans voice outside votes for women  mitchener revolver in hand rushes to the door and locks it balsquith hides under the table  a shot is heard  balsquith emerging in the greatest alarm good heavens you havent given orders to fire on them have you  mitchener no but its a sentinels duty to fire on anyone who persists in attempting to pass without giving the word  balsquith wiping his brow this military business is really awful  mitchener be calm balsquith these things must happen they save bloodshed in the long run believe me ive seen plenty of it and i know  balsquith i havent and i dont know i wish those guns didnt make such a devil of a noise we must adopt maxims silencer for the army rifles if we are going to shoot women i really couldnt stand hearing it  some one outside tries to open the door and then knocks  mitchener and balsquith whats that  mitchener whos there  the orderly its only me governor its all right  mitchener unlocking the door and admitting the orderly who comes between them what was it  the orderly suffraget sir  balsquith did the sentry shoot her  the orderly no sir she shot the sentry  balsquith relieved oh is that all  mitchener most indignantly all a civilian shoots down one of his majestys soldiers on duty and the prime minister of england asks is that all have you no regard for the sanctity of human life  balsquith much relieved well getting shot is what a soldier is for besides he doesnt vote  mitchener neither do the suffragets  balsquith their husbands do to the orderly by the way did she kill him  the orderly no sir he got a stinger on his trousers sir but it didnt penetrate he lost his temper a bit and put down his gun and clouted her head for her so she said he was no gentleman and we let her go thinking shed had enough sir  mitchener groaning clouted her head these women are making the army as lawless as themselves clouted her head indeed a purely civil procedure  the orderly any orders sir  mitchener no yes no yes send everybody who took part in this disgraceful scene to the guardroom no ill address the men on the subject after lunch parade them for that purposefull kit dont grin at me sir right about face march the orderly obeys and goes out  balsquith taking mitchener affectionately by the arm and walking him persuasively to and fro and now mitchener will you come to the rescue of the government and take the command that old red has thrown up  mitchener how can i you know that the people are devoted heart and soul to sandstone he is only bringing you on the knee as we say in the army could any other living man have persuaded the british nation to accept universal compulsory military service as he did last year why even the church refused exemption he is supremeomnipotent  balsquith he was a year ago but ever since your book of reminiscences went into two more editions than his and the rush for it led to the wrecking of the times book club you have become to all intents and purposes his senior he lost ground by saying that the wrecking was got up by the booksellers it showed jealousy and the public felt it  mitchener but i cracked him up in my bookyou see i could do no less after the handsome way he cracked me up in hisand i cant go back on it now breaking loose from balsquith no its no use balsquith he can dictate his terms to you  balsquith not a bit of it that affair of the curate  mitchener impatiently oh damn that curate ive heard of nothing but that wretched mutineer for a fortnight past he is not a curate whilst he is serving in the army he is a private soldier and nothing else i really havent time to discuss him further im busy good morning he sits down at his table and takes up his letters  balsquith near the door i am sorry you take that tone mitchener since you do take it let me tell you frankly that i think lieutenant chubbsjenkinson showed a great want of consideration for the government in giving an unreasonable and unpopular order and bringing compulsory military service into disrepute when the leader of the labor party appealed to me and to the house last year not to throw away all the liberties of englishmen by accepting universal compulsory military service without insisting on full civil rights for the soldier  mitchener rot  balsquith i said that no british officer would be capable of abusing the authority with which it was absolutely necessary to invest him  mitchener quite right  balsquith that carried the house and carried the country  mitchener naturally  balsquith and the feeling was that the labor party were soulless cads  mitchener so they are  balsquith and now comes this unmannerly young whelp chubbsjenkinson the only son of what they call a soda king and orders a curate to lick his boots and when the curate punches his head you first sentence him to be shot and then make a great show of clemency by commuting it to a flogging what did you expect the curate to do  mitchener throwing down his pen and his letters and jumping up to confront balsquith his duty was perfectly simple he should have obeyed the order and then laid his complaint against the officer in proper form he would have received the fullest satisfaction  balsquith what satisfaction  mitchener chubbsjenkinson would have been reprimanded in fact he was reprimanded besides the man was thoroughly insubordinate you cant deny that the very first thing he did when they took him down after flogging him was to walk up to chubbsjenkinson and break his jaw that showed there was no use flogging him so now he will get two years hard labor and serve him right  balsquith i bet you a guinea he wont get even a week i bet you another that chubbsjenkinson apologizes abjectly you evidently havent heard the news  mitchener what news  balsquith it turns out that the curate is well connected mitchener staggers at the shock speechless he contemplates balsquith with a wild and ghastly stare then reels into his chair and buries his face in his hands over the blotter balsquith continues remorselessly stooping over him to rub it in he has three aunts in the peerage and lady richmonds one of them mitchener utters a heartrending groan and they all adore him the invitations for six garden parties and fourteen dances have been cancelled for all the subalterns in chubbss regiment is it possible you havent heard of it  mitchener not a word  balsquith shaking his head i suppose nobody dared to tell you he sits down carelessly on mitcheners right  mitchener what an infernal young fool chubbsjenkinson is not to know the standing of his man better why didnt he know it was his business to know he ought to be flogged  balsquith probably he will be by the other subalterns  mitchener i hope so anyhow out he goes out of the army he or i  balsquith his father has subscribed a million to the party funds we owe him a peerage  mitchener i dont care  balsquith i do how do you think parties are kept up not by the subscriptions of the local associations i hope they dont pay for the gas at the meetings  mitchener man can you not be serious here are we face to face with lady richmonds grave displeasure and you talk to me about gas and subscriptions her own nephew  balsquith gloomily its unfortunate he was at oxford with bobby bassborough  mitchener worse and worse what shall we do  balsquith shakes his head they contemplate one another in miserable silence  a voice without votes for women votes for women  a terrific explosion shakes the buildingthey take no notice  mitchener breaking down you dont know what this means to me balsquith i love the army i love my country  balsquith it certainly is rather awkward  the orderly comes in  mitchener angrily what is it how dare you interrupt us like this  the orderly didnt you hear the explosion sir  mitchener explosion what explosion no i heard no explosion i have something more serious to attend to than explosions great heavens lady richmonds nephew has been treated like any common laborer and while england is reeling under the shock a private comes in and asks me if i heard an explosion  balsquith by the way what was the explosion  the orderly only a sort of bombshell sir  balsquith bombshell  the orderly a pasteboard one sir full of papers with votes for women in red letters fired into the yard from the roof of the alliance office  mitchener pooh go away go away  the orderly bewildered goes out  balsquith mitchener you can save the country yet put on your fulldress uniform and your medals and orders and so forth get a guard of honorsomething showyhorse guards or something of that sort and call on the old girl  mitchener the old girl  balsquith well lady richmond apologize to her ask her leave to accept the command tell her that youve made the curate your adjutant or your aidedecamp or whatever is the proper thing by the way what can you make him  mitchener i might make him my chaplain i dont see why i shouldnt have a chaplain on my staff he showed a very proper spirit in punching that young cubs head i should have done the same myself  balsquith then ive your promise to take command if lady richmond consents  mitchener on condition that i have a free hand no nonsense about public opinion or democracy  balsquith as far as possible i think i may say yes  mitchener rising intolerantly and going to the hearthrug that wont do for me dont be weakkneed balsquith you know perfectly well that the real government of this country is and always must be the government of the masses by the classes you know that democracy is damned nonsense and that no class stands less of it than the working class you know that we are already discussing the steps that will have to be taken if the country should ever be face to face with the possibility of a labor majority in parliament you know that in that case we should disfranchise the mob and if they made a fuss shoot them down you know that if we need public opinion to support us we can get any quantity of it manufactured in our papers by poor devils of journalists who will sell their souls for five shillings you know  balsquith stop stop i say i dont know that is the difference between your job and mine mitchener after twenty years in the army a man thinks he knows everything after twenty months in the cabinet he knows that he knows nothing  mitchener we learn from history  balsquith we learn from history that men never learn anything from history thats not my own its hegel  mitchener whos hegel  balsquith dead a german philosopher he half rises but recollects something and sits down again oh confound it that reminds me the germans have laid down four more dreadnoughts  mitchener then you must lay down twelve  balsquith oh yes its easy to say that but think of what theyll cost  mitchener think of what it would cost to be invaded by germany and forced to pay an indemnity of five hundred millions  balsquith but you said that if you got compulsory military service there would be an end of the danger of invasion  mitchener on the contrary my dear fellow it increases the danger tenfold because it increases german jealousy of our military supremacy  balsquith after all why should the germans invade us  mitchener why shouldnt they what else has their army to do what else are they building a navy for  balsquith well we never think of invading germany  mitchener yes we do i have thought of nothing else for the last ten years say what you will balsquith the germans have never recognized and until they get a stern lesson they never will recognize the plain fact that the interests of the british empire are paramount and that the command of the sea belongs by nature to england  balsquith but if they wont recognize it what can i do  mitchener shoot them down  balsquith i cant shoot them down  mitchener yes you can you dont realize it but if you fire a rifle into a german he drops just as surely as a rabbit does  balsquith but dash it all man a rabbit hasnt got a rifle and a german has suppose he shoots you down  mitchener excuse me balsquith but that consideration is what we call cowardice in the army a soldier always assumes that he is going to shoot not to be shot  balsquith jumping up and walking about sulkily oh come i like to hear you military people talking of cowardice why you spend your lives in an ecstasy of terror of imaginary invasions i dont believe you ever go to bed without looking under it for a burglar  mitchener calmly a very sensible precaution balsquith i always take it and in consequence ive never been burgled  balsquith neither have i anyhow dont you taunt me with cowardice he posts himself on the hearthrug beside mitchener on his left i never look under my bed for a burglar im not always looking under the nations bed for an invader and if it comes to fighting im quite willing to fight without being three to one  mitchener these are the romantic ravings of a jingo civilian balsquith at least youll not deny that the absolute command of the sea is essential to our security  balsquith the absolute command of the sea is essential to the security of the principality of monaco but monaco isnt going to get it  mitchener and consequently monaco enjoys no security what a frightful thing how do the inhabitants sleep with the possibility of invasion of bombardment continually present to their minds would you have our english slumbers broken in the same way are we also to live without security  balsquith dogmatically yes theres no such thing as security in the world and there never can be as long as men are mortal england will be secure when england is dead just as the streets of london will be safe when there is no longer a man in her streets to be run over or a vehicle to run over him when you military chaps ask for security you are crying for the moon  mitchener very seriously let me tell you balsquith that in these days of aeroplanes and zeppelin airships the question of the moon is becoming one of the greatest importance it will be reached at no very distant date can you as an englishman tamely contemplate the possibility of having to live under a german moon the british flag must be planted there at all hazards  balsquith my dear mitchener the moon is outside practical politics id swop it for a cooling station tomorrow with germany or any other power sufficiently military in its way of thinking to attach any importance to it  mitchener losing his temper you are the friend of every country but your own  balsquith say nobodys enemy but my own it sounds nicer you really neednt be so horribly afraid of the other countries theyre all in the same fix as we are im much more interested in the death rate in lambeth than in the german fleet  mitchener you darent say that in lambeth  balsquith ill say it the day after you publish your scheme for invading germany and repealing all the reform acts  the orderly comes in  mitchener what do you want  the orderly i dont want anything governor thank you the secretary and president of the antisuffraget league say they had an appointment with the prime minister and that theyve been sent on here from downing street  balsquith going to the table quite right i forgot them to mitchener would you mind my seeing them here i feel extraordinarily grateful to these women for standing by us and facing the suffragets especially as they are naturally the gentler and timid sort of women the orderly moans did you say anything  the orderly no sir  balsquith did you catch their names  the orderly yes sir the president is lady corinthia fanshawe and the secretary is mrs banger  mitchener abruptly mrs what  the orderly mrs banger  balsquith curious that quiet people always seem to have violent names  the orderly not much quiet about her sir  mitchener outraged attention speak when youre spoken to hold your tongue when youre not right about face march the orderly obeys thats the way to keep these chaps up to the mark the orderly returns back again what do you mean by this mutiny  the orderly what am i to say to the ladies sir  balsquith you dont mind my seeing them somewhere do you  mitchener not at all bring them in to see me when youve done with them i understand that lady corinthia is a very fascinating woman who is she by the way  balsquith daughter of lord broadstairs the automatic turbine man gave quarter of a million to the party funds shes musical and romantic and all thatdont hunt hates politics stops in town all the year round one never sees her anywhere except at the opera and at musical athomes and so forth  mitchener what a life still if she wants to see me i dont mind to the orderly where are the ladies  the orderly in no 17 sir  mitchener show mr balsquith there and send mrs farrell here  the orderly calling into the corridor mrs farrell to balsquith this way sir he goes out with balsquith  mrs farrell a lean highly respectable irish charwoman of about 50 comes in  mitchener mrs farrell ive a very important visit to pay i shall want my full dress uniform and all my medals and orders and my presentation sword there was a time when the british army contained men capable of discharging these duties for their commanding officer those days are over the compulsorily enlisted soldier runs to a woman for everything im therefore reluctantly obliged to trouble you  mrs farrell your meddles n ordhers n the crooked sword with the ivory handle n your full dress uniform is in the waxworks in the chamber o military glory over in the place they used to call the banquetin hall i told you youd be sorry for sendin them away n you told me to mind me own business youre wiser now  mitchener i am i had not at that time discovered that you were the only person in the whole military establishment of this capital who could be trusted to remember where anything was or to understand an order and obey it  mrs farrell its no good flattherin me im too old  mitchener not at all mrs farrell how is your daughter  mrs farrell which daughther  mitchener the one who has made such a gratifying success in the music halls  mrs farrell theres no music halls nowadays theyre variety theatres shes got an offer of marriage from a young jook  mitchener is it possible what did you do  mrs farrell i told his mother on him  mitchener oh what did she say  mrs farrell she was as pleased as punch thank heaven she says hes got somebody thatll be able to keep him when the supertax is put up to twenty shillings in the pound  mitchener but your daughter herself what did she say  mrs farrell accepted him of course what else would a young fool like her do he inthrojooced her to the poet laureate thinking shed inspire him  mitchener did she  mrs farrell faith i dunna all i know is she walked up to him as bold as brass n said write me a sketch dear afther all the trouble i took with that chills manners shes no more notion how to behave herself than a pig youll have to wear general sandstones uniform its the ony one in the place because he wont lend it to the shows  mitchener but sandstones clothes wont fit me  mrs farrell unmoved then youll have to fit them why shouldnt they fitcha as well as they fitted general blake at the mansion house  mitchener they didnt fit him he looked a frightful guy  mrs farrell well you must do the best you can with them you cant exhibit your clothes and wear them too  mitchener and the public thinks the lot of a commanding officer a happy one oh if they could only see the seamy side of it he returns to his table to resume work  mrs farrell if they could only see the seamy side of general sandstones uniform where his flask rubs agen the buckle of his braces theyll tell him he ought to get a new one let alone the way he swears at me  mitchener when a man has risked his life on eight battlefields mrs farrell he has given sufficient proof of his selfcontrol to be excused a little strong language  mrs farrell would you put up with bad language from me because ive risked my life eight times in childbed  mitchener my dear mrs farrell you surely would not compare a risk of that harmless domestic kind to the fearful risks of the battlefield  mrs farrell i wouldnt compare risks run to bear living people into the world to risks run to blow them out of it a mothers risk is jooty a soldiers nothin but divilmint  mitchener nettled let me tell you mrs farrell that if the men did not fight the women would have to fight themselves we spare you that at all events  mrs farrell you cant help yourselves if threequarters of you was killed we could replace you with the help of the other quarter if threequarters of us was killed how many people would there be in england in another generation if it wasnt for that the man d put the fightin on us just as they put all the other dhrudgery what would you do if we was all kilt would you go to bed and have twins  mitchener really mrs farrell you must discuss these questions with a medical man you make me blush positively  mrs farrell a good job too if i could have made farrell blush i wouldnt have had to risk me life too often you n your risks n your bravery n your selfcontrol indeed why dont you conthrol yourself i sez to farrell its agen me religion he sez  mitchener plaintively mrs farrell youre a woman of very powerful mind im not qualified to argue these delicate matters with you i ask you to spare me and to be good enough to take these clothes to mr balsquith when the ladies leave  the orderly comes in  the orderly lady corinthia fanshawe and mrs banger wish to see you sir mr balsquith told me to tell you  mrs farrell theyve come about the vote i dont know whether its them that want it or them that

orderly no sir couldnt stand mrs banger i expect fair caution she is he chuckles couldnt help larfin when i sor im op it  mitchener how dare you indulge in this unseemly mirth in the presence of your commanding officer have you no sense of a soldiers duty  the orderly sadly im afraid i shant ever get the ang of it sir you see my father has a tidy little barbers business down off shoreditch and i was brought up to be chatty and easy like with everybody i tell you when i drew the number in the conscription it gave my old mother the needle and it gev me the ump i should take it very kind sir if

proper work for a man with an active mind as you might say sir arf of its only ousemaidin and the other arf is dressup and makebelieve  mitchener stuff sir its the easiest life in the world once you learn your drill all you have to do is to hold your tongue and obey your orders  the orderly but i do assure you sir arf the time theyre the wrong orders and i get into trouble when i obey them the sergeants orders is all right but the officers dont know what theyre talkin about why the orses knows better sometimes fours says lieutenant trevor at the gate of bucknam palace only this morning when

discipline he says what am i to do for the general i says youre to let im talk e says thats what es for  mitchener groaning it is impossible for the human mind to conceive anything more dreadful than this youre a disgrace to the service  the orderly deeply wounded the service is a disgrace to me when my mothers people pass me in the street with this uniform on i ardly know which way to look there never was a soldier in my family before  mitchener there never was anything else in mine sir  the orderly my mothers second cousin was one of the parkinsons of stepney almost in tears what do you know of the feelings of a respectable family in the middle station of life i cant bear to be looked down on as a common soldier why cant my father be let buy my discharge youve done away with the soldiers right to have his discharge bought for him by his relations the country didnt know you were going to do that or it would never have stood it is an englishman to be made a mockery like this  mitchener silence attention right about face march  the orderly retiring to the standing desk and bedewing it with passionate tears oh that i should have lived to be spoke to as if i was the lowest of the low me that has shaved a city of london aldermen wiv me own hand  mitchener poltroon crybaby well better disgrace yourself here than disgrace your country on the field of battle  the orderly angrily coming to the table whos going to disgrace his country on the field of battle its not fightin i object to its soljerin show me a german and ill have a go at him as fast as you or any man but to ave me time wasted like this an be stuck in a sentry box at a street corner for an ornament to be stared at and to be told right about face march if i speak as one man to another that aint pluck that aint fightin that aint patriotism its bein made a bloomin sheep of  mitchener a sheep has many valuable military qualities emulate them dont disparage them  the orderly oh wots the good of talkin to you if i wasnt a poor soldier i could punch your head for forty shillins for a month but because youre my commanding officer you deprive me of my right to a magistrate and make a compliment of giving me two years ard sted of shootin me why cant you take your chance the same as any civilian does  mitchener rising majestically i search the pages of history in vain for a parallel to such a speech made by a private to a general but for the coherence of your remarks i should conclude that you were drunk as it is you must be mad you shall be placed under restraint at once call the guard  the orderly call your grandmother if you take one man off the doors the placell be full of suffragets before you can wink  mitchener then arrest yourself and off with you to the guardroom  the orderly what am i to

as if you was a doormat  mitchener i should feel as if my country had spoken through the voice of my officer i should feel proud and honored to be able to serve my country by obeying its commands no thought of selfno vulgar preoccupation with my own petty vanity could touch my mind at such a moment to me my officer would not be a mere man he would be for the momentwhatever his personal frailtiesthe incarnation of our national destiny  the orderly what im saying to you is the voice of old england a jolly sight more than all this rot that you get out of books id rather be spoke to by a sergeant than by you he tells me to go to hell when i challenges him to argue it out like a man it aint polite but its english what you say aint anything at all you dont act on it yourself you dont believe in it youd punch my head if i tried it on you and serve me right and look here heres another point for you to argue  mitchener with a shriek of protest no  mrs banger comes in followed by lady corinthia fanshawe  mrs banger is a masculine woman of forty with a powerful voice and great physical strength lady corinthia who is also over thirty is beautiful and romantic  mrs banger throwing the door open decisively and marching straight to michener pray how much longer is the antisuffrage league to be kept waiting she passes him contemptuously and sits down with impressive confidence in the chair next the fireplace lady corinthia takes the chair on the opposite side of the table with equal aplomb  mitchener im extremely sorry you really do not know what i have to put with this imbecile incompetent unsoldierly disgrace to the uniform he should never have been allowed to put on ought to have shown you in fifteen minutes ago  the orderly all i said was  mitchener not another word attention right about face march the orderly sits down doggedly get out of the room this instant you fool or ill kick you out  the orderly civilly i dont mind that sir its human its english why couldnt you have said it before he goes out  mitchener take no notice i beg these scenes are of daily occurrence now that we have compulsory service under the command of the halfpenny papers pray sit down  lady corinthia and mrs banger rising thank you they sit down again  mitchener sitting down with a slight chuckle of satisfaction and now ladies to what am i indebted  mrs banger let me introduce us i am rosa carmina bangermrs banger organizing secretary of the antisuffraget league this is lady corinthia fanshawe the president of the league known in musical circlesi am not myself musicalas the richmond park nightingale a soprano i am myself said to be almost a baritone but i do not profess to understand these distinctions  mitchener murmuring politely most happy im sure  mrs banger we have come to tell you plainly that the antisuffragets are going to fight  mitchener gallantly oh pray leave that to the men mrs banger  lady corinthia we can no longer trust the men  mrs banger they have shown neither the strength the courage nor the determination which are needed to combat women like the suffragets  lady corinthia nature is too strong for the combatants  mrs banger physical struggles between persons of opposite sexes are unseemly  lady corinthia demoralizing  mrs banger insincere  lady corinthia they are merely embraces in disguise  mrs banger no such suspicion can attach to combats in which the antagonists are of the same sex  lady corinthia the antisuffragets have resolved to take the field  mrs banger they will enforce the order of general sandstone for the removal of all women from the two mile radiusthat is all women except themselves  mitchener i am sorry to have to inform you madam that the government has given up that project and that general sandstone has resigned in consequence  mrs banger that does not concern us in the least we approve of the project and will see that it is carried out we have spent a good deal of money arming ourselves and we are not going to have that money thrown away through the pusillanimity of a cabinet of males  mitchener arming yourselves but my dear ladies under the latest proclamation women are strictly forbidden to carry chains padlocks tracts on the franchise or weapons of any description  lady corinthia producing an ivoryhandled revolver and pointing it at his nose you little know your countrywomen general mitchener  mitchener without flinching madam it is my duty to take possession of that weapon in accordance with the proclamation be good enough to put it down  mrs banger producing an xviii century horse pistol is it your duty to take possession of this also  mitchener that madam is not a weapon it is a curiosity if you would be kind enough to place it in some museum instead of pointing it at my head i should be obliged to you  mrs banger this pistol sir was carried at waterloo by my grandmother  mitchener i presume you mean your grandfather  mrs banger you presume unwarrantably  lady corinthia mrs bangers grandmother commanded a canteen at that celebrated battle  mrs banger who my grandfather was is a point that has never been quite clearly settled i put my trust not in my ancestors but in my good sword which is at my lodgings  mitchener your sword  mrs banger the sword with which i slew five egyptians with my own hand at kassassin where i served as a trooper  mitchener lord bless me but was your sex never discovered  mrs banger it was never even suspected i had a comradea gentleman rankerwhom they called fanny they never called me fanny  lady corinthia the suffragets have turned the whole woman movement on to the wrong track they ask for a vote  mrs banger what use is a vote men have the vote  lady corinthia and men are slaves  mrs banger what women need is the right to military service give me a wellmounted regiment of women with sabres opposed to a regiment of men with votes we shall see which will go down before the other rises no we have had enough of these gentle pretty creatures who merely talk and crossexamine ministers in police courts and go to prison like sheep and suffer and sacrifice themselves this question must be solved by blood and iron as was well said by bismarck whom i have reason to believe was a woman in disguise  mitchener bismarck a woman  mrs banger all the really strong men of history have been disguised women  mitchener remonstrating my dear lady  mrs banger how can you tell you never knew that the hero of the charge at kassassin was a woman yet she was it was i rosa carmina banger would napoleon have been so brutal to women think you had he been a man  mitchener oh come come really surely female rulers have often shown all the feminine weaknesses queen elizabeth for instance her vanity her levity  mrs banger nobody who has studied the history of queen elizabeth can doubt for a moment that she was a disguised man  lady corinthia admiring mrs banger isnt she splendid  mrs banger rising with a large gesture this very afternoon i shall cast off this hampering skirt for ever mount my charger and with my good sabre lead the antisuffragets to victory she strides to the other side of the room snorting  mitchener but i cant allow anything of the sort madam i shall stand no such ridiculous nonsense im perfectly determined to put my foot down  lady corinthia dont be hysterical general  mitchener hysterical  mrs banger do you think we are to be stopped by these childish exhibitions of temper they are useless and your tears and entreatiesa mans last resourcewill avail you just as little i sweep them away just as i sweep your plans of campaign made in germany  mitchener flying into a transport of rage how dare you repeat that infamous slander he rings the bell violently if this is the alternative to votes for women i shall advocate giving every woman in the country six votes  the orderly comes in  remove that woman see that she leaves the building at once  the orderly forlornly contemplates the iron front presented by mrs banger  the orderly propitiatorily would you av the feelin art to step out madam  mrs banger you are a soldier obey your orders put me out if i got such an order i should not hesitate  the orderly to mitchener would you mind lendin me a and guvner  lady corinthia raising her revolver i shall be obliged to shoot you if you stir general  mrs banger to the orderly when you are ordered to put a person out you should do it like this she hurls him from the room he is heard falling headlong downstairs and crashing through a glass door i shall now wait on general sandstone if he shows any sign of weakness he shall share that poor wretchs fate she goes out  lady corinthia isnt she magnificent  mitchener thank heaven shes gone and now my dear lady is it necessary to keep that loaded pistol to my nose all through our conversation  lady corinthia its not loaded its heavy enough goodness knows without putting bullets in it  mitchener triumphantly snatching his revolver from the drawer then i am master of the situation this is loaded ha ha  lady corinthia but since we are not really going to shoot one another what difference can it possibly make  mitchener putting his pistol down on the table true quite true i recognize there the practical good sense that has prevented you from falling into the snares of the suffragets  lady corinthia the suffragets general are the dupes of dowdies a really attractive and clever woman  mitchener gallantly yourself for instance  lady corinthia snatching up his revolver another step and you are a dead man  mitchener amazed my dear lady  lady corinthia i am not your dear lady you are not the first man who has concluded that because i am devoted to music and can reach f flat with the greatest facilitypatti never got above e flati am marked out as the prey of every libertine you think i am like the thousands of weak women whom you have ruined  mitchener i solemnly protest  lady corinthia oh i know what you officers are to you a womans honor is nothing and the idle pleasure of the moment is everything  mitchener this is perfectly ridiculous i never ruined anyone in my life  lady corinthia never are you in earnest  mitchener certainly i am in earnest most indignantly in earnest  lady corinthia throwing down the pistol contemptuously then you have no temperament you are not an artist you have no soul for music  mitchener ive subscribed to the regimental band all my life i bought two sarrusophones for it out of my own pocket when i sang tostis goodbye for ever at knightsbridge in 1880 the whole regiment wept you are too young to remember that  lady corinthia your advances are useless i  mitchener confound it madam can you not receive an innocent compliment without suspecting me of dishonorable intentions  lady corinthia lovereal lovemakes all intentions honorable but you could never understand that  mitchener ill not submit to the vulgar pennynovelette notion that an officer is less honorable than a civilian in his relations with women while i live ill raise my voice  lady corinthia tush  mitchener what do you mean by tush  lady corinthia you cant raise your voice above its natural compass what sort of voice have you  mitchener a tenor what sort had you  lady corinthia had i have it still i tell you i am the highest living soprano scornfully what was your highest note pray  mitchener b flatoncein 1879 i was drunk at the time  lady corinthia gazing at him almost tenderly though you may not believe me i find you are more interesting when you talk about music than when you are endeavoring to betray a woman who has trusted you by remaining alone with you in your apartment  mitchener springing up and fuming away to the fireplace these repeated insults to a man of blameless life are as disgraceful to you as they are undeserved by me lady corinthia such suspicions invite the conduct they impute she raises the pistol you need not be alarmed i am only going to leave the room  lady corinthia fish  mitchener fish this is worse than tush why fish  lady corinthia yes fish coldblooded fish  mitchener dash it all madam do you want me to make advances to you  lady corinthia i have not the slightest intention of yielding to them but to make them would be a tribute to romance what is life without romance  mitchener making a movement toward her i tell you  lady corinthia stop no nearer no vulgar sensuousness if you must adore adore at a distance  mitchener this is worse than mrs banger i shall ask that estimable woman to come back  lady corinthia poor mrs banger do not for a moment suppose general mitchener that mrs banger represents my views on the suffrage question mrs banger is a man in petticoats i am every inch a woman but i find it convenient to work with her  mitchener do you find the combination comfortable  lady corinthia i do not wear combinations general with dignity they are unwomanly  mitchener throwing himself despairingly into the chair next the hearthrug i shall go mad i never for a moment dreamt of alluding to anything of the sort  lady corinthia there is no need to blush and become selfconscious at the mention of underclothing you are extremely vulgar general  mitchener lady corinthia you have my pistol will you have the goodness to blow my brains out i should prefer it to any further effort to follow the gyrations of the weathercock you no doubt call your mind if you refuse then i warn you that youll not get another word out of menot if we sit here until doomsday  lady corinthia i dont want you to talk i want you to listen you do not yet understand my views on the question of the suffrage she rises to make a speech i must preface my remarks by reminding you that the suffraget movement is essentially a dowdy movement the suffragets are not all dowdies but they are mainly supported by dowdies now i am not a dowdy oh no compliments  mitchener i did not utter a sound  lady corinthia smiling it is easy to read your thoughts i am one of those women who are accustomed to rule the world through men man is ruled by beauty by charm the men who are not have no influence the salic law which forbade women to occupy a throne is founded on the fact that when a woman is on the throne the country is ruled by men and therefore ruled badly whereas when a man is on the throne the country is ruled by women and therefore ruled well the suffragets would degrade women from being rulers to being voters mere politicians the drudges of the caucus and the polling booth we should lose our influence completely under such a state of affairs the new zealand women have the vote what is the result no poet ever makes a new zealand woman his heroine one might as well be romantic about new zealand mutton look at the suffragets themselves the only ones who are popular are the pretty ones who flirt with mobs as ordinary women flirt with officers  mitchener then i understand you to hold that the country should be governed by the women after all  lady corinthia not by all the women by certain women i had almost said by one woman by the women who have charmwho have artistic talentwho wield a legitimate a refining influence over the men she sits down gracefully smiling and arranging her draperies with conscious elegance  mitchener in short madam you think that if you give the vote to the man you give the power to the women who can get round the man  lady corinthia that is not a very delicate way of putting it but i suppose that is how you would express what i mean  mitchener perhaps youve never had any experience of garrison life if you had youd have noticed that the sort of woman who is clever at getting round men is sometimes rather a bad lot  lady corinthia what do you mean by a bad lot  mitchener i mean a woman who would play the very devil if the other women didnt keep her in pretty strict order i dont approve of democracy because its rot and im against giving the vote to women because im not accustomed to it and therefore am able to see with an unprejudiced eye what infernal nonsense it is but i tell you plainly lady corinthia that there is one game that i dislike more than either democracy or votes for women and that is the game of antony and cleopatra if i must be ruled by women let me have decent women and notwell not the other sort  lady corinthia you have a coarse mind general mitchener  mitchener so has mrs banger and by george i prefer mrs banger to you  lady corinthia bounding to her feet you prefer mrs banger to me  mitchener i do you said yourself she was splendid  lady corinthia you are no true man you are one of those unsexed creatures who have no joy in life no sense of beauty no high notes  mitchener no doubt i am madam as a matter of fact i am not clever at discussing public questions because as an english gentleman i was not brought up to use my brains but occasionally after a number of remarks which are perhaps sometimes rather idiotic i get certain convictions thanks to you i have now got a conviction that this woman question is not a question of lovely and accomplished females but of dowdies the average englishwoman is a dowdy and never has half a chance of becoming anything else she hasnt any charm and she has no high notes except when shes giving her husband a piece of her mind or calling down the street for one of the children  lady corinthia how disgusting  mitchener somebody must do the dowdy work if we had to choose between pitching all the dowdies into the thames and pitching all the lovely and accomplished women the lovely ones would have to go  lady corinthia and if you had to do without wagners music or do without your breakfast you would do without wagner pray does that make eggs and bacon more precious than music or the butcher and baker better than the poet and philosopher the scullery may be more necessary to our bare existence than the cathedral even humbler apartments might make the same claim but which is the more essential to the higher life  mitchener your arguments are so devilishly ingenious that i feel convinced you got them out of some confounded book minesuch as they areare my own i imagine its something like this there is an old saying that if you take care of the pence the pounds will take care of themselves well perhaps if we take care of the dowdies and the butchers and the bakers the beauties and the bigwigs will take care of themselves rising and facing her determinedly anyhow i dont want to have things arranged for me by wagner im not wagner how does he know where the shoe pinches me how do you know where the shoe pinches your washerwomanyou and your high f in alt how are you to know when you havent made her comfortable unless she has a vote do you want her to come and break your windows  lady corinthia am i to understand that general mitchener is a democrat and a suffraget  mitchener yes you have converted meyou and mrs banger  lady corinthia farewell creature balsquith enters hurriedly mr balsquith i am going to wait on general sandstone he at least is an officer and a gentleman she sails out  balsquith mitchener the game is up  mitchener what do you mean  balsquith the strain is too much for the cabinet the old liberal and unionist free traders declare that if they are defeated on their resolution to invite tenders from private contractors for carrying on the army and navy they will go solid for votes for women as the only means of restoring the liberties of the country which we have destroyed by compulsory military service  mitchener infernal impudence  balsquith the labor party is taking the same line they say the men got the factory acts by hiding behind the womens petticoats and that they will get votes for the army in the same way  mitchener balsquith we must not yield to clamor i have just told this lady that i am at last convinced  balsquith joyfully that the suffragets must be supported  mitchener no that the antisuffragets must be put down at all hazards  balsquith same thing  mitchener no for you now tell me that the labor party demands votes for women that makes it impossible to give them because it would be yielding to clamor the one condition on which we can consent to grant anything in this country is that nobody shall presume to want it  balsquith earnestly mitchener its no use you cant have the conveniences of democracy without its occasional inconveniences  mitchener what are its conveniences i should like to know  balsquith when you tell people that they are the real rulers and they can do what they like nine times out of ten they say all right tell us what to do but it happens sometimes that they get an idea of their own and then of course youre landed  mitchener sh  balsquith desperately shouting him down no its no use telling me to shoot them down im not going to do it after all i dont suppose votes for women will make much difference it hasnt in the other countries in which it has been tried  mitchener i never supposed it would make much difference what i cant stand is giving in to that pankhurst lot hang it all balsquith it seems only yesterday that we put them in quod for a month i said at the time that it ought to have been ten years if my advice had been taken this wouldnt have happened its a consolation to me that events are proving how thoroughly right i was  the orderly rushes in  the orderly look ere sir mrs banger locked the door of general sandstones room on the inside and shes sitting on his ead until he signs a proclamation for women to serve in the army  mitchener put your shoulder to the door and burst it open  the orderly its only in story books that doors burst open as easy as that besides im only too thankful to have a locked door between me and mrs b and so is all the rest of us  mitchener cowards balsquith to the rescue he dashes out  balsquith ambling calmly to the hearth this is the business of the sergeant at arms rather than of the leader of the house theres no use in my tackling mrs banger she would only sit on my head too  the orderly you take my tip mr balsquith give the women the vote and give the army civil rights and av done with it  mitchener returns  mitchener balsquith prepare to hear the worst  balsquith sandstone is no more  mitchener on the contrary he is particularly lively he has softened mrs banger by a proposal of marriage in which he appears to be perfectly in earnest he says he has met his ideal at last a really soldierly woman she will sit on his head for the rest of his life and the british army is now to all intents and purposes commanded by mrs banger when i remonstrated with sandstone she positively shouted rightaboutface march at me in the most offensive tone if she hadnt been a woman i should have punched her head i precious nearly punched sandstones the horrors of martial law administered by mrs banger are too terrible to be faced i demand civil rights for the army  the orderly chuckling wot oh general wot oh  mitchener hold your tongue he goes to the door and calls mrs farrell returning and again addressing the orderly civil rights dont mean the right to be uncivil pleased with his own wit almost a pun ha ha  mrs farrell whats the matther now she comes to the table  mitchener to the orderly i have private business with mrs farrell outside you infernal blackguard  the orderly arguing as usual well i didnt ask tomitchener seizes him by the nape rushes him out and slams the door  mitchener excuse the abruptness of this communication mrs farrell but i know only one woman in the country whose practical ability and force of character can maintain her husband in competition with the husband of mrs banger i have the honor to propose for your hand  mrs farrell dye mean you want to marry me  mitchener i do  mrs farrell no thank you id have to work for you just the same only i shouldnt get any wages for it  balsquith that will be remedied when women get the vote ive had to promise that  mitchener winningly mrs farrell you have been charwoman here now ever since i took up my duties have you really never in your more romantic moments cast a favorable eye on my person  mrs farrell ive been too busy casting an unfavorable eye on your cloze and on the litther you make with your papers  mitchener wounded am i to understand that you refuse me  mrs farrell just wait a bit she takes mitcheners chair and rings up the telephone double three oh seven elephant  mitchener i trust youre not ringing for the police mrs farrell i

what she listens well thats just what i was thinkin  mitchener may i ask what you were thinking mrs farrell this suspense is awful  mrs farrell i was thinkin that perhaps the duchess might like her daughterinlaws mother to be a generals lady betther than to be a charwoman into the telephone waitle youre married yourself me fine lady youll find out that every woman is a charwoman from the day shes married she listens then you think i might take him she listens glang you young scald if i had you here id teach you manners she listens thats enough now back wid you to bed and be thankful im

she says  the orderly opens the door ushering in lady corinthia  the orderly lady corinthia fanshawe to speak to you sir  lady corinthia general mitchener your designs on mrs banger are defeated she is engaged to general sandstone do you still prefer her to me  mrs farrell hes out o the hunt hes engaged to me  the orderly overcome by this news reels from the door to the standing desk and clutches the stool to save himself from collapsing  mitchener and extremely proud of it lady corinthia  lady corinthia contemptuously she suits you exactly coming to balsquith mr balsquith you at least are not a philistine  balsquith no lady corinthia but im a confirmed bachelor i dont want a wife but i want an egeria  mrs farrell more shame for you  lady corinthia silence woman the position and functions of a wife may suit your gross nature an egeria is exactly what i desire to be to balsquith can you play accompaniments  balsquith melodies only i regret to say with one finger but my brother who is a very obliging fellow and not unlike me personally is acquainted with three chords with which he manages to accompany most of the comic songs of the day  lady corinthia i do not sing comic songs neither will you when i am your egeria come i give a musical athome this afternoon i will allow you to sit at my feet  balsquith that is my ideal of romantic happiness it commits me exactly as far as i desire to venture thank you  the orderly wot price me general wont you celebrate your engagement by doing something for me maynt i be promoted to be a sergeant  mitchener youre too utterly incompetent to discharge the duties of a sergeant you are only fit to be a lieutenant i shall recommend you for a commission  the orderly hooray the parkinsons of stepney will be proud to have me call on them now ill go and tell the sergeant what i think of him hooray he rushes out  mrs farrell going to the door and calling after him you might have the manners to shut the door idther you she shuts it and comes between mitchener and lady corinthia  mitchener poor wretch the day after civil rights are conceded to the army he and chubbsjenkinson will be found incapable of maintaining discipline they will be sacked and replaced by really capable men mrs farrell as we are engaged and i am anxious to do the correct thing in every way i am quite willing to kiss you if you wish it  mrs farrell youd only feel like a fool and so would i  mitchener you are really the most sensible woman ive made an extremely wise choice  lady corinthia to balsquith you may kiss my hand if you wish  balsquith cautiously i think we had better not commit ourselves too far if i might carry your parasol that would quite satisfy me let us change a subject which threatens to become embarrassing to mitchener the moral of the occasion for you mitchener appears to be that youve got to give up treating soldiers as if they were schoolboys  mitchener the moral for you balsquith is that youve got to give up treating women as if they were angels ha ha  mrs farrell its a mercy youve found one another out at last thats enough now  curtain
