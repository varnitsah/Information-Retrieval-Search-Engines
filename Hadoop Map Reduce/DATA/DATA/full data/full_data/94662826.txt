           the memory of                                 my sister                                  jane ann     chapter i—how my mother got her soft face   on the day i was born we bought six hairbottomed chairs and in our little house it was an event the first great victory in a woman’s long campaign how they had been laboured for the poundnote and the thirty threepennybits they cost what anxiety there was about the purchase the show they made in possession of the west room my father’s unnatural coolness when he brought them in but his face was white—i so often heard the tale afterwards and shared as boy and man in so many similar triumphs that the coming of the chairs seems to be something i remember as if i had jumped out of bed on that first day and run ben to see how they looked  i am sure my mother’s feet were ettling to be ben long before they could be trusted and that the moment after she was left alone with me she was discovered barefooted in the west room doctoring a scar which she had been the first to detect on one of the chairs or sitting on them regally or withdrawing and reopening the door suddenly to take the six by surprise  and then i think a shawl was flung over her it is strange to me to think it was not i who ran after her with the shawl and she was escorted sternly back to bed and reminded that she had promised not to budge to which her reply was probably that she had been gone but an instant and the implication that therefore she had not been gone at all  thus was one little bit of her revealed to me at once i wonder if i took note of it  neighbours came in to see the boy and the chairs  i wonder if she deceived me when she affected to think that there were others like us or whether i saw through her from the first she was so easily seen through  when she seemed to agree with them that it would be impossible to give me a college education was i so easily taken in or did i know already what ambitions burned behind that dear face when they spoke of the chairs as the goal quickly reached was i such a newcomer that her timid lips must say ‘they are but a beginning’ before i heard the words  and when we were left together did i laugh at the great things that were in her mind or had she to whisper them to me first and then did i put my arm round her and tell her that i would help  thus it was for such a long time it is strange to me to feel that it was not so from the beginning  it is all guesswork for six years and she whom i see in them is the woman who came suddenly into view when they were at an end  her timid lips i have said but they were not timid then and when i knew her the timid lips had come  the soft face—they say the face was not so soft then  the shawl that was flung over her—we had not begun to hunt her with a shawl nor to make our bodies a screen between her and the draughts nor to creep into her room a score of times in the night to stand looking at her as she slept  we did not see her becoming little then nor sharply turn our heads when she said wonderingly how small her arms had grown  in her happiest moments—and never was a happier woman—her mouth did not of a sudden begin to twitch and tears to lie on the mute blue eyes in which i have read all i know and would ever care to write  for when you looked into my mother’s eyes you knew as if he had told you why god sent her into the world—it was to open the minds of all who looked to beautiful thoughts  and that is the beginning and end of literature  those eyes that i cannot see until i was six years old have guided me through life and i pray god they may remain my only earthly judge to the last  they were never more my guide than when i helped to put her to earth not whimpering because my mother had been taken away after seventysix glorious years of life but exulting in her even at the grave                                        she had a son who was far away at school  i remember very little about him only that he was a merryfaced boy who ran like a squirrel up a tree and shook the cherries into my lap  when he was thirteen and i was half his age the terrible news came and i have been told the face of my mother was awful in its calmness as she set off to get between death and her boy  we trooped with her down the brae to the wooden station and i think i was envying her the journey in the mysterious wagons i know we played around her proud of our right to be there but i do not recall it i only speak from hearsay  her ticket was taken she had bidden us goodbye with that fighting face which i cannot see and then my father came out of the telegraphoffice and said huskily ‘he’s gone’  then we turned very quietly and went home again up the little brae  but i speak from hearsay no longer i knew my mother for ever now  that is how she got her soft face and her pathetic ways and her large charity and why other mothers ran to her when they had lost a child ‘dinna greet poor janet’ she would say to them and they would answer ‘ah margaret but you’re greeting yoursel’  margaret ogilvy had been her maiden name and after the scotch custom she was still margaret ogilvy to her old friends  margaret ogilvy i loved to name her  often when i was a boy ‘margaret ogilvy are you there’  i would call up the stair  she was always delicate from that hour and for many months she was very ill  i have heard that the first thing she expressed a wish to see was the christening robe and she looked long at it and then turned her face to the wall  that was what made me as a boy think of it always as the robe in which he was christened but i knew later that we had all been christened in it from the oldest of the family to the youngest between whom stood twenty years  hundreds of other children were christened in it also such robes being then a rare possession and the lending of ours among my mother’s glories  it was carried carefully from house to house as if it were itself a child my mother made much of it smoothed it out petted it smiled to it before putting it into the arms of those to whom it was being lent she was in our pew to see it borne magnificently something inside it now down the aisle to the pulpitside when a stir of expectancy went through the church and we kicked each other’s feet beneath the bookboard but were reverent in the face and however the child might behave laughing brazenly or skirling to its mother’s shame and whatever the father as he held it up might do look doited probably and bow at the wrong time the christening robe of long experience helped them through  and when it was brought back to her she took it in her arms as softly as if it might be asleep and unconsciously pressed it to her breast there was never anything in the house that spoke to her quite so eloquently as that little white robe it was the one of her children that always remained a baby  and she had not made it herself which was the most wonderful thing about it to me for she seemed to have made all other things  all the clothes in the house were of her making and you don’t know her in the least if you think they were out of the fashion she turned them and made them new again she beat them and made them new again and then she coaxed them into being new again just for the last time she let them out and took them in and put on new braid and added a piece up the back and thus they passed from one member of the family to another until they reached the youngest and even when we were done with them they reappeared as something else  in the fashion  i must come back to this  never was a woman with such an eye for it  she had no fashionplates she did not need them  the minister’s wife a cloak the banker’s daughters the new sleeve—they had but to pass our window once and the scalp so to speak was in my mother’s hands  observe her rushing scissors in hand thread in mouth to the drawers where her daughters’ sabbath clothes were kept  or go to church next sunday and watch a certain family filing in the boy lifting his legs high to show off his new boots but all the others demure especially the timid unobservantlooking little woman in the rear of them  if you were the minister’s wife that day or the banker’s daughters you would have got a shock  but she bought the christening robe and when i used to ask why she would beam and look conscious and say she wanted to be extravagant once  and she told me still smiling that the more a woman was given to stitching and making things for herself the greater was her passionate desire now and again to rush to the shops and ‘be foolish’  the christening robe with its pathetic frills is over half a century old now and has begun to droop a little like a daisy whose time is past but it is as fondly kept together as ever i saw it in use again only the other day  my mother lay in bed with the christening robe beside her and i peeped in many times at the door and then went to the stair and sat on it and sobbed  i know not if it was that first day or many days afterwards that there came to me my sister the daughter my mother loved the best yes more i am sure even than she loved me whose great glory she has been since i was six years old  this sister who was then passing out of her ‘teens came to me with a very anxious face and wringing her hands and she told me to go ben to my mother and say to her that she still had another boy  i went ben excitedly but the room was dark and when i heard the door shut and no sound come from the bed i was afraid and i stood still  i suppose i was breathing hard or perhaps i was crying for after a time i heard a listless voice that had never been listless before say ‘is that you’  i think the tone hurt me for i made no answer and then the voice said more anxiously ‘is that you’ again  i thought it was the dead boy she was speaking to and i said in a little lonely voice ‘no it’s no him it’s just me’  then i heard a cry and my mother turned in bed and though it was dark i knew that she was holding out her arms  after that i sat a great deal in her bed trying to make her forget him which was my crafty way of playing physician and if i saw any one out of doors do something that made the others laugh i immediately hastened to that dark room and did it before her  i suppose i was an odd little figure i have been told that my anxiety to brighten her gave my face a strained look and put a tremor into the joke i would stand on my head in the bed my feet against the wall and then cry excitedly ‘are you laughing mother’—and perhaps what made her laugh was something i was unconscious of but she did laugh suddenly now and then whereupon i screamed exultantly to that dear sister who was ever in waiting to come and see the sight but by the time she came the soft face was wet again thus i was deprived of some of my glory and i remember once only making her laugh before witnesses  i kept a record of her laughs on a piece of paper a stroke for each and it was my custom to show this proudly to the doctor every morning  there were five strokes the first time i slipped it into his hand and when their meaning was explained to him he laughed so boisterously that i cried ‘i wish that was one of hers’ then he was sympathetic and asked me if my mother had seen the paper yet and when i shook my head he said that if i showed it to her now and told her that these were her five laughs he thought i might win another i had less confidence but he was the mysterious man whom you ran for in the dead of night you flung sand at his window to waken him and if it was only toothache he extracted the tooth through the open window but when it was something sterner he was with you in the dark square at once like a man who slept in his topcoat so i did as he bade me and not only did she laugh then but again when i put the laugh down so that though it was really one laugh with a tear in the middle i counted it as two  it was doubtless that same sister who told me not to sulk when my mother lay thinking of him but to try instead to get her to talk about him  i did not see how this could make her the merry mother she used to be but i was told that if i could not do it nobody could and this made me eager to begin  at first they say i was often jealous stopping her fond memories with the cry ‘do you mind nothing about me’ but that did not last its place was taken by an intense desire again i think my sister must have breathed it into life to become so like him that even my mother should not see the difference and many and artful were the questions i put to that end  then i practised in secret but after a whole week had passed i was still rather like myself  he had such a cheery way of whistling she had told me it had always brightened her at her work to hear him whistling and when he whistled he stood with his legs apart and his hands in the pockets of his knickerbockers  i decided to trust to this so one day after i had learned his whistle every boy of enterprise invents a whistle of his own from boys who had been his comrades i secretly put on a suit of his clothes dark grey they were with little spots and they fitted me many years afterwards and thus disguised i slipped unknown to the others into my mother’s room  quaking i doubt not yet so pleased i stood still until she saw me and then—how it must have hurt her  ‘listen’ i cried in a glow of triumph and i stretched my legs wide apart and plunged my hands into the pockets of my knickerbockers and began to whistle  she lived twentynine years after his death such active years until toward the end that you never knew where she was unless you took hold of her and though she was frail henceforth and ever growing frailer her housekeeping again became famous so that brides called as a matter of course to watch her ca’ming and sanding and stitching there are old people still one or two to tell with wonder in their eyes how she could bake twentyfour bannocks in the hour and not a chip in one of them and how many she gave away how much she gave away of all she had and what pretty ways she had of giving it  her face beamed and rippled with mirth as before and her laugh that i had tried so hard to force came running home again  i have heard no such laugh as hers save from merry children the laughter of most of us ages and wears out with the body but hers remained gleeful to the last as if it were born afresh every morning  there was always something of the child in her and her laugh was its voice as eloquent of the past to me as was the christening robe to her  but i had not made her forget the bit of her that was dead in those nineandtwenty years he was not removed one day farther from her many a time she fell asleep speaking to him and even while she slept her lips moved and she smiled as if he had come back to her and when she woke he might vanish so suddenly that she started up bewildered and looked about her and then said slowly ‘my david’s dead’ or perhaps he remained long enough to whisper why he must leave her now and then she lay silent with filmy eyes  when i became a man and he was still a boy of thirteen i wrote a little paper called ‘dead this twenty years’ which was about a similar tragedy in another woman’s life and it is the only thing i have written that she never spoke about not even to that daughter she loved the best  no one ever spoke of it to her or asked her if she had read it one does not ask a mother if she knows that there is a little coffin in the house  she read many times the book in which it is printed but when she came to that chapter she would put her hands to her heart or even over her ears     chapter ii—what she had been   what she had been what i should be these were the two great subjects between us in my boyhood and while we discussed the one we were deciding the other though neither of us knew it  before i reached my tenth year a giant entered my native place in the night and we woke to find him in possession  he transformed it into a new town at a rate with which we boys only could keep up for as fast as he built dams we made rafts to sail in them he knocked down houses and there we were crying ‘pilly’ among the ruins he dug trenches and we jumped them we had to be dragged by the legs from beneath his engines he sunk wells and in we went  but though there were never circumstances to which boys could not adapt themselves in half an hour older folk are slower in the uptake and i am sure they stood and gaped at the changes so suddenly being worked in our midst and scarce knew their way home now in the dark  where had been formerly but the click of the shuttle was soon the roar of ‘power’ handlooms were pushed into a corner as a room is cleared for a dance every morning at halfpast five the town was wakened with a yell and from a chimneystack that rose high into our caller air the conqueror waved for evermore his flag of smoke  another era had dawned new customs new fashions sprang into life all as lusty as if they had been born at twentyone as quickly as two people may exchange seats the daughter till now but a knitter of stockings became the breadwinner he who had been the breadwinner sat down to the knitting of stockings what had been yesterday a nest of weavers was today a town of girls  i am not of those who would fling stones at the change it is something surely that backs are no longer prematurely bent you may no more look through dim panes of glass at the aged poor weaving tremulously for their little bit of ground in the cemetery  rather are their working years too few now not because they will it so but because it is with youth that the powerlooms must be fed  well this teaches them to make provision and they have the means as they never had before  not in batches are boys now sent to college the halfdozen a year have dwindled to one doubtless because in these days they can begin to draw wages as they step out of their fourteenth year  here assuredly there is loss but all the losses would be but a pebble in a sea of gain were it not for this that with so many of the family young mothers among them working in the factories home life is not so beautiful as it was  so much of what is great in scotland has sprung from the closeness of the family ties it is there i sometimes fear that my country is being struck  that we are all being reduced to one dead level that character abounds no more and life itself is less interesting such things i have read but i do not believe them  i have even seen them given as my reason for writing of a past time and in that at least there is no truth  in our little town which is a sample of many life is as interesting as pathetic as joyous as ever it was no group of weavers was better to look at or think about than the rivulet of winsome girls that overruns our streets every time the sluice is raised the comedy of summer evenings and winter firesides is played with the old zest and every windowblind is the curtain of a romance  once the lights of a little town are lit who could ever hope to tell all its story or the story of a single wynd in it  and who looking at lighted windows needs to turn to books  the reason my books deal with the past instead of with the life i myself have known is simply this that i soon grow tired of writing tales unless i can see a little girl of whom my mother has told me wandering confidently through the pages  such a grip has her memory of her girlhood had upon me since i was a boy of six  those innumerable talks with her made her youth as vivid to me as my own and so much more quaint for to a child the oddest of things and the most richly coloured picturebook is that his mother was once a child also and the contrast between what she is and what she was is perhaps the source of all humour  my mother’s father the one hero of her life died nine years before i was born and i remember this with bewilderment so familiarly does the weatherbeaten mason’s figure rise before me from the old chair on which i was nursed and now write my books  on the surface he is as hard as the stone on which he chiselled and his face is dyed red by its dust he is rounded in the shoulders and a ‘hoast’ hunts him ever sooner or later that cough must carry him off but until then it shall not keep him from the quarry nor shall his chapped hands as long as they can grasp the mell  it is a night of rain or snow and my mother the little girl in a pinafore who is already his housekeeper has been many times to the door to look for him  at last he draws nigh hoasting  or i see him setting off to church for he was a great ‘stoop’ of the auld licht kirk and his mouth is very firm now as if there were a case of discipline to face but on his way home he is bowed with pity perhaps his little daughter who saw him so stern an hour ago does not understand why he wrestles so long in prayer tonight or why when he rises from his knees he presses her to him with unwonted tenderness  or he is in this chair repeating to her his favourite poem ‘the cameronian’s dream’ and at the first lines so solemnly uttered      ‘in a dream of the night i was wafted away’  she screams with excitement just as i screamed long afterwards when she repeated them in his voice to me  or i watch as from a window while she sets off through the long parks to the distant place where he is at work in her hand a flagon which contains his dinner  she is singing to herself and gleefully swinging the flagon she jumps the burn and proudly measures the jump with her eye but she never dallies unless she meets a baby for she was so fond of babies that she must hug each one she met but while she hugged them she also noted how their robes were cut and afterwards made paper patterns which she concealed jealously and in the fulness of time her first robe for her eldest born was fashioned from one of these patterns made when she was in her twelfth year  she was eight when her mother’s death made her mistress of the house and mother to her little brother and from that time she scrubbed and mended and baked and sewed and argued with the flesher about the quarter pound of beef and penny bone which provided dinner for two days but if you think that this was poverty you don’t know the meaning of the word and she carried the water from the pump and had her washingdays and her ironings and a stocking always on the wire for odd moments and gossiped like a matron with the other women and humoured the men with a tolerant smile—all these things she did as a matter of course leaping joyful from bed in the morning because there was so much to do doing it as thoroughly and sedately as if the brides were already due for a lesson and then rushing out in a fit of childishness to play dumps or palaulays with others of her age  i see her frocks lengthening though they were never very short and the games given reluctantly up the horror of my boyhood was that i knew a time would come when i also must give up the games and how it was to be done i saw not this agony still returns to me in dreams when i catch myself playing marbles and look on with cold displeasure i felt that i must continue playing in secret and i took this shadow to her when she told me her own experience which convinced us both that we were very like each other inside  she had discovered that work is the best fun after all and i learned it in time but have my lapses and so had she  i know what was her favourite costume when she was at the age that they make heroines of it was a pale blue with a pale blue bonnet the white ribbons of which tied aggravatingly beneath the chin and when questioned about this garb she never admitted that she looked pretty in it but she did say with blushes too that blue was her colour and then she might smile as at some memory and begin to tell us about a man who—but it ended there with another smile which was longer in departing  she never said indeed she denied strenuously that she had led the men a dance but again the smile returned and came between us and full belief  yes she had her little vanities when she got the mizpah ring she did carry that finger in such a way that the most reluctant must see  she was very particular about her gloves and hid her boots so that no other should put them on and then she forgot their hidingplace and had suspicions of the one who found them  a good way of enraging her was to say that her last year’s bonnet would do for this year without alteration or that it would defy the face of clay to count the number of her shawls  in one of my books there is a mother who is setting off with her son for the town to which he had been called as minister and she pauses on the threshold to ask him anxiously if he thinks her bonnet ‘sets’ her  a reviewer said she acted thus not because she cared how she looked but for the sake of her son  this i remember amused my mother very much  i have seen many weary ondings of snow but the one i seem to recollect best occurred nearly twenty years before i was born  it was at the time of my mother’s marriage to one who proved a most loving as he was always a wellloved husband a man i am very proud to be able to call my father i know not for how many days the snow had been falling but a day came when the people lost heart and would make no more gullies through it and by next morning to do so was impossible they could not fling the snow high enough  its back was against every door when sunday came and none ventured out save a valiant few who buffeted their way into my mother’s home to discuss her predicament for unless she was ‘cried’ in the church that day she might not be married for another week and how could she be cried with the minister a field away and the church buried to the waist for hours they talked and at last some men started for the church which was several hundred yards distant  three of them found a window and forcing a passage through it cried the pair and that is how it came about that my father and mother were married on the first of march  that would be the end i suppose if it were a story but to my mother it was only another beginning and not the last  i see her bending over the cradle of her firstborn college for him already in her eye and my father not less ambitious and anon it is a girl who is in the cradle and then another girl—already a tragic figure to those who know the end i wonder if any instinct told my mother that the great day of her life was when she bore this child what i am sure of is that from the first the child followed her with the most wistful eyes and saw how she needed help and longed to rise and give it  for of physical strength my mother had never very much it was her spirit that got through the work and in those days she was often so ill that the sand rained on the doctor’s window and men ran to and fro with leeches and ‘she is in life we can say no more’ was the information for those who came knocking at the door ‘i am sorrow to say’ her father writes in an old letter now before me ‘that margaret is in a state that she was never so bad before in this world  till wednesday night she was in as poor a condition as you could think of to be alive  however after bleeding leeching etc the dr says this morning that he is better hoped now but at present we can say no more but only she is alive and in the hands of him in whose hands all our lives are  i can give you no adequate view of what my feelings are indeed they are a burden too heavy for me and i cannot describe them  i look on my right and left hand and find no comfort and if it were not for the rock that is higher than i my spirit would utterly fall but blessed be his name who can comfort those that are cast down  o for more faith in his supporting grace in this hour of trial’  then she is ‘on the mend’ she may ‘thole thro’’ if they take great care of her ‘which we will be forward to do’  the fourth child dies when but a few weeks old and the next at two years  she was her grandfather’s companion and thus he wrote of her death this stern selfeducated auld licht with the chapped hands—      ‘i hope you received my last in which i spoke of dear little lydia     being unwell  now with deep sorrow i must tell you that yesterday i     assisted in laying her dear remains in the lonely grave  she died at     7 o’clock on wednesday evening i suppose by the time you had got the     letter  the dr did not think it was croup till late on tuesday     night and all that medical aid could prescribe was done but the dr     had no hope after he saw that the croup was confirmed and hard     indeed would the heart have been that would not have melted at seeing     what the dear little creature suffered all wednesday until the feeble     frame was quite worn out  she was quite sensible till within 2 hours     of her death and then she sunk quite low till the vital spark fled     and all medicine that she got she took with the greatest readiness     as if apprehensive they would make her well  i cannot well describe     my feelings on the occasion  i thought that the fountainhead of my     tears had now been dried up but i have been mistaken for i must     confess that the briny rivulets descended fast on my furrowed cheeks     she was such a winning child and had such a regard for me and always     came and told me all her little things and as she was now speaking     some of her little prattle was very taking and the lively images of     these things intrude themselves more into my mind than they should     do but there is allowance for moderate grief on such occasions  but     when i am telling you of my own grief and sorrow i know not what to     say of the bereaved mother she hath not met with anything in this     world before that hath gone so near the quick with her  she had no     handling of the last one as she was not able at the time for she     only had her once in her arms and her affections had not time to be     so fairly entwined around her  i am much afraid that she will not     soon if ever get over this trial  although she was weakly before     yet she was pretty well recovered but this hath not only affected     her mind but her body is so much affected that she is not well able     to sit so long as her bed is making and hath scarcely tasted meat     ie food since monday night and till some time is elapsed we     cannot say how she may be  there is none that is not a parent     themselves that can fully sympathise with one in such a state  david     is much affected also but it is not so well known on him and the     younger branches of the family are affected but it will be only     momentary  but alas in all this vast ado there is only the sorrow     of the world which worketh death  o how gladdening would it be if we     were in as great bitterness for sin as for the loss of a firstborn     o how unfitted persons or families is for trials who knows not the     divine art of casting all their cares upon the lord and what     multitudes are there that when earthly comforts is taken away may     well say what have i more all their delight is placed in some one     thing or another in the world and who can blame them for unwillingly     parting with what they esteem their chief good  o that we were wise     to lay up treasure for the time of need for it is truly a solemn     affair to enter the lists with the king of terrors  it is strange     that the living lay the things so little to heart until they have to     engage in that war where there is no discharge  o that my head were     waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears that i might weep day and     night for my own and others’ stupidity in this great matter  o for     grace to do every day work in its proper time and to live above the     tempting cheating train of earthly things  the rest of the family     are moderately well  i have been for some days worse than i have     been for 8 months past but i may soon get better  i am in the same     way i have often been in before but there is no security for it     always being so for i know that it cannot be far from the time when     i will be one of those that once were  i have no other news to send     you and as little heart for them  i hope you will take the earliest     opportunity of writing that you can and be particular as regards     margaret for she requires consolation’  he died exactly a week after writing this letter but my mother was to live for another fortyfour years  and joys of a kind never shared in by him were to come to her so abundantly so long drawn out that strange as it would have seemed to him to know it her fuller life had scarce yet begun  and with the joys were to come their sweet frightened comrades pain and grief again she was to be touched to the quick again and again to be so ill that ‘she is in life we can say no more’ but still she had attendants very ‘forward’ to help her some of them unborn in her father’s time  she told me everything and so my memories of our little red town are coloured by her memories  i knew it as it had been for generations and suddenly i saw it change and the transformation could not fail to strike a boy for these first years are the most impressionable nothing that happens after we are twelve matters very much they are also the most vivid years when we look back and more vivid the farther we have to look until at the end what lies between bends like a hoop and the extremes meet  but though the new town is to me a glass through which i look at the old the people i see passing up and down these wynds sitting nightcapped on their barrowshafts hobbling in their blacks to church on sunday are less those i saw in my childhood than their fathers and mothers who did these things in the same way when my mother was young  i cannot picture the place without seeing her as a little girl come to the door of a certain house and beat her bass against the gav’leend or there is a wedding tonight and the carriage with the whiteeared horse is sent for a maiden in pale blue whose bonnetstrings tie beneath the chin     chapter iii—what i should be   my mother was a great reader and with ten minutes to spare before the starch was ready would begin the ‘decline and fall’—and finish it too that winter  foreign words in the text annoyed her and made her bemoan her want of a classical education—she had only attended a dame’s school during some easy months—but she never passed the foreign words by until their meaning was explained to her and when next she and they met it was as acquaintances which i think was clever of her  one of her delights was to learn from me scraps of horace and then bring them into her conversation with ‘colleged men’  i have come upon her in lonely places such as the stairhead or the east room muttering these quotations aloud to herself and i well remember how she would say to the visitors ‘ay ay it’s very true doctor but as you know “eheu fugaces postume postume labuntur anni”’ or ‘sal mr soandso my lassie is thriving well but would it no’ be more to the point to say “o matra pulchra filia pulchrior”’ which astounded them very much if she managed to reach the end without being flung but usually she had a fit of laughing in the middle and so they found her out  biography and exploration were her favourite reading for choice the biography of men who had been good to their mothers and she liked the explorers to be alive so that she could shudder at the thought of their venturing forth again but though she expressed a hope that they would have the sense to stay at home henceforth she gleamed with admiration when they disappointed her  in later days i had a friend who was an african explorer and she was in two minds about him he was one of the most engrossing of mortals to her she admired him prodigiously pictured him at the head of his caravan now attacked by savages now by wild beasts and adored him for the uneasy hours he gave her but she was also afraid that he wanted to take me with him and then she thought he should be put down by law  explorers’ mothers also interested her very much the books might tell her nothing about them but she could create them for herself and wring her hands in sympathy with them when they had got no news of him for six months  yet there were times when she grudged him to them—as the day when he returned victorious  then what was before her eyes was not the son coming marching home again but an old woman peering for him round the window curtain and trying not to look uplifted  the newspaper reports would be about the son but my mother’s comment was ‘she’s a proud woman this night’  we read many books together when i was a boy ‘robinson crusoe’ being the first and the second and the ‘arabian nights’ should have been the next for we got it out of the library a penny for three days but on discovering that they were nights when we had paid for knights we sent that volume packing and i have curled my lips at it ever since  ‘the pilgrim’s progress’ we had in the house it was as common a possession as a dresserhead and so enamoured of it was i that i turned our garden into sloughs of despond with peasticks to represent christian on his travels and a buffetstool for his burden but when i dragged my mother out to see my handiwork she was scared and i felt for days with a certain elation that i had been a dark character  besides reading every book we could hire or borrow i also bought one now and again and while buying it was the occupation of weeks i read standing at the counter most of the other books in the shop which is perhaps the most exquisite way of reading  and i took in a magazine called ‘sunshine’ the most delicious periodical i am sure of any day  it cost a halfpenny or a penny a month and always as i fondly remember had a continued tale about the dearest girl who sold watercress which is a dainty not grown and i suppose never seen in my native town  this romantic little creature took such hold of my imagination that i cannot eat watercress even now without emotion  i lay in bed wondering what she would be up to in the next number i have lost trout because when they nibbled my mind was wandering with her my early life was embittered by her not arriving regularly on the first of the month  i know not whether it was owing to her loitering on the way one month to an extent flesh and blood could not bear or because we had exhausted the penny library but on a day i conceived a glorious idea or it was put into my head by my mother then desirous of making progress with her new clouty hearthrug  the notion was nothing short of this why should i not write the tales myself  i did write them—in the garret—but they by no means helped her to get on with her work for when i finished a chapter i bounded downstairs to read it to her and so short were the chapters so ready was the pen that i was back with new manuscript before another clout had been added to the rug  authorship seemed like her bannockbaking to consist of running between two points  they were all tales of adventure happiest is he who writes of adventure no characters were allowed within if i knew their like in the flesh the scene lay in unknown parts desert islands enchanted gardens with knights none of your nights on black chargers and round the first corner a lady selling watercress  at twelve or thereabout i put the literary calling to bed for a time having gone to a school where cricket and football were more esteemed but during the year before i went to the university it woke up and i wrote great part of a threevolume novel  the publisher replied that the sum for which he would print it was a hundred and—however that was not the important point i had sixpence where he stabbed us both was in writing that he considered me a ‘clever lady’  i replied stiffly that i was a gentleman and since then i have kept that manuscript concealed  i looked through it lately and oh but it is dull  i defy any one to read it  the malignancy of publishers however could not turn me back  from the day on which i first tasted blood in the garret my mind was made up there could be no humdreadfuldrum profession for me literature was my game  it was not highly thought of by those who wished me well  i remember being asked by two maiden ladies about the time i left the university what i was to be and when i replied brazenly ‘an author’ they flung up their hands and one exclaimed reproachfully ‘and you an ma’  my mother’s views at first were not dissimilar for long she took mine jestingly as something i would grow out of and afterwards they hurt her so that i tried to give them up  to be a minister—that she thought was among the fairest prospects but she was a very ambitious woman and sometimes she would add half scared at her appetite that there were ministers who had become professors ‘but it was not canny to think of such things’  i had one person only on my side an old tailor one of the fullest men i have known and quite the best talker  he was a bachelor he told me all that is to be known about woman a lean man pallid of face his legs drawn up when he walked as if he was ever carrying something in his lap his walks were of the shortest from the teapot on the hob to the board on which he stitched from the board to the hob and so to bed  he might have gone out had the idea struck him but in the years i knew him the last of his brave life i think he was only in the open twice when he ‘flitted’—changed his room for another hard by  i did not see him make these journeys but i seem to see him now and he is somewhat dizzy in the odd atmosphere in one hand he carries a boxiron he raises the other wondering what this is on his head it is a hat a faint smell of singed cloth goes by with him  this man had heard of my set of photographs of the poets and asked for a sight of them which led to our first meeting  i remember how he spread them out on his board and after looking long at them turned his gaze on me and said solemnly      what can i do to be for ever known     and make the age to come my own  these lines of cowley were new to me but the sentiment was not new and i marvelled how the old tailor could see through me so well  so it was strange to me to discover presently that he had not been thinking of me at all but of his own young days when that couplet sang in his head and he too had thirsted to set off for grub street but was afraid and while he hesitated old age came and then death and found him grasping a boxiron  i hurried home with the mouthful but neighbours had dropped in and this was for her ears only so i drew her to the stair and said imperiously      what can i do to be for ever known     and make the age to come my own  it was an odd request for which to draw her from a teatable and she must have been surprised but i think she did not laugh and in after years she would repeat the lines fondly with a flush on her soft face ‘that is the kind you would like to be yourself’ we would say in jest to her and she would reply almost passionately ‘no but i would be windy of being his mother’  it is possible that she could have been his mother had that other son lived he might have managed it from sheer love of her but for my part i can smile at one of those two figures on the stair now having long given up the dream of being for ever known and seeing myself more akin to my friend the tailor for as he was found at the end on his board so i hope shall i be found at my handloom doing honestly the work that suits me best  who should know so well as i that it is but a handloom compared to the great guns that reverberate through the age to come  but she who stood with me on the stair that day was a very simple woman accustomed all her life to making the most of small things and i weaved sufficiently well to please her which has been my only steadfast ambition since i was a little boy  not less than mine became her desire that i should have my way—but ah the iron seats in that park of horrible repute and that bare room at the top of many flights of stairs  while i was away at college she drained all available libraries for books about those who go to london to live by the pen and they all told the same shuddering tale  london which she never saw was to her a monster that licked up country youths as they stepped from the train there were the garrets in which they sat abject and the park seats where they passed the night  those park seats were the monster’s glaring eyes to her and as i go by them now she is nearer to me than when i am in any other part of london  i daresay that when night comes this hyde park which is so gay by day is haunted by the ghosts of many mothers who run wildeyed from seat to seat looking for their sons  but if we could dodge those dreary seats she longed to see me try my luck and i sought to exclude them from the picture by drawing maps of london with hyde park left out  london was as strange to me as to her but long before i was shot upon it i knew it by maps and drew them more accurately than i could draw them now  many a time she and i took our jaunt together through the map and were most gleeful popping into telegraph offices to wire my father and sister that we should not be home till late winking to my books in lordly shopwindows lunching at restaurants and remembering not to call it dinner saying ‘how do’ to mr alfred tennyson when we passed him in regent street calling at publishers’ offices for cheque when ‘will you take care of it or shall i’ i asked gaily and she would be certain to reply ‘i’m thinking we’d better take it to the bank and get the money’ for she always felt surer of money than of cheques so to the bank we went ‘two tens and the rest in gold’ and thence straightway by cab to the place where you buy sealskin coats for middling old ladies  but ere the laugh was done the park would come through the map like a blot  ‘if you could only be sure of as much as would keep body and soul together’ my mother would say with a sigh  ‘with something over mother to send to you’  ‘you couldna expect that at the start’  the wench i should have been courting now was journalism that grisette of literature who has a smile and a hand for all beginners welcoming them at the threshold teaching them so much that is worth knowing introducing them to the other lady whom they have worshipped from afar showing them even how to woo her and then bidding them a bright godspeed—he were an ingrate who having had her joyous companionship no longer flings her a kiss as they pass  but though she bears no illwill when she is jilted you must serve faithfully while you are hers and you must seek her out and make much of her and until you can rely on her goodnature note this not a word about the other lady  when at last she took me in i grew so fond of her that i called her by the other’s name and even now i think at times that there was more fun in the little sister but i began by wooing her with contributions that were all misfits  in an old book i find columns of notes about works projected at this time nearly all to consist of essays on deeply uninteresting subjects the lightest was to be a volume on the older satirists beginning with skelton and tom nash—the half of that manuscript still lies in a dusty chest—the only story was about mary queen of scots who was also the subject of many unwritten papers  queen mary seems to have been luring me to my undoing ever since i saw holyrood and i have a horrid fear that i may write that novel yet  that anything could be written about my native place never struck me  we had read somewhere that a novelist is better equipped than most of his trade if he knows himself and one woman and my mother said ‘you know yourself for everybody must know himself’ there never was a woman who knew less about herself than she and she would add dolefully ‘but i doubt i’m the only woman you know well’  ‘then i must make you my heroine’ i said lightly  ‘a gey auldfarrantlike heroine’ she said and we both laughed at the notion—so little did we read the future  thus it is obvious what were my qualifications when i was rashly engaged as a leaderwriter it was my sister who saw the advertisement on an english provincial paper  at the moment i was as uplifted as the others for the chance had come at last with what we all regarded as a prodigious salary but i was wanted in the beginning of the week and it suddenly struck me that the leaders were the one thing i had always skipped  leaders  how were they written what were they about  my mother was already sitting triumphant among my socks and i durst not let her see me quaking  i retired to ponder and presently she came to me with the daily paper  which were the leaders she wanted to know so evidently i could get no help from her  had she any more newspapers  i asked and after rummaging she produced a few with which her boxes had been lined  others very dusty came from beneath carpets and lastly a sooty bundle was dragged down the chimney  surrounded by these i sat down and studied how to become a journalist     chapter iv—an editor   a devout lady to whom some friend had presented one of my books used to say when asked how she was getting on with it ‘sal it’s dreary weary uphill work but i’ve wrastled through with tougher jobs in my time and please god i’ll wrastle through with this one’  it was in this spirit i fear though she never told me so that my mother wrestled for the next year or more with my leaders and indeed i was always genuinely sorry for the people i saw reading them  in my spare hours i was trying journalism of another kind and sending it to london but nearly eighteen months elapsed before there came to me as unlooked for as a telegram the thought that there was something quaint about my native place  a boy who found that a knife had been put into his pocket in the night could not have been more surprised  a few days afterwards i sent my mother a london evening paper with an article entitled ‘an auld licht community’ and they told me that when she saw the heading she laughed because there was something droll to her in the sight of the words auld licht in print for her as for me that newspaper was soon to have the face of a friend to this day i never pass its placards in the street without shaking it by the hand and she used to sew its pages together as lovingly as though they were a child’s frock but let the truth be told when she read that first article she became alarmed and fearing the talk of the town hid the paper from all eyes  for some time afterwards while i proudly pictured her showing this and similar articles to all who felt an interest in me she was really concealing them fearfully in a bandbox on the garret stair  and she wanted to know by return of post whether i was paid for these articles as much as i was paid for real articles when she heard that i was paid better she laughed again and had them out of the bandbox for rereading and it cannot be denied that she thought the london editor a fine fellow but slightly soft  when i sent off that first sketch i thought i had exhausted the subject but our editor wrote that he would like something more of the same so i sent him a marriage and he took it and then i tried him with a funeral and he took it and really it began to look as if we had him  now my mother might have been discovered in answer to certain excited letters flinging the bundle of undarned socks from her lap and ‘going in for literature’ she was racking her brains by request for memories i might convert into articles and they came to me in letters which she dictated to my sisters  how well i could hear her sayings between the lines ‘but the editorman will never stand that it’s perfect blethers’—‘by this post it must go i tell you we must take the editor when he’s hungry—we canna be blamed for it can we he prints them of his free will so the wite is his’—‘but i’m near terrified—if london folk reads them we’re done for’  and i was sounded as to the advisability of sending him a present of a lippie of shortbread which was to be her crafty way of getting round him  by this time though my mother and i were hundreds of miles apart you may picture us waving our hands to each other across country and shouting ‘hurrah’  you may also picture the editor in his office thinking he was behaving like a shrewd man of business and unconscious that up in the north there was an elderly lady chuckling so much at him that she could scarcely scrape the potatoes  i was now able to see my mother again and the park seats no longer loomed so prominent in our map of london  still there they were and it was with an effort that she summoned up courage to let me go  she feared changes and who could tell that the editor would continue to be kind perhaps when he saw me—  she seemed to be very much afraid of his seeing me and this i would point out was a reflection on my appearance or my manner  no what she meant was that i looked so young and—and that would take him aback for had i not written as an aged man  ‘but he knows my age mother’  ‘i’m glad of that but maybe he wouldna like you when he saw you’  ‘oh it is my manner then’  ‘i dinna say that but—’  here my sister would break in ‘the short and the long of it is just this she thinks nobody has such manners as herself  can you deny it you vain woman’  my mother would deny it vigorously  ‘you stand there’ my sister would say with affected scorn ‘and tell me you don’t think you could get the better of that man quicker than any of us’  ‘sal i’m thinking i could manage him’ says my mother with a chuckle  ‘how would you set about it’  then my mother would begin to laugh  ‘i would find out first if he had a family and then i would say they were the finest family in london’  ‘yes that is just what you would do you cunning woman  but if he has no family’  ‘i would say what great men editors are’  ‘he would see through you’  ‘not he’  ‘you don’t understand that what imposes on common folk would never hoodwink an editor’  ‘that’s where you are wrong  gentle or simple stupid or clever the men are all alike in the hands of a woman that flatters them’  ‘ah i’m sure there are better ways of getting round an editor than that’  ‘i daresay there are’ my mother would say with conviction ‘but if you try that plan you will never need to try another’  ‘how artful you are mother—you with your soft face  do you not think shame’  ‘pooh’ says my mother brazenly  ‘i can see the reason why you are so popular with men’  ‘ay you can see it but they never will’  ‘well how would you dress yourself if you were going to that editor’s office’  ‘of course i would wear my silk and my sabbath bonnet’  ‘it is you who are shortsighted now mother  i tell you you would manage him better if you just put on your old grey shawl and one of your bonny white mutches and went in half smiling and half timid and said “i am the mother of him that writes about the auld lichts and i want you to promise that he will never have to sleep in the open air”’  but my mother would shake her head at this and reply almost hotly ‘i tell you if i ever go into that man’s office i go in silk’  i wrote and asked the editor if i should come to london and he said no so i went laden with charges from my mother to walk in the middle of the street they jump out on you as you are turning a corner never to venture forth after sunset and always to lock up everything i who could never lock up anything except my heart in company  thanks to this editor for the others would have nothing to say to me though i battered on all their doors she was soon able to sleep at nights without the dread that i should be waking presently with the ironwork of certain seats figured on my person and what relieved her very much was that i had begun to write as if auld lichts were not the only people i knew of so long as i confined myself to them she had a haunting fear that even though the editor remained blind to his best interests something would one day go crack within me as the mainspring of a watch breaks and my pen refuse to write for evermore  ‘ay i like the article brawly’ she would say timidly ‘but i’m doubting it’s the last—i always have a sort of terror the new one may be the last’ and if many days elapsed before the arrival of another article her face would say mournfully ‘the blow has fallen—he can think of nothing more to write about’  if i ever shared her fears i never told her so and the articles that were not scotch grew in number until there were hundreds of them all carefully preserved by her they were the only thing in the house that having served one purpose she did not convert into something else yet they could give her uneasy moments  this was because i nearly always assumed a character when i wrote i must be a country squire or an undergraduate or a butler or a member of the house of lords or a dowager or a lady called sweet seventeen or an engineer in india else was my pen clogged and though this gave my mother certain fearful joys causing her to laugh unexpectedly so far as my articles were concerned she nearly always laughed in the wrong place it also scared her  much to her amusement the editor continued to prefer the auld licht papers however as was proved to those who knew him by his way of thinking that the others would pass as they were while he sent these back and asked me to make them better  here again she came to my aid  i had said that the row of stockings were hung on a string by the fire which was a recollection of my own but she could tell me whether they were hung upside down  she became quite skilful at sending or giving me for now i could be with her half the year the right details but still she smiled at the editor and in her gay moods she would say ‘i was fifteen when i got my first pair of elasticsided boots  tell him my charge for this important news is two pounds ten’  ‘ay but though we’re doing well it’s no’ the same as if they were a book with your name on it’  so the ambitious woman would say with a sigh and i did my best to turn the auld licht sketches into a book with my name on it  then perhaps we understood most fully how good a friend our editor had been for just as i had been able to find no wellknown magazine—and i think i tried all—which would print any article or story about the poor of my native land so now the publishers scotch and english refused to accept the book as a gift  i was willing to present it to them but they would have it in no guise there seemed to be a blight on everything that was scotch  i daresay we sighed but never were collaborators more prepared for rejection and though my mother might look wistfully at the scorned manuscript at times and murmur ‘you poor cold little crittur shut away in a drawer are you dead or just sleeping’ she had still her editor to say grace over  and at last publishers sufficiently daring and far more than sufficiently generous were found for us by a dear friend who made one woman very ‘uplifted’ he also was an editor and had as large a part in making me a writer of books as the other in determining what the books should be about  now that i was an author i must get into a club  but you should have heard my mother on clubs  she knew of none save those to which you subscribe a pittance weekly in anticipation of rainy days and the london clubs were her scorn  often i heard her on them—she raised her voice to make me hear whichever room i might be in and it was when she was sarcastic that i skulked the most ‘thirty pounds is what he will have to pay the first year and ten pounds a year after that  you think it’s a lot o’ siller  oh no you’re mista’en—it’s nothing ava  for the third part of thirty pounds you could rent a fourroomed house but what is a fourroomed house what is thirty pounds compared to the glory of being a member of a club  where does the glory come in  sal you needna ask me i’m just a doited auld stock that never set foot in a club so it’s little i ken about glory  but i may tell you if you bide in london and canna become member of a club the best you can do is to tie a rope round your neck and slip out of the world  what use are they  oh they’re terrible useful  you see it doesna do for a man in london to eat his dinner in his lodgings  other men shake their heads at him  he maun away to his club if he is to be respected  does he get good dinners at the club  oh they cow  you get no common beef at clubs there is a manzy of different things all sauced up to be unlike themsels  even the potatoes daurna look like potatoes  if the food in a club looks like what it is the members run about flinging up their hands and crying “woe is me”  then this is another thing you get your letters sent to the club instead of to your lodgings  you see you would get them sooner at your lodgings and you may have to trudge weary miles to the club for them but that’s a great advantage and cheap at thirty pounds is it no’  i wonder they can do it at the price’  my wisest policy was to remain downstairs when these withering blasts were blowing but probably i went up in selfdefence  ‘i never saw you so pugnacious before mother’  ‘oh’ she would reply promptly ‘you canna expect me to be sharp in the uptake when i am no’ a member of a club’  ‘but the difficulty is in becoming a member  they are very particular about whom they elect and i daresay i shall not get in’  ‘well i’m but a poor crittur not being member of a club but i think i can tell you to make your mind easy on that head  you’ll get in i’se uphaud—and your thirty pounds will get in too’  ‘if i get in it will be because the editor is supporting me’  ‘it’s the first ill thing i ever heard of him’  ‘you don’t think he is to get any of the thirty pounds do you’  ‘’deed if i did i should be better pleased for he has been a good friend to us but what maddens me is that every penny of it should go to those barefaced scoundrels’  ‘what barefaced scoundrels’  ‘them that have the club’  ‘but all the members have the club between them’  ‘havers  i’m no’ to be catched with chaff’  ‘but don’t you believe me’  ‘i believe they’ve filled your head with their stories till you swallow whatever they tell you  if the place belongs to the members why do they have to pay thirty pounds’  ‘to keep it going’  ‘they dinna have to pay for their dinners then’  ‘oh yes they have to pay extra for dinner’  ‘and a gey black price i’m thinking’  ‘well five or six shillings’  ‘is that all  losh it’s nothing i wonder they dinna raise the price’  nevertheless my mother was of a sex that scorned prejudice and dropping sarcasm she would at times crossexamine me as if her mind was not yet made up  ‘tell me this if you were to fall ill would you be paid a weekly allowance out of the club’  no it was not that kind of club  ‘i see  well i am just trying to find out what kind of club it is  do you get anything out of it for accidents’  not a penny  ‘anything at new year’s time’  not so much as a goose  ‘is there any one mortal thing you get free out of that club’  there was not one mortal thing  ‘and thirty pounds is what you pay for this’  if the committee elected me  ‘how many are in the committee’  about a dozen i thought  ‘a dozen  ay ay that makes two pound ten apiece’  when i was elected i thought it wisdom to send my sister upstairs with the news  my mother was ironing and made no comment unless with the iron which i could hear rattling more violently in its box  presently i heard her laughing—at me undoubtedly but she had recovered control over her face before she came downstairs to congratulate me sarcastically this was grand news she said without a twinkle and i must write and thank the committee the noble critturs  i saw behind her mask and maintained a dignified silence but she would have another shot at me ‘and tell them’ she said from the door ‘you were doubtful of being elected but your auld mother had aye a mighty confidence they would snick you in’  i heard her laughing softly as she went up the stair but though i had provided her with a joke i knew she was burning to tell the committee what she thought of them  money you see meant so much to her though even at her poorest she was the most cheerful giver  in the old days when the article arrived she did not read it at once she first counted the lines to discover what we should get for it—she and the daughter who was so dear to her had calculated the payment per line and i remember once overhearing a discussion between them about whether that subtitle meant another sixpence  yes she knew the value of money she had always in the end got the things she wanted but now she could get them more easily and it turned her simple life into a fairy tale  so often in those days she went down suddenly upon her knees we would come upon her thus and go away noiselessly  after her death i found that she had preserved in a little box with a photograph of me as a child the envelopes which had contained my first cheques  there was a little ribbon round them     chapter v—a day of her life   i should like to call back a day of her life as it was at this time when her spirit was as bright as ever and her hand as eager but she was no longer able to do much work  it should not be difficult for she repeated herself from day to day and yet did it with a quaint unreasonableness that was ever yielding fresh delight  our love for her was such that we could easily tell what she would do in given circumstances but she had always a new way of doing it  well with break of day she wakes and sits up in bed and is standing in the middle of the room  so nimble was she in the mornings one of our troubles with her that these three actions must be considered as one she is on the floor before you have time to count them  she has strict orders not to rise until her fire is lit and having broken them there is a demure elation on her face  the question is what to do before she is caught and hurried to bed again  her fingers are tingling to prepare the breakfast she would dearly love to blacklead the grate but that might rouse her daughter from whose side she has slipped so cunningly  she catches sight of the screen at the foot of the bed and immediately her soft face becomes very determined  to guard her from draughts the screen had been brought here from the lordly east room where it was of no use whatever  but in her opinion it was too beautiful for use it belonged to the east room where she could take pleasant peeps at it she had objected to its removal even become lowspirited  now is her opportunity  the screen is an unwieldy thing but still as a mouse she carries it and they are well under weigh when it strikes against the gasbracket in the passage  next moment a reproachful hand arrests her she is challenged with being out of bed she denies it—standing in the passage  meekly or stubbornly she returns to bed and it is no satisfaction to you that you can say ‘well well of all the women’ and so on or ‘surely you knew that the screen was brought here to protect you’ for she will reply scornfully ‘who was touching the screen’  by this time i have wakened i am through the wall and join them anxiously so often has my mother been taken ill in the night that the slightest sound from her room rouses the house  she is in bed again looking as if she had never been out of it but i know her and listen sternly to the tale of her misdoings  she is not contrite  yes maybe she did promise not to venture forth on the cold floors of daybreak but she had risen for a moment only and we just t’neaded her with our talk about draughts—there were no such things as draughts in her young days—and it is more than she can do here she again attempts to rise but we hold her down to lie there and watch that beautiful screen being spoilt  i reply that the beauty of the screen has ever been its miserable defect ho there for a knife with which to spoil its beauty and make the bedroom its fitting home  as there is no knife handy my foot will do i raise my foot and then—she sees that it is bare she cries to me excitedly to go back to bed lest i catch cold  for though ever careless of herself she will wander the house unshod and tell us not to talk havers when we chide her the sight of one of us similarly negligent rouses her anxiety at once  she is willing now to sign any vow if only i will take my bare feet back to bed but probably she is soon after me in hers to make sure that i am nicely covered up  it is scarcely six o’clock and we have all promised to sleep for another hour but in ten minutes she is sure that eight has struck house disgraced or that if it has not something is wrong with the clock next moment she is captured on her way downstairs to wind up the clock so evidently we must be up and doing and as we have no servant my sister disappears into the kitchen having first asked me to see that ‘that woman’ lies still and ‘that woman’ calls out that she always does lie still so what are we blethering about  she is up now and dressed in her thick maroon wrapper over her shoulders lest she should stray despite our watchfulness is a shawl not placed there by her own hands and on her head a delicious mutch  o that i could sing the pæan of the white mutch and the dirge of the elaborate black cap from the day when she called witchcraft to her aid and made it out of snowflakes and the dear worn hands that washed it tenderly in a basin and the starching of it and the fingeriron for its exquisite frills that looked like curls of sugar and the sweet bands with which it tied beneath the chin  the honoured snowy mutch how i love to see it smiling to me from the doors and windows of the poor it is always smiling—sometimes maybe a wavering wistful smile as if a teardrop lay hidden among the frills  a hundred times i have taken the characterless cap from my mother’s head and put the mutch in its place and tied the bands beneath her chin while she protested but was well pleased  for in her heart she knew what suited her best and would admit it beaming when i put a mirror into her hands and told her to look but nevertheless the cap cost no less than soandso whereas—was that a knock at the door  she is gone to put on her cap  she begins the day by the fireside with the new testament in her hands an old volume with its loose pages beautifully refixed and its covers sewn and resewn by her so that you would say it can never fall to pieces  it is mine now and to me the black threads with which she stitched it are as part of the contents  other books she read in the ordinary manner but this one differently her lips moving with each word as if she were reading aloud and her face very solemn  the testament lies open on her lap long after she has ceased to read and the expression of her face has not changed  i have seen her reading other books early in the day but never without a guilty look on her face for she thought reading was scarce respectable until night had come  she spends the forenoon in what she calls doing nothing which may consist in stitching so hard that you would swear she was an overworked seamstress at it for her life or you will find her on a table with nails in her mouth and anon she has to be chased from the garret she has suddenly decided to change her curtains or she is under the bed searching for bandboxes and asking sternly where we have put that bonnet  on the whole she is behaving in a most exemplary way today not once have we caught her trying to go out into the washinghouse and we compliment her at dinnertime partly because she deserves it and partly to make her think herself so good that she will eat something just to maintain her new character  i question whether one hour of all her life was given to thoughts of food in her great days to eat seemed to her to be waste of time and afterwards she only ate to boast of it as something she had done to please us  she seldom remembered whether she had dined but always presumed she had and while she was telling me in all good faith what the meal consisted of it might be brought in when in london i had to hear daily what she was eating and perhaps she had refused all dishes until they produced the pen and ink  these were flourished before her and then she would say with a sigh ‘tell him i am to eat an egg’  but they were not so easily deceived they waited pen in hand until the egg was eaten  she never ‘went for a walk’ in her life  many long trudges she had as a girl when she carried her father’s dinner in a flagon to the country place where he was at work but to walk with no end save the good of your health seemed a very droll proceeding to her  in her young days she was positive no one had ever gone for a walk and she never lost the belief that it was an absurdity introduced by a new generation with too much time on their hands  that they enjoyed it she could not believe it was merely a form of showing off and as they passed her window she would remark to herself with blasting satire ‘ay jeames are you off for your walk’ and add fervently ‘rather you than me’  i was one of those who walked and though she smiled and might drop a sarcastic word when she saw me putting on my boots it was she who had heated them in preparation for my going  the arrangement between us was that she should lie down until my return and to ensure its being carried out i saw her in bed before i started but with the bang of the door she would be at the window to watch me go there is one spot on the road where a thousand times i have turned to wave my stick to her while she nodded and smiled and kissed her hand to me  that kissing of the hand was the one english custom she had learned  in an hour or so i return and perhaps find her in bed according to promise but still i am suspicious  the way to her detection is circuitous  ‘i’ll need to be rising now’ she says with a yawn that may be genuine  ‘how long have you been in bed’  ‘you saw me go’  ‘and then i saw you at the window  did you go straight back to bed’  ‘surely i had that much sense’  ‘the truth’  ‘i might have taken a look at the clock first’  ‘it is a terrible thing to have a mother who prevaricates  have you been lying down ever since i left’  ‘thereabout’  ‘what does that mean exactly’  ‘off and on’  ‘have you been to the garret’  ‘what should i do in the garret’  ‘but have you’  ‘i might just have looked up the garret stair’  ‘you have been redding up the garret again’  ‘not what you could call a redd up’  ‘o woman woman i believe you have not been in bed at all’  ‘you see me in it’  ‘my opinion is that you jumped into bed when you heard me open the door’  ‘havers’  ‘did you’  ‘no’  ‘well then when you heard me at the gate’  ‘it might have been when i heard you at the gate’  as daylight goes she follows it with her sewing to the window and gets another needleful out of it as one may run after a departed visitor for a last word but now the gas is lit and no longer is it shameful to sit down to literature  if the book be a story by george eliot or mrs oliphant her favourites and mine among women novelists or if it be a carlyle and we move softly she will read entranced for hours  her delight in carlyle was so well known that various good people would send her books that contained a page about him she could place her finger on any passage wanted in the biography as promptly as though she were looking for some article in her own drawer and given a date she was often able to tell you what they were doing in cheyne row that day carlyle she decided was not so much an ill man to live with as one who needed a deal of managing but when i asked if she thought she could have managed him she only replied with a modest smile that meant ‘oh no’ but had the face of ‘sal i would have liked to try’  one lady lent her some scores of carlyle letters that have never been published and crabbed was the writing but though my mother liked to have our letters read aloud to her she read every one of these herself and would quote from them in her talk  side by side with the carlyle letters which show him in his most gracious light were many from his wife to a friend and in one of these a romantic adventure is described—i quote from memory and it is a poor memory compared to my mother’s which registered everything by a method of her own ‘what might be the age of bell tibbits  well she was born the week i bought the boiler so she’ll be oneandfifty no less come martinmas’  mrs carlyle had got into the train at a london station and was feeling very lonely for the journey to scotland lay before her and no one had come to see her off then just as the train was starting a man jumped into the carriage to her regret until she saw his face when behold they were old friends and the last time they met i forget how many years before he had asked her to be his wife  he was very nice and if i remember aright saw her to her journey’s end though he had intended to alight at some halfway place  i call this an adventure and i am sure it seemed to my mother to be the most touching and memorable adventure that can come into a woman’s life  ‘you see he hadna forgot’ she would say proudly as if this was a compliment in which all her sex could share and on her old tender face shone some of the elation with which mrs carlyle wrote that letter  but there were times she held when carlyle must have made his wife a glorious woman  ‘as when’ i might inquire  ‘when she keeked in at his study door and said to herself “the whole world is ringing with his fame and he is my man”’  ‘and then’ i might point out ‘he would roar to her to shut the door’  ‘pooh’ said my mother ‘a man’s roar is neither here nor there’  but her verdict as a whole was ‘i would rather have been his mother than his wife’  so we have got her into her chair with the carlyles and all is well furthermore ‘to mak siccar’ my father has taken the opposite side of the fireplace and is deep in the latest five columns of gladstone who is his carlyle  he is to see that she does not slip away fired by a conviction which suddenly overrides her pages that the kitchen is going to rack and ruin for want of her and she is to recall him to himself should he put his foot in the fire and keep it there forgetful of all save his hero’s eloquence  we were a family who needed a deal of watching  she is not interested in what mr gladstone has to say indeed she could never be brought to look upon politics as of serious concern for grown folk a class in which she scarcely included man and she gratefully gave up reading ‘leaders’ the day i ceased to write them but like want of reasonableness a love for having the last word want of humour and the like politics were in her opinion a mannish attribute to be tolerated and gladstone was the name of the something which makes all our sex such queer characters  she had a profound faith in him as an aid to conversation and if there were silent men in the company would give him to them to talk about precisely as she divided a cake among children  and then with a motherly smile she would leave them to gorge on him  but in the idolising of gladstone she recognised nevertheless a certain inevitability and would no more have tried to contend with it than to sweep a shadow off the floor  gladstone was and there was an end of it in her practical philosophy  nor did she accept him coldly like a true woman she sympathised with those who suffered severely and they knew it and took counsel of her in the hour of need  i remember one ardent gladstonian who as a general election drew near was in sore straits indeed for he disbelieved in home rule and yet how could he vote against ‘gladstone’s man’  his distress was so real that it gave him a hangdog appearance  he put his case gloomily before her and until the day of the election she riddled him with sarcasm i think he only went to her because he found a mournful enjoyment in seeing a false gladstonian tortured  it was all such plainsailing for him she pointed out he did not like this home rule and therefore he must vote against it  she put it pitiful clear he replied with a groan  but she was like another woman to him when he appeared before her on his way to the pollingbooth  ‘this is a watery sabbath to you i’m thinking’ she said sympathetically but without dropping her wires—for home rule or no home rule that stockingfoot must be turned before twelve o’clock  a watery sabbath means a doleful day and ‘a watery sabbath it is’ he replied with feeling  a silence followed broken only by the click of the wires  now and again he would mutter ‘ay well i’ll be going to vote—little did i think the day would come’ and so on but if he rose it was only to sit down again and at last she crossed over to him and said softly no sarcasm in her voice now ‘away with you and vote for gladstone’s man’  he jumped up and made off without a word but from the east window we watched him strutting down the brae  i laughed but she said ‘i’m no sure that it’s a laughing matter’ and afterwards ‘i would have liked fine to be that gladstone’s mother’  it is nine o’clock now a quarterpast nine halfpast nine—all the same moment to me for i am at a sentence that will not write  i know though i can’t hear what my sister has gone upstairs to say to my mother—  ‘i was in at him at nine and he said “in five minutes” so i put the steak on the brander but i’ve been in thrice since then and every time he says “in five minutes” and when i try to take the tablecover off he presses his elbows hard on it and growls  his supper will be completely spoilt’  ‘oh that weary writing’  ‘i can do no more mother so you must come down and stop him’  ‘i have no power over him’ my mother says but she rises smiling and presently she is opening my door  ‘in five minutes’ i cry but when i see that it is she i rise and put my arm round her  ‘what a full basket’ she says looking at the wastepaper basket which contains most of my work of the night and with a dear gesture she lifts up a torn page and kisses it  ‘poor thing’ she says to it ‘and you would have liked so fine to be printed’ and she puts her hand over my desk to prevent my writing more  ‘in the last five minutes’ i begin ‘one can often do more than in the first hour’  ‘many a time i’ve said it in my young days’ she says slowly  ‘and proved it too’ cries a voice from the door the voice of one who was prouder of her even than i it is true and yet almost unbelievable that any one could have been prouder of her than i  ‘but those days are gone’ my mother says solemnly ‘gone to come back no more  you’ll put by your work now man and have your supper and then you’ll come up and sit beside your mother for a whiley for soon you’ll be putting her away in the kirkyard’  i hear such a little cry from near the door  so my mother and i go up the stair together  ‘we have changed places’ she says ‘that was just how i used to help you up but i’m the bairn now’  she brings out the testament again it was always lying within reach it is the lock of hair she left me when she died  and when she has read for a long time she ‘gives me a look’ as we say in the north and i go out to leave her alone with god  she had been but a child when her mother died and so she fell early into the way of saying her prayers with no earthly listener  often and often i have found her on her knees but i always went softly away closing the door  i never heard her pray but i know very well how she prayed and that when that door was shut there was not a day in god’s sight between the worn woman and the little child     chapter vi—her maid of all work   and sometimes i was her maid of all work  it is early morn and my mother has come noiselessly into my room  i know it is she though my eyes are shut and i am only half awake perhaps i was dreaming of her for i accept her presence without surprise as if in the awakening i had but seen her go out at one door to come in at another  but she is speaking to herself  ‘i’m sweer to waken him—i doubt he was working late—oh that weary writing—no i maunna waken him’  i start up  she is wringing her hands  ‘what is wrong’ i cry but i know before she answers  my sister is down with one of the headaches against which even she cannot fight and my mother who bears physical pain as if it were a comrade is most woebegone when her daughter is the sufferer  ‘and she winna let me go down the stair to make a cup of tea for her’ she groans  ‘i will soon make the tea mother’  ‘will you’ she says eagerly  it is what she has come to me for but ‘it is a pity to rouse you’ she says  ‘and i will take charge of the house today and light the fires and wash the dishes—’  ‘na oh no no i couldna ask that of you and you an author’  ‘it won’t be the first time mother since i was an author’  ‘more like the fiftieth’ she says almost gleefully so i have begun well for to keep up her spirits is the great thing today  knock at the door  it is the baker  i take in the bread looking so sternly at him that he dare not smile  knock at the door  it is the postman i hope he did not see that i had the lid of the kettle in my other hand  furious knocking in a remote part  this means that the author is in the coal cellar  anon i carry two breakfasts upstairs in triumph  i enter the bedroom like no mere humdrum son but after the manner of the glasgow waiter  i must say more about him  he had been my mother’s one waiter the only manservant she ever came in contact with and they had met in a glasgow hotel which she was eager to see having heard of the monstrous things and conceived them to resemble country inns with another twelve bedrooms i remember how she beamed—yet tried to look as if it was quite an ordinary experience—when we alighted at the hotel door but though she said nothing i soon read disappointment in her face  she knew how i was exulting in having her there so would not say a word to damp me but i craftily drew it out of her  no she was very comfortable and the house was grand beyond speech but—but—where was he he had not been very hearty  ‘he’ was the landlord she had expected him to receive us at the door and ask if we were in good health and how we had left the others and then she would have asked him if his wife was well and how many children they had after which we should all have sat down together to dinner  two chambermaids came into her room and prepared it without a single word to her about her journey or on any other subject and when they had gone ‘they are two haughty misses’ said my mother with spirit but what she most resented was the waiter with his swagger black suit and short quick steps and the ‘towel’ over his arm  without so much as a ‘welcome to glasgow’ he showed us to our seats not the smallest acknowledgment of our kindness in giving such munificent orders did we draw from him he hovered around the table as if it would be unsafe to leave us with his knives and forks he should have seen her knives and forks when we spoke to each other he affected not to hear we might laugh but this uppish fellow would not join in  we retired crushed and he had the final impudence to open the door for us  but though this hurt my mother at the time the humour of our experiences filled her on reflection and in her own house she would describe them with unction sometimes to those who had been in many hotels often to others who had been in none and whoever were her listeners she made them laugh though not always at the same thing  so now when i enter the bedroom with the tray on my arm is that badge of pride the towel and i approach with prim steps to inform madam that breakfast is ready and she puts on the society manner and addresses me as ‘sir’ and asks with cruel sarcasm for what purpose except to boast i carry the towel and i say ‘is there anything more i can do for madam’ and madam replies that there is one more thing i can do and that is eat her breakfast for her  but of this i take no notice for my object is to fire her with the spirit of the game so that she eats unwittingly  now that i have washed up the breakfast things i should be at my writing and i am anxious to be at it as i have an idea in my head which if it is of any value has almost certainly been put there by her  but dare i venture  i know that the house has not been properly set going yet there are beds to make the exterior of the teapot is fair but suppose some one were to look inside  what a pity i knocked over the flourbarrel  can i hope that for once my mother will forget to inquire into these matters  is my sister willing to let disorder reign until tomorrow  i determine to risk it  perhaps i have been at work for half an hour when i hear movements overhead  one or other of them is wondering why the house is so quiet  i rattle the tongs but even this does not satisfy them so back into the desk go my papers and now what you hear is not the scrape of a pen but the rinsing of pots and pans or i am making beds and making them thoroughly because after i am gone my mother will come i know her and look suspiciously beneath the coverlet  the kitchen is now speckless not an unwashed platter in sight unless you look beneath the table  i feel that i have earned time for an hour’s writing at last and at it i go with vigour  one page two pages really i am making progress when—was that a door opening  but i have my mother’s light step on the brain so i ‘yoke’ again and next moment she is beside me  she has not exactly left her room she gives me to understand but suddenly a conviction had come to her that i was writing without a warm mat at my feet  she carries one in her hands  now that she is here she remains for a time and though she is in the armchair by the fire where she sits bolt upright she loved to have cushions on the unused chairs but detested putting her back against them and i am bent low over my desk i know that contentment and pity are struggling for possession of her face contentment wins when she surveys her room pity when she looks at me  every article of furniture from the chairs that came into the world with me and have worn so much better though i was new and they were secondhand to the mantleborder of fashionable design which she sewed in her seventieth year having picked up the stitch in half a lesson has its story of fight and attainment for her hence her satisfaction but she sighs at sight of her son dipping and tearing and chewing the loathly pen  ‘oh that weary writing’  in vain do i tell her that writing is as pleasant to me as ever was the prospect of a tremendous day’s ironing to her that to some though not to me new chapters are as easy to turn out as new bannocks  no she maintains for one bannock is the marrows of another while chapters—and then perhaps her eyes twinkle and says she saucily ‘but sal you may be right for sometimes your bannocks are as alike as mine’  or i may be roused from my writing by her cry that i am making strange faces again  it is my contemptible weakness that if i say a character smiled vacuously i must smile vacuously if he frowns or leers i frown or leer if he is a coward or given to contortions i cringe or twist my legs until i have to stop writing to undo the knot  i bow with him eat with him and gnaw my moustache with him  if the character be a lady with an exquisite laugh i suddenly terrify you by laughing exquisitely one reads of the astounding versatility of an actor who is stout and lean on the same evening but what is he to the novelist who is a dozen persons within the hour  morally i fear we must deteriorate—but this is a subject i may wisely edge away from  we always spoke to each other in broad scotch i think in it still but now and again she would use a word that was new to me or i might hear one of her contemporaries use it  now is my opportunity to angle for its meaning  if i ask boldly what was chat word she used just now something like ‘bilbie’ or ‘silvendy’ she blushes and says she never said anything so common or hoots it is some auldfarrant word about which she can tell me nothing  but if in the course of conversation i remark casually ‘did he find bilbie’ or ‘was that quite silvendy’ though the sense of the question is vague to me she falls into the trap and the words explain themselves in her replies  or maybe today she sees whither i am leading her and such is her sensitiveness that she is quite hurt  the humour goes out of her face to find bilbie in some more silvendy spot and her reproachful eyes—but now i am on the arm of her chair and we have made it up  nevertheless i shall get no more oldworld scotch out of her this forenoon she weeds her talk determinedly and it is as great a falling away as when the mutch gives place to the cap  i am off for my afternoon walk and she has promised to bar the door behind me and open it to none  when i return—well the door is still barred but she is looking both furtive and elated  i should say that she is burning to tell me something but cannot tell it without exposing herself  has she opened the door and if so why  i don’t ask but i watch  it is she who is sly now  ‘have you been in the east room since you came in’ she asks with apparent indifference  ‘no why do you ask’  ‘oh i just thought you might have looked in’  ‘is there anything new there’  ‘i dinna say there is but—but just go and see’  ‘there can’t be anything new if you kept the door barred’ i say cleverly  this crushes her for a moment but her eagerness that i should see is greater than her fear  i set off for the east room and she follows affecting humility but with triumph in her eye  how often those little scenes took place  i was never told of the new purchase i was lured into its presence and then she waited timidly for my start of surprise  ‘do you see it’ she says anxiously and i see it and hear it for this time it is a brannew wicker chair of the kind that whisper to themselves for the first six months  ‘a goingabout body was selling them in a cart’ my mother begins and what followed presents itself to my eyes before she can utter another word  ten minutes at the least did she stand at the door argybargying with that man  but it would be cruelty to scold a woman so uplifted  ‘fifteen shillings he wanted’ she cries ‘but what do you think i beat him down to’  ‘seven and sixpence’  she claps her hands with delight  ‘four shillings as i’m a living woman’ she crows never was a woman fonder of a bargain  i gaze at the purchase with the amazement expected of me and the chair itself crinkles and shudders to hear what it went for or is it merely chuckling at her  ‘and the man said it cost himself five shillings’ my mother continues exultantly  you would have thought her the hardest person had not a knock on the wall summoned us about this time to my sister’s side  though in bed she has been listening and this is what she has to say in a voice that makes my mother very indignant ‘you drive a bargain   i’m thinking ten shillings was nearer what you paid’  ‘four shillings to a penny’ says my mother  ‘i daresay’ says my sister ‘but after you paid him the money i heard you in the little bedroom press  what were you doing there’  my mother winces  ‘i may have given him a present of an old topcoat’ she falters  ‘he looked illhappit  but that was after i made the bargain’  ‘were there bairns in the cart’  ‘there might have been a bit lassie in the cart’  ‘i thought as much  what did you give her  i heard you in the pantry’  ‘four shillings was what i got that chair for’ replies my mother firmly if i don’t interfere there will be a coldness between them for at least a minute  ‘there is blood on your finger’ i say to my mother  ‘so there is’ she says concealing her hand  ‘blood’ exclaims my sister anxiously and then with a cry of triumph ‘i warrant it’s jelly  you gave that lassie one of the jelly cans’  the glasgow waiter brings up tea and presently my sister is able to rise and after a sharp fight i am expelled from the kitchen  the last thing i do as maid of all work is to lug upstairs the clothesbasket which has just arrived with the mangling  now there is delicious linen for my mother to finger there was always rapture on her face when the clothesbasket came in it never failed to make her once more the active genius of the house  i may leave her now with her sheets and collars and napkins and fronts  indeed she probably orders me to go  a son is all very well but suppose he were to tread on that counterpane  my sister is but and i am ben—i mean she is in the east end and i am in the west—tuts tuts let us get at the english of this by striving she is in the kitchen and i am at my desk in the parlour  i hope i may not be disturbed for tonight i must make my hero say ‘darling’ and it needs both privacy and concentration  in a word let me admit though i should like to beat about the bush that i have sat down to a lovechapter  too long has it been avoided albert has called marion ‘dear’ only as yet between you and me these are not their real names but though the public will probably read the word without blinking it went off in my hands with a bang  they tell me—the sassenach tell me—that in time i shall be able without a blush to make albert say ‘darling’ and even gather her up in his arms but i begin to doubt it the moment sees me as shy as ever i still find it advisable to lock the door and then—no witness save the dog—i ‘do’ it dourly with my teeth clenched while the dog retreats into the far corner and moans  the bolder englishman i am told will write a lovechapter and then go out quite coolly to dinner but such goings on are contrary to the scotch nature even the great novelists dared not  conceive mr stevenson left alone with a hero a heroine and a proposal impending he does not know where to look  sir walter in the same circumstances gets out of the room by making his lovescenes take place between the end of one chapter and the beginning of the next but he could afford to do anything and the small fry must e’en to their task moan the dog as he may  so i have yoked to mine when enter my mother looking wistful  ‘i suppose you are terrible thrang’ she says  ‘well i am rather busy but—what is it you want me to do’  ‘it would be a shame to ask you’  ‘still ask me’  ‘i am so terrified they may be filed’  ‘you want me to—’  ‘if you would just come up and help me to fold the sheets’  the sheets are folded and i return to albert  i lock the door and at last i am bringing my hero forward nicely my knee in the small of his back when this startling question is shot by my sister through the keyhole—  ‘where did you put the carrotgrater’  it will all have to be done over again if i let albert go for a moment so gripping him hard i shout indignantly that i have not seen the carrotgrater  ‘then what did you grate the carrots on’ asks the voice and the doorhandle is shaken just as i shake albert  ‘on a broken cup’ i reply with surprising readiness and i get to work again but am less engrossed for a conviction grows on me that i put the carrotgrater in the drawer of the sewingmachine  i am wondering whether i should confess or brazen it out when i hear my sister going hurriedly upstairs  i have a presentiment that she has gone to talk about me and i basely open my door and listen  ‘just look at that mother’  ‘is it a dishcloth’  ‘that’s what it is now’  ‘losh behears it’s one of the new tablenapkins’  ‘that’s what it was  he has been polishing the kitchen grate with it’  i remember  ‘woe’s me  that is what comes of his not letting me budge from this room  o it is a watery sabbath when men take to doing women’s work’  ‘it defies the face of clay mother to fathom what makes him so senseless’  ‘oh it’s that weary writing’  ‘and the worst of it is he will talk tomorrow as if he had done wonders’  ‘that’s the way with the whole clanjamfray of them’  ‘yes but as usual you will humour him mother’  ‘oh well it pleases him you see’ says my mother ‘and we can have our laugh when his door’s shut’  ‘he is most terribly handless’  ‘he is all that but poor soul he does his best’     chapter vii—r l s   these familiar initials are i suppose the best beloved in recent literature certainly they are the sweetest to me but there was a time when my mother could not abide them  she said ‘that stevenson man’ with a sneer and it was never easy to her to sneer  at thought of him her face would become almost hard which seems incredible and she would knit her lips and fold her arms and reply with a stiff ‘oh’ if you mentioned his aggravating name  in the novels we have a way of writing of our heroine ‘she drew herself up haughtily’ and when mine draw themselves up haughtily i see my mother thinking of robert louis stevenson  he knew her opinion of him and would write ‘my ears tingled yesterday i sair doubt she has been miscalling me again’  but the more she miscalled him the more he delighted in her and she was informed of this and at once said ‘the scoundrel’  if you would know what was his unpardonable crime it was this he wrote better books than mine  i remember the day she found it out which was not however the day she admitted it  that day when i should have been at my work she came upon me in the kitchen ‘the master of ballantrae’ beside me but i was not reading my head lay heavy on the table and to her anxious eyes i doubt not i was the picture of woe  ‘not writing’ i echoed no i was not writing i saw no use in ever trying to write again  and down i suppose went my head once more  she misunderstood and thought the blow had fallen i had awakened to the discovery always dreaded by her that i had written myself dry i was no better than an empty inkbottle  she wrung her hands but indignation came to her with my explanation which was that while r l s was at it we others were only ‘prentices cutting our fingers on his tools  ‘i could never thole his books’ said my mother immediately and indeed vindictively  ‘you have not read any of them’ i reminded her  ‘and never will’ said she with spirit  and i have no doubt that she called him a dark character that very day for weeks too if not for months she adhered to her determination not to read him though i having come to my senses and seen that there is a place for the ‘prentice was taking a pleasure almost malicious in putting ‘the master of ballantrae’ in her way  i would place it on her table so that it said goodmorning to her when she rose  she would frown and carrying it downstairs as if she had it in the tongs replace it on its bookshelf  i would wrap it up in the cover she had made for the latest carlyle she would skin it contemptuously and again bring it down  i would hide her spectacles in it and lay it on top of the clothesbasket and prop it up invitingly open against her teapot  and at last i got her though i forget by which of many contrivances  what i recall vividly is a keyhole view to which another member of the family invited me  then i saw my mother wrapped up in ‘the master of ballantrae’ and muttering the music to herself nodding her head in approval and taking a stealthy glance at the foot of each page before she began at the top  nevertheless she had an ear for the door for when i bounced in she had been too clever for me there was no book to be seen only an apron on her lap and she was gazing out at the window some such conversation as this followed—  ‘you have been sitting very quietly mother’  ‘i always sit quietly i never do anything i’m just a finished stocking’  ‘have you been reading’  ‘do i ever read at this time of day’  ‘what is that in your lap’  ‘just my apron’  ‘is that a book beneath the apron’  ‘it might be a book’  ‘let me see’  ‘go away with you to your work’  but i lifted the apron  ‘why it’s “the master of ballantrae”’  i exclaimed shocked  ‘so it is’ said my mother equally surprised  but i looked sternly at her and perhaps she blushed  ‘well what do you think not nearly equal to mine’ said i with humour  ‘nothing like them’ she said determinedly  ‘not a bit’ said i though whether with a smile or a groan is immaterial they would have meant the same thing  should i put the book back on its shelf  i asked and she replied that i could put it wherever i liked for all she cared so long as i took it out of her sight the implication was that it had stolen on to her lap while she was looking out at the window  my behaviour may seem small but i gave her a last chance for i said that some people found it a book there was no putting down until they reached the last page  ‘i’m no that kind’ replied my mother  nevertheless our old game with the haver of a thing as she called it was continued with this difference that it was now she who carried the book covertly upstairs and i who replaced it on the shelf and several times we caught each other in the act but not a word said either of us we were grown selfconscious  much of the play no doubt i forget but one incident i remember clearly  she had come down to sit beside me while i wrote and sometimes when i looked up her eye was not on me but on the shelf where ‘the master of ballantrae’ stood inviting her mr stevenson’s books are not for the shelf they are for the hand even when you lay them down let it be on the table for the next comer  being the most sociable that man has penned in our time they feel very lonely up there in a stately row  i think their eye is on you the moment you enter the room and so you are drawn to look at them and you take a volume down with the impulse that induces one to unchain the dog  and the result is not dissimilar for in another moment you two are at play is there any other modern writer who gets round you in this way  well he had given my mother the look which in the ballroom means ‘ask me for this waltz’ and she ettled to do it but felt that her more dutiful course was to sit out the dance with this other less entertaining partner  i wrote on doggedly but could hear the whispering  ‘am i to be a wallflower’ asked james durie reproachfully  it must have been leapyear  ‘speak lower’ replied my mother with an uneasy look at me  ‘pooh’ said james contemptuously ‘that kailruntle’  ‘i winna have him miscalled’ said my mother frowning  ‘i am done with him’ said james wiping his cane with his cambric handkerchief and his sword clattered deliciously i cannot think this was accidental which made my mother sigh  like the man he was he followed up his advantage with a comparison that made me dip viciously  ‘a prettier sound that’ said he clanking his sword again ‘than the clackclack of your young friend’s shuttle’  ‘whist’ cried my mother who had seen me dip  ‘then give me your arm’ said james lowering his voice  ‘i dare not’ answered my mother  ‘he’s so touchy about you’  ‘come come’ he pressed her ‘you are certain to do it sooner or later so why not now’  ‘wait till he has gone for his walk’ said my mother ‘and forbye that i’m ower old to dance with you’  ‘how old are you’ he inquired  ‘you’re gey an’ pert’ cried my mother  ‘are you seventy’  ‘off and on’ she admitted  ‘pooh’ he said ‘a mere girl’  she replied instantly ‘i’m no’ to be catched with chaff’ but she smiled and rose as if he had stretched out his hand and got her by the fingertip  after that they whispered so low which they could do as they were now much nearer each other that i could catch only one remark  it came from james and seems to show the tenor of their whisperings for his words were ‘easily enough if you slip me beneath your shawl’  that is what she did and furthermore she left the room guiltily muttering something about redding up the drawers  i suppose i smiled wanly to myself or conscience must have been nibbling at my mother for in less than five minutes she was back carrying her accomplice openly and she thrust him with positive viciousness into the place where my stevenson had lost a tooth as the writer whom he most resembled would have said  and then like a good mother she took up one of her son’s books and read it most determinedly  it had become a touching incident to me and i remember how we there and then agreed upon a compromise she was to read the enticing thing just to convince herself of its inferiority  ‘the master of ballantrae’ is not the best  conceive the glory which was my mother’s of knowing from a trustworthy source that there are at least three better awaiting you on the same shelf  she did not know alan breck yet and he was as anxious to step down as mr bally himself  john silver was there getting into his leg so that she should not have to wait a moment and roaring ‘i’ll lay to that’ when she told me consolingly that she could not thole pirate stories  not to know these gentlemen what is it like  it is like never having been in love  but they are in the house  that is like knowing that you will fall in love tomorrow morning  with one word by drawing one mournful face i could have got my mother to abjure the jamshelf—nay i might have managed it by merely saying that she had enjoyed ‘the master of ballantrae’  for you must remember that she only read it to persuade herself and me of its unworthiness and that the reason she wanted to read the others was to get further proof  all this she made plain to me eyeing me a little anxiously the while and of course i accepted the explanation  alan is the biggest child of them all and i doubt not that she thought so but curiously enough her views of him are among the things i have forgotten but how enamoured she was of ‘treasure island’ and how faithful she tried to be to me all the time she was reading it  i had to put my hands over her eyes to let her know that i had entered the room and even then she might try to read between my fingers coming to herself presently however to say ‘it’s a haver of a book’  ‘those pirate stories are so uninteresting’ i would reply without fear for she was too engrossed to see through me  ‘do you think you will finish this one’  ‘i may as well go on with it since i have begun it’ my mother says so slyly that my sister and i shake our heads at each other to imply ‘was there ever such a woman’  ‘there are none of those onelegged scoundrels in my books’ i say  ‘better without them’ she replies promptly  ‘i wonder mother what it is about the man that so infatuates the public’  ‘he takes no hold of me’ she insists  ‘i would a hantle rather read your books’  i offer obligingly to bring one of them to her and now she looks at me suspiciously  ‘you surely believe i like yours best’ she says with instant anxiety and i soothe her by assurances and retire advising her to read on just to see if she can find out how he misleads the public ‘oh i may take a look at it again byandby’ she says indifferently but nevertheless the probability is that as the door shuts the book opens as if by some mechanical contrivance  i remember how she read ‘treasure island’ holding it close to the ribs of the fire because she could not spare a moment to rise and light the gas and how when bedtime came and we coaxed remonstrated scolded she said quite fiercely clinging to the book ‘i dinna lay my head on a pillow this night till i see how that laddie got out of the barrel’  after this i think he was as bewitching as the laddie in the barrel to her—was he not always a laddie in the barrel himself climbing in for apples while we all stood around like gamins waiting for a bite  he was the spirit of boyhood tugging at the skirts of this old world of ours and compelling it to come back and play  and i suppose my mother felt this as so many have felt it like others she was a little scared at first to find herself skipping again with this masterful child at the rope but soon she gave him her hand and set off with him for the meadow not an apology between the two of them for the author left behind  but near to the end did she admit in words that he had a way with him which was beyond her son  ‘silk and sacking that is what we are’ she was informed to which she would reply obstinately ‘well then i prefer sacking’  ‘but if he had been your son’  ‘but he is not’  ‘you wish he were’  ‘i dinna deny but what i could have found room for him’  and still at times she would smear him with the name of black to his delight when he learned the reason  that was when some podgy redsealed bluecrossed letter arrived from vailima inviting me to journey thither his directions were ‘you take the boat at san francisco and then my place is the second to the left’  even london seemed to her to carry me so far away that i often took a week to the journey the first six days in getting her used to the idea and these letters terrified her  it was not the finger of jim hawkins she now saw beckoning me across the seas it was john silver waving a crutch  seldom i believe did i read straight through one of these vailima letters when in the middle i suddenly remembered who was upstairs and what she was probably doing and i ran to her three steps at a jump to find her lips pursed hands folded a picture of gloom  ‘i have a letter from—’  ‘so i have heard’  ‘would you like to hear it’  ‘no’  ‘can you not abide him’  ‘i cauna thole him’  ‘is he a black’  ‘he is all that’  well vailima was the one spot on earth i had any great craving to visit but i think she always knew i would never leave her  sometime she said she should like me to go but not until she was laid away  ‘and how small i have grown this last winter  look at my wrists  it canna be long now’  no i never thought of going was never absent for a day from her without reluctance and never walked so quickly as when i was going back  in the meantime that happened which put an end for ever to my scheme of travel  i shall never go up the road of loving hearts now on ‘a wonderful clear night of stars’ to meet the man coming toward me on a horse  it is still a wonderful clear night of stars but the road is empty  so i never saw the dear king of us all  but before he had written books he was in my part of the country with a fishingwand in his hand and i like to think that i was the boy who met him that day by queen margaret’s burn where the rowans are and busked a fly for him and stood watching while his lithe figure rose and fell as he cast and hinted back from the crystal waters of noranside     chapter viii—a panic in the house   i was sitting at my desk in london when a telegram came announcing that my mother was again dangerously ill and i seized my hat and hurried to the station  it is not a memory of one night only  a score of times i am sure i was called north thus suddenly and reached our little town trembling head out at railwaycarriage window for a glance at a known face which would answer the question on mine  these illnesses came as regularly as the backend of the year but were less regular in going and through them all by night and by day i see my sister moving so unwearyingly so lovingly though with failing strength that i bow my head in reverence for her  she was wearing herself done  the doctor advised us to engage a nurse but the mere word frightened my mother and we got between her and the door as if the woman was already on the stair to have a strange woman in my mother’s room—you who are used to them cannot conceive what it meant to us  then we must have a servant  this seemed only less horrible  my father turned up his sleeves and clutched the besom  i tossed aside my papers and was ready to run the errands  he answered the door i kept the fires going he gave me a lesson in cooking i showed him how to make beds one of us wore an apron  it was not for long  i was led to my desk the newspaper was put into my father’s hand  ‘but a servant’ we cried and would have fallen to again  ‘no servant comes into this house’ said my sister quite fiercely and oh but my mother was relieved to hear her there were many such scenes a year of them i daresay before we yielded  i cannot say which of us felt it most  in london i was used to servants and in moments of irritation would ring for them furiously though doubtless my manner changed as they opened the door  i have even held my own with gentlemen in plush giving one my hat another my stick and a third my coat and all done with little more trouble than i should have expended in putting the three articles on the chair myself  but this bold deed and other big things of the kind i did that i might tell my mother of them afterwards while i sat on the end of her bed and her face beamed with astonishment and mirth  from my earliest days i had seen servants  the manse had a servant the bank had another one of their uses was to pounce upon and carry away in stately manner certain naughty boys who played with me  the banker did not seem really great to me but his servant—oh yes  her boots cheeped all the way down the church aisle it was common report that she had flesh every day for her dinner instead of meeting her lover at the pump she walked him into the country and he returned with wild roses in his buttonhole his hand up to hide them and on his face the troubled look of those who know that if they take this lady they must give up drinking from the saucer for evermore  for the lovers were really common men until she gave them that glance over the shoulder which i have noticed is the fatal gift of servants  according to legend we once had a servant—in my childhood i could show the mark of it on my forehead and even point her out to other boys though she was now merely a wife with a house of her own  but even while i boasted i doubted  reduced to lifesize she may have been but a woman who came in to help  i shall say no more about her lest some one comes forward to prove that she went home at night  never shall i forget my first servant  i was eight or nine in velveteen diamond socks ‘cross your legs when they look at you’ my mother had said ‘and put your thumb in your pocket and leave the top of your handkerchief showing’ and i had travelled by rail to visit a relative  he had a servant and as i was to be his guest she must be my servant also for the time being—you may be sure i had got my mother to put this plainly before me ere i set off  my relative met me at the station but i wasted no time in hoping i found him well  i did not even cross my legs for him so eager was i to hear whether she was still there  a sister greeted me at the door but i chafed at having to be kissed at once i made for the kitchen where i knew they reside and there she was and i crossed my legs and put one thumb in my pocket and the handkerchief was showing  afterwards i stopped strangers on the highway with an offer to show her to them through the kitchen window and i doubt not the first letter i ever wrote told my mother what they are like when they are so near that you can put your fingers into them  but now when we could have servants for ourselves i shrank from the thought  it would not be the same house we should have to dissemble i saw myself speaking english the long day through  you only know the shell of a scot until you have entered his home circle in his office in clubs at social gatherings where you and he seem to be getting on so well he is really a house with all the shutters closed and the door locked  he is not opaque of set purpose often it is against his will—it is certainly against mine i try to keep my shutters open and my foot in the door but they will bang to  in many ways my mother was as reticent as myself though her manners were as gracious as mine were rough in vain alas all the honest oiling of them and my sister was the most reserved of us all you might at times see a light through one of my chinks she was doubleshuttered  now it seems to be a law of nature that we must show our true selves at some time and as the scot must do it at home and squeeze a day into an hour what follows is that there he is selfrevealing in the superlative degree the feelings so long dammed up overflow and thus a scotch family are probably better acquainted with each other and more ignorant of the life outside their circle than any other family in the world  and as knowledge is sympathy the affection existing between them is almost painful in its intensity they have not more to give than their neighbours but it is bestowed upon a few instead of being distributed among many they are reputed niggardly but for family affection at least they pay in gold  in this i believe we shall find the true explanation why scotch literature since long before the days of burns has been so often inspired by the domestic hearth and has treated it with a passionate understanding  must a woman come into our house and discover that i was not such a dreary dog as i had the reputation of being  was i to be seen at last with the veil of dourness lifted  my company voice is so low and unimpressive that my first remark is merely an intimation that i am about to speak like the whir of the clock before it strikes must it be revealed that i had another voice that there was one door i never opened without leaving my reserve on the mat  ah that room must its secrets be disclosed  so joyous they were when my mother was well no wonder we were merry  again and again she had been given back to us it was for the glorious today we thanked god in our hearts we knew and in our prayers confessed that the fill of delight had been given us whatever might befall  we had not to wait till all was over to know its value my mother used to say ‘we never understand how little we need in this world until we know the loss of it’ and there can be few truer sayings but during her last years we exulted daily in the possession of her as much as we can exult in her memory  no wonder i say that we were merry but we liked to show it to god alone and to him only our agony during those many nightalarms when lights flickered in the house and white faces were round my mother’s bedside  not for other eyes those long vigils when night about we sat watching nor the awful nights when we stood together teeth clenched—waiting—it must be now  and it was not then her hand became cooler her breathing more easy she smiled to us  once more i could work by snatches and was glad but what was the result to me compared to the joy of hearing that voice from the other room  there lay all the work i was ever proud of the rest is but honest craftsmanship done to give her coal and food and softer pillows  my thousand letters that she so carefully preserved always sleeping with the last beneath the sheet where one was found when she died—they are the only writing of mine of which i shall ever boast  i would not there had been one less though i could have written an immortal book for it  how my sister toiled—to prevent a stranger’s getting any footing in the house  and how with the same object my mother strove to ‘do for herself’ once more  she pretended that she was always well now and concealed her ailments so craftily that we had to probe for them—  ‘i think you are not feeling well today’  ‘i am perfectly well’  ‘where is the pain’  ‘i have no pain to speak of’  ‘is it at your heart’  ‘no’  ‘is your breathing hurting you’  ‘not it’  ‘do you feel those stounds in your head again’  ‘no no i tell you there is nothing the matter with me’  ‘have you a pain in your side’  ‘really it’s most provoking i canna put my hand to my side without your thinking i have a pain there’  ‘you have a pain in your side’  ‘i might have a pain in my side’  ‘and you were trying to hide it  is it very painful’  ‘it’s—it’s no so bad but what i can bear it’  which of these two gave in first i cannot tell though to me fell the duty of persuading them for whichever she was she rebelled as soon as the other showed signs of yielding so that sometimes i had two converts in the week but never both on the same day  i would take them separately and press the one to yield for the sake of the other but they saw so easily through my artifice  my mother might go bravely to my sister and say ‘i have been thinking it over and i believe i would like a servant fine—once we got used to her’  ‘did he tell you to say that’ asks my sister sharply  ‘i say it of my own free will’  ‘he put you up to it i am sure and he told you not to let on that you did it to lighten my work’  ‘maybe he did but i think we should get one’  ‘not for my sake’ says my sister obstinately and then my mother comes ben to me to say delightedly ‘she winna listen to reason’  but at last a servant was engaged we might be said to be at the window gloomily waiting for her now and it was with such words as these that we sought to comfort each other and ourselves—  ‘she will go early to her bed’  ‘she needna often be seen upstairs’  ‘we’ll set her to the walking every day’  ‘there will be a many errands for her to run  we’ll tell her to take her time over them’  ‘three times she shall go to the kirk every sabbath and we’ll egg her on to attending the lectures in the hall’  ‘she is sure to have friends in the town  we’ll let her visit them often’  ‘if she dares to come into your room mother’  ‘mind this every one of you servant or no servant i fold all the linen mysel’  ‘she shall not get cleaning out the east room’  ‘nor putting my chest of drawers in order’  ‘nor tidying up my manuscripts’  ‘i hope she’s a reader though  you could set her down with a book and then close the door canny on her’  and so on  was ever servant awaited so apprehensively  and then she came—at an anxious time too when her worth could be put to the proof at once—and from first to last she was a treasure  i know not what we should have done without her     chapter ix—my heroine   when it was known that i had begun another story my mother might ask what it was to be about this time  ‘fine we can guess who it is about’ my sister would say pointedly  ‘maybe you can guess but it is beyond me’ says my mother with the meekness of one who knows that she is a dull person  my sister scorned her at such times  ‘what woman is in all his books’ she would demand  ‘i’m sure i canna say’ replies my mother determinedly  ‘i thought the women were different every time’  ‘mother i wonder you can be so audacious  fine you know what woman i mean’  ‘how can i know  what woman is it  you should bear in mind that i hinna your cleverness’ they were constantly giving each other little knocks  ‘i won’t give you the satisfaction of saying her name  but this i will say it is high time he was keeping her out of his books’  and then as usual my mother would give herself away unconsciously  ‘that is what i tell him’ she says chuckling ‘and he tries to keep me out but he canna it’s more than he can do’  on an evening after my mother had gone to bed the first chapter would be brought upstairs and i read sitting at the foot of the bed while my sister watched to make my mother behave herself and my father cried h’sh when there were interruptions  all would go well at the start the reflections were accepted with a little nod of the head the descriptions of scenery as ruts on the road that must be got over at a walking pace my mother did not care for scenery and that is why there is so little of it in my books  but now i am reading too quickly a little apprehensively because i know that the next paragraph begins with—let us say with ‘along this path came a woman’ i had intended to rush on here in a loud bullying voice but ‘along this path came a woman’ i read and stop  did i hear a faint sound from the other end of the bed  perhaps i did not i may only have been listening for it but i falter and look up my sister and i look sternly at my mother  she bites her underlip and clutches the bed with both hands really she is doing her best for me but first comes a smothered gurgling sound then her hold on herself relaxes and she shakes with mirth  ‘that’s a way to behave’ cries my sister  ‘i cannot help it’ my mother gasps  ‘and there’s nothing to laugh at’  ‘it’s that woman’ my mother explains unnecessarily  ‘maybe she’s not the woman you think her’ i say crushed  ‘maybe not’ says my mother doubtfully  ‘what was her name’  ‘her name’ i answer with triumph ‘was not margaret’ but this makes her ripple again  ‘i have so many names nowadays’ she mutters  ‘h’sh’ says my father and the reading is resumed  perhaps the woman who came along the path was of tall and majestic figure which should have shown my mother that i had contrived to start my train without her this time  but it did not  ‘what are you laughing at now’ says my sister severely  ‘do you not hear that she was a tall majestic woman’  ‘it’s the first time i ever heard it said of her’ replies my mother  ‘but she is’  ‘ke fy havers’  ‘the book says it’  ‘there will be a many queer things in the book  what was she wearing’  i have not described her clothes  ‘that’s a mistake’ says my mother ‘when i come upon a woman in a book the first thing i want to know about her is whether she was goodlooking and the second how she was put on’  the woman on the path was eighteen years of age and of remarkable beauty  ‘that settles you’ says my sister  ‘i was no beauty at eighteen’ my mother admits but here my father interferes unexpectedly  ‘there wasna your like in this countryside at eighteen’ says he stoutly  ‘pooh’ says she well pleased  ‘were you plain then’ we ask  ‘sal’ she replies briskly ‘i was far from plain’  ‘h’sh’  perhaps in the next chapter this lady or another appears in a carriage  ‘i assure you we’re mounting in the world’ i hear my mother murmur but i hurry on without looking up  the lady lives in a house where there are footmen—but the footmen have come on the scene too hurriedly  ‘this is more than i can stand’ gasps my mother and just as she is getting the better of a fit of laughter ‘footman give me a drink of water’ she cries and this sets her off again  often the readings had to end abruptly because her mirth brought on violent fits of coughing  sometimes i read to my sister alone and she assured me that she could not see my mother among the women this time  this she said to humour me presently she would slip upstairs to announce triumphantly ‘you are in again’  or in the small hours i might make a confidant of my father and when i had finished reading he would say thoughtfully ‘that lassie is very natural  some of the ways you say she had—your mother had them just the same  did you ever notice what an extraordinary woman your mother is’  then would i seek my mother for comfort  she was the more ready to give it because of her profound conviction that if i was found out—that is if readers discovered how frequently and in how many guises she appeared in my books—the affair would become a public scandal  ‘you see jess is not really you’ i begin inquiringly  ‘oh no she is another kind of woman altogether’ my mother says and then spoils the compliment by adding naîvely ‘she had but two rooms and i have six’  i sigh  ‘without counting the pantry and it’s a great big pantry’ she mutters  this was not the sort of difference i could greatly plume myself upon and honesty would force me to say ‘as far as that goes there was a time when you had but two rooms yourself—’  ‘that’s long since’ she breaks in  ‘i began with an upthestair but i always had it in my mind—i never mentioned it but there it was—to have the downthestair as well  ay and i’ve had it this many a year’  ‘still there is no denying that jess had the same ambition’  ‘she had but to her tworoomed house she had to stick all her born days was that like me’  ‘no but she wanted—’  ‘she wanted and i wanted but i got and she didna  that’s the difference betwixt her and me’  ‘if that is all the difference it is little credit i can claim for having created her’  my mother sees that i need soothing  ‘that is far from being all the difference’ she would say eagerly  ‘there’s my silk for instance though i say it mysel there’s not a better silk in the valley of strathmore  had jess a silk of any kind—not to speak of a silk like that’  ‘well she had no silk but you remember how she got that cloak with beads’  ‘an eleven and a bit  hoots what was that to boast of  i tell you every single yard of my silk cost—’  ‘mother that is the very way jess spoke about her cloak’  she lets this pass perhaps without hearing it for solicitude about her silk has hurried her to the wardrobe where it hangs  ‘ah mother i am afraid that was very like jess’  ‘how could it be like her when she didna even have a wardrobe  i tell you what if there had been a real jess and she had boasted to me about her cloak with beads i would have said to her in a careless sort of voice “step across with me jess and i’ll let you see something that is hanging in my wardrobe”  that would have lowered her pride’  ‘i don’t believe that is what you would have done mother’  then a sweeter expression would come into her face  ‘no’ she would say reflectively ‘it’s not’  ‘what would you have done  i think i know’  ‘you canna know  but i’m thinking i would have called to mind that she was a poor woman and ailing and terrible windy about her cloak and i would just have said it was a beauty and that i wished i had one like it’  ‘yes i am certain that is what you would have done  but oh mother that is just how jess would have acted if some poorer woman than she had shown her a new shawl’  ‘maybe but though i hadna boasted about my silk i would have wanted to do it’  ‘just as jess would have been fidgeting to show off her eleven and a bit’  it seems advisable to jump to another book not to my first because—well as it was my first there would naturally be something of my mother in it and not to the second as it was my first novel and not much esteemed even in our family  but the little touches of my mother in it are not so bad  let us try the story about the minister  my mother’s first remark is decidedly damping  ‘many a time in my young days’ she says ‘i played about the auld licht manse but i little thought i should live to be the mistress of it’  ‘but margaret is not you’  ‘nno oh no  she had a very different life from mine  i never let on to a soul that she is me’  ‘she was not meant to be you when i began  mother what a way you have of coming creeping in’  ‘you should keep better watch on yourself’  ‘perhaps if i had called margaret by some other name—’  ‘i should have seen through her just the same  as soon as i heard she was the mother i began to laugh  in some ways though she’s no’ so very like me  she was long in finding out about babbie  i’se uphaud i should have been quicker’  ‘babbie you see kept close to the gardenwall’  ‘it’s not the wall up at the manse that would have hidden her from me’  ‘she came out in the dark’  ‘i’m thinking she would have found me looking for her with a candle’  ‘and gavin was secretive’  ‘that would have put me on my mettle’  ‘she never suspected anything’  ‘i wonder at her’  but my new heroine is to be a child  what has madam to say to that  a child  yes she has something to say even to that  ‘this beats all’ are the words  ‘come come mother i see what you are thinking but i assure you that this time—’  ‘of course not’ she says soothingly ‘oh no she canna be me’ but anon her real thoughts are revealed by the artless remark ‘i doubt though this is a tough job you have on hand—it is so long since i was a bairn’  we came very close to each other in those talks  ‘it is a queer thing’ she would say softly ‘that near everything you write is about this bit place  you little expected that when you began  i mind well the time when it never entered your head any more than mine that you could write a page about our squares and wynds  i wonder how it has come about’  there was a time when i could not have answered that question but that time had long passed  ‘i suppose mother it was because you were most at home in your own town and there was never much pleasure to me in writing of people who could not have known you nor of squares and wynds you never passed through nor of a countryside where you never carried your father’s dinner in a flagon  there is scarce a house in all my books where i have not seemed to see you a thousand times bending over the fireplace or winding up the clock’  ‘and yet you used to be in such a quandary because you knew nobody you could make your womenfolk out of  do you mind that and how we both laughed at the notion of your having to make them out of me’  ‘i remember’  ‘and now you’ve gone back to my father’s time  it’s more than sixty years since i carried his dinner in a flagon through the long parks of kinnordy’  ‘i often go into the long parks mother and sit on the stile at the edge of the wood till i fancy i see a little girl coming toward me with a flagon in her hand’  ‘jumping the burn i was once so proud of my jumps and swinging the flagon round so quick that what was inside hadna time to fall out  i used to wear a magenta frock and a white pinafore  did i ever tell you that’  ‘mother the little girl in my story wears a magenta frock and a white pinafore’  ‘you minded that  but i’m thinking it wasna a lassie in a pinafore you saw in the long parks of kinnordy it was just a gey done auld woman’  ‘it was a lassie in a pinafore mother when she was far away but when she came near it was a gey done auld woman’  ‘and a fell ugly one’  ‘the most beautiful one i shall ever see’  ‘i wonder to hear you say it  look at my wrinkled auld face’  ‘it is the sweetest face in all the world’  ‘see how the rings drop off my poor wasted finger’  ‘there will always be someone nigh mother to put them on again’  ‘ay will there  well i know it  do you mind how when you were but a bairn you used to say “wait till i’m a man and you’ll never have a reason for greeting again”’  i remembered  ‘you used to come running into the house to say “there’s a proud dame going down the marywellbrae in a cloak that is black on one side and white on the other wait till i’m a man and you’ll have one the very same”  and when i lay on gey hard beds you said “when i’m a man you’ll lie on feathers”  you saw nothing bonny you never heard of my setting my heart on anything but what you flung up your head and cried “wait till i’m a man”  you fair shamed me before the neighbours and yet i was windy too  and now it has all come true like a dream  i can call to mind not one little thing i ettled for in my lusty days that hasna been put into my hands in my auld age i sit here useless surrounded by the gratification of all my wishes and all my ambitions and at times i’m near terrified for it’s as if god had mista’en me for some other woman’  ‘your hopes and ambitions were so simple’ i would say but she did not like that  ‘they werena that simple’ she would answer flushing  i am reluctant to leave those happy days but the end must be faced and as i write i seem to see my mother growing smaller and her face more wistful and still she lingers with us as if god had said ‘child of mine your time has come be not afraid’  and she was not afraid but still she lingered and he waited smiling  i never read any of that last book to her when it was finished she was too heavy with years to follow a story  to me this was as if my book must go out cold into the world like all that may come after it from me and my sister who took more thought for others and less for herself than any other human being i have known saw this and by some means unfathomable to a man coaxed my mother into being once again the woman she had been  on a day but three weeks before she died my father and i were called softly upstairs  my mother was sitting bolt upright as she loved to sit in her old chair by the window with a manuscript in her hands  but she was looking about her without much understanding  ‘just to please him’ my sister whispered and then in a low trembling voice my mother began to read  i looked at my sister  tears of woe were stealing down her face  soon the reading became very slow and stopped  after a pause ‘there was something you were to say to him’ my sister reminded her  ‘luck’ muttered a voice as from the dead ‘luck’  and then the old smile came running to her face like a lamplighter and she said to me ‘i am ower far gone to read but i’m thinking i am in it again’  my father put her testament in her hands and it fell open—as it always does—at the fourteenth of john  she made an effort to read but could not  suddenly she stooped and kissed the broad page  ‘will that do instead’ she asked     chapter x—art thou afraid his power shall fail   for years i had been trying to prepare myself for my mother’s death trying to foresee how she would die seeing myself when she was dead even then i knew it was a vain thing i did but i am sure there was no morbidness in it  i hoped i should be with her at the end not as the one she looked at last but as him from whom she would turn only to look upon her bestbeloved not my arm but my sister’s should be round her when she died not my hand but my sister’s should close her eyes  i knew that i might reach her too late i saw myself open a door where there was none to greet me and go up the old stair into the old room  but what i did not foresee was that which happened  i little thought it could come about that i should climb the old stair and pass the door beyond which my mother lay dead and enter another room first and go on my knees there  my mother’s favourite paraphrase is one known in our house as david’s because it was the last he learned to repeat  it was also the last thing she read—      art thou afraid his power shall fail     when comes thy evil day     and can an allcreating arm     grow weary or decay  i heard her voice gain strength as she read it i saw her timid face take courage but when came my evil day then at the dawning alas for me i was afraid  in those last weeks though we did not know it my sister was dying on her feet  for many years she had been giving her life a little bit at a time for another year another month latterly for another day of her mother and now she was worn out  ‘i’ll never leave you mother’—‘fine i know you’ll never leave me’  i thought that cry so pathetic at the time but i was not to know its full significance until it was only the echo of a cry  looking at these two then it was to me as if my mother had set out for the new country and my sister held her back  but i see with a clearer vision now  it is no longer the mother but the daughter who is in front and she cries ‘mother you are lingering so long at the end i have ill waiting for you’  but she knew no more than we how it was to be if she seemed weary when we met her on the stair she was still the brightest the most active figure in my mother’s room she never complained save when she had to depart on that walk which separated them for half an hour  how reluctantly she put on her bonnet how we had to press her to it and how often having gone as far as the door she came back to stand by my mother’s side  sometimes as we watched from the window i could not but laugh and yet with a pain at my heart to see her hasting doggedly onward not an eye for right or left nothing in her head but the return there was always my father in the house than whom never was a more devoted husband and often there were others one daughter in particular but they scarce dared tend my mother—this one snatched the cup jealously from their hands  my mother liked it best from her  we all knew this ‘i like them fine but i canna do without you’  my sister so unselfish in all other things had an unwearying passion for parading it before us it was the rich reward of her life  the others spoke among themselves of what must come soon and they had tears to help them but this daughter would not speak of it and her tears were ever slow to come  i knew that night and day she was trying to get ready for a world without her mother in it but she must remain dumb none of us was so scotch as she she must bear her agony alone a tragic solitary scotchwoman  even my mother who spoke so calmly to us of the coming time could not mention it to her  these two the one in bed and the other bending over her could only look long at each other until slowly the tears came to my sister’s eyes and then my mother would turn away her wet face  and still neither said a word each knew so well what was in the other’s thoughts so eloquently they spoke in silence ‘mother i am loath to let you go’ and ‘oh my daughter now that my time is near i wish you werena quite so fond of me’  but when the daughter had slipped away my mother would grip my hand and cry ‘i leave her to you you see how she has sown it will depend on you how she is to reap’ and i made promises but i suppose neither of us saw that she had already reaped  in the night my mother might waken and sit up in bed confused by what she saw  while she slept six decades or more had rolled back and she was again in her girlhood suddenly recalled from it she was dizzy as with the rush of the years  how had she come into this room  when she went to bed last night after preparing her father’s supper there had been a dresser at the window what had become of the saltbucket the mealtub the hams that should be hanging from the rafters  there were no rafters it was a papered ceiling  she had often heard of open beds but how came she to be lying in one  to fathom these things she would try to spring out of bed and be startled to find it a labour as if she had been taken ill in the night  hearing her move i might knock on the wall that separated us this being a sign prearranged between us that i was near by and so all was well but sometimes the knocking seemed to belong to the past and she would cry ‘that is my father chapping at the door i maun rise and let him in’  she seemed to see him—and it was one much younger than herself that she saw—covered with snow kicking clods of it from his boots his hands swollen and chapped with sand and wet then i would hear—it was a common experience of the night—my sister soothing her lovingly and turning up the light to show her where she was helping her to the window to let her see that it was no night of snow even humouring her by going downstairs and opening the outer door and calling into the darkness ‘is anybody there’ and if that was not sufficient she would swaddle my mother in wraps and take her through the rooms of the house lighting them one by one pointing out familiar objects and so guiding her slowly through the sixty odd years she had jumped too quickly  and perhaps the end of it was that my mother came to my bedside and said wistfully ‘am i an auld woman’  but with daylight even during the last week in which i saw her she would be up and doing for though pitifully frail she no longer suffered from any ailment  she seemed so well comparatively that i having still the remnants of an illness to shake off was to take a holiday in switzerland and then return for her when we were all to go to the muchloved manse of her muchloved brother in the west country  so she had many preparations on her mind and the morning was the time when she had any strength to carry them out  to leave her house had always been a month’s work for her it must be left in such perfect order every corner visited and cleaned out every chest probed to the bottom the linen lifted out examined and put back lovingly as if to make it lie more easily in her absence shelves had to be repapered a strenuous week devoted to the garret  less exhaustively but with much of the old exultation in her house this was done for the last time and then there was the bringing out of her own clothes and the spreading of them upon the bed and the pleased fingering of them and the consultations about which should be left behind  ah beautiful dream i clung to it every morning i would not look when my sister shook her head at it but long before each day was done i too knew that it could never be  it had come true many times but never again  we two knew it but when my mother who must always be prepared so long beforehand called for her trunk and bandboxes we brought them to her and we stood silent watching while she packed  the morning came when i was to go away  it had come a hundred times when i was a boy when i was an undergraduate when i was a man when she had seemed big and strong to me when she was grown so little and it was i who put my arms round her  but always it was the same scene  i am not to write about it of the parting and the turning back on the stair and two people trying to smile and the setting off again and the cry that brought me back  nor shall i say more of the silent figure in the background always in the background always near my mother  the last i saw of these two was from the gate  they were at the window which never passes from my eyes  i could not see my dear sister’s face for she was bending over my mother pointing me out to her and telling her to wave her hand and smile because i liked it so  that action was an epitome of my sister’s life  i had been gone a fortnight when the telegram was put into my hands  i had got a letter from my sister a few hours before saying that all was well at home  the telegram said in five words that she had died suddenly the previous night  there was no mention of my mother and i was three days’ journey from home  the news i got on reaching london was this my mother did not understand that her daughter was dead and they were waiting for me to tell her  i need not have been such a coward  this is how these two died—for after all i was too late by twelve hours to see my mother alive  their last night was almost gleeful  in the old days that hour before my mother’s gas was lowered had so often been the happiest that my pen steals back to it again and again as i write it was the time when my mother lay smiling in bed and we were gathered round her like children at play our reticence scattered on the floor or tossed in sport from hand to hand the author become so boisterous that in the pauses they were holding him in check by force  rather woful had been some attempts latterly to renew those evenings when my mother might be brought to the verge of them as if some familiar echo called her but where she was she did not clearly know because the past was roaring in her ears like a great sea  but this night was a last gift to my sister  the joyousness of their voices drew the others in the house upstairs where for more than an hour my mother was the centre of a merry party and so clear of mental eye that they who were at first cautious abandoned themselves to the sport and whatever they said by way of humorous rally she instantly capped as of old turning their darts against themselves until in selfdefence they were three to one and the three hard pressed  how my sister must have been rejoicing  once again she could cry ‘was there ever such a woman’  they tell me that such a happiness was on the daughter’s face that my mother commented on it that having risen to go they sat down again fascinated by the radiance of these two  and when eventually they went the last words they heard were ‘they are gone you see mother but i am here i will never leave you’ and ‘na you winna leave me fine i know that’  for some time afterwards their voices could be heard from downstairs but what they talked of is not known  and then came silence  had i been at home i should have been in the room again several times turning the handle of the door softly releasing it so that it did not creak and standing looking at them  it had been so a thousand times  but that night would i have slipped out again mind at rest or should i have seen the change coming while they slept  let it be told in the fewest words  my sister awoke next morning with a headache  she had always been a martyr to headaches but this one like many another seemed to be unusually severe  nevertheless she rose and lit my mother’s fire and brought up her breakfast and then had to return to bed  she was not able to write her daily letter to me saying how my mother was and almost the last thing she did was to ask my father to write it and not to let on that she was ill as it would distress me the doctor was called but she rapidly became unconscious  in this state she was removed from my mother’s bed to another  it was discovered that she was suffering from an internal disease  no one had guessed it  she herself never knew  nothing could be done  in this unconsciousness she passed away without knowing that she was leaving her mother  had i known when i heard of her death that she had been saved that pain surely i could have gone home more bravely with the words      art thou afraid his power fail     when comes thy evil day  ah you would think so i should have thought so but i know myself now when i reached london i did hear how my sister died but still i was afraid  i saw myself in my mother’s room telling her why the door of the next room was locked and i was afraid  god had done so much and yet i could not look confidently to him for the little that was left to do  ‘o ye of little faith’  these are the words i seem to hear my mother saying to me now and she looks at me so sorrowfully  he did it very easily and it has ceased to seem marvellous to me because it was so plainly his doing  my timid mother saw the one who was never to leave her carried unconscious from the room and she did not break down  she who used to wring her hands if her daughter was gone for a moment never asked for her again they were afraid to mention her name an awe fell upon them  but i am sure they need not have been so anxious there are mysteries in life and death but this was not one of them  a child can understand what happened  god said that my sister must come first but he put his hand on my mother’s eyes at that moment and she was altered  they told her that i was on my way home and she said with a confident smile ‘he will come as quick as trains can bring him’  that is my reward that is what i have got for my books  everything i could do for her in this life i have done since i was a boy i look back through the years and i cannot see the smallest thing left undone  they were buried together on my mother’s seventysixth birthday though there had been three days between their deaths  on the last day my mother insisted on rising from bed and going through the house  the arms that had so often helped her on that journey were now cold in death but there were others only less loving and she went slowly from room to room like one bidding goodbye and in mine she said ‘the beautiful rows upon rows of books ant he said every one of them was mine all mine’ and in the east room which was her greatest triumph she said caressingly ‘my nain bonny room’  all this time there seemed to be something that she wanted but the one was dead who always knew what she wanted and they produced many things at which she shook her head  they did not know then that she was dying but they followed her through the house in some apprehension and after she returned to bed they saw that she was becoming very weak  once she said eagerly ‘is that you david’ and again she thought she heard her father knocking the snow off his boots her desire for that which she could not name came back to her and at last they saw that what she wanted was the old christening robe  it was brought to her and she unfolded it with trembling exultant hands and when she had made sure that it was still of virgin fairness her old arms went round it adoringly and upon her face there was the ineffable mysterious glow of motherhood  suddenly she said ‘wha’s bairn’s dead is a bairn of mine dead’ but those watching dared not speak and then slowly as if with an effort of memory she repeated our names aloud in the order in which we were born  only one who should have come third among the ten did she omit the one in the next room but at the end after a pause she said her name and repeated it again and again and again lingering over it as if it were the most exquisite music and this her dying song  and yet it was a very commonplace name  they knew now that she was dying  she told them to fold up the christening robe and almost sharply she watched them put it away and then for some time she talked of the long lovely life that had been hers and of him to whom she owed it  she said goodbye to them all and at last turned her face to the side where her bestbeloved had lain and for over an hour she prayed  they only caught the words now and again and the last they heard were ‘god’ and ‘love’  i think god was smiling when he took her to him as he had so often smiled at her during those seventysix years  i saw her lying dead and her face was beautiful and serene  but it was the other room i entered first and it was by my sister’s side that i fell upon my knees  the rounded completeness of a woman’s life that was my mother’s had not been for her  she would not have it at the price ‘i’ll never leave you mother’—‘fine i know you’ll never leave me’  the fierce joy of loving too much it is a terrible thing  my sister’s mouth was firmly closed as if she had got her way  and now i am left without them but i trust my memory will ever go back to those happy days not to rush through them but dallying here and there even as my mother wanders through my books  and if i also live to a time when age must dim my mind and the past comes sweeping back like the shades of night over the bare road of the present it will not i believe be my youth i shall see but hers not a boy clinging to his mother’s skirt and crying ‘wait till i’m a man and you’ll lie on feathers’ but a little girl in a magenta frock and a white pinafore who comes toward me through the long parks singing to herself and carrying her father’s dinner in a flagon                                                                         the end                                                                                                    edinburgh t and a constable
