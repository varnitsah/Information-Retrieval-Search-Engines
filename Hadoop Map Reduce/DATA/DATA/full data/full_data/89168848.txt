creature as clara  lop aside i could name one  don ferd yes the tame fool who submits to her caprice  lop asidei thought he couldnt miss it  don ferd is she not capricious teasing tyrannical obstinate perverse absurd ay a wilderness of faults and follies her looks are scorn and her very smilessdeath i wish i hadnt mentioned her smiles for she does smile such beaming loveliness such fascinating brightnessoh death and madness i shall die if i lose her  lop aside oh those damned smiles have undone all  airdon ferd    could i her faults remember   forgetting every charm   soon would impartial

a singular affection for music so i left him roaring at his barred window like the print of bajazet in the cage and what brings you out so early  don ferd i believe i told you that tomorrow was the day fixed by don pedro and claras unnatural stepmother for her to enter a convent in order that her brat might possess her fortune made desperate by this i procured a key to the door and bribed claras maid to leave it unbolted at two this morning i entered unperceived and stole to her chamberi found her waking and weeping  don ant happy ferdinand  don ferd sdeath hear the conclusioni was rated as the most confident ruffian for daring to approach her room at that hour of the night  don ant ay ay this was at first  don ferd no such thing she would not hear a word from me but threatened to raise her mother if i did not instantly leave her  don ant well but at last  don ferd at last why i was forced to leave the house as i came in  don ant and did you do nothing to offend her  don ferd nothing as i hope to be savedi believe i might snatch a dozen or two of kisses  don ant was that all well i think i never heard of such assurance  don ferd zounds i tell you i behaved with the utmost respect  don ant o lord i dont mean you but in her but hark ye ferdinand did you leave your key with them  don ferd yes the maid who saw me out took it from the door  don ant then my life for it her mistress elopes after you  don ferd ay to bless my rival perhaps i am in a humour to suspect everybodyyou loved her once and thought her an angel as i do now  don ant yes i loved her till i found she wouldnt love me and then i discovered that she hadnt a good feature in her face  air    i neer could any lustre see   in eyes that would not look on me   i neer saw nectar on a lip   but where my own did hope to sip   has the maid who seeks my heart   cheeks of rose untouchd by art   i will own the colour true   when yielding blushes aid their hue    is her hand so soft and pure   i must press it to be sure   nor can i be certain then   till it grateful press again   must i with attentive eye   watch her heaving bosom sigh   i will do so when i see   that heaving bosom sigh for me  besides ferdinand you have full security in my love for your sister help me there and i can never disturb you with clara  don ferd as far as i can consistently with the honour of our family you know i will but there must be no eloping  don ant and yet now you would carry off clara  don ferd ay thats a different casewe never mean that others should act to our sisters and wives as we do to othersbut to morrow clara is to be forced into a convent  don ant well and am not i so unfortunately circumstanced to morrow your father forces louisa to marry isaac the portuguesebut come with me and well devise something i warrant  don ferd i must go home  don ant well adieu  don ferd but don antonio if you did not love my sister you have too much honour and friendship to supplant me with clara  airdon ant    friendship is the bond of reason   but if beauty disapprove   heaven dissolves all other treason   in the heart thats true to love    the faith which to my friend i swore   as a civil oath i view   but to the charms which i adore   tis religion to be true  exit  don ferd there is always a levity in antonios manner of replying to me on this subject that is very alarmingsdeath if clara should love him after all  song    though cause for suspicion appears   yet proofs of her love too are strong   im a wretch if im right in my fears   and unworthy of bliss if im wrong   what heartbreaking torments from jealousy flow   ah none but the jealousthe jealous can know    when blest with the smiles of my fair   i know not how much i adore   those smiles let another but share   and i wonder i prized them no

dear margaret my charming duenna do you think we shall succeed  duen i tell you again i have no doubt ont but it must be instantly put to the trial everything is prepared in your room and for the rest we must trust to fortune  don louisa my fathers oath was never to see me till i had consented to  duen twas thus i overheard him say to his friend don guzmani will demand of her tomorrow once for all whether she will consent to marry isaac mendoza if she hesitates i will make a solemn oath never to see or speak to her till she returns to her dutythese were his words  don louisa and on his known obstinate adherence to what he has once said you have formed this plan for my escapebut have you secured my maid in our interest  duen she is a party in the whole but remember if we succeed you resign all right and title in little isaac the jew over to me  don louisa that i do with all my soul get him if you can and i shall wish you joy most heartily he is twenty times as rich as my poor antonio  air   thou canst not boast of fortunes store   my love while me they wealthy call   but i was glad to find thee poor   for with my heart id give thee all   and then the grateful youth shall own   i loved him for himself alone    but when his worth my hand shall gain   no word or look of mine shall show   that i the smallest thought retain   of what my bounty did bestow   yet still his grateful heart shall own   i loved him for himself alone  duen i hear don jerome comingquick give me the last letter i brought you from antonioyou know that is to be the ground of my dismissioni must slip out to seal it up as undelivered exit   enter don jerome and don ferdinand  don jer what i suppose you have been serenading too eh disturbing some peaceable neighbourhood with villainous catgut and lascivious piping out ont you set your sister here a vile example but i come to tell you madam that ill suffer no more of these midnight incantationsthese amorous orgies that steal the senses in the hearing as they say egyptian embalmers serve mummies extracting the brain through the ears however theres an end of your frolicsisaac mendoza will be here presently and tomorrow you shall marry him  don louisa never while i have life  don ferd indeed sir i wonder how you can think of such a man for a soninlaw  don jer sir you are very kind to favour me with your sentiments and pray what is your objection to him  don ferd he is a portuguese in the first place  don jer no such thing boy he has forsworn his country  don louisa he is a jew  don jer another mistake he has been a christian these six weeks  don ferd ay he left his old religion for an estate and has not had time to get a new one  don louisa but stands like a dead wall between church and synagogue or like the blank leaves between the old and new testament  don jer anything more  don ferd but the most remarkable part of his character is his passion for deceit and tricks of cunning  don louisa though at the same time the fool predominates so much over the knave that i am told he is generally the dupe of his own art  don ferd true like an unskilful gunner he usually misses his aim and is hurt by the recoil of his own piece  don jer anything more  don louisa to sum up all he has the worst fault a husband can havehes not my choice  don jer but you are his and choice on one side is sufficienttwo lovers should never meet in marriagebe you sour as you please he is sweettempered and for your good fruit theres nothing like ingrafting on a crab  don louisa i detest him as a lover and shall ten times more as a husband  don jer i dont know thatmarriage generally makes a great change but to cut the matter short will you have him or not  don louisa there is nothing else i could disobey you in  don jer do you value your fathers peace  don louisa so much that i will not fasten on him the regret of making an only daughter wretched  don jer very well maam then mark menever more will i see or converse with you till you return to your dutyno replythis and your chamber shall be your apartments i never will stir out without leaving you under lock and key and when im at home no creature can approach you but through my library well try who can be most obstinate out of my sightthere remain till you know your duty pushes her out  don ferd surely sir my sisters inclinations should be consulted in a matter of this kind and some regard paid to don antonio being my particular friend  don jer that doubtless is a very great recommendationi certainly have not paid sufficient respect to it  don ferd there is not a man living i would sooner choose for a brotherinlaw  don jer very possible and if you happen to have eer a sister who is not at the same time a daughter of mine im sure i shall have no objection to the relationship but at present if you please well drop the subject  don ferd nay sir tis only my regard for my sister makes me speak  don jer then pray sir in future let your regard for your father make you hold your tongue  don ferd i have done sir i shall only add a wish that you would reflect what at our age you would have felt had you been crossed in your affection for the mother of her you are so severe to  don jer why i must confess i had a great affection for your mothers ducats but that was all boy i married her for her fortune and she took me in obedience to her father and a very happy couple we were we never expected any love from one another and so we were never disappointed if we grumbled a little now and then it was soon over for we were never fond enough to quarrel and when the good woman died why whyi had as lieve she had lived and i wish every widower in seville could say the same i shall now go and get the key of this dressingroomso good son if you have any lecture in support of disobedience to give your sister it must be brief so make the best of your time dye hear exit  don ferd i fear indeed my friend antonio has little to hope for however louisa has firmness and my fathers anger will probably only increase her affectionin our intercourse with the world it is natural for us to dislike those who are innocently the cause of our distress but in the hearts attachment a woman never likes a man with ardour till she has suffered for his sakenoise so what bustle is herebetween my father and the duenna too ill een get out of the way exit   reenter don
