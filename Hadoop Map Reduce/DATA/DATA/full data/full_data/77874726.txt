past five morning  the birds chirping feeblymostly chaffinches answering each other the rest discomposed i fancy by the june snow1 the lake neither smooth nor rippled but like a surface of perfectly bright glass ill cast the lines of wave few and irregular like flaws in the planes of a fine crystal        1 the summits of the old man of wetherlam and helvellyn       were all white on the morning when this was written  i see this book was begun eight years agothen intended to contain only four oxford lectures but the said lectures also intended to contain the cream of forty volumes of scientific ornithology which intentions all and sundry having gone carlyle would have said to water and more piouslyminded persons to fire i am obliged now to cast my materials into another form and here at all events is a bundle of what is readiest under my hand the nature and name of which i must try to make a little more intelligible than my books have lately been either in text or title  meinie is the old english word for many in the sense of a many persons attending one as bridesmaids when in sixes or tens or dozenscourtiers footmen and the like it passes gradually into menial and unites the senses of multitude and servitude  in the passages quoted from or referred to in chaucers translation of the romance of the rose at the end of the first lecture any reader who cares for a clue to the farther significances of the title may find one to lead him safely through richer labyrinths of thought than mine and ladder enough alsoif there be either any heavenly or pure earthly love in his own breastto guide him to a pretty birds nest both in the romances of the rose and of juliet and in the sermons of st francis and st bernard  the term lecture is retained for though i lecture no more i still write habitually in a manner suited for oral delivery and imagine myself speaking to my pupils if ever i am happily thinking in myself but it will be also seen that by the help of this very familiarity of style i am endeavoring in these and my other writings on natural history to compel in the student a clearness of thought and precision of language which have not hitherto been in any wise the virtues or skills of scientific persons thoughtless readers who imagine that my own style such as it is the one thing which the british public concedes to me as a real power has been formed without pains may smile at the confidence with which i speak of altering accepted and even longestablished nomenclature but the use which i now have of language has taken me forty years to attain and those forty years spent mostly in walking through the wilderness of this worlds vain words seeking how they might be pruned into some better strength and i think it likely that at last i may put in my pruninghook with effect for indeed a time must come when english fathers and mothers will wish their children to learn english again and to speak it for all scholarly purposes and if they use instead greek or latin to use them only that they may be understood by greeks or latins2 and not that they may mystify the illiterate many of their own land dead languages so called may at least be left at rest if not honored and must not be torn in mutilation out of their tumuli that the skins and bones of them may help to hold our living nonsense together while languages called living but which live only to slack themselves into slang or bloat themselves into bombast must one day have new grammars written for their license and new laws for their insolence        2 greek is now a living nations language from messina to       delosand latin still lives for the welltrained churchmen       and gentlemen of italy  observe however that the recast methods of classification adopted in this book and in proserpina must be carefully distinguished from their recastings of nomenclature i am perfectly sure that it is wiser to use plain short words than obscure long ones but not in the least sure that i am doing the best that can be done for my pupils in classing swallows with owls or milkworts with violets the classification is always given as tentative and at its utmost elementary but the nomenclature as in all probability conclusive  for the rest the success and the service of all depend on the more or less thorough accomplishment of plans long since laid and which would have been good for little if their coping could at once have been conjectured or foretold in their foundations it has been throughout my trust that if death should write on these what this man began to build he was not able to finish god may also write on them not in anger but in aid      a stronger than he cometh     loves meinie  il etoit tout convert doisiaulx                             romance of the rose     lecture i3  the robin   1 among the more splendid pictures in the exhibition of the old masters this year you cannot but remember the vandyke portraits of the two sons of the duke of lennox i think you cannot but remember it because it would be difficult to find even among the works of vandyke a more striking representation of the youth of our english noblesse nor one in which the painter had more exerted himself or with better success in rendering the decorous pride and natural grace of honorable aristocracy        3 delivered at oxford march 15th 1873  vandyke is however inferior to titian and velasquez in that his effort to show this noblesse of air and persons may always be detected also the aristocracy of vandykes day were already so far fearful of their own position as to feel anxiety that it should be immediately recognized and the effect of the painters conscious deference and of the equally conscious pride of the boys as they stood to be painted has been somewhat to shorten the power of the one and to abase the dignity of the other and thus in the midst of my admiration of the youths beautiful faces and natural quality of majesty set off by all splendors of dress and courtesies of art i could not forbear questioning with myself what the true value was in the scales of creation of these fair human beings who set so high a value on themselves andas if the only answerthe words kept repeating themselves in my ear ye are of more value than many sparrows  2 passeres greek strouthosthe things that open their wings and are not otherwise noticeable small birds of the land and wood the food of the serpent of man or of the stronger creatures of their own kindthat even these though among the simplest and obscurest of beings have yet price in the eyes of their maker and that the death of one of them cannot take place but by his permission has long been the subject of declamation in our pulpits and the ground of much sentiment in nursery education but the declamation is so aimless and the sentiment so hollow that practically the chief interest of the leisure of mankind has been found in the destruction of the creatures which they professed to believe even the most high would not see perish without pity and in recent days it is fast becoming the only definition of aristocracy that the principal business of its life is the killing of sparrows  sparrows or pigeons or partridges what does it matter centum mille perdrices plumbo confecit4 that is indeed too often the sum of the life of an english lord much questionable now if indeed of more value than that of many sparrows        4 the epitaph on count zachdarm in sartor resartus  3 is it not a strange fact that interested in nothing so much for the last two hundred years as in his horses he yet left it to the farmers of scotland to relieve draught horses from the bearingrein5 is it not one equally strange that master of the forests of england for a thousand years and of its libraries for three hundred he left the natural history of birds to be written by a cardprinters lad of newcastle6 written and not written for indeed we have no natural history of birds written yet it cannot be written but by a scholar and a gentleman and no english gentleman in recent times has ever thought of birds except as flying targets or flavorous dishes the only piece of natural history worth the name in the english language that i know of is in the few lines of milton on the creation the only example of a proper manner of contribution to natural history is in whites letters from selborne you know i have always spoken of bewick as preeminently a vulgar or boorish person though of splendid honor and genius his vulgarity shows in nothing so much as in the poverty of the details he has collected with the best intentions and the shrewdest sense for english ornithology his imagination is not cultivated enough to enable him to choose or arrange        5 sir arthur helps animals and their masters p 67        6 ariadne florentina vi 45  4 nor can much more be said for the observations of modern science it is vulgar in a far worse way by its arrogance and materialism in general the scientific natural history of a bird consists of four articlesfirst the name and estate of the gentleman whose gamekeeper shot the last that was seen in england secondly two or three stories of doubtful origin printed in every book on the subject of birds for the last fifty years thirdly an account of the feathers from the comb to the rump with enumeration of the colors which are never more to be seen on the living bird by english eyes and lastly a discussion of the reasons why none of the twelve names which former naturalists have given to the bird are of any further use and why the present author has given it a thirteenth which is to be universally and to the end of time accepted  5 you may fancy this is caricature but the abyss of confusion produced by modern science in nomenclature and the utter void of the abyss when you plunge into it after any one useful fact surpass all caricature i have in my hand thirteen plates of thirteen species of eagles eagles all or hawks all or falcons allwhichever name you choose for the great race of the hookheaded birds of preysome so like that you cant tell the one from the other at the distance at which i show them to you all absolutely alike in their eagle or falcon character having every one the falx for its beak and every one flesh for its prey do you suppose the unhappy student is to be allowed to call them all eagles or all falcons to begin with as would be the first condition of a wise nomenclature establishing resemblance by specific name before marking variation by individual name no such luck i hold you up the plates of the thirteen birds one by one and read you their names off the back      the first is        an aquila     the second          a haliætus     the third           a milvus     the fourth          a pandion     the fifth           an astur     the sixth           a falco     the seventh         a pernis     the eighth          a circus     the ninth           a buteo     the tenth           an archibuteo     the eleventh        an accipiter     the twelfth         an erythropus     and the thirteenth  a tinnunculus  theres a nice little lesson to entertain a parish schoolboy with beginning his natural history of birds  6 there are not so many varieties of robin as of hawk but the scientific classifiers are not to be beaten if they cannot find a number of similar birds to give different names to they will give two names to the same one here are two pictures of your own redbreast out of the two best modern works on ornithology in one it is called motacilla rubecula in the other rubecula familiaris  7 it is indeed one of the most serious as one of the most absurd weaknesses of modern naturalists to imagine that any presently invented nomenclature can stand even were it adopted by the consent of nations instead of the conceit of individuals it will take fifty years digestion before the recently ascertained elements of natural science can permit the arrangement of species in any permanently even over a limited period namable order nor then unless a great man is born to perceive and exhibit such order in the meantime the simplest and most descriptive nomenclature is the best every one of these birds for instance might be called falco in latin hawk in english some word being added to distinguish the genus which should describe its principal aspect or habit falco montium mountain hawk falco silvarum wood hawk falco procellarum sea hawk and the like then one descriptive epithet would mark species falco montium aureus golden eagle falco silvarum apivorus honey buzzard and so on and the naturalists of vienna paris and london should confirm the names of known creatures in conclave once every halfcentury and let them so stand for the next fifty years  8 in the meantime you yourselves or to speak more generally the young rising scholars of englandall of you who care for life as well as literature and for spiriteven the poor souls of birdsas well as lettering of their classes in booksyou with all care should cherish the old saxonenglish and normanfrench names of birds and ascertain them with the most affectionate researchnever despising even the rudest or most provincial forms all of them will some day or other give you clue to historical points of interest take for example the common english name of this lowflying falcon the most tamable and affectionate of his tribe and therefore i suppose fastest vanishing from field and wood the buzzard that name comes from the latin buteo still retained by the ornithologists but in its original form valueless to you but when you get it comfortably corrupted into provençal busac whence gradually the french busard and our buzzard you get from it the delightful compound busacador adorer of buzzardsmeaning generally a sporting person and then you have dantes bertrand de born the first troubadour of war bearing witness to you how the love of mere hunting and falconry was already in his day degrading the military classes and so far from being a necessary adjunct of the noble disposition of lover or soldier was even to contempt showing itself separate from both      le ric home cassador     menneion el buzacador     parlan de volada daustor     ne jamais darmas ni damor      the rich man the chaser     tires me to death and the adorer of buzzards     they talk of covey and hawk     and never of arms nor of love  cassador of course afterwards becomes chasseur and austor vautour but after you have read this and familiarized your ear with the old word how differently miltons phrase will ring to youthose who thought no better of the living god than of a buzzard idoland how literal it becomes when we think of the actual difference between a member of parliament in miltons time and the busacador of todayand all this freshness and value in the reading observe come of your keeping the word which great men have used for the bird instead of letting the anatomists blunder out a new one from their latin dictionaries  9 there are not so many namable varieties i just now said of robin as of falcon but this is somewhat inaccurately stated those thirteen birds represented a very large proportion of the entire group of the birds of prey which in my sevenfold classification i recommended you to call universally hawks the robin is only one of the far greater multitude of small birds which live almost indiscriminately on grain or insects and which i recommended you to call generally sparrows but of the robin itself there are two important european varietiesone redbreasted and the other bluebreasted  10 you probably some of you never heard of the bluebreast very few certainly have seen one alive and if alive certainly not wild in england  here is a picture of it daintily done7 and you can see the pretty blue shield on its breast perhaps at this distance vain shield if ever the fair little thing is wretched enough to set foot on english ground i find the last that was seen was shot at margate so long ago as 1842and there seems to be no official record of any visit before that since mr thomas embledon shot one on newcastle town moor in 1816 but this rarity of visit to us is strange other birds have no such clear objection to being shot and really seem to come to england expressly for the purpose and yet this bluebirdone cant say blue robini think we shall have to call him bluet like the cornflowerstays in sweden where it sings so sweetly that it is called a hundred tongues        7 mr goulds in his birds of great britain  11 that then is the utmost which the lords of land and masters of science do for us in their watch upon our feathered suppliants one kills them the other writes classifying epitaphs  we have next to ask what the poets painters and monks have done  the poetsamong whom i affectionately and reverently class the sweet singers of the nursery mothers and nurseshave done much very nearly all that i care for your thinking of the painters and monks the one being so greatly under the influence of the other we may for the present class together and may almost sum their contributions to ornithology in saying that they have plucked the wings from birds to make angels of men and the claws from birds to make devils of men  if you were to take away from religious art these two great helps of itsi must say on the whole very feebleimagination if you were to take from it i say the power of putting wings on shoulders and claws on fingers and toes how wonderfully the sphere of its angelic and diabolic characters would be contracted reduced only to the sources of expression in face or movements you might still find in good early sculpture very sufficient devils but the best angels would resolve themselves i think into little more than and not often into so much as the likenesses of pretty women with that grave and i do not say it ironically majestic expression which they put on when being very fond of their husbands and children they seriously think either the one or the other have misbehaved themselves  12 and it is not a little discouraging for me and may well make you doubtful of my right judgment in this endeavor to lead you into closer attention to the bird with its wings and claws still in its own possessionit is discouraging i say to observe that the beginning of such more faithful and accurate observation in former art is exactly coeval with the commencement of its decline the feverish and ungraceful natural history of paul called of the birds paolo degli uccelli produced indeed no harmful result on the minds of his contemporaries they watched in him with only contemptuous admiration the fantasy of zoological instinct which filled his house with painted dogs cats and birds because he was too poor to fill it with real ones their judgment of this morbidly naturalistic art was conclusively expressed by the sentence of donatello when going one morning into the old market to buy fruit and finding the animal painter uncovering a picture which had cost him months of care curiously symbolic in its subject the infidelity of st thomas of the investigatory fingering of the natural historian paul my friend said donatello thou art uncovering the picture just when thou shouldst be shutting it up  13 no harm therefore i repeat but on the contrary some wholesome stimulus to the fancy of men like luca and donatello themselves came of the grotesque and impertinent zoology of uccello  but the fatalest institutor of proud modern anatomical and scientific art and of all that has polluted the dignity and darkened the charity of the greater ages was antonio pollajuolo of florence antonio that is to say the poultererso named from the trade of his grandfather and with just so much of his grandfathers trade left in his own disposition that being set by lorenzo ghiberti to complete one of the ornamental festoons of the gates of the florentine baptistery there says vasari antonio produced a quail which may still be seen and is so beautiful nay so perfect that it wants nothing but the power of flight  14 here the morbid tendency was as attractive as it was subtle ghiberti himself fell under the influence of it allowed the borders of his gates with their fluttering birds and bossy fruits to dispute the spectators favor with the religious subjects they inclosed and from that day forward minuteness and muscularity were with curious harmony of evil delighted in together and the lancet and the microscope in the hands of fools were supposed to be complete substitutes for imagination in the souls of wise men so that even the best artists are gradually compelled or beguiled into compliance with the curiosity of their day and francia in the city of bologna is held to be a kind of god more particularly again i quote vasari after he had painted a set of caparisons for the duke of urbino on which he depicted a great forest all on fire and whence there rushes forth an immense number of every kind of animal with several human figures this terrific yet truly beautiful representation was all the more highly esteemed for the time that had been expended on it in the plumage of the birds and other minutiæ in the delineation of the different animals and in the diversity of the branches and leaves of the various trees seen therein and thenceforward the catastrophe is direct to the ornithological museums which breughel painted for gardens of eden and to the still life and dead game of dutch celebrities  15 and yet i am going to invite you today to examine down to almost microscopic detail the aspect of a small bird and to invite you to do this as a most expedient and sure step in your study of the greatest art  but the difference in our motive of examination will entirely alter the result to paint birds that we may show how minutely we can paint is among the most contemptible occupations of art to paint them that we may show how beautiful they are is not indeed one of its highest but quite one of its pleasantest and most useful it is a skill within the reach of every student of average capacity and which so far as acquired will assuredly both make their hearts kinder and their lives happier  without further preamble i will ask you to look today more carefully than usual at your wellknown favorite and to think about him with some precision  16 and first where does he come from i stated that my lectures were to be on english and greek birds but we are apt to fancy the robin all our own how exclusively do you suppose he really belongs to us you would think this was the first point to be settled in any book about him i have hunted all my books through and cant tell you how much he is our own or how far he is a traveler  and indeed are not all our ideas obscure about migration itself you are broadly told that a bird travels and how wonderful it is that it finds its way but you are scarcely ever told or led to think what it really travels forwhether for food for warmth or for seclusionand how the traveling is connected with its fixed home birds have not their town and country housestheir villas in italy and shooting boxes in scotland the country in which they build their nests is their proper homethe country that is to say in which they pass the spring and summer then they go south in the winter for food and warmth but in what lines and by what stages the general definition of a migrant in this hemisphere is a bird that goes north to build its nest and south for the winter but then the one essential point to know about it is the breadth and latitude of the zone it properly inhabitsthat is to say in which it builds its nest next its habits of life and extent and line of southing in the winter and finally its manner of traveling  17 now here is this entirely familiar bird the robin quite the first thing that strikes me about it looking at it as a painter is the small effect it seems to have had on the minds of the southern nations i trace nothing of it definitely either in the art or literature of greece or italy i find even no definite name for it you dont know if lesbias passer had a red breast or a blue or a brown and yet mr gould says it is abundant in all parts of europe in all the islands of the mediterranean and in madeira and the azores and then he saysnow notice the puzzle of thisin many parts of the continent it is a migrant and contrary to what obtains with us is there treated as a vagrant for there is scarcely a country across the water in which it is not shot down and eaten  in many parts of the continent it is a migrant in what partshow farin what manner  18 in none of the old natural history books can i find any account of the robin as a traveler but there is for once some sufficient reason for their reticence he has a curious fancy in his manner of traveling of all birds you would think he was likely to do it in the cheerfulest way and he does it in the saddest do you chance to have read in the life of charles dickens how fond he was of taking long walks in the night and alone the robin en voyage is the charles dickens of birds he always travels in the night and alone rests in the day wherever day chances to find him sings a little and pretends he hasnt been anywhere he goes as far in the winter as the northwest of africa and in lombardy arrives from the south early in march but does not stay long going on into the alps where he prefers wooded and wild districts so at least says my lombard informant  i do not find him named in the list of cretan birds but even if often seen his dim red breast was little likely to make much impression on the greeks who knew the flamingo and had made it under the name of phoenix or phoenicopterus the center of their myths of scarlet birds they broadly embraced the general aspect of the smaller and more obscure species under the term greek xonthos which as i understand their use of it exactly implies the indescribable silky brown the groundwork of all other color in so many small birds which is indistinct among green leaves and absolutely identifies itself with dead ones or with mossy stems  19 i think i show it you more accurately in the robins back than i could in any other bird its mode of transition into more brilliant color is in him elementarily simple and although there is nothing or rather because there is nothing in his plumage of interest like that of tropical birds or even of our own gamebirds i think it will be desirable for you to learn first from the breast of the robin what a feather is once knowing that thoroughly we can further learn from the swallow what a wing is from the chough what a beak is and from the falcon what a claw is  i must take care however in neither of these last two particulars to do injustice to our little english friend here and before we come to his feathers must ask you to look at his bill and his feet  20 i do not think it is distinctly enough felt by us that the beak of a bird is not only its mouth but its hand or rather its two hands for as its arms and hands are turned into wings all it has to depend upon in economical and practical life is its beak the beak therefore is at once its sword its carpenters toolbox and its dressingcase partly also its musical instrument all this besides its function of seizing and preparing the food in which functions alone it has to be a trap carvingknife and teeth all in one  21 it is this need of the beaks being a mechanical tool which chiefly regulates the form of a birds face as opposed to a fourfooted animals if the question of food were the only one we might wonder why there were not more fourfooted creatures living on seeds than there are or why those that dofieldmice and the likehave not beaks instead of teeth but the fact is that a birds beak is by no means a perfect eating or foodseizing instrument a squirrel is far more dexterous with a nut than a cockatoo and a dog manages a bone incomparably better than an eagle but the beak has to do so much more pruning feathers building nests and the incessant discipline in military arts are all to be thought of as much as feeding  soldiership especially is a much more imperious necessity among birds than quadrupeds neither lions nor wolves habitually use claws or teeth in contest with their own species but birds for their partners their nests their huntinggrounds and their personal dignity are nearly always in contention their courage is unequaled by that of any other race of animals capable of comprehending danger and their pertinacity and endurance have in all ages made them an example to the brave and an amusement to the base among mankind  22 nevertheless since as sword as trowel or as pocketcomb the beak of the bird has to be pointed the collection of seeds may be conveniently intrusted to this otherwise penetrative instrument and such food as can only be obtained by probing crevices splitting open fissures or neatly and minutely picking things up is allotted preeminently to the bird species  the food of the robin as you know is very miscellaneous linnæus says of the swedish one that it is delectatus euonymi baccisdelighted with dogwood berriesthe dogwood growing abundantly in sweden as once in forfarshire where it grew though only a bush usually in the south with trunks a foot or eighteen inches in diameter and the tree thirty feet high but the swedish robins taste for its berries is to be noted by you because first the dogwood berry is commonly said to be so bitter that it is not eaten by birds loudon arboretum ii 497 1 and secondly because it is a pretty coincidence that this most familiar of household birds should feed fondly from the tree which gives the housewife her spindlethe proper name of the dogwood in english french and german being alike spindletree it feeds however with us certainly most on worms and insects i am not sure how far the following account of its mode of dressing its dinners may be depended on i take it from an old book on natural history but find it more or less confirmed by others it takes a worm by one extremity in its beak and beats it on the ground till the inner part comes away then seizing it in a similar manner by the other end it entirely cleanses the outer part which alone it eats  ones first impression is that this must be a singularly unpleasant operation for the worm however fastidiously delicate and exemplary in the robin but i suppose the real meaning is that as a worm lives by passing earth through its body the robin merely compels it to quit thisnot illgotten indeed but now quite unnecessarywealth we human creatures who have lived the lives of worms collecting dust are served by death in exactly the same manner  23 you will find that the robins beak then is a very prettily representative one of general bird power as a weapon it is very formidable indeed he can kill an adversary of his own kind with one blow of it in the throat and is so pugnacious valde pugnax says linnæus ut non una arbor duos capiat erithacosno single tree can hold two cockrobins and for precision of seizure the little flat hook at the end of the upper mandible is one of the most delicately formed points of forceps which you can find among the grain eaters but i pass to one of his more special perfections  24 he is very notable in the exquisite silence and precision of his movements as opposed to birds who either creak in flying or waddle in walking always quiet says gould for the silkiness of his plumage renders his movements noiseless and the rustling of his wings is never heard any more than his tread on earth over which he bounds with amazing sprightliness you know how much importance i have always given among the fine arts to good dancing if you think of it you will find one of the robins very chief ingratiatory faculties is his dainty and delicate movementhis footing it featly here and there whatever prettiness there may be in his red breast at his brightest he can always be outshone by a brickbat but if he is rationally proud of anything about him i should think a robin must be proud of his legs hundreds of birds have longer and more imposing onesbut for real neatness finish and precision of action commend me to his fine little ankles and fine little feet this long stilted process as you know corresponding to our anklebone commend me i say to the robin for use of his ankleshe is of all birds the preeminent and characteristic hopper none other so light so pert or so swift  25 we must not however give too much credit to his legs in this matter a robins hop is half a flight he hops very essentially with wings and tail as well as with his feet and the exquisitely rapid opening and quivering of the tailfeathers certainly give half the force to his leap it is in this action that he is put among the motacillae or wagtails but the ornithologists have no real business to put him among them the swing of the long tail feathers in the true wagtail is entirely consequent on its motion not impulsive of itthe tremulous shake is after alighting but the robin leaps with wing tail and foot all in time and all helping each other leaps i say and you check at the word and ought to check you look at a bird hopping and the motion is so much a matter of course you never think how it is done but do you think you would find it easy to hop like a robin if you had twoall but woodenlegs like this  26 i have looked wholly in vain through all my books on birds to find some account of the muscles it uses in hopping and of the part of the toes with which the spring is given i must leave you to find out that for yourselves it is a little bit of anatomy which i think it highly desirable for you to know but which it is not my business to teach you only observe this is the point to be made out you leap yourselves with the toe and ball of the foot but in that power of leaping you lose the faculty of grasp on the contrary with your hands you grasp as a bird with its feet but you cannot hop on your hands a cat a leopard and a monkey leap or grasp with equal ease but the action of their paws in leaping is i imagine from the fleshy ball of the foot while in the bird characteristically greek gampsônux this fleshy ball is reduced to a boss or series of bosses and the nails are elongated into sickles or horns nor does the springing power seem to depend on the development of the bosses they are far more developed in an eagle than a robin but you know how unpardonably and preposterously awkward an eagle is when he hops when they are most of all developed the bird walks runs and digs well but leaps badly  27 i have no time to speak of the various forms of the ankle itself or of the scales of armor more apparent than real by which the foot and ankle are protected the use of this lecture is not either to describe or to exhibit these varieties to you but so to awaken your attention to the real points of character that when you have a birds foot to draw you may do so with intelligence and pleasure knowing whether you want to express force grasp or firm ground pressure or dexterity and tact in motion and as the actions of the foot and the hand in man are made by every great painter perfectly expressive of the character of mind so the expressions of rapacity cruelty or force of seizure in the harpy the gryphon and the hooked and clawed evil spirits of early religious art can only be felt by extreme attention to the original form  28 and now i return to our main question for the robins breast to answer what is a feather you know something about it already that it is composed of a quill with its lateral filaments terminating generally more or less in a point that these extremities of the quills lying over each other like the tiles of a house allow the wind and rain to pass over them with the least possible resistance and form a protection alike from the heat and the cold which in structure much resembling the scalearmor assumed by man for very different objects is in fact intermediate exactly between the fur of beasts and the scales of fishes having the minute division of the one and the armorlike symmetry and succession of the other  29 not merely symmetry observe but extreme flatness feathers are smoothed down as a field of corn by wind with rain only the swathes laid in beautiful order they are fur so structurally placed as to imply and submit to the perpetually swift forward motion in fact i have no doubt the darwinian theory on the subject is that the feathers of birds once stuck up all erect like the bristles of a brush and have only been blown flat by continual flying  nay we might even sufficiently represent the general manner of conclusion in the darwinian system by the statement that if you fasten a hairbrush to a millwheel with the handle forward so as to develop itself into a neck by moving always in the same direction and within continual hearing of a steamwhistle after a certain number of revolutions the hairbrush will fall in love with the whistle they will marry lay an egg and the produce will be a nightingale  30 whether however a hogs bristle can turn into a feather or not it is vital that you should know the present difference between them  the scientific people will tell you that a feather is composed of three partsthe down the laminæ and the shaft  but the commonsense method of stating the matter is that a feather is composed of two parts a shaft with lateral filaments for the greater part of the shafts length these filaments are strong and nearly straight forming by their attachment a finely warped sail like that of a windmill but towards the root of the feather they suddenly become weak and confusedly flexible and form the close down which immediately protects the birds body  to show you the typical arrangement of these parts i choose as i have said the robin because both in his power of flying and in his color he is a moderate and balanced birdnot turned into nothing but wings like a swallow or nothing but neck and tail like a peacock and first for his flying power there is one of the long feathers of robins wing and here fig 1 the analysis of its form  31 first in pure outline a seen from above it is very nearly a long oval but with this peculiarity that it has as it were projecting shoulders at a 1 and a 2 i merely desire you to observe this in passing because one usually thinks of the contour as sweeping unbroken from the root to the point i have not time today to enter on any discussion of the reason for it which will appear when we examine the placing of the wing feathers for their stroke  now i hope you are getting accustomed to the general method in which i give you the analysis of all formsleaf or feather or shell or limb first the plan then the profile then the crosssection  i take next the profile of my feather b fig 1 and find that it is twisted as the sail of a windmill is but more distinctly so that you can always see the upper surface of the feather at its root and the under at its end every primary wingfeather in the fine flyers is thus twisted and is best described as a sail striking with the power of a cimeter but with the flat instead of the edge  illustration fig 1  twice the size of reality  a  a 1  a 2  b  32 further you remember that on the edges of the broad side of feathers you find always a series of undulations irregularly sequent and lapping over each other like waves on sand you might at first imagine that this appearance was owing to a slight ruffling or disorder of the filaments but it is entirely normal and i doubt not so constructed in order to insure a redundance of material in the plume so that no accident or pressure from wind may leave a gap anywhere how this redundance is obtained you will see in a moment by bending any feather the wrong way bend for instance this plume b fig 2 into the reversed curve a fig 2 then all the filaments of the plume become perfectly even and there are no waves at the edge but let the plume return into its proper form b and the tissue being now contracted into a smaller space the edge waves are formed in it instantly  illustration fig 2  a  b  hitherto i have been speaking only of the filaments arranged for the strength and continuity of the energetic plume they are entirely different when they are set together for decoration instead of force after the feather of the robins wing let us examine one from his breast  33 i said just now he might be at once outshone by a brickbat indeed the day before yesterday sleeping at lichfield and seeing the first thing when i woke in the morning for i never put down the blinds of my bedroom windows the not uncommon sight in an english country town of an entire housefront of very neat and very flat and very red bricks with very exactly squared square windows in it and not feeling myself in anywise gratified or improved by the spectacle i was thinking how in this as in all other good the too much destroyed all the breadth of a robins breast in brickred is delicious but a whole housefront of brickred as vivid is alarming and yet one cannot generalize even that trite moral with any safetyfor infinite breadth of green is delightful however green and of sea or sky however blue  you must note however that the robins charm is greatly helped by the pretty space of gray plumage which separates the red from the brown back and sets it off to its best advantage there is no great brilliancy in it even so relieved only the finish of it is exquisite  34 if you separate a single feather you will find it more like a transparent hollow shell than a feather so delicately rounded the surface of itgray at the root where the down istinged and only tinged with red at the part that overlaps and is visible so that when three or four more feathers have overlapped it again all together with their joined red are just enough to give the color determined upon each of them contributing a tinge there are about thirty of these glowing filaments on each side the whole being no larger across than a wellgrown currant and each of these is itself another exquisite feather with central quill and lateral webs whose filaments are not to be counted  the extremity of these breast plumes parts slightly into two as you see in the peacocks and many other such decorative ones the transition from the entirely leaflike shape of the active plume with its oblique point to the more or less symmetrical dualism of the decorative plume corresponds with the change from the pointed green leaf to the dual or heartshaped petal of many flowers i shall return to this part of our subject having given you i believe enough of detail for the present  35 i have said nothing today of the mythology of the bird though i told you that would always be for us the most important part of its natural history but i am obliged sometimes to take what we immediately want rather than what ultimately we shall need chiefly in the second place you probably most of you know more of the mythology of the robin than i do for the stories about it are all northern and i know scarcely any myths but the italian and greek you will find under the name robin in miss yonges exhaustive and admirable history of christian names the various titles of honor and endearment connected with him and with the general idea of rednessfrom the bishop called bright red fame who founded the first great christian church on the rhine i am afraid of your thinking i mean a pun in connection with robins if i tell you the locality of it down through the hoods and roys and grays to robin goodfellow and spensers hobbinol and our modern hobjoining on to the goblin which comes from the old greek greek kobalos but i cannot let you go without asking you to compare the english and french feeling about small birds in chaucers time with our own on the same subject i say english and french because the original french of the romance of the rose shows more affection for birds than even chaucers translation passionate as he is always in love for any one of his little winged brothers or sisters look however either in the french or english at the description of the coming of the god of love leading his caroldance in the garden of the rose  his dress is embroidered with figures of flowers and of beasts but about him fly the living birds the french is      il etoit tout convert doisiaulx     de rossignols et de papegaux     de calendre et de mesangel     il semblait que ce fut une angle     qui fuz tout droit venuz du ciel  36 there are several points of philology in this transitional french and in chaucers translation which it is well worth your patience to observe the monkish latin angelus you see is passing through the very unpoetical form angle into ange but in order to get a rhyme with it in that angular form the french troubadour expands the birds name mesange quite arbitrarily into mesangel then chaucer not liking the mes at the beginning of the word changes that unscrupulously into arch and gathers in though too shortly a lovely bit from another place about the nightingales flying so close round loves head that they strike some of the leaves off his crown of roses so that the english runs thus      but nightingales a full great rout     that flien over his head about     the leaves felden as they flien     and he was all with birds wrien     with popinjay with nightingale     with chelaundre and with wodewale     with finch with lark and with archangel     he seemed as he were an angell     that down were comen from heaven clear  now when i first read this bit of chaucer without referring to the original i was greatly delighted to find that there was a bird in his time called an archangel and set to work with brightly hopeful industry to find out what it was i was a little discomfited by finding that in old botany the word only meant deadnettle but was still sanguine about my bird till i found the french form descend as you have seen into a mesangel and finally into mesange which is a provincialism from greek meion and means the smallest of birdsor specially herea titmouse i have seldom had a less expected or more ignominious fall from the clouds  37 the other birds named here and in the previous description of the garden are introduced as far as i can judge nearly at random and with no precision of imagination like that of aristophanes but with a sweet childish delight in crowding as many birds as possible into the smallest space the popinjay is always prominent and i want some of you to help me for i have not time at present for the chase in hunting the parrot down on his first appearance in europe just at this particular time he contested favor even with the falcon and i think it a piece of good fortune that i chanced to draw for you thinking only of its brilliant color the popinjay which carpaccio allows to be present on the grave occasion of st georges baptizing the princess and her father  38 and indeed as soon as the christian poets begin to speak of the singing of the birds they show themselves in quite a different mood from any that ever occurs to a greek aristophanes with infinitely more skill describes and partly imitates the singing of the nightingale but simply as beautiful sound it fills the thickets with honey and if in the oftenquotedjust because it is not characteristic of greek literaturepassage of the coloneus a deeper sentiment is shown that feeling is dependent on association of the birdvoices with deeply pathetic circumstances but this troubadour finds his heart in heaven by the power of the singing only      trop parfoisaient beau servise     ciz oiselles que je vous devise     il chantaient un chant ytel     com fussent angle esperitel  we want a moment more of wordchasing to enjoy this oiseau as you know comes from avis but it had at this time got oisel for its singular number of which the terminating sel confused itself with the selle from ancilla in domisella and demoiselle and the feminine form oiselle thus snatched for itself some of the delightfulness belonging to the title of a young lady then note that esperitel does not here mean merely spiritual because all angels are spiritual but an angle esperitel is an angel of the air so that in english we could only express the meaning in some such fashion as this      they perfected all their service of love     these maiden birds that i tell you of     they sang such a song so finishedfair     as if they were angels born of the air  39 such were the fancies then and the scenes in which englishmen took delight in chaucers time england was then a simple country we boasted for the best kind of riches our birds and trees and our wives and children we had now grown to be a rich one and our first pleasure is in shooting our birds but it has become too expensive for us to keep our trees lord derby whose crest is the eagle and childyou will find the northern name for it the bird and bantling made classical by scottis the first to propose that woodbirds should have no more nests we must cut down all our trees he says that we may effectively use the steamplow and the effect of the steamplow i find by a recent article in the cornhill magazine is that an english laborer must not any more have a nest nor bantlings neither but may only expect to get on prosperously in life if he be perfectly skillful sober and honest and dispenses at least until he is fortyfive with the luxury of marriage  40 gentlemen you may perhaps have heard me blamed for making no effort here to teach in the artisans schools but i can only say that since the future life of the english laborer or artisan summing the benefits to him of recent philosophy and economy is to be passed in a country without angels and without birds without prayers and without songs without trees and without flowers in a state of exemplary sobriety and extending the catholic celibacy of the clergy into celibacy of the laity in a state of dispensation with the luxury of marriage i do not believe he will derive either profit or entertainment from lectures on the fine arts     lecture ii8  the swallow   41 we are today to take note of the form of a creature which gives us a singular example of the unity of what artists call beauty with the fineness of mechanical structure often mistaken for it you cannot but have noticed how little during the years of my past professorship i have introduced any questions as to the nature of beauty i avoided them partly because they are treated of at length in my books and partly because they are in the last degree unpractical we are born to like or dislike certain aspects of things nor could i by any arguments alter the defined tastes which you received at your birth and which the surrounding circumstances of life have enforced without any possibility of your voluntary resistance to them and the result of those surrounding circumstances today is that most english youths would have more pleasure in looking at a locomotive than at a swallow and that many english philosophers would suppose the pleasure so received to be through a new sense of beauty but the meaning of the word beauty in the fine arts and in classical literature is properly restricted to those very qualities in which the locomotion of a swallow differs from that of an engine        8 delivered at oxford may 2d 1873  42 not only from that of an engine but also from that of animals in whose members the mechanism is so complex as to give them a resemblance to engines the dart of the common housefly for instance in full strength is a more wonderful movement than that of a swallow the mechanism of it is not only more minute but the swiftness of the action so much greater that the vibration of the wing is invisible but though a schoolboy might prefer the locomotive to the swallow he would not carry his admiration of finely mechanical velocity into unqualified sympathy with the workmanship of the god of ekron and would generally suppose that flies were made only to be food for the more graceful flycatcherwhose finer grace you will discover upon reflection to be owing to the very moderation and simplicity of its structure and to the subduing of that infinitude of joints claws tissues veins and fibers which inconceivably vibrate in the microscopic9 creatures motion to a quite intelligible and simple balance of rounded body upon edged plume maintained not without visible and sometimes fatigued exertion and raising the lower creature into fellowship with the volition and the virtue of humanity        9 i call it so because the members and action of it cannot be       seen with the unaided eye  43 with the virtue i say in an exceedingly qualified sense meaning rather the strength and art displayed in overcoming difficulties than any distinct morality of disposition the bird has kindly and homely qualities but its principal virtue for us is its being an incarnate voracity and that it moves as a consuming and cleansing power you sometimes hear it said of a humane person that they would not kill a fly from 700 to 1000 flies a day are a moderate allowance for a baby swallow  44 perhaps as i say this it may occur to some of you to think for the first time of the reason of the birds name for it is very interesting as a piece of language study to consider the different power on our mindsnay the different sweetness to the earwhich from association these same two syllables receive when we read them as a noun or as a verb also the word is a curious instance of the traps which are continually open for rash etymologists at first nothing would appear more natural than that the name should have been given to the bird from its reckless function of devouring but if you look to your johnson you will find to your better satisfaction that the name means bird of porticos or porches from the gothic swale subdivaleso that he goes back in thought as far as virgils et nunc porticibus vacuis nunc humida circum stagna sonat notice in passing how a simile of virgils or any other great masters will probably tell in two or more ways at once juturna is compared to the swallow not merely as winding and turning swiftly in her chariot but as being a waternymph by birthstagnis quae fluminibusque sonoris praesidet how many different creatures in one the swallow is by birth as a virgilian simile is many thoughts in one it would take many more lectures than one to show you clearly but i will indicate them with such rough sketch as is possible  45 it belongs as most of you know to a family of birds called fissirostres or literally splitbeaks split heads would be a better term for it is the enormous width of mouth and power of gaping which the epithet is meant to express a dull sermon for instance makes half the congregation fissirostres the bird however is most vigilant when its mouth is widest for it opens as a net to catch whatever comes in its wayhence the french giving the whole family the more literal name gobbleflygobemouche extend the term to the openmouthed and too acceptant appearance of a simpleton  46 partly in order to provide for this width of mouth but more for the advantage in flight the head of the swallow is rounded into a bullet shape and sunk down on the shoulders with no neck whatever between so as to give nearly the aspect of a conical rifle bullet to the entire front of the body and indeed the bird moves more like a bullet than an arrowdependent on a certain impetus of weight rather than on sharp penetration of the air i say dependent on but i have not yet been able to trace distinct relation between the shapes of birds and their powers of flight i suppose the form of the body is first determined by the general habits and food and that nature can make any form she chooses volatile only one point i think is always notable that a complete master of the art of flight must be shortnecked so that he turns altogether if he turns at all you dont expect a swallow to look round a corner before he goes round it he must take his chance the main point is that he may be able to stop himself and turn in a moment  47 the stopping on any terms is difficult enough to understand nor less so the original gaining of the pace we always think of flight as if the main difficulty of it were only in keeping up in the airbut the buoyancy is conceivable enough the far more wonderful matter is the getting along you find it hard work to row yourself at anything like speed though your impulsestroke is given in a heavy element and your returnstroke in a light one but both in birds and fishes the impelling stroke and its return are in the same element and if for the bird that medium yields easily to its impulses it secedes as easily from the blow that gives it and if you think what an effort you make to leap six feet with the earth for a fulcrum the dart either of a trout or a swallow with no fulcrum but the water and air they penetrate will seem to you i think greatly marvelous yet of the mode in which it is accomplished you will as yet find no undisputed account in any book on natural history and scarcely as far as i know definite notice even of the rate of flight what do you suppose it is we are apt to think of the migration of a swallow as we should ourselves of a serious journey how long do you think it would take him if he flew uninterruptedly to get from here to africa  48 michelet gives the rate of his flight at full speed of course as eighty leagues an hour i find no more sound authority but do not doubt his approximate accuracy10 still how curious and how provoking it is that neither white of selborne bewick yarrell nor gould says a word about this one should have thought the most interesting power of the bird11        10 i wrote this some time ago and the endeavors i have since       made to verify statements on points of natural history which i       had taken on trust have given me reason to doubt everybodys       accuracy the ordinary flight of the swallow does not assuredly       even in the dashes reach anything like this speed        11 incidentally suggestive sentences occur in the history of       selborne but its author never comes to the point in this case  taking michelets estimateeighty french leagues roughly two hundred and fifty miles an hourwe have a thousand miles in four hours that is to say leaving devonshire after an early breakfast he could be in africa to lunch  49 he could i say if his flight were constant but though there is much inconsistency in the accounts the sum of testimony seems definite that the swallow is among the most fatiguable of birds when the weather is hazy i quote yarrell they will alight on fishingboats a league or two from land so tired that when any one tries to catch them they can scarcely fly from one end of the boat to the other  i have no time to read to you the interesting evidence on this point given by yarrell but only that of the brother of white of selborne at gibraltar my brother has always found he himself writes that some of his birds and particularly the swallow kind are very sparing of their pains in crossing the mediterranean for when arrived at gibraltar they do not set forth their airy caravan high over seas but scout and hurry along in little detached parties of six or seven in a company and sweeping low just over the surface of the land and water direct their course to the opposite continent at the narrowest passage they can find  50 you will observe however that it remains an open question whether this fear of sea may not be in the swallow like ours of the desert the commissariat department is a serious one for birds that eat a thousand flies a day when just out of the egg and it is possible that the weariness of swallows at sea may depend much more on fasting than flying captain or admiral sir charles wager says that one springtime as he came into soundings in the english channel a great flock of swallows came and settled on all his rigging every rope was covered they hung on one another like a swarm of bees even the decks were filled with them they seemed almost famished and spent and were only feathers and bone but being recruited with a nights rest took their flight in the morning  51 now i detain you on this point somewhat because it is intimately connected with a more important one i told you we should learn from the swallow what a wing was few other birds approach him in the beauty of it or apparent power and yet after all this care taken about it he gets tired and instead of flying as we should do in his place all over the world and tasting the flavor of the midges in every marsh which the infinitude of human folly has left to breed gnats instead of growing cornhe is of all birds characteristically except when he absolutely cant help it the stayer at home and contentedly lodges himself and his family in an old chimney when he might be flying all over the world  at least you would think if he built in an english chimney this year he would build in a french one next but no michelet prettily says of him he is the bird of return if you will only treat him kindly year after year he comes back to the same niche and to the same hearth for his nest  to the same niche and builds himself an opaque walled house within that think of this a little as if you heard of it for the first time  52 suppose you had never seen a swallow but that its general habit of life had been described to you and you had been asked how you thought such a bird would build its nest a creature observe whose life is to be passed in the air whose beak and throat are shaped with the fineness of a net for the catching of gnats and whose feet in the most perfect of the species are so feeble that it is called the footless swallow and cannot stand a moment on the ground with comfort of all land birds the one that has least to do with the earth of all the least disposed and the least able to stop to pick anything up what will it build with gossamer we should saythistledownanything it can catch floating like flies  but it builds with stiff clay  53 and observe its chosen place for building also you would think by its play in the air that not only of all birds but of all creatures it most delighted in space and freedom you would fancy its notion of the place for a nest would be the openest field it could find that anything like confinement would be an agony to it that it would almost expire of horror at the sight of a black hole  and its favorite home is down a chimney  54 not for your hearths sake nor for your companys do not think it the bird will love you if you treat it kindly is as frank and friendly as bird can be but it does not more than others seek your society it comes to your house because in no wild wood nor rough rock can it find a cavity close enough to please it it comes for the blessedness of imprisonment and the solemnity of an unbroken and constant shadow in the tower or under the eaves  do you suppose that this is part of its necessary economy and that a swallow could not catch flies unless it lived in a hole  not so this instinct is part of its brotherhood with another race of creatures it is given to complete a mesh in the reticulation of the orders of life  55 i have already given you several reasons for my wish that you should retain in classifying birds the now rejected order of picae i am going to read you a passage from humboldt which shows you what difficulties one may get into for want of it  you will find in the second volume of his personal narrative an account of the cave of caripe in new andalusia which is inhabited by entirely nocturnal birds having the gaping mouths of the goatsucker and the swallow and yet feeding on fruit  unless which mr humboldt does not tell us they sit under the trees outside in the night time and hold their mouths open for the berries to drop into there is not the smallest occasion for their having wide mouths like swallows still less is there any need since they are fruit eaters for their living in a cavern 1500 feet out of daylight they have only in consequence the trouble of carrying in the seeds to feed their young and the floor of the cave is thus covered by the seeds they let fall with a growth of unfortunate pale plants which have never seen day nay they are not even content with the darkness of their cave but build their nests in the funnels with which the roof of the grotto is pierced like a sieve live actually in the chimney not of a house but of an egyptian sepulcher the color of this bird of so remarkable taste in lodging humboldt tells us is of dark bluishgray mixed with streaks and specks of black large white spots which have the form of a heart and which are bordered with black mark the head the wings and the tail the spread of the wings which are composed of seventeen or eighteen quill feathers is three feet and a half suppressing with mr cuvier the order of picae we must refer this extraordinary bird to the sparrows  56 we can only suppose that it must be to our popular sparrows what the swallow of the cinnamon country is to our subordinate swallow do you recollect the cinnamon swallows of herodotus who build their mudnests in the faces of the cliffs where dionusos was brought up and where nobody can get near them and how the cinnamon merchants fetch them joints of meat which the unadvised birds flying up to their nests with instead of cinnamonnest and all come down togetherthe original of sindbads valleyofdiamond story  57 well humboldt is reduced by necessities of recent classification to call a bird three feet and a half across the wings a sparrow i have no right to laugh at him for i am just going myself to call the cheerfulest and brightest of birds of the air an owl all these architectural and sepulchral habits these egyptian manners of the sandmartin digging caves in the sand and bordertroopers habits of the chimney swallow living in round towers instead of open air belonging to them as connected with the tribe of the falcons through the owls and not only so but with the mammalia through the bats a swallow is an emancipated owl and a glorified bat but it never forgets its fellowship with night  58 its ancient fellowship i had nearly written so natural is it to think of these similarlyminded creatures when the feelings that both show are evidently useless to one of them as if the inferior had changed into the higher the doctrine of development seems at first to explain all so pleasantly that the scream of consent with which it has been accepted by men of science and the shriller vociferation of the publics gregarious applause scarcely permit you the power of antagonistic reflection i must justify today in graver tone than usual the terms in which i have hitherto spokenit may have been thought with less than the due respect to my audienceof the popular theory  59 supposing that the octohedrons of galena of gold and of oxide of iron were endowed with powers of reproduction and perished at appointed dates of dissolution or solution you would without any doubt have heard it by this time asserted that the octohedric form which was common to all indicated their descent from a common progenitor and it would have been ingeniously explained to you how the angular offspring of this eightsided ancestor had developed themselves by force of circumstances into their distinct metallic perfections how the galena had become gray and brittle under prolonged subterranean heat and the gold yellow and ductile as it was rolled among the pebbles of ambercolored streams  60 by the denial to these structures of any individually reproductive energy you are forced to accept the inexplicable and why expect it to be otherwise than inexplicable fact of the formation of a series of bodies having very similar aspects qualities and chemical relations to other substances which yet have no connection whatever with each other and are governed in their relation with their native rocks by entirely arbitrary laws it has been the pride of modern chemistry to extricate herself from the vanity of the alchemist and to admit with resignation the independent though apparently fraternal natures of silver of lead of platinumaluminiumpotassium hence a rational philosophy would deduce the probability that when the arborescence of dead crystallization rose into the radiation of the living tree and sentient plume the splendor of nature in her more exalted power would not be restricted to a less variety of design and the beautiful caprice in which she gave to the silver its frost and to the opal its fire would not be subdued under the slow influences of accident and time when she wreathed the swan with snow and bathed the dove in iridescence that the infinitely more exalted powers of life must exercise more intimate influence over matter than the reckless forces of cohesionand that the loves and hatreds of the now conscious creatures would modify their forms into parallel beauty and degradation we might have anticipated by reason and we ought long since to have known by observation but this law of its spirit over the substance of the creature involves necessarily the indistinctness of its type and the existence of inferior and of higher conditions which whole eras of heroism and affectionwhole eras of misery and misconductconfirm into glory or confuse into shame collecting the causes of changed form in lower creatures by distress or by adaptationby the disturbance or intensifying of the parental strength and the native fortunethe wonder is not that species should sometimes be confused but that the greater number of them remain so splendidly so manifestly so eternally distinct and that the vile industries and vicious curiosities of modern science while they have robbed the fields of england of a thousand living creatures have not created in them one  61 but even in the paltry knowledge we have obtained what unanimity have wewhat security suppose any man of ordinary sense knowing the value of time and the relative importance of subjects of thought and that the whole scientific world was agog concerning the origin of species desired to know first of allwhat was meant by a species  he would naturally look for the definition of species first among the higher animals and expect it to be best defined in those which were best known and being referred for satisfaction to the 226th page of the first volume of mr darwins descent of man he would find this passage  man has been studied more carefully than any other organic being and yet there is the greatest possible diversity among capable judges whether he should be classed as a single species or race or as two virey as three jacquinot as four kant five blumenbach six buffon seven hunter eight agassiz eleven pickering fifteen bory st vincent sixteen desmoulins twentytwo morton sixty crawford or as sixtythree according to burke  and in the meantime while your men of science are thus vacillating in the definition of the species of the only animal they have the opportunity of studying inside and out between one and sixtythree and disputing about the origin in past ages of what they cannot define in the present ones and deciphering the filthy heraldries which record the relation of humanity to the ascidian and the crocodile you have ceased utterly to distinguish between the two species of man evermore separate by infinite separation of whom the one capable of loyalty and of love can at least conceive spiritual natures which have no taint from their own and leave behind them diffused among thousands on earth the happiness they never hoped for themselves in the skies and the other capable only of avarice hatred and shame who in their lives are the companions of the swine and leave in death nothing but food for the worm and the vulture  62 now i have first traced for you the relations of the creature we are examining to those beneath it and above to the bat and to the falcon but you will find that it has still others to entirely another world as you watch it glance and skim over the surface of the waters has it never struck you what relation it bears to the creatures that glance and glide under their surface flycatchers some of them alsoflycatchers in the same manner with wide mouth while in motion the bird almost exactly combines the dart of the trout with the dash of the dolphin to the rounded forehead and projecting muzzle of which its own bullet head and bill exactly correspond in its plunge if you watch it bathing you may see it dip its breast just as much under the water as a porpoise shows its back above you can only rightly describe the bird by the resemblances and images of what it seems to have changed fromthen adding the fantastic and beautiful contrast of the unimaginable change it is an owl that has been trained by the graces it is a bat that loves the morning light it is the aërial reflection of a dolphin it is the tender domestication of a trout  63 and yet be assured as it cannot have been all these creatures so it has never in truth been any of them the transformations believed in by the mythologists are at least spiritually true you cannot too carefully trace or too accurately consider them but the transformations believed in by the anatomist are as yet proved true in no single instance and in no substance spiritual or material and i cannot too often or too earnestly urge you not to waste your time in guessing what animals may once have been while you remain in nearly total ignorance of what they are  64 do you even know distinctly from each otherfor that is the real naturalists business instead of confounding them with each otherdo you know distinctly the five great species of this familiar birdthe swallow the housemartin the sandmartin the swift and the alpine swiftor can you so much as answer the first question which would suggest itself to any careful observer of the form of its most familiar speciesyet which i do not find proposed far less answered in any scientific booknamely why a swallow has a swallowtail  it is true that the tail feathers in many birds appear to be entirelyeven cumbrously decorative as in the peacock and birds of paradise but i am confident that it is not so in the swallow and that the forked tail so defined in form and strong in plume has indeed important functions in guiding the flight yet notice how surrounded one is on all sides with pitfalls for the theorists the forked tail reminds you at once of a fishs and yet the action of the two creatures is wholly contrary a fish lashes himself forward with his tail and steers with his fins a swallow lashes himself forward with his fins and steers with his tail partly not necessarily because in the most dashing of the swallows the swift the fork of the tail is the least developed and i never watch the bird for a moment without finding myself in some fresh puzzle out of which there is no clue in the scientific books i want to know for instance how the bird turns what does it do with one wing what with the other fancy the pace that has to be stopped the force of bridlehand put out in an instant fancy how the wings must bend with the strain what need there must be for the perfect aid and work of every feather in them there is a problem for you students of mechanicshow does a swallow turn  you shall see at all events to begin with today how it gets along  65 i say you shall see but indeed you have often seen and feltat least with your hands if not with your shoulderswhen you chanced to be holding the sheet of a sail  i have said that i never got into scrapes by blaming people wrongly but i often do by praising them wrongly i never praised without qualification but one scientific book in my life that i rememberthis of dr pettigrews on the wing12 and now i must qualify my praise considerably discovering when i examined the book farther that the good doctor had described the motion of a bird as resembling that of a kite without ever inquiring what in a bird represented that somewhat important part of a kite the string you will however find the book full of important observations and illustrated by valuable drawings but the point in question you must settle for yourselves and you easily may some of you perhaps knew in your time better than the doctor how a kite stopped but i do not doubt that a great many of you also know now what is much more to the purpose how a ship gets along i will take the simplest the most natural the most beautiful of sailsthe lateen sail of the mediterranean        12 on the physiology of wings transactions of the royal       society of edinburgh vol xxvi part ii i cannot sufficiently       express either my wonder or regret at the petulance in which men       of science are continually tempted into immature publicity by       their rivalship with each other page after page of this book       which slowly digested and taken counsel upon might have been a       noble contribution to natural history is occupied with dispute       utterly useless to the reader on the question of the priority of       the author by some months to a french savant in the statement       of a principle which neither has yet proved while page after       page is rendered worse than useless to the reader by the authors       passionate endeavor to contradict the ideas of unquestionably       previous investigators the problem of flight was to all serious       purpose solved by borelli in 1680 and the following passage is       very notable as an example of the way in which the endeavor to       obscure the light of former ages too fatally dims and distorts       that by which modern men of science walk themselves borelli       and all who have written since his time are unanimous in       affirming that the horizontal transference of the body of the       bird is due to the perpendicular vibration of the wings and to       the yielding of the posterior or flexible margins of the wings in       an upward direction as the wings descend i dr pettigrew       am however disposed to attribute it to the fact 1st that       the wings both when elevated and depressed leap forwards in       curves those curves uniting to form a continuous waved track       2d to the tendency which the body of the bird has to swing       forwards in a more or less horizontal direction when once set       in motion 3d to the construction of the wings they are       elastic helices or screws which twist and untwist while they       vibrate and tend to bear upwards and onwards any weight       suspended from them 4th to the action of the air on the       under surfaces of the wings 5th to the evervarying power       with which the wings are urged this being greatest at the       beginning of the downstroke and least at the end of the up one       6th to the contraction of the voluntary muscles and elastic       ligaments and to the effect produced by the various inclined       surfaces formed by the wings during their oscillations 7th       to the weight of the birdweight itself when acting upon       wings becoming a propelling power and so contributing to       horizontal motion        i will collect these seven reasons for the forward motion in the       gist of them which i have marked by italics that the reader may       better judge of their collective value the bird is carried       forward according to dr pettigrew        1 because its wings leap forward        2 because its body has a tendency to swing forward        3 because its wings are screws so constructed as to screw       upwards and onwards any body suspended from them        4 because the air reacts on the under surfaces of the wings        5 because the wings are urged with evervarying power        6 because the voluntary muscles contract        7 because the bird is heavy        what must be the general conditions of modern science when it is       possible for a man of great experimental knowledge and practical       ingenuity to publish nonsense such as this becoming to all       intents and purposes insane in the passion of his endeavor to       overthrow the statements of his rival had he merely taken       patience to consult any elementary scholar in dynamics he would       have been enabled to understand his own machines and develop       with credit to himself what had been rightly judged or noticed       by others  66 i draw it rudely in outline as it would be set for a sidewind on the boat you probably know bestthe boat of burden on the lake of geneva fig 3 not confusing the drawing by adding the mast which you know rakes a little carrying the yard across it a then with your permission i will load my boat thus with a few casks of vevay vintageand to keep them cool we will put an awning over them so b next as we are classical scholars instead of this rustic stern of the boat meant only to run easily on a flat shore we will give it an attic greek embolon c we have no business indeed yet to put an greek embolon on a boat of burden but i hope some day to see all our ships of war loaded with bread and wine instead of artillery then i shade the entire form c and lastly reflect it in the water dand you have seen something like that before besides a boat havent you  illustration fig 3  there is the gist of the whole business for you put in very small space with these only differences in a boat the air strikes the sail in a bird the sail strikes the air in a boat the force is lateral and in a bird downwards and it has its sail on both sides i shall leave you to follow out the mechanical problem for yourselves as far as the mere resolution of force is concerned my business as a painter is only with the exquisite organic weapon that deals with it  67 of which you are now to note farther that a bird is required to manage his wing so as to obtain two results with one blowhe has to keep himself up as well as to get along  but observe he only requires to keep himself up because he has to get along the buoyancy might have been given at once if nature had wanted that only she might have blown the feathers up with the hot air of the breath till the bird rose in air like a cork in water but it has to be not a buoyant cork but a buoyant bullet and therefore that it may have momentum for pace it must have weight to carry and to carry that weight the wings must deliver their blow with effective vertical as well as oblique force  here again you may take the matter in brief sum whatever is the ships loss is the birds gain whatever tendency the ship has to leeway is all given to the birds support so that every atom13 of force in the blow is of service        13 i dont know what word to use for an infinitesimal degree or       divided portion of force one cannot properly speak of a force       being cut into pieces but i can think of no other word than       atom  68 therefore you have to construct your organic weapon so that this absolutely and perfectly economized force may be distributed as the bird chooses at any moment that if it wants to rise it may be able to strike vertically more than obliquelyif the order is goahead that it may put the oblique screw on if it wants to stop in an instant that it may be able to throw its wings up full to the wind if it wants to hover that it may be able to lay itself quietly on the wind with its wings and tail or in calm air to regulate their vibration and expansion into tranquillity of gliding or of pausing power given the various proportions of weight and wing the conditions of possible increase of muscular force and quillstrength in proportion to size and the different objects and circumstances of flightyou have a series of exquisitely complex problems and exquisitely perfect solutions which the life of the youngest among you cannot be long enough to read through so much as once and of which the future infinitudes of human life however granted or extended never will be fatigued in admiration  69 i take the rude outline of sail in fig 3 and now considering it as a jib of one of our own sailing vessels slightly exaggerate the loops at the edge and draw curved lines from them to the opposite point fig 4 and i have a reptilian or dragons wing which would with some ramification of the supporting ribs become a bats or moths that is to say an extension of membrane between the ribs as in an umbrella which will catch the wind and flutter upon it like a leaf but cannot strike it to any purpose the flying squirrel drifts like a falling leaf the bat flits like a black rag torn at the edge to give power we must have plumes that can strike as with the flat of a swordblade and to give perfect power these must be laid over each other so that each may support the one below it i use the word below advisedly we have to strike down the lowest feather is the one that first meets the adverse force it is the one to be supported  illustration fig 4  now for the manner of the support you must all know well the look of the machicolated parapets in mediæval castles you know they are carried on rows of small projecting buttresses constructed so that though the uppermost stone farprojecting would break easily under any shock it is supported by the next below and so on down to the wall now in this figure i am obliged to separate the feathers by white spaces to show you them distinctly in reality they are set as close to each other as can be but putting them as close as i can you get a or b fig 5 for the rough section of the wing thick towards the birds head and curved like a sickle so that in striking down it catches the air like a reapinghook and in rising up it throws off the air like a penthouse  illustration fig 5  70 the stroke would therefore be vigorous and the recovery almost effortless were even the direction of both actually vertical but they are vertical only with relation to the birds body in space they follow the forward flight in a softly curved line the downward stroke being as effective as the bird chooses the recovery scarcely encounters resistance in the softly gliding ascent thus in fig 5 i can only explain this to readers a little versed in the elements of mechanics if b is the locus of the center of gravity of the bird moving in slow flight in the direction of the arrow w is the locus of the leading feather of its wing and a and b roughly the successive positions of the wing in the downstroke and recovery  71 i say the downstroke is as effective as the bird chooses that is to say it can be given with exactly the quantity of impulse and exactly the quantity of supporting power required at the moment thus when the bird wants to fly slowly the wings are fluttered fast giving vertical blows if it wants to pause absolutely in still air this large birds cannot do not being able to move their wings fast enough the velocity becomes vibration as in the hummingbird but if there is wind any of the larger birds can lay themselves on it like a kite their own weight answering the purpose of the string14 while they keep the wings and tail in an inclined plane giving them as much gliding ascent as counteracts the fall they nearly all however use some slightly gliding force at the same time a single stroke of the wing with forward intent seeming enough to enable them to glide on for half a minute or more without stirring a plume a circling eagle floats an inconceivable time without visible stroke fancy the pretty action of the inner wing backing air instead of water which gives exactly the breadth of circle he chooses but for exhibition of the complete art of flight a swallow on rough water is the master of masters a seagull with all its splendid power generally has its work cut out for it and is visibly fighting but the swallow plays with wind and wave as a girl plays with her fan and there are no words to say how many things it does with its wings in any ten seconds and does consummately the mystery of its dart remains always inexplicable to me no eye can trace the bending of bow that sends that living arrow  but the main structure of the noble weapon we may with little pains understand        14 see app p 112 § 145  72 in the sections a and b of fig 5 i have only represented the quills of the outer part of the wing the relation of these and of the inner quills to the birds body may be very simply shown  fig 6 is a rude sketch typically representing the wing of any bird but actually founded chiefly on the seagulls  illustration fig 6  it is broadly composed of two fans a and b the outmost fan a is carried by the birds hand of which i rudely sketch the contour of the bones at a the innermost fan b is carried by the birds forearm from wrist to elbow b  the strong humerus c corresponding to our arm from shoulder to elbow has command of the whole instrument no feathers are attached to this bone but covering and protecting ones are set in the skin of it completely filling when the active wing is open the space between it and the body but the plumes of the two great fans a and b are set into the bones in fig 8 farther on are shown the projecting knobs on the main arm bone set for the reception of the quills which make it look like the club of hercules the connection of the still more powerful quills of the outer fan with the bones of the hand is quite beyond all my poor anatomical perceptions and happily for me also beyond needs of artistic investigation  73 the feathers of the fan a are called the primaries those of the fan b secondaries effective actions of flight whether for support or forward motion are i believe all executed with the primaries every one of which may be briefly described as the strongest cimeter that can be made of quill substance flexible within limits and elastic at its edgescarried by an elastic central shafttwisted like a windmill sailstriking with the flat and recovering with the edge  the secondary feathers are more rounded at the ends and frequently notched their curvature is reversed to that of the primaries they are arranged when expanded somewhat in the shape of a shallow cup with the hollow of it downwards holding the air therefore and aiding in all the pause and buoyancy of flight but little in the activity of it essentially they are the brooding and covering feathers of the wing exquisitely beautifulas far as i have yet seen most beautifulin the bird whose brooding is of most use to us and which has become the image of all tenderness how often would i have gathered thy children  and ye would not  74 over these two chief masses of the plume are set others which partly complete their power partly adorn and protect them but of these i can take no notice at present all that i want you to understand is the action of the two main masses as the wing is opened and closed  fig 7 roughly represents the upper surface of the main feathers of the wing closed the secondaries are folded over the primaries and the primaries shut up close with their outer edges parallel or nearly so fig 8 roughly shows the outline of the bones in this position of one of the larger pigeons15  illustration fig 7  illustration fig 8        15 i find even this mere outline of anatomical structure so       interferes with the temper in which i wish my readers to think       that i shall withdraw it in my complete edition  75 then fig 9 is always sketched in the roughest way the outer fig 10 the inner surface of a seagulls wing in this position next fig 11 shows the tops of the four lowest feathers in fig 9 in mere outline a separate pulled off so that they can be set side by side b shut up close in the folded wing c opened in the spread wing  illustration fig 9  illustration fig 10  illustration fig 11  76 and now if you will yourselves watch a few birds in flight or opening and closing their wings to prune them you will soon know as much as is needful for our art purposes and which is far more desirable feel how very little we know to any purpose of even the familiar creatures that are our companions  even what we have seen today16 is more than appears to have been noticed by the most careful painters of the great schools and you will continually fancy that i am inconsistent with myself in pressing you to learn better than they the anatomy of birds while i violently and constantly urge you to refuse the knowledge of the anatomy of men but you will find as my system develops itself that it is absolutely consistent throughout i dont mean by telling you not to study human anatomy that you are not to know how many fingers and toes you have nor how you can grasp and walk with them and similarly when you look at a bird i wish you to know how many claws and wingfeathers it has and how it grips and flies with them of the bones in either i shall show you little and of the muscles nothing but what can be seen in the living creature nor often even so much        16 large and somewhat carefully painted diagrams were shown at       the lecture which i cannot engrave but for my complete edition  77 and accordingly when i now show you this sketch of my favorite holbein and tell you that it is entirely disgraceful he should not know what a wing was better i dont mean that it is disgraceful he should not know the anatomy of it but that he should never have looked at it to see how the feathers lie  now holbein paints men gloriously but never looks at birds gibbons the woodcutter carves birds but cant menof the two faults the last is the worst but the right is in looking at the whole of nature in due comparison and with universal candor and tenderness  78 at the whole of nature i say not at supernatureat what you suppose to be above the visible nature about you if you are not inclined to look at the wings of birds which god has given you to handle and to see much less are you to contemplate or draw imaginations of the wings of angels which you cant see know your own world firstnot denying any other but being quite sure that the place in which you are now put is the place with which you are now concerned and that it will be wiser in you to think the gods themselves may appear in the form of a dove or a swallow than that by false theft from the form of dove or swallow you can represent the aspect of gods  79 one sweet instance of such simple conception in the end of the odyssey must surely recur to your minds in connection with our subject of today but you may not have noticed the recurrent manner in which homer insists on the thought when ulysses first bends and strings his bow the vibration of the chord is shrill like the note of a swallow a poor and unwarlike simile it seems but in the next book when ulysses stands with his bow lifted and telemachus has brought the lances and laid them at his feet and athena comes to his side to encourage himdo you recollect the gist of her speech you fought she says nine years for the sake of helen and for anothers housenow returned after all those wanderings and under your own roof for it and its treasures will you not fight then and she herself flies up to the houseroof and thence in the form of the swallow guides the arrows of vengeance for the violation of the sanctities of home  80 today then i believe verily for the first time i have been able to put before you some means of guidance to understand the beauty of the bird which lives with you in your own houses and which purifies for you from its insect pestilence the air that you breathe thus the sweet domestic thing has done for men at least these four thousand years she has been their companion not of the home merely but of the hearth and the threshold companion only endeared by departure and showing better her lovingkindness by her faithful return type sometimes of the stranger she has softened us to hospitality type always of the suppliant she has enchanted us to mercy and in her feeble presence the cowardice or the wrath of sacrilege has changed into the fidelities of sanctuary herald of our summer she glances through our days of gladness numberer of our years she would teach us to apply our hearts to wisdomand yet so little have we regarded her that this very day scarcely able to gather from all i can find told of her enough to explain so much as the unfolding of her wings i can tell you nothing of her lifenothing of her journeying i cannot learn how she builds nor how she chooses the place of her wandering nor how she traces the path of her return remaining thus blind and careless to the true ministries of the humble creature whom god has really sent to serve us we in our pride thinking ourselves surrounded by the pursuivants of the sky can yet only invest them with majesty by giving them the calm of the birds motion and shade of the birds plumeand after all it is well for us if when even for gods best mercies and in his temples marblebuilt we think that with angels and archangels and all the company of heaven we laud and magnify his glorious namewell for us if our attempt be not only an insult and his ears open rather to the inarticulate and unintended praise of the swallow twittering from her strawbuilt shed     lecture iii  the dabchicks   81 i believe that somewhere i have already observed but permit myself for immediate use to repeat what i cannot but think the sagacious observationthat the arrangement of any sort of animals must be to say the least imperfect if it be founded only on the characters of their feet and of all creatures one would think birds were those which continually dispensing with the use of their feet would require for their classification some attention also to be paid to their bodies and wingsnot to say their heads and tails nevertheless the ornithological arrangement at present in vogue may suffice for most scientific persons but in grouping birds so that the groups may be understood and remembered by children i must try to make them a little more generally descriptive  82 in talking of parrots for instance it is only a small part of the creatures nature which is told by its scientific name of scansor or climber that it only clutches with its claws and does not snatch or strike with themthat it helps itself about with its beak on branches or bars of cage in an absurd manner as if partly imagining itself hung up in a larder are by no means the most vital matters about the bird whereas that its beak is always extremely short and is bent down so roundly that the angriest parrot cannot peck but only bite if you give it a chance that it can bite pinch or otherwise apply the mechanism of a pair of nutcrackers from the back of its head with effect that it has a little black tongue capable of much talk above all that it is mostly gay in plumage often to vulgarity and always to pertnessall these characters should surely be represented to the apprehensive juvenile mind in sum and not merely the birds climbing qualities  83 again that the race of birds called in latin rasores do in the search for their food usually scratch and kick out their legs behind living for the most part in gravelly or littery places of which the hidden treasures are only to be discovered in that manner seems to me no supremely interesting custom of the animals life but only a manner of its household or threshold economy but that the tribe on the whole is unambitiously domestic and never predatory that they fly little and low eat much of what they can pick up without troubleand are themselves always excellent eatingyet so exemplary in their own domestic cares and courtesies that one is ashamed to eat them except in eggsthat their plumage is for the most part warm brown delicately and even bewitchingly spottyand that in the goodliest species the spots become variegated and inlaid as in a byzantine pavement deepening to imperial purple and azure and lightening into luster of innumerable eyesall this i hold very clearly and positively should be explained to children as a part of science quite as exact and infinitely more gracious than that which reckons up the whole tribe of loving and luminous creatures under the feebly descriptive term of scratchers  i will venture therefore to recommend my younger readers in classing birds to think of them literally from top to toefrom toe to top i should sayfoot body and head studying with the body the wings that bear it and with the head what brains it can bring to bear on practical matters and what sense on sentimental but indeed primarily you have to consider whether the bird altogether may not be little more than a fat cheerful little stomach in a spotted waistcoat and with legs to it that is the main definition of a great many birdsmeant to eat all day chiefly grubs or grainnot at all unless under wintry and calamitous conditions meant to fast painfully or be in concern about their food faultless in digestiondinner lasting all day long with the delight of social intercoursevarious chirp and chatter flying or fluttering in a practical not stately manner hopping and creeping intelligently sociable to man extremely building and nestling and rustling about himprying and speculating curiously watchful of him at his work if likely to be profitable to themselves or even sometimes in mere pitying sympathy and wonder how such a wingless and beakless creature can do anything17        17 compare paradise of birds song to the young roc page       67 and see close of lecture for notes on that book  84 the balance of this kind of bird on its legs is a very important part of itsdiagnosis we must have a fine word now and then its action on the wing is mere flutter or flirt in and out of the hedge or over it but its manner of perch or literally bienséance is admirable matter of interest so also in the birds which are on the water what these are on land picking up anything anywhere lazy and fortunate mostly themselves fat floating daintiest darlingstheir balance on the water also and under it in ducking a most essential part of their business and being  85 then directly opposed to these in both kinds you have the birds which must fast long and fly far and watch or fight for their food not stomachic in profile far from cheerful in disposition more or less lonely in habit or if gregarious out of the way of men the balance of these on the wing is no less essential a part of their picturing than that of the buntings robins and ducks on the foot or breast and therefore especially the position of the head in flying  86 accordingly for complete ornithology every bird must be drawn as every flower for good botany both in profile and looking down upon it but for the perchers the standing profile is the most essential and for the falcons and gulls the flying planthe outline of the bird as it would be seen looking down on it when its wings were fullspread  then in connection with these general outlines we want systematic plan and profile of the foot and head but since we cant have everything at once let us say the plan of the foot and profile of the head quite accurately given and for every bird consistently and to scale  profile and plan in outline then at least the head in light and shade from life so as to give the expression of the eye fallacious this latter often as an indication of character but deeply significant of habit and power thus the projecting full bead which enables the smaller birds to see the smallest insect or grain with good in it gives them much of their bright and often arch expression while the flattened iris under the beetling brow of the falconsprojecting not in frown but as roof to shade the eye from interfering skylightgives them their apparently threatening and ominous gaze the iris itself often wide and pale showing as a lurid saturnine ring under the shadow of the brow plumes  87 i speak of things that are to be very assuredly they will be done some daynot far off by painters educated as gentlemen in the strictest senseworking for love and truth and not for lust and gold much has already been done by good and earnest draughtsmen who yet had not received the higher painters education which would have enabled them to see the bird in the greater lights and laws of its form it is only here and there by dürer holbein carpaccio or other such men that we get a living bird rightly drawn18 but we may be greatly thankful for the unspared labor and attentive skill with which many illustrations of ornithology have been produced within the last seventy or eighty years far beyond rivalship among them stands le vaillants monograph or dualgraph on the birds of paradise and jays its plates exquisitely engraved and colored with unwearying care by hand are insuperable in plumetexture hue and actionspoiled in effect unhappily by the vulgar boughs for sustentation next ranks the recently issued history of the birds of lombardy the lithographs by herr oscar dressler superb but the coloring chromolithotint poor and then the selftaught but in some qualities greatly to be respected art of mr gould of which i would fain have spoken with gratitude and admiration in his lifetime had not i known that the qualified expressions necessary for true estimate of his published plates would have caused him more pain than any general praise could have counteracted or soothed without special criticism and rejoicing in all the pleasure which any of my young pupils may take in his drawingonly guarding them once for all against the error of supposing it exemplary as arti use his plates henceforward for general reference finding also that following mr goulds practical and natural arrangement i can at once throw together in groups easily comprehensible by british children all they are ever likely to see of british or britainvisitant birds which i find fall with frank casting into these following divisions not in any important matters varying from the usual ones and therefore less offensive i hope to the normal zoologist than my heresies in botany while yet they enable me to make what i have to say about our native birds more simply presentable to young minds19        18 the macaw in sir joshuas portrait of the countess of derby       is a grand example        19 see the notes on classification in the appendix to the       volume published together with the preface simultaneously with       this number  88  1 the hawks come first of course massed under the single latin term falco and next them       2 the owls second also of courseunmistakable these two tribes in all types of form and ways of living       3 the swallows i put next these being connected with the owls by the goatsucker and with the falcons by their flight       4 the pies next whose name has a curious double meaning derived partly from the notion of their being painted or speckled birds and partly from their being beyond all others pecking or pickaxbeaked birds they include therefore the crows jays and woodpeckers historically and practically a most important order of creatures to man next which i take the great company of the smaller birds of the dry land under these following more arbitrary heads       5 the songsters the thrush lark blackbird and nightingale and one or two choristers more these are connected with the pheasants in their speckledness and with the pies in pecking while the nightingale leads down to the smaller groups of familiar birds       6 the robins going on into the minor warblers and the wrens the essential character of a robin being that it should have some front red in its dress somewhere and the crossbills being included in the class partly because they have red in their dress and partly because i dont know where else to put them       7 the creepers and titsseparated chiefly on the ground of their minuteness and subtle little tricks and graces of movement       8 the sparrows going on into buntings and finches       9 the pheasants substituting this specific name for that of scratchers      10 the herons for the most part wading and fishing creatures but leading up to the stork and including any longlegged birds that run well such as the plovers      11 the dabchicksthe subject of our present chapter      12 the swans and geese      13 the ducks      14 the gulls  of these i take the dabchicks first for three sufficient reasonsthat they give us least troublethat they best show what i mean by broad principles of groupingand that they are the effective clasp if not center of all the series since they are the true link between land and water birds we will look at one or two of their leading examples before saying more of their position in birdsociety i shall give for the heading of each article the name which i propose for the bird in english childrens schoolsdameschools if possible a perfectly simple latin one and a familiar english one the varieties of existing nomenclature will be given in the appendix so far as i think them necessary to be known or remembered   i  merula fontium    torrentouzel  89 there are very few good popular words which do not unite two or more ideas being founded on one and catching up others as they go along thus i find dabchick to be a corruption of dipchick meaning birds that only dip and do not dive or even duck for any length of time but in its broader and customary use it takes up the idea of dabbling and as a classname stands for dabblingchick meaning a bird of small size that neither wades nor dives nor runs nor swims nor flies in a consistent manner but humorously dabbles or dips or flutters or trips or plashes or paddles and is always doing all manner of odd and delightful things being also very goodhumored and in consequence though graceful inclined to plumpness20 and though it never waddles sometimes for a minute or two toddles and now and then looks more like a ball than a bird for the most part being clever they are also brave and would be as tame as any other chickens if we would let them they are mostly shore birds living at the edge of irregularly broken water either streams or sea and the representative of the whole group with which we will begin is the mysterious little waterouzel or oiselle properly the waterblackbirdbuffons merle deaufor ouzel is the classic and poetic word for the blackbird or ouzelcock so black of hue in midsummer nights dream johnson gives it from the saxon osle but in chaucer it must be understood simply as the feminine of oiseau the bird in question might however be more properly called as bewick calls it water pyot or water magpie for only its back and wings are blackits head brown and breast snow white        20 or in french embonpoint  90 and now i must once for all get over a difficulty in the description of birds costume i can always describe the neckfeathers as such when birds have any neck to speak of but when as the majority of dabchicks they have not anyinstead of talking of throatfeathers and stomachfeathers which both seem to me rather ugly words i shall call the breast feathers the chemisette and all below them the bodice  i am now able without incivility to distinguish the two families of waterouzel both have white chemisettes but the common waterouzel cinclus aquaticus of gould has a white bodice and the other a black one the bird being called therefore in ugly greek melanogaster blackstomached the black bodice is norwegian fashionthe white english and i find that in switzerland there is an intermediate robinouzel with a red bodice but the ornithologists are at variance as to his specific existence the chemisette is always white  91 however dressed and wherever born the ouzel is essentially a mountaintorrent bird and bewick says may be seen perched on a stone in the midst of a stream in a continual dipping motion or short curtsey often repeated while it is watching for its food which consists of small fishes and insectswater insects that is to say caught mostly at the bottom manylegged and shrimpy things according to goulds plate the popular tradition that it can walk under the water has been denied by scientific people but there is no doubt whatever of the factsee the authentic evidence of it in the delightful little monograph of the bird published by the carlisle naturalists society but how the thing is done nobody but the ouzel knows its strong little feet indeed have plenty of grip in them but cannot lay hold of smooth stones and mr gould himself does not solve the problem some assert that it is done by clinging to the pebbles with its strong claws others by considerable exertion and a rapid movement of the wings its silky plumage is impervious to wet and hence when the bird returns to the surface the pearly drops which roll off into the stream are the only evidence of its recent submersion it is indeed very interesting to observe this pretty bird walk down a stone quietly descend into the water rise again perhaps at a distance of several yards down the stream and fly21 back to the place it had just left to perform the same maneuver the next minute the silence of the interval broken by its cheerful warbling song        21 wing its way in the ornithological language i shall take       leave usually to substitute the vulgar word fly for this       poetical phrase  92 in which you see we have the reason for its being called waterblackbird being i think the only one of the dabchicks that really sings some of the others sandpipers pipe and others the stints say stint in a charming manner but none of them sing except the oiselle very singularly the blackbodiced one seems to like living near manufactories the specimen in the norwich museum says mr gould is the one mentioned by mr lubbock in 1845 as lately shot at hellesdon mills and two others are stated by the same author to have been seen at different times by trustworthy observers at marlingford and saxthorpe of more recent occurrence i may mention a male in my own collection which was brought to me in the flesh having been shot in november 1855 whilst hovering over the river between the foundry bridge and the ferry it is not a little singular that a bird so accustomed to the clear running streams of the north and the quiet haunts of the silent angler should be found as in this case almost within the walls of the city sporting over a river turbid and discolored from the neighboring factories and with the busy noise of traffic on every side about the same time that this bird appeared near the city three others were observed on more than one occasion on the earlham river by mr fountaine of easton who is well acquainted with our british birds but these suddenly disappeared and were not seen again  and all will disappear and never be seen again but in skeleton illcovered with camphorated rags of skin under the present scientific dispensation unless some kindhearted northern squire will let them have the run and the dip of his brooks and teach the village children to let them alone if they like to wade down to the village  i am sixtytwo and have passed as much time out of those years by torrent sides as most people but i have never seen a waterouzel alive   ii  allegretta nymphÆa    lilyouzel  93 we have got so far by help of our first example in the etymology of our entire class as to rest in the easily memorable root dab short for dabble as the foundation of comprehensive nomenclature but the earlier if not aryan root dip must be taken good heed to also because as we further study the customs of aquatic chickens we shall find that they really mass themselves under the three great heads of duckers birds that duck their heads only and stick up their tails in the airdippers birds that take real dips under but not far down in shallow water mostly for things at the bottom or else to get out of harms way staying down about as long as we could ourselves if we were used to itand divers who plunge like stones when they choosecan go nobody knows how deep in the deep seaand swim under the water just as comfortably as upon it and as fast if not faster  but although this is clearly the practical and poetical division we cant make it a scientific one for the dippers and dabblers are so like each other that we must take them together and so also the duckers and divers are inseparable in some of their forms so that for convenience of classing we must keep to the still more general rank i have givendabchick duck and gullthe last being essentially the aerial seabird which lives on the wing  94 but there is yet one more mode of motion to be thought of in the class we are now examining several of them ought really to be described not as dipchicks but as tripchicks being as far as i can make out little in the habit of going under water but much in the habit of walking or tripping daintily over it on such raft or float as they may find constructed for them by waterlily or other buoyant leaves of these come and trip it as you come chicksmy emendation of milton is surely more reasonable than the emendations of commentators as a body for we do not any of us like to see our mistresses trip it as they gothere are i find pictured by mr gould three species called by him porzana minuta olivaceous crake porzana pygmæa baillons crake and porzana maruetta spotted crake  now in the first place i find porzana to be indeed italian for waterhen but i cant find its derivation and in the second place these little birds are neither waterhens nor moorhens nor watercocks nor moorcocks neither can i find either in gould yarrell or bewick the slightest notice of their voicesthough it is only in implied depreciation of their quality that we have any business to call them crakes croaks or creaks in the third place olivaceous is not a translation of minuta nor baillons of pygmæa nor spotted of maruetta which last is another of the words that mean nothing in any language that i know of though the french have adopted it as marouette and in the fourth place i cant make out any difference either in text or picture between mr baillons crake and the minute one except that the minute one is the bigger and has fewer white marks in the center of the back  95 for our purposes therefore i mean to call all the three varieties neither crake nor porzan but allegretta which will at once remind us of their motion the larger one nine inches long i find called always spotted crake so that shall be allegretta maculata spotty allegret and the two little ones shall be one the tiny allegret and the other the starry allegret allegretta minuta and allegretta stellaris all the three varieties being generally thought of by the plain english name i have given at the head of this section lilyouzel see in § 7 page 5 the explanation of my system of dual epithet and its limitations i note briefly what may be properly considered distinctive in the three kinds   iia  allegretta nymphÆa maculata    spotted allegret  96 watercrake or skitty of bewickfrench poule deau marouette we may perhaps take marouette as euphonious for maculata but i wish i knew what it meantthough so light of foot flies heavily and when compelled to take wing merely passes over the tops of the reeds to some place of security a short distance off gould the body is in all these rails compressed yarrellhe means laterally thin which enables them to make their way through dense herbage with facility i cant find anything clear about its country except that it occasionally visits sweden in summer and smyrna in winter and that it has been found in corfu sicily cretewhittlesea mereand yarley fenin marshes always wherever it is nothing said of its behavior on ice and not generally found farther north than cumberland its food is rather nastywaterslugs and the likebut it is itself as fat as an ortolan almost melts in the hand gould its own color brown spotted with white the spots on the wing coverts surrounded with black which gives them a studded or pearly appearance bewickhe means by pearly rounded or projecting hence my specific epithet its young are of the liveliest black little balls of black glistening down beautifully put by mr gould among the white water crowfoot ranunculus aquatilis looking like little ducklings in mourning its nest is made of rushes and other buoyant materials matted together so as to float on and rise or fall with the ebbing or flowing of the water like a boat and to prevent its being carried away it is moored or fastened to a reed bewick   iib  allegretta nymphÆa stellaris    starry allegret  97 called stellaris by temmincki do not find why but it is by much the brightest in color of the three and may be thought of as the star of them gould says it is the least also and calls it the pigmy but we cant keep that name without confusing it with the minuta baillons crake seems the most commonly accepted titleas the worst possible both this and the more quietly toned tiny in mr goulds delightful plates of them have softly brown backs exquisitely ermined by black markings at the root of each feather following into series of small waves like little breakers on sand they have lovely gray chemisettes striped gray bodices and green bills and feet a little orange stain at the root of the green bill and the bright red iris of the eye have wonderful effect in warming the color of the whole bird and with beautiful fancy mr gould has put the stellaris among yellow waterlilies to set off its gray and a yellow butterfly with blue and red spots and blackspeckled wings papilio machaon to harmonize both it is just as if the flower were gradually turning into the bird examples of the starry allegret have been obtainedin the british islands it is said to be numerous unobtained in india china japan persia greece north africa italy and france i have never heard of anybodys seeing it however   iic  allegretta nymphÆa minuta    tiny allegret  98 tiny allegretyarrells little crake but see names in appendix it is a little more rosy than stellaris in the gray of its neck passing into brown and mr gould has put it with a pink water plant which harmonizes with it to the birds advantage while the tiny creature stands on the bent leaf of a reed and scarcely bends it more it runs with rapidity over broken reeds and moves gracefully raising and displaying its tail at every step it has so very small a tail to display however that i should hardly think the display was worth while it is very cunning and especially noticeable for the subtlety with which it wearies the dog of the sportsman by executing a thousand evolutions with surprising celerity whence comes the trivial name of killdog bestowed upon it in some localities pursued to extremity it casts itself into the water swims with ease and dives at the moment its enemy is about to seize it or it conceals itself in a tuft of reeds or a bush and by this means often escapes with impunity it loves to breed among the reeds and in long and thick grass frequently in small companies of its own species or of the stellaris the female lays her eggs on an inartificially constructed platform of decayed leaves or stalks of marsh plants slightly elevated above the water how elevated i cannot find proper accountthat is to say whether it is hung to the stems of growing reeds or built on hillocks of soil but the bird is always liable to have its nest overflowed by floods the fullgrown bird is dressed in an exquisite perfection of barred bodice spotted chemisette and waved feathers edged with gray on the back  99 the reader will please recollect these three allegrets as the second group of the dab or dabblechicks and while the waterouzel is a mountain and torrent bird these inhabit exclusively flat lands and calm water belonging properly to temperate inclining to warm climates and able to gladden for usas their name now given impliesmany scenes and places otherwise little enlivened and to make the very gnats of them profitable to us were we wise enough dainty and delightful creatures in all their waysvoice only dubitable but i hope not a shriek or a squeakand there seems to be no reason whatever why half our fen lands should not be turned into beds of white water lilies and golden ducks with jetty ducklings to the great comfort of english souls22        22 compare bishop stanleys account of the larger tropical       jacana p 311 one species is often tamed and from its being       a resolute enemy to birds of prey the inhabitants of the       countries where it is found which be they rear it as a       protector for their fowls as it not only feeds with them but       accompanies them into the fields and brings them back in the       evening   iii  trepida stagnarum    little grebe  100 the two birdstorrentouzel and lilyouzelwhich we have been just describing agree you will observe in delicate and singular use of their feet in the water the torrentouzel holding itself mysteriously at the bottom and the lilyouzel less mysteriously but as skillfully on the top for i forgot to note respecting this raftwalking that the bird however light must be always careful not to tread on the edges of leaves but in the middle or rather as nearly as may be where they are set on the stalk it would go in at once if it trod on the edges but both the birds have the foot which is really characteristic of land not waterbirds and especially of those land species that run well of the real action of the toes either in running or hopping nothing is told us by the anatomistscompare lecture on robin § 26 but i hope before long to get at some of the facts respecting the greater flexibility of the gripping and climbing feet and elasticity of running ones and to draw up something like a properly graduated scale of the length of the toes in proportion to that of the body  illustration fig 12  and for one question relative to thisthe balance of a bird standing not grippingis to be thought of taking a typical profile of birdform in its abstract with beak belly and foot horizontal fig 12 the security of the standing supposing atomic weight equal through the birds body and the will in the ankle of iron is the same as of an inverted cone between the dotted lines from the extremities of the foot to those of the body and of course with a little grip of the foot or hind claw the bird can be safe in almost any position it likes nevertheless when the feet are as small in proportion as the torrentouzels i greatly doubt the possibility of such a balance as bewick has given it fig 13 a goulds of the blackbodiced ouzel fig 13 b is i imagine right bewick was infallible in plume texture and expression either of the features of animals or of any action that had meaning in it but he was singularly careless of indifferent points in geometry or perspective and even loses character in his waterbirds by making them always swim on the top of the water  illustration fig 13a  101 but whatever their balance of body or use of foot the two birds just examined are as i said essentially connected with the running land birds or broadly the plovers and with the sandrunners or from their cry sandpipers which mr gould evidently associates mentally with the plovers in his description of the plumage of the dunlin while he gives to them in his plates of that birdthe little stint and common sandpipermost subtle action with their fine feetthreadfine almost in the toes requiring us it seems to me to consider them as entirely landbirds however fond of the wave margins but the next real waterouzel we come to belongs to a group with feet like little horsechestnut leaves each toe having its separate lobes of web why separated i cannot yet make out but the bird swims or even dives on occasion with dexterity and force these lobefooted birds consist first of the grebes which are connected with freshwater ducks and secondly of the phalaropes which are a sort of seagulls no bird which is not properly webfooted has any business to think itself either true duck or true gull but as both in size and habit of life the larger grebes and phalaropes are entirely aquatic and marine i shall take out of them into my class of dabchicks only those which are literally dabblers in habit and chickens in size and of the grebes therefore only the one commonly known as the dabchick the little grebe colymbus minutus minute diver of linnæus a summary word or two first respecting the grebe family will be useful  illustration fig 13b  102 grebe properly i suppose grèbe from the french is not in johnson nor do any of my books tell me what it means i retain it however as being short not ugly and well established in two languages we may think of it as formed from gré and meaning a nice bird the specialities of the whole class easily remembered are first that they have chestnutleaf feet secondly that their legs are serrated behind with a double row of notcheswhy thirdly that they have no tails fourthly that they have most of them very fine and very comic crests tufts tippets and other variously applied appendages to their heads and chins so that some are called crested some eared some tippeted and so on but the least of them our proper dabchick displays no absurdity of this sort and i have the less scruple in distinguishing it from others i find further in stanleys classes the grebes placed among the shortwinged birds and made to include all the divers but he does not say how short their wings are and his grouping them with guillemots and puffins is entirely absurd all their ways and looks and abodes being those of ducks we can say no more of them as a family accordingly until we know what a duck isand i go on to the little pet of them whose ways are more entirely its own  103 strangely the most interesting fact if fact it be that it builds a floating nest gains scarcely more than chance notice from its historians here is mr goulds account of it the materials composing this raft or nest are weeds and aquatic plants carefully heaped together in a rounded form it is very large at the base and is so constantly added to that a considerable portion of it becomes submerged at the same time it is sufficiently buoyant to admit of its saucerlike hollow top being always above the surface in this wet depression five or six eggs are laid the bird always most alert is still more so now and scarcely ever admits of a near examination of the nestmaking or of a view of the eggs in favorable situations however and with the aid of a telescope the process may be watched and it is not a little interesting to notice with what remarkable quickness the dabchick scratches the weeds over her eggs with her feet when she perceives herself observed so as not to lead even to the suspicion that any were deposited on the illshapen floating mass this work of an instant displays as much skill in deception as can well be imagined  104 it is still left to question first what is meant by a wet depressiondoes the bird actually sit in the water and are the eggs under it and if not how is the water kept out secondly is the floating nest anchored and how looking to other ornithologists for solution of these particulars i find nobody else say anything about a floating nest at all bewick describes it as being of a large size and composed of a very great quantity of grass and water plants at least a foot in thickness and so placed in the water that the female hatches her eggs amidst the continual wet in which they were first laid yarrell says only that it is a large flat nest made of aquatic plants while morris finally complicates the whole business by telling us that the nest is placed often as much as twenty or thirty yards from the water that it is composed of short pieces of roots reeds rushes and flags and that when dry the whole naturally becomes very brittle23        23 i hear from a friend in whose statements i have absolute       confidence that he has found the eggs of the waterhen laid on a       dead sycamore leaf by the side of a shallow stream one of the       many brooks near uxbridge  105 while out of my fifteen volumes of ornithology i can obtain only this very vague account of the prettiest bird next to the kingfisher that haunts our english rivers i have no doubt the most precise and accurate accounts are obtainable of the shapes of her bones and the sinuosities of her larynx but about these i am lowminded enough not to feel the slightest curiosity i return to mr gould therefore to gather some pleasanter particulars first namely that she has a winter and summer dressin winter olive gray and white but in summer changing at marriage time deep olive black with dark chestnut chemisette infant dabchicks have delicate rosecolored bills harlequinlike markings and rosywhite aprons the harlequinlike markings i should call rather agatelike especially on the head where they are black and white like an onyx the bodies look more like a little walnutshell or nutmeg with wings to it or things that are to be wings some day  106 even when fullgrown the birds never fly muchnever more says morris than six or ten feet above the water and for the most part trailing their legs in it but either on the water or under it every movement is characterized by the most consummate dexterity and facile agility the most expert waterman that sculls his skiff on the thames or isis is but an humble and unskillful imitator of the dabchick in moving straightforward under water the wings are used to aid its progress as if in the air and in turning it has an easy gliding motion feet and wings being used as occasion requires sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other it walks but indifferently as may readily be imagined from the position of the legs so very far back it is pleasant to watch the parent bird feeding her young down she dives with a quick turn and presently rises again with five times out of six a minnow or other little fish glittering like silver in her bill the young rush towards the spot where the mother has come up but she does not drop the fish into the water for them to receive until she has well shaken it about and killed it so that it may not escape when for the last time in its own element i have seen a young one which had just seized out of its turn i have no doubt the captured prey chased away by her and pursued in apparent anger as if for punishment the following one being willingly given the next fish without any demur  107 mr gould seems to think that the dabchick likes insects and fish spawn better than fish or at least more prudently dines upon them that fish are taken we have positive evidence from examples having been repeatedly picked up dead by the fishermen of the thames with a bullhead or millers thumb in their throats and by which they had evidently been choked in the act of swallowing them that it is especially fond of insects is shown by the great activity it displays when in captivity in capturing houseflies and other diptera those who have visited paris will probably have seen the grebes in the window of the restaurateur in the rue de rivoli for years have a pair of these birds been living apparently in the greatest enjoyment within the glass window attracting the admiration of all the passersby the extreme agility with which they sailed round their little prison or scrambled over the halfsubmerged piece of rock for a fly was very remarkable that no bird can be more easily kept in a state of confinement is certain  108 this question about its food is closely connected with that of its diving so far as i understand mr morris it dives only when disturbed and to escaperemaining under water however if need be an almost incredible time and swimming underneath it to great distances here we have if we would only think of it the same question as that about the waterouzel how it keeps down and we must now note a few general points about diving birds altogether  it is easy to understand how the properly socalled divers can plunge with impetus to great depths or keep themselves at the bottom by continued strokes of the webbed feet but neither how the ouzel walks at the bottom if it be specifically lighter than the water nor how a bird can swim horizontally under the surface at least it is not enough explained that the action must be always that of oblique diving the bird regulating the stroke according to the upward pressure of the water at different depths  109 but there are many other points needing elucidation it is said and beautifully insisted on by michelet that great spaces in the bones of birds that pass most of their lives in flight are filled with air presumably the bones of the divers are made comparatively solid or it is even conceivableif conceptions or suppositions were of any usethat the deep divers may take in water to help themselves to sink the enormous depths at which they have been caught according to report cannot be reached by any mere effort of strength if the body remained as buoyant as it evidently is on the surface the strength of the wing must however be enormous for the great northern diver is described as swimming under water as it were with the velocity of an arrow in the air yarrell vol iii page 431 or to keep to more measured fact sir william jardine says i have pursued this bird in a newhaven fishingboat with four sturdy rowers and notwithstanding it was kept almost constantly under water by firing as soon as it appeared the boat could not succeed in making one yard upon it ibid p 432  110 but this is followed by the amazing statement of mr robert dunn p 433 that in the act of diving it does not appear to make the least exertion but sinks gradually under the surface without throwing itself forward the head being the last part that disappears i am not fond of the word impossible but i think i am safe in saying that according to the laws of nature no buoyant body can sink merely by an act of volition and that it must pull itself down by some hitherto unconceived action of the feet which in this bird are immensely broad and strong and so flat that it cannot walk with them any more than we could with two flat boards a yard square tied to our feet but when it is caught on land shoves its body along upon the ground like a seal by jerks all these diving motions are executed in a more delicate but quite as wonderful way by the dabchickmore wonderful indeed it may be said because it has only the divided or chestnutleaflike foot to strike with we shall understand it perhaps a little better after tracing in a future talk the history of its relations among the smaller seagulls meantime in quitting the little dainty creature i must plead for a daintier latin name than it has nowpodiceps no one seems to have the least idea what that means and colymbus diver must be kept for the great northern diver and his deepsea relatives far removed from our little living rippleline of the pools i cant think of any one pretty enough but for the present trepida may serve and perhaps be applied not improperly to all the grebes with reference to their subtle and instant escape from any sudden danger see stanley p 419 it requires all the address of a keen sportsman to get within shot and when he does the bird may still be too shrewd for him i fired at the distance of thirty yards my gun went quick as lightning but the grebe went quicker and scrambling over out of sight came up again in a few seconds perfectly unhurt  i think therefore that unless i receive some better suggestion trepida stagnarum may be the sufficiently intelligible latin renaming of our easily startled favorite   iv  titania arctica    arctic fairy  111 i must first get quit of the confusion of names for this bird linnæus in the fauna suecica p 64 calls it tringa lobata but afterwards northern tringa and his editor gmelin dark tringa other people agree to call it a phalarope but some of them northern phalarope some the dark phalarope some the ashy phalarope some the disposed to be ashy phalarope some the rednecked phalarope and some mr williamss phalarope finally cuvier calls it a lobipes and mr gould in english rednecked phalarope few people are likely to know what phalarope means24 and i believe nobody knows what tringa means and as also nobody ever sees it the little bird being obliged to live in orkney greenland norway and lapland out of human creatures way i shall myself call it the arctic fairy it would come south if we would let it but of course mr bond says the first specimen i ever had was shot by a friend of mine in september 1842 near southend essex where he saw the phalarope swimming on the water like a little duck about a mile from land not knowing what it was he shot it and kindly brought it to me another was shot while running between the metals of the great eastern railway near the stratford station early in june 1852 and on the norfolk coast four others have been killed during the last fifteen years and the birds visits thus satisfactorily put a stop to i can therefore study it only in mr goulds drawing on consulting which i find the bird to be simply a sea dabchickbrown stripes on the back and all but the webs of the feet a little finer and in its habits it is more like the lilyouzel according to the following report of mr st john the rednecked phalarope is certainly the most beautiful little wader of my acquaintance there were a pair of them male and female feeding near the loch in a little pool which was covered with weeds of different kinds nothing could be more graceful than the movements of these two little birds as they swam about in search of insects etc sometimes they ran lightly on the broad leaves of the waterlily which served them for a raft and entirely kept them out of the water though not exactly webfooted the phalarope swims with the greatest ease the attachment of these two birds to each other seemed very great whenever in their search for food they wandered so far apart as to be hidden by the intervening weeds the male bird stopped feeding suddenly and looking round uttered a low and musical call of inquiry which was immediately answered by the female in a different note but perfectly expressive of her answer which one might suppose to be to the purport that she was at hand and quite safe on hearing her the male immediately recommenced feeding but at the same time making his way towards her she also flew to meet him they then joined company for a moment or two and after a few little notes of endearment turned off again in different directions this scene was repeated a dozen times while i was watching them they seemed to have not the slightest fear of me for frequently they came to within a yard of where i was sitting and after looking up they continued catching the small waterinsects etc on the weeds without minding my presence in the least what reward the birds got for this gentle behavior we learn from the sentence following after the next two lines containing the extremely valuable contribution to their natural history that on dissecting the female we found two eggs in her        24 the terminal pe is short for pus pous and phalero       from phalera fringesfringefoot morris  112 all other accounts concur in expressing with as much admiration as is possible to naturalists the kindly and frank disposition of this bird which for the rest is almost a central type of all bird power with elf gifts added it flies like a lark trips on waterlily leaves like a fairy swims like a duck and roves like a seagull having been seen sixty miles from land and finally though living chiefly in lapland and iceland and other such northern countries it has been seen serenely swimming and catching flies in the hot water of the geysers in which a man could not bear his hand  and no less harmoniously than in report of the extreme tameness grace and affectionateness of this bird do sportsmen agree also in the treatment and appreciation of these qualities thus says mr salmon although we shot two pairs those that were swimming about did not take the least notice of the report of the gun and they seemed to be much attached to each other for when one of them flew to a short distance the other directly followed and while i held a wounded female in my hand its mate came and fluttered before my face compare the scene between irene and hector at page 393 of the may number of aunt judys magazine and again says mr wolley the bird is extremely tame swimming about my indiarubber boat so near that i could almost catch it in my hand i have seen it even when far from its nest struck at many times with an oar before it flew away in its domestic habits also the creature seems as exemplary as in its social habits it is frank for on the approach of danger to her nestlings the hen uses all the careful subtleties of the most cunning land birds spreading her wings and counterfeiting lameness for the purpose of deluding the intruder and after leading the enemy from her young she takes wing and flies to a great height at the same time displaying a peculiar action of the wings then descending with great velocity and making simultaneously a noise with her wings on her return to her young she uses a particular cry for the purpose of gathering them together as soon as she has collected them she covers them with her wings like the domestic hen  113 i cannot quite make out the limits of the fairys migrations but it is said by morris to occur in france holland germany italy and switzerland i find that one was what sportsmen call procured near york in full summer dress and another killed at rottingdean swimming in a pond in the middle of the village in the company of some ducks at scarborough louth and shoreham it has also been captured or shot and has been found building nests in sutherland and on the whole it seems that here is a sort of petrelpartridge and ducklingdove and divinglark with every possible grace and faculty that bird can have in body and soul ready at least in summer to swim on our village ponds or wait at our railway stations and make the wild northeastern coasts of scotland gay with its dancing flocks upon the foam were it not that the idle cockneys and potheaded squires fresh out of parliament stand as it were on guard all round the island spluttering smallshot at it striking at it with oars cutting it open to find how many eggs there are inside and in fine sending it for refuge into the hot water of hecla and any manner of stormy solitude that it can still find for itself and its amber nestlings i have never seen one nor i suppose ever shall see but hear of some of my friends sunning themselves at midnight about the north cape of whom if any one will bring me a couple of arctic fairies in a basket i think i can pledge our own squires and squires ladys faith for the pairs getting some peace if they choose to take it and as many waterlily leaves as they can trip upon on the tarns of monkconiston   ivb  titania inconstans    changeful fairy  phalaropus fulicarius cootlike phalaropegould  114 i think the epithet changeful prettier and until we know what a coot is like more descriptive than cootlike the bird having red plumage in summer and gray in winter while the coot is always black it is a little less pretty and less amiable than its sister fairy otherwise scarcely to be thought of but as a variety both of them being distinguished from the coot not only by color but by their smaller sizethey eight inches long it sixteenand by the slender beaks the coot having a thick one halfway to a puffins  and here once for allfor i see i have taken no note yet of the beaks or bills of my dabchicksi will at once arrange a formula of the order of questions which it will be proper to ask and get answered concerning any bird in the same order always so that we shall never miss anything that we ought to think of and i find these questions will naturally and easily fall into the following twelve   1 country and scope of migration  2 food  3 form and flight  4 foot  5 beak and eye  6 voice and ear  7 temper  8 nest  9 eggs 10 brood 11 feathers 12 uses in the world  it may be thought that i have forcedand not fallen intomy number 12 by packing the faculties of sight and hearing into bycorners but the expression of a birds head depends on the relation of eye to beak as the getting of its food depends on their practical alliance of power and the question for instance whether peacocks and parrots have musical ears seems to me not properly debatable unless with due respect to the quality of their voices it is curious considering how much one way or another we are amused or pleased by the chatter and song of birds that you will scarcely find in any ornithic manual more than a sentence if so much about their hearing and i have not myself at this moment the least idea where a nightingales ears are but see appendix p 122  i retain therefore my dodecahedric form of catechism as sufficiently clear and without binding myself to follow the order of it in strictness if there be motive for discursory remark it will certainly prevent my leaving any bird insufficiently distinguished and enable me to arrange the collected statements about it in the most easily compared order  115 we will try it at once on this second variety of the titania of which i find nothing of much interest in my books and have nothing discursive myself to say   1 country arctic mostly seen off greenland in lat 68° swimming among icebergs three or four miles from shore abundant in siberia and as far south as the caspian migratory in europe as far as italy yet always rare do a few only more intelligently curious than the rest or for the sake of their health travel   2 food small thinskinned crustacea and aquatic surfaceinsects   3 form and flight stout for a seabird and they dont care to fly  preferring to swim out of danger body 7 to 8 inches long wings  from carpal joint to end 434say 5 these quarters of inches are  absurd pretenses to generalize what varies in every bird 8 inches  long by 10 across the wings open is near enough in future the  brief notification 8 × 10 5 × 7 or the like will enough express a  birds inches unless it possess decorative appendage of tail which  must be noted separately   4 foot chestnutleaved in front toes the lobes slightly serrated on the edges hind toe without membrane color of foot always black   5 beak long slender straight how long drawn as about a fifth of the birds lengthsay an inch or a little over upper mandible slightly curved down at the point in titania arctica the beak is longer and more slender   6 voice a sharp short cry not conceived by me enough to spell any likeness of it   7 temper gentle passing into stupid it seems to me one in meditative travel lets itself be knocked down by a gardener with his spade   8 nest little said of it the bird breeding chiefly in the north among marshes it is of weeds and grass but among icebergs of what   9 eggs pearshape narrow ends together in nest never more than four  10 brood no account of  11 feathers mostly gray passing into brown in summer varied with white on margin reddish chestnut or bay bodicewell oiled or varnished  12 uses fortunately at present unknown   v  rallus aquaticus    waterrail  116 thus far we have got for representatives of our dabchick group eight species of little birdsnamely two torrentouzels three lilyouzels one grebe and two titanias and these we associate observe not for any specialty of feature in them but for common character habit and size so that if perchance a child playing by any stream or on the seasands perceives a companionable bird dabbling in an equally childish and pleasant manner he may not have to look through half a dozen volumes of ornithology to find it but may be pretty sure it has been one of these eight and having once fastened the characters of these well in his mind he may with ease remember that the little grebe is the least of a family of chestnutleaffooted and sharpbilled creatures which yet in size color and diving power go necessarily among ducks and cannot be classed with dabblers though it must be always as distinctly kept in mind that a duck proper has a flat beak and a fully webbed foot  again he may recollect that with these leaffooted ducks of the calm and fresh waters must be associated the leaffooted or fringefooted ducks of the seaphalaropes which by their short wings connect themselves with many clumsy marine creatures on their way to become seals instead of birds and that i have kept the two little titanias out of this class not merely for their niceness but because they are not shortwinged in any vulgar degree but seem to have wings about as long as a sandpipersand indeed i had put the purple sandpiper arquatella maritima with them in my own folio only as the arquatellas feet are not chestnutty she had better go with her own kind in our notes on them  117 but there are yet two birds which i think well to put with our eight dabchicks though they are much larger than any of thempartly because of their disposition and partly because of their plumagethe waterrail and waterhen modern science with instinctive horror of all that is pretty to see or easy to remember entirely rejects the plumage as any element or noticeable condition of birdkinds nor have i ever yet tried to make it one myself yet there are certain qualities of downiness in ducks fluffiness in owls spottiness in thrushes patchiness in pies bronzed or rusty luster in cocks and pearly iridescence in doves which i believe may be aptly brought into connection with other defining characters and when we find an entirely similar disposition of plumage and nearly the same form in two birds i do not think that mere difference in size should far separate them  bewick accordingly calls the waterrail the brookouzel and puts it between the little crake and the waterouzel but he does not say a word of its living by brooksonly in low wet places buffon however takes it with the landrail gould and yarrell put it between the little crake and waterhen goulds description of it is by no means clear to mehe first says it is in action as much like a rat as a bird then that it bounds like a ball before the nose of the spaniel and lastly in the next sentence speaks of it as this lathlike bird it is as large as a bantam but can run like the allegretta on floating leaves itself weighing about four ounces and a half bewick and rarely uses the wing flying very slowly i imagine the lathlike must mean like the more frequent epithet compressed that the birds body is vertically thin so as to go easily between close reeds  118 we will try our twelve questions again   1 country equally numerous in every part of europe in africa india china and japan yet hardly anybody seems to have seen it living however near the perennial fountains wherever those may beit sounds like the garden of eden during the greater part of the winter the birds pass malta in spring and autumn and have been seen fifty leagues at sea off the coast of portugal buffon but where coming from or going to is not told tunis is the most southerly place named by yarrell   2 food anything small enough to be swallowed that lives in mud or water   3 form and flight i am puzzled as aforesaid between its likeness to a ball and a lath flies heavily and unwillingly hanging its legs down   4 foot longtoed and flexible   5 beak sharp and strong some inch and a half long showing distinctly the cimetercurve of a gulls near the point   6 voice no account of   7 temper quite easily tamable though naturally shy feeds out of the hand in a day or two if fed regularly in confinement   8 nest slight of leaves and strips of flags gould of sedge and grass rarely found yarrell size not told   9 eggs eight or nine creamwhite with rosy yolk rather larger than a blackbirds  10 brood velvet black with white bills hunting with the utmost activity from the minute they are hatched  11 feathers brown on the back a beautiful warm ash gray on the breast and under the wings transverse stripes of very dark gray and white the disposition of pattern is almost exactly the same as in the allegretta  12 uses by many thought delicious eating bewick the fact is or seems to me that this entire group of marsh birds is meant to become to us the domestic poultry of marshy land and i imagine that by proper irrigation and care many districts of otherwise useless bog and sand might be made more profitable to us than many fishinggrounds   vi  pulla aquatica    waterhen  gallinula chloropuspennant bewick gould and yarrell  119 greenfooted little cock or hen that is to say in english only observe if you call the fringefoot a phalarope you ought in consistency to call the greenfoot a chlorope their feet are not only notable for greenness but for size they are very ugly having the awkward and illused look of the feet of scratchers while a trace of beginning membrane connects them with the fringefoots  their proper name would be marshcock which would enough distinguish them from the true moorcock or blackcock moatcock would be prettier and characteristic for in the old english days they used to live much in the moats of manorhouses mine is the name nearest to the familiar one only note there is no proper feminine of pullus and i use the adjective pulla to express the dark color  it is a darkbrown bird according to the colored picturesiron gray buffon says with white stripes of little order on the bodice clumsy feet and bill but makes up for all ungainliness by its gentle and intelligent mind and seems meant for a useful possession to mankind all over the world for it lives in siberia and new zealand in senegal and jamaica in scotland switzerland and prussia in corfu crete and trebizond in canada and at the cape i find no account of its migrations and one would think that a bird which usually flies dip dip dipping with its toes and leaving a track along the water like that of a stone at ducks and drakes yarrell would not willingly adventure itself on the atlantic it must have a kind of human facility in adapting itself to climate as it has human domesticity of temper with curious fineness of sagacity and sympathies in taste a family of them petted by a clergymans wife were constantly adding materials to their nest and made real havoc in the flowergardenfor though straw and leaves are their chief ingredients they seem to have an eye for beauty and the old hen has been seen surrounded with a brilliant wreath of scarlet anemones thus bishop stanley whose account of the bird is full of interesting particulars this aesthetic waterhen with her husband lived at cheadle in staffordshire in the rectory moat for several seasons always however leaving it in the spring for scotland supposably being constantly fed the pair became quite tame built their nest in a thornbush covered with ivy which had fallen into the water and when the young are a few days old the old ones bring them up close to the drawingroom window where they are regularly fed with wheat and as the lady of the house pays them the greatest attention they have learned to look up to her as their natural protectress and friend so much so that one bird in particular which was much persecuted by the rest would when attacked fly to her for refuge and whenever she calls the whole flock as tame as barndoor fowls quit the water and assemble round her to the number of seventeen november 1833  120 they have also made other friends in the dogs belonging to the family approaching them without fear though hurrying off with great alarm on the appearance of a strange dog  the position of the water together with the familiarity of these birds has afforded many interesting particulars respecting their habits  they have three broods in a seasonthe first early in april and they begin to lay again when the first hatch is about a fortnight old they lay eight or nine eggs and sit about three weeksthe cock alternately with the hen the nest in the thornbush is placed usually so high above the surface of the water they cannot climb into it again but as a substitute within an hour after they leave the nest the cock bird builds a larger and more roomy nest for them with sedges at the waters edge which they can enter or retire from at pleasure for about a month they are fed by the old birds but soon become very active in taking flies and waterinsects immediately on the second hatch coming out the young ones of the first hatch assist the old ones in feeding and hovering over them leading them out in detached parties and making additional nests for them similar to their own on the brink of the moat  but it is not only in their instinctive attachments and habits that they merit notice the following anecdote proves that they are gifted with a sense of observation approaching to something very like reasoning faculties  at a gentlemans house in staffordshire the pheasants are fed out of one of those boxes described in page 287 the lid of which rises with the pressure of the pheasant standing on the rail in front of the box a waterhen observing this went and stood upon the rail as soon as the pheasant had quitted it but the weight of the bird being insufficient to raise the lid of the box so as to enable it to get at the corn the waterhen kept jumping on the rail to give additional impetus to its weight this partially succeeded but not to the satisfaction of the sagacious bird accordingly it went off and soon returning with a bird of its own species the united weight of the two had the desired effect and the successful pair enjoyed the benefit of their ingenuity  we can vouch for the truth of this singular instance of penetration on the authority of the owner of the place where it occurred and who witnessed the fact  121 but although in these sagacities and teachablenesses the bird has much in common with land poultry it seems not a link between these and waterfowl but to be properly placed by the ornithologists between the rail and the coot this latter being the largest of the fringefoots singularly dark in color and called fulica sooty or with insistence fulica atra black sooty or even fulica aterrima blackest sooty coot is said by johnson to be dutch and that it became cotée in french but i cannot find cotée in my french dictionary in the meantime putting the coot and waterhen aside for future better knowledge we may be content with the pentagonal group of our dabchickspassing at each angle into another tribe thusif people must classify they at least should also map take the ouzel allegret grebe fairy and rail and only giving the fairy her latin name write their fourpennyworth of initial letters groat round a pentagon set on its base putting the ouzel at the top angleso then the ouzels pass up into blackbirds the rails to the left into woodcocks the allegrets to the right into plovers the grebes down left into ducks and the titanias down right into gulls and theres a bit of pentagonal darwinism for you if you like it and learn it which will be really good for something in the end or the five ends  122 and for the bliss of classification pure with no ends of any sort or any number referring my reader to the works of ornithologists in general and for what small portion of them he may afterwards care to consult to my appendix i will end this lecture and this volume with the refreshment for us of a piece of perfect english and exquisite wit falling into versethe chorus of the birds in mr courthopes paradise of thema book lovely and often faultless in most of its execution but little skilled or attractive in plan and too thoughtful to be understood without such notes as a good author will not write on his own work partly because he has not time and partly because he always feels that if people wont look for his meaning they should not be told it my own special function on the contrary is and always has been that of the interpreter only in the pilgrims progress and i trust that mr courthope will therefore forgive my arranging his long cadence of continuous line so as to come symmetrically into my own page thus also enforcing for the inattentive the rhymes which he is too easily proud to insist on and my division of the whole chorus into equal strophe and antistrophe of six lines each in which counting from the last line of the stanza the reader can easily catch the word to which my note refers  123     we wish to declare                 how the birds of the air          all high

fortunately able to supply mr hartwigs miscellany being a favoritewhat can i call it sandhillof my own out of which every now and then in a rasorial manner i can scratch some savory or useful contentsone or two it may be remembered i collected for the behoof of the bishop of manchester on this very subject contemporary review feb 1880 and some of mr hartwigs halfsandy halfsoppy political opinions are offered to the consideration of the british workman in the last extant number of fors touching eider ducks i find in his fifth chapteron icelandhe quotes the following account by mr shepherd of the shore of the island of isafjardarjupa word which seems to contain in itself an introduction to icelandic literature  127 the ducks and their nests were everywhere in a manner that was quite alarming great brown ducks sat upon their nests in masses and at every step started up from under our feet it was with difficulty that we avoided treading on some of the nests the island being but threequarters of a mile in width the opposite shore was soon reached on the coast was a wall built of large stones just above the highwater level about three feet in height and of considerable thickness at the bottom on both sides of it alternate stones had been left out so as to form a series of square compartments for the ducks to make their nests in almost every compartment was occupied and as we walked along the shore a long line of ducks flew out one after another the surface of the water also was perfectly white with drakes who welcomed their brown wives with loud and clamorous cooing when we arrived at the farmhouse we were cordially welcomed by its mistress the house itself was a great marvel the earthen wall that surrounded it and the window embrasures were occupied by ducks on the ground the house was fringed with ducks on the turfslopes of the roof we could see ducks and a duck sat in the scraper  a grassy bank close by had been cut into square patches like a chessboard a square of turf of about eighteen inches being removed and a hollow made and all were filled with ducks a windmill was infested and so were all the outhouses mounds rocks and crevices the ducks were everywhere many of them were so tame that we could stroke them on their nests and the good lady told us that there was scarcely a duck on the island which would not allow her to take its eggs without flight or fear  128 but upon the back of the canvas as it were of this pleasant pictureon the back of the leaf in his book p 65this description being given in p 66doctor hartwig tells us in his own peculiar soppy and sandy wayhalf tearful half dryasdusty or may not we sayit sounds more icelandicdryassawdusty these less cheerful facts the eiderdown is easily collected as the birds are quite tame the female having laid five or six pale greenisholive eggs in a nest thickly lined with her beautiful down the collectors after carefully removing the bird rob the nest of its contents after which they replace her she then begins to lay afreshthough this time only three or four eggsand again has recourse to the down on her body but her greedy persecutors once more rifle her nest and oblige her to line it for the third time now however her own stock of down is exhausted and with a plaintive voice she calls her mate to her assistance who willingly plucks the soft feathers from his breast to supply the deficiency if the cruel robbery be again repeated which in former times was frequently the case the poor eiderduck abandons the spot never to return and seeks for a new home where she may indulge her maternal instinct undisturbed by the avarice of man  129 now as i have above told you these two statements are given on the two sides of the same leaf and the reader must make what he may of them setting the best of my own poor wits at them it seems to me that the merciless abstraction of down is indeed the usual custom of the inhabitants and visitors but that the good lady referred to by mr shepherd manages things differently and in consequence we are presently farther told of her bottom of p 65 that when she first became possessor of the island the produce of down from the ducks was not more than fifteen pounds weight in the year but under her careful nurture of twenty years it had risen to nearly one hundred pounds annually it requires about one pound and a half to make a coverlet for a single bed and the down is worth from twelve to fifteen shillings per pound most of the eggs are taken and pickled for winter consumption one or two only being left to hatch  but here again pulverulent dr hartwig leaves us untold who consumes all these pickled eggs of the cooing and downybreasted creatures you observe in passing that an eiderduck coos instead of quacking and must be a sort of seadove or what addition their price makes to the good old ladys feathernesting income of as i calculate it sixty to seventyfive pounds a yearall her twenty years of skill and humanity and moderate plucking having got no farther than that and not feeling myself able on these imperfect data to offer any recommendations to the icelandic government touching the duck trade i must end my present chapter with a rough generalization of results for a beginning of which the time having too clearly and sadly come for me as i have said in my preface to knit up as far as i may the loose threads and straws of my raveled lifes work i reprint in this place the second paragraph of the chapter on vital beauty in the second volume of modern painters premising however some few necessary words  130 i intended never to have reprinted the second volume of modern painters first because it is written in affected imitation of hooker and not in my own proper style and secondly yet chiefly because i did not think the analytic study of which it mainly consists in the least likely to be intelligible to the general student or therefore profitable to him but i find now that the general student has plunged himself into such abysses not of analytic but of dissolyticdialyticor even diarrhoeiclies belonging to the sooty and sensual elements of his london and paris life that however imperfectly or dimly done the higher analysis of that early work of mine ought at least to be put within his reach and the fact somehow enforced upon him that there were people before he lived who knew what æsthesis meant though they did not think that pigs flavoring of pigswash was ennobled by giving it that greek name and that there were also people before his time who knew what vital beauty meant though they did not seek it either in the modelroom or the parc aux cerfs  therefore i will republish dv the analytic parts of the second volume of modern painters as they were written but with perhaps an additional note or two and the omission of the passages concerning evangelical or other religious matters in which i have found out my mistakes  131 to be able to hunt for these mistakes and crow over them in the original volume will always give that volume its orthodox value in sale catalogues so that i shall swindle nobody who has already bought the book by bringing down its price upon them nor will the new edition be a cheap oneeven if i ever get it out which is by no means certain here however at once is the paragraph above referred to quite one of the most important in the book the reader should know preparatorily that for what is now called æsthesis i always used and still use the english word sensationas for instance the sensation of cold or heat and of their differencesof the flavor of mutton and beef and their differencesof a peacocks and a larks cry and their differencesof the redness in a blush and in rouge and their differencesof the whiteness in snow and in almondpaste and their differencesof the blackness and brightness of night and day or of smoke and gaslight and their differences etc etc but for the perception of beauty i always used platos word which is the proper word in greek and the only possible single word that can be used in any other language by any man who understands the subjecttheoriathe germans only having a term parallel to it anschauung assumed to be its equivalent in p 22 of the old edition of modern painters but which is not its real equivalent for anschauung does not i believe include bodily sensation whereas platos theoria does so far as is necessary and mine somewhat more than platos the first perfection then i say in this so long in coming paragraph of the theoretic faculty is the kindness and unselfish fullness of heart which receives the utmost amount of pleasure from the happiness of all things of which in high degree the heart of man is incapable neither what intense enjoyment the angels may have in all that they see of things that move and live and in the part they take in the shedding of gods kindness upon them can we know or conceive only in proportion as we draw near to god and are made in measure like unto him can we increase this our possession of charity of which the entire essence is in god only but even the ordinary exercise of this faculty implies a condition of the whole moral being in some measure right and healthy and to the entire exercise of it there is necessary the entire perfection of the christian character for he who loves not god nor his brother cannot love the grass beneath his feet and the creatures which live not for his uses filling those spaces in the universe which he needs not while on the other hand none can love god nor his human brother without loving all things which his father loves nor without looking upon them every one as in that respect his brethren also and perhaps worthier than he if in the under concords they have to fill their part be touched more truly it is good to read of that kindness and humbleness of s francis of assisi who never spoke to bird or cicala nor even to wolf and beast of prey but as his brother and so we find are moved the minds of all good and mighty men as in the lesson that we have from the mariner of coleridge and yet more truly and rightly taught in the hartleap well      never to blend our pleasure or our pride     with sorrow of the meanest thing that feels  and again in the white doe of rylstone with the added teaching that anguish of our own      is tempered and allayed by sympathies     aloft ascending and descending deep     even to the inferior kinds  so that i know not of anything more destructive of the whole theoretic faculty not to say of the christian character and human intellect than those accursed sports in which man makes of himself cat tiger serpent chætodon and alligator in one and gathers into one continuance of cruelty for his amusement all the devices that brutes sparingly and at intervals use against each other for their necessities  132 so much i had perceived and said you observe good reader concerning s francis of assisi and his sermons when i was only fiveandtwentylittle thinking at that day how evangelicalbred as i was i should ever come to write a lecture for the first school of art in oxford in the sacristans cell at assisi25 or everamong such poor treasures as i have of friends reliquariesi should fondly keep a little pinch of his cloak        25 see ariadne florentina chap v § 164 compare fors       letter v  rough cloak of hair it is still at assisi concerning which and the general use of camels hair or sackcloth or briars and thorns in the middle ages together with sealskins not badgers and rams skins dyed gules by the jews and the crusaders as compared with the use of the two furs ermine and vair and their final result in the operations of the hudsons bay company much casual notice will be found in my former work and now this is the sum of it all so far as i can shortly write it  there is no possibility of explaining the system of life in this world on any principle of conqueringly divine benevolence that piece of bold impiety if it be so i have always asserted in my wellconsidered booksi considering it on the contrary the only really pious thing to say namely that the world is under a curse which we may if we will gradually remove by doing as we are bid and believing what we are told and when we are told for instance in the best book we have about our own old history that unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothed them we are to accept it as the best thing to be done under the circumstances and to wear if we can get them wolf skin or cow skin or beavers or ermines but not therefore to confuse god with the hudsons bay company nor to hunt foxes for their brushes instead of their skins or think the poor little black tails of a siberian weasel on a judges shoulders may constitute him therefore a minos in matters of retributive justice or an Æacus in distributive who can at once determine how many millions a railroad company are to make the public pay for not granting them their exclusive business by telegraph  133 and every hour of my life since that paragraph of modern painters was written has increased i disdain to say my feeling but say with fearless decision my knowledge of the bitterness of the curse which the habits of hunting and la chasse have brought upon the socalled upper classes of england and france until from knights and gentlemen they have sunk into jockeys speculators usurers butchers by battue and the english especially now as a political body into what i have called them in the opening chapter of the bible of amiensthe scurviest louts that ever fouled gods earth with their carcasses  the language appears to be violent it is simply brief and accurate but i never meant it to remain without justification and i will give the justification here at once  take your johnson and look out the adjective scurvy in its higher or figurative sense  you find the first quotation he gives is from measure for measure spoken of the duke in monks disguise      i know him for a man divine and holy     not scurvy nor a temporary meddler  in which passage shakspeare who never uses words in vain nor with a grain less than their full weight opposes the divineness of men or their walking with god to the scurviness of men or their wallowing with swine and again he opposes the holiness of menin the sense of holyharmless undefiled and more than that helpful or healthful in actionto the harmful and filthy action of temporary meddlers such as the hanging of seventeen priests before breakfast and our profitable military successes in such a prolonged piece of temporary meddling as the crimean war  134 but secondly if you look down johnsons column you will find his last quotation is not in the higher or figurative but the lower and literal sense from swift to the effect that it would be convenient to prevent the excess of drink with that scurvy custom of taking tobacco and you will also find if you ever have the sense or courage to look the facts of modern history in the face that those two itches for the pot and the pipe have been the roots of every other demoralization of the filthiest and literally scurviest sort among all classesthe dirty pack of cards the church pavement running with human salivai have seen the spittings in ponds half an inch deep in the choir of rouen cathedral and the entirely infernal atmosphere of the common cafés and gamblinghouses of european festivity infecting every condition of what they call æsthesis left in the bodies of men until they cannot be happy with the pines and pansies of the alps until they have mixed tobacco smoke with the scent of them and the whole concluding in the enduranceor even enjoymentof the most squalid conditions of filth in our capital cities that have ever been yet recorded among the disgraces of mankind  135 but thirdly johnsons central quotation is again from measure for measure      he spoke scurvy and provoking terms against your honor  the debates in the english house of commons for the last halfcentury having consisted virtually of nothing else  i next take the word lout of which johnson gives two derivations for our choice it is either the past participle of to lower or make low a lowed person as our house of lords under the direction of railway companies and publichouse keepers or elseand more strictly i believe in etymologya form of the german leute common people in either case its proper classical english sense is given by johnson as a mean awkward fellow a bumpkin a clown  now i surely cannot refer to any general representation of british society more acceptable to and acknowledged by that society than the finished and admirably composed drawings of du maurier in punch which have become every week more and more consistent keen and comprehensive during the issues of the last two years  i take three of them as quite trustworthy pictures and the best our present arts of delineation could produce of the three etats or representative orders of the british nation of our day  of the working class take the type given in lady clara robinsons garden tea party p 174 vol 79  of the mercantile class mr smith in his drawingroom after dinner p 222 vol 80  and of the noblesse the first five gentlemen on the right spectators right of the line in the ball at stilton house july 3d 1880  136 of the manner or state of lout to which our manufacturing prosperity has reduced its artisan as represented in the first of these frescoes i do not think it needful to speak here neither of the level of sublime temperament and unselfish heroism to which the dangers of commercial enterprise have exalted mr smith but the five consecutive heads in the third fresco are a very notable piece of english history representing the polished and more or less lustrous type of lout which is indeed a kind of rolled shingle of former english noblesse capable of nothing now in the way of resistance to atlantic liberalism except of getting itself swept up into ugly harbor bars and troublesome shoals in the tideway  and observe also that of the three types of lout whose combined chorus and tripudiation leads the present british constitution its devils dance this last and smoothest type is also the dullest your operative lout cannot indeed hold his cup of coffee with a grace or possess himself of a biscuit from lady claras salver without embarrassment but in his own mill he can at least make a needle without an eye or a nail without a head or a knife that wont cut or something of that sort with dexterity also the middle class or smithian lout at least manages his stockbroking or marketing with decision and cunning knows something by eye or touch of his wares and something of the characters of the men he has to deal with but the ducal or marquisian lout has no knowledge of anything under the sun except what sort of horses quarters will carry his own farther weighted with that smooth block or pebble of a pow and no faculty under the sun of doing anything except cutting down the trees his fathers planted for him and selling the lands his fathers won  137 that is indeed the final result of hunting and horseracing on the british landlord of its result on the british soldier perhaps the figures of lord george sackville at the battle of minden and of lord raglan at the battle of alma who in the first part of the battle did not know where he was and in the second plumed himself on being where he had no business to be are as illustrative as any i could name but the darkest of all to my own thinking are the various personages civil and military who have conducted the caffre war to its last successes of blowing women and children to death with dynamite and harrying the lands of entirely innocent peasantry because they would not betray their defeated king  138 of the due and noble relations between man and his companion creatures the horse dog and falcon enough has been said in my former writingsunintelligible enough to a chivalry which passes six months of its annual life in rotten row and spends the rents of its cumberland hills in building furnaces round furness abbey but which careful students either of past knighthood or of future christianity will find securely and always true for the relations between man and his beast of burden whether the burden be himself or his goods become beautiful and honorable just in the degree that both creatures are useful to the rest of mankind whether in war or peace the greeks gave the highest symbol of them in the bridling of pegasus for bellerophon by athena and from that myth you may go down to modern timesunderstanding according to your own sense and dignity what all prophecy poetry history have told youof the horse whose neck is clothed with thunder or the ox who treadeth out the cornof josephs chariot or of elijahsof achilles and xanthusherminius and black austerdown to scott and brown adamor dandie dinmont and dumple that pastoral one is of all the most enduring i hear the proudest tribe of arabia felix is now reduced by poverty and civilization to sell its last wellbred horse and that we send out our cavalry regiments to repetitions of the charge at balaclava without horses at all those that they can pick up wherever they land being good enough for such military operations but the carthorse will remain when the charger and hunter are no more and with a wiser master      ill buy him for the dogs shall never     set tooth upon a friend so true     hell not live long but i forever     shall know i gave the beast his due      ready as bird to meet the morn     were all his efforts at the plow     then the millbrookwith hay or corn     good creature how hed spatter through      i left him in the shafts behind     his fellows all unhookd and gone     he neighd and deemed the thing unkind     then starting drew the load alone                                    half choked with joy with love and pride     he now with dainty clover fed him     now took a short triumphant ride     and then again got down and led him  139 where paris has had to lead her horses we know and where london had better lead hers than let her people die of starvation but i have not lost my hope that there are yet in england bewicks and bloomfields who may teach their childrenand earn for their cattlebetter ways of fronting and of waiting for death  nor are the uses of the inferior creatures to us less consistent with their happiness to all that live death must come the manner of it and the time are for the human master of them and of the earth to determinenot to his pleasure but to his duty and his need  in sacrifice or for his food or for his clothing it is lawful for him to slay animals but not to delight in slaying any that are helpless if he choose for discipline and trial of courage to leave the boar in calydon the wolf in taurus the tiger in bengal or the wild bull in aragon there is forest and mountain wide enough for them but the inhabited world in sea and land should be one vast unwalled park and treasure lake in which its flocks of sheep or deer or fowl or fish should be tended and dealt with as best may multiply the life of all loves meinie in strength and use and peace     appendix   140 this part of the book will i hope be continuous with the text of it containing henceforward in each number the nomenclature hitherto used for the birds described in it and the authors reason for his choice or change of names in the present number it supplies also the nomenclature required for the two preceding ones and thus finishes the first volume  the names given first in capitals for each bird are those which the author will in future give it and proposes for use in elementary teaching they will consist only of a plain latin specific name with one or at the most two latin epithets and the simplest popular english name if there be one if not the english name will usually be the direct translation of the latin one  then in order will follow  i linnæuss name marked l  ii buffons name marked f the f standing also for french when any popular french name is given with buffons  iii the german popular name marked t teutonic for i want the g for mr gould and this t will include authoritative german scientific names also  iv the italian popular name if one exists to give the connection with old latin marked i  v mr goulds name g yarrells y dresslers d and gesners ges being added if different  vi bewicks b  vii shakspeares and chaucers if i know them and general references such as may be needful  the appendix will thus contain the names of all the birds i am able to think or learn anything about as i can set down what i think or learn and with no other attempt at order than the slight grouping of convenience but the numbers of the species examined will be consecutive so that l m 25loves meinie number twentyfiveor whatever the number may be will at once identify any bird in the system of the st georges schools  the following note by the author has in previous editions faced the first page of lecture iii with the exception of the nos ivii which are now added by the editor for the sake of completeness                                                        names of the birds noticed

monastica in translation of shakspeares templehaunting the main idea about this bird among people who have any ideas seems to be that it haunts and builds among grander masses or clefts of wall than the common swallow thus the germans besides churchswallow call it wallrockroofor window swallow and murspyren or munster spyren wallwalker minsterwalker but by the people who have no ideas the names town and country urbica and rustica have been accepted as indicating the practical result that a bird which likes walls will live in towns and one which is content with eaves may remain in farms and villages and under their strawbuilt sheds  my name monastica is farther justified by the dominican severity of the birds dress dark grayblue and white only while the domestica has a red cap and light brown bodice and much longer tail as far as i remember the bird i know best is the monastica i have seen it in happiest flocks in allmonastic abbeville playing over the somme in morning sunlight

swallowflight was for greater certainty and severity made with this apparently feeblest of its kinda marked topino brought from its nest at pavia to milan fifteen miles flew back to pavia in thirteen minutes i imagine a swift would at least have doubled this rate of flight and that we may safely take a hundred miles an hour as an average of swallowspeed this however is less by threefifths than michelets estimate see above lecture ii § 48  i have substituted bank for sand in the english name since all the six quoted authorities give it this epithet in latin or french and bewick in english also it may be well thus to distinguish it from birds of the seashore   v  145 hirundo sagitta    swift  hirundo apus l martinet noir f geyrschwalbe vultureswallow t rondone plural rondini i cypselus apus g and y swift black martin or deviling b  i think it will be often well to admit the license of using a substantive for epithet as one says rockbird or seabird and not rocky or marine in latin as well as in english we thus greatly increase our power and assist the brevity of nomenclature and we gain the convenience of using the second term by itself when we wish to do so more naturally thus one may shortly speak of the sagitta when one is on a scientific point where swift would be indecorous more easily than one could speak of the stridula or the velox if we gave the bird either of those epithets i think this of sagitta is the most descriptive one could well find only the reader is always to recollect that arrowbirds must be more heavy in the head or shaft than arrowweapons and fly more in the manner of rifleshot than bowshot see lecture ii §§ 46 67 71 in which last paragraph however i have to correct the careless statement that in the sailing flight without stroke of the larger falcons their weight ever acts like the string of a kite their weight acts simply as the weight of a kite acts and no otherwise compare § 65 the impulsive force in sailing can be given only by the tail feathers like that of a darting trout by the tail fin i do not think any excuse necessary for my rejection of the name which seems most to have established itself lately cypselus apus footless capsule it is not footless and there is no sense in calling a bird a capsule because it lives in a hole which the swift does not the greeks had a double idea in the word which it is not the least necessary to keep and aristotles cypselus is not the swift but the bankmartletthey bring up their young in cells made out of clay long in the entrance the swift being precisely the one of the hirundines which does not make its nest of clay but of miscellaneous straws threads and shreds of any adaptable rubbish which it can snatch from the ground as it stoops on the wing26 or pilfer from any halfruined nests of other birds        26 i have in different times and places opened ten or twelve       swifts nests in all of them i found the same materials and       these consisting of a great variety of substancesstalks of       corn dry grass moss hemp bits of cord threads of silk and       linen the tip of an ermines tail small shreds of gauze of       muslin and other light stuffs

with cotyles or capsules but recollect simply that hirundo greek chelidôn swallow schwalbe and hirondelle are in each language the sufficing single words for the entire hirundine race   vi  146

air nothing but rocks or cathedrals serving it for nest in france seen only near the alps in spain among the mountains of aragon almost every person who has had an opportunity of observing this bird

our meads and fields until it is shot g it is i believe the swallow of the bibleabundant though only a summer migrant in the holy land i have never seen it that i know of nor thought of it in the

names for this bird but as it is really neither a hawk nor an owl though much mingled in its manners of both i keep the usual one nightjar euphonious for nightchurr from its continuous note like the sound of a spinning wheel the idea of its sucking goats or any other milky creature has long been set at rest and science intolerant of legends in which there is any use or beauty cannot be allowed to ratify in its dog or piglatin those which are eternally vulgar and profitless i had first thought of calling it hirundo nocturna but this would be too broad massing for although the creature is more swallow than owl living wholly on insects it must be properly held as a distinct species from both owls cannot gape like constrictors nor have swallows whiskers or beards or combs to keep both in order with on their middle toes this birds catlike bristles at the base of the beak connect it with the bearded toucans and so also the toothed mandibles of the american cavedwelling variety i shall not want the word noctua for the owls themselves and it is a pretty and simple one for this tribe enabling the local epithet european and other necessary ones of varieties to be retained for the second or specific term nachtschade nightloss the popular german name perhaps really still refers to this supposed nocturnal thieving or may have fallen euphonious from nachtschwalbe which in some places abides crapaudvolant is ugly but descriptive the brown speckling of the bird being indeed toadlike though wonderful and beautiful bewick has put his utmost skill into it and the cut with the bittern and white owl may perhaps stand otherwise unrivaled by any of his hand  goulds drawing of the bird on its ground nest or ground contentedly taken for nest among heath and scarlettopped lichen

grayer and more graceful bird than ours natalensis wears a most wonderful dark oakleaf pattern of cloak rufigena i suppose blushes herself separate from ruficollis of gould but these foreign varieties seem countless i shall never have time to examine them but thought it not well to end the titular list of the swallows without notice of the position of this great tribe   viii  148 merula fontium

without knowing buffons name which i have only looked up now the chestnutty given from the brown on its back i should have myself always called its foot chestnutty from the shape of its lobes  my trepida will do well enough i think for a latin rendering of grebe and will include the whole group of themstagnarum remaining for this species only and the others being called tippeted trepids or muffed trepids eared trepids or majestic trepids as i find out what they wear and how they behave grèbe is used by buffon only for the larger ones and castagneux for the smaller which is absurd enough unless the smaller are also the browner  but i find in buffon some interesting particulars not given in my textnamely that the whole group differs from common chicks not only in the lobed feet but in these being set so far back becoming almost a fishs tail indeed rather than a birds legs that they are quite useless for walking and could support the bird only on land if it stood upright but that it dashes through the waves ie the larger varieties through sea waves and runs on the surface ie the smaller varieties on pools with surprising rapidity its motions are said to be never quicker and brisker than when under water it pursues the fish to a very great depth and is often caught in fishermens nets it dives deeper than the scoter duck which is taken only on beds of shellfish left bare by the ebbtide while the grebes are taken in the open sea often at more than twenty feet depth   xi  151 titania arctica    arctic fairy  tringa fulicaria l no french name given in my edition of

question the german one which must belong to the water hen for the rail is not black but prettily gray and spotted and i think buffon confuses the two birds as several popular names do thus the velvet hen also i fancy is the water hen but bewicks velvetrunner partly confirms it to the rail i find nothing about velvet said in describing the plumage  i leave linnæuss for our latin name under some protest rallus is a late latin adjective meaning thin and if understood as thinbird or lathlike bird would be reasonable but if it stand as it does practically for railing or rattling bird it is both bad latin and as far as i can make out calumnious of the usually quiet creature  note also for a connected piece of scholarship that our english verb to rail does not properly mean to scold or to abuse noisily it is from railler and means to rally or jest at which is often a much wickeder thing to do if the matter be indeed no jest  note also of samet or samite its derivation from late greek greek examitos silken stuff woven of six threads of which i believe two were of gold the french oriflamme was of crimson samite and i dont see why the french shouldnt call this bird poule de soie instead of by their present ugly namemore objectionable on all grounds of sense scholarship and feeling than the english one but see the next species   153 xiia  pulla aquatica    water hen  there seems so much confusion in the minds or at least the language of ornithologists between the water rail and water hen that i give this latter bird under the number xiia rather than xiii which would besides be an unlucky number to end my appendix with and it would be very nice if at all possible or proper to keep these two larger dabchicks connected pleasantly in schoolgirl minds by their costumes and call one silken runner and thiswhich as said above gesner seems to mean velvet runner or velvet henpoule de soie or poule de velours i am getting a little confused myself however i find at last between poules poussins pullets and pullas and must for the present leave the matter to the readers choice and fancy till i get some more birds looked at and namedonly for a pretty end of my appendix here are two bits of very precious letters sent me by friends who know birds better than most scientific people but have been too busyone in a dorcas society and the other in a childrens hospitalto write books and only now write these bits of letters on my special petition the member of the dorcas society sends me this brief but final and satisfactory answer to my above question about birds ears  we talk and think of birds as essentially musical and mimetic or at least vocal and noisy creatures and yet we seem to think that although they have an ear they have no ears little or nothing is told us of the structure of a birds ear we are now too enlightened to believe in what we cant see and ears that are never pricked or cocked or laid backthat merely receive and learn but dont expressthat are organs not features dont interest our philosophers now  if you blow gently on the feathers of the side of a birds head a little above and behind the corner of the beak a little below and behind the eye the parted feathers will show the listening place a little hole with convolutions of delicate skin turning inwards very much like what your own ear would be if you had nonei mean if all of it that lies above the level of the head had been removed leaving no trace no one who looks at the little hole could fail to see that it is an ear highly organizedan ear for music at least i found it so among the finches i have examined i know not if a simpler structure is evident in the ear of a rook or a peacock  the feathers are so planted round a birds ears that however ruffled or wet they cant get inand possibly they conduct sound birds have no need of ears with a movable cowl over them to turn and twist for the catching of stray sounds as foxes have and hares and other fourfooted things for a bird can turn his whole head so as to put his ear wherever he pleases in the twinkling of an eye and he has too many resources whatever bird he may be of voice and gesture to need any power of earcocking to welcome his friends or earflattening to menace his foes  the long and the short of it is that we may as well take the trouble first to look for and then to look at a birds earhaving first made the bird like us and trust us so much that he wont mind a human breath upon his cheek but will let us see behind the veil into the doorless corridor that lets music into the birdsoul  154 next the physician over whom to get the letter out of him i had to use the authority of a more than ordinarily imperious patient says  now for the grebes lowering themselves in water which lucy said i was to tell you about the way in which they manage it i believe to be this most birds have under their skins great airpassages which open into the lungs and which when the bird is moving quickly and consequently devouring a great deal of air do to a certain extent the work of supplementary lungs they also lessen the birds specific gravity which must be of some help in flying and in the gannet which drops into the sea from a great height after fish these airbags lessen the shock on striking the water now the grebes and all divingbirds which can swim high up out of water when the aircushions are full and so feel very little the cold of the water beneath them breathe out all spare air and sink almost out of sight when they wish to be less conspicuousjust as a balloon sinks when part of the gas is let out and i have often watched the common divers and cormorants too when frightened swimming about with only head and neck out of water and so looking more like snakes than birds  then about the dippers they fly to the bottom of a stream using their wings just as they would fly up into the air and there is the same difficulty in flying to the bottom of the stream and keeping there as there would be in flying up into the air and keeping thereperhaps greater difficulty  they can never walk comfortably along the bottom of a river as they could on the bank though i know they are often talked of as doing it they too no doubt empty their airbags to make going under water a little less difficult  155 this most valuable letter for once leaves me a minute or two disposed to ask a question which would need the skinning of a bird in a diagram to answerabout the airpassages which are a kind of supplementary lungs thinking better of it and leaving the bird to breathe in its own way i do wish we could get this dipper question settledfor here we are all at seaor at least at brook again about it and although in a book i ought to have examined beforemr robert grays birds of the west of scotland which contains a quantity of useful and amusing things and some plates remarkable for the delicate and spirited action of birds in groupsalthough i say this unusually wellgathered and wellwritten book has a nice little lithograph of two dippers and says they are quite universally distributed in scotland and called water crows and in gaelic gobha dubh nan allt which im sure must mean something nice if one knew what and though it has a lively account of the birds ways out of the watersays not a word of its ways in it except that dippers everywhere delight in deep linns and brawling rapids where their interesting motions never fail to attract the angler and birdstudent and this of their voices in early spring the male birds may be seen perched on some mosscovered stone trilling their fine clear notes and again i have stood within a few yards of one at the close of a blustering winters day and enjoyed its charming music unobserved the performer was sitting on a stake jutting from a millpond in the midst of a cold and cheerless forfarshire moor yet he joyously warbled his evening hymn with a fullness which made me
