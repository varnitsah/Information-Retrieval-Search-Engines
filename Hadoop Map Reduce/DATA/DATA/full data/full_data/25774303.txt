25774303	the talisman  by sir walter scott     introduction to the talisman  the betrothed did not greatly please one or two friends who thought that it did not well correspond to the general title of the crusaders they urged therefore that without direct allusion to the manners of the eastern tribes and to the romantic conflicts of the period the title of a tale of the crusaders would resemble the playbill which is said to have announced the tragedy of hamlet the character of the prince of denmark being left out on the other hand i felt the difficulty of giving a vivid picture of a part of the world with which i was almost totally unacquainted unless by early recollections of the arabian nights entertainments and not only did i labour under the incapacity of ignorancein which as far as regards eastern manners i was as thickly wrapped as an egyptian in his fogbut my contemporaries were many of them as much enlightened upon the subject as if they had been inhabitants of the favoured land of goshen the love of travelling had pervaded all ranks and carried the subjects of britain into all quarters of the world greece so attractive by its remains of art by its struggles for freedom against a mohammedan tyrant by its very name where every fountain had its classical legendpalestine endeared to the imagination by yet more sacred remembranceshad been of late surveyed by british eyes and described by recent travellers had i therefore attempted the difficult task of substituting manners of my own invention instead of the genuine costume of the east almost every traveller i met who had extended his route beyond what was anciently called the grand tour had acquired a right by ocular inspection to chastise me for my presumption every member of the travellers club who could pretend to have thrown his shoe over edom was by having done so constituted my lawful critic and corrector it occurred therefore that where the author of anastasius as well as he of hadji baba had described the manners and vices of the eastern nations not only with fidelity but with the humour of le sage and the ludicrous power of fielding himself one who was a perfect stranger to the subject must necessarily produce an unfavourable contrast the poet laureate also in the charming tale of thalaba had shown how extensive might be the researches of a person of acquirements and talent by dint of investigation alone into the ancient doctrines history and manners of the eastern countries in which we are probably to look for the cradle of mankind moore in his lalla rookh had successfully trod the same path in which too byron joining ocular experience to extensive reading had written some of his most attractive poems in a word the eastern themes had been already so successfully handled by those who were acknowledged to be masters of their craft that i was diffident of making the attempt  these were powerful objections nor did they lose force when they became the subject of anxious reflection although they did not finally prevail the arguments on the other side were that though i had no hope of rivalling the contemporaries whom i have mentioned yet it occurred to me as possible to acquit myself of the task i was engaged in without entering into competition with them  the period relating more immediately to the crusades which i at last fixed upon was that at which the warlike character of richard i wild and generous a pattern of chivalry with all its extravagant virtues and its no less absurd errors was opposed to that of saladin in which the christian and english monarch showed all the cruelty and violence of an eastern sultan and saladin on the other hand displayed the deep policy and prudence of a european sovereign whilst each contended which should excel the other in the knightly qualities of bravery and generosity this singular contrast afforded as the author conceived materials for a work of fiction possessing peculiar interest one of the inferior characters introduced was a supposed relation of richard coeur de liona violation of the truth of history which gave offence to mr mills the author of the history of chivalry and the crusades who was not it may be presumed aware that romantic fiction naturally includes the power of such invention which is indeed one of the requisites of the art  prince david of scotland who was actually in the host and was the hero of some very romantic adventures on his way home was also pressed into my service and constitutes one of my dramatis personae  it is true i had already brought upon the field him of the lion heart but it was in a more private capacity than he was here to be exhibited in the talismanthen as a disguised knight now in the avowed character of a conquering monarch so that i doubted not a name so dear to englishmen as that of king richard i might contribute to their amusement for more than once  i had access to all which antiquity believed whether of reality or fable on the subject of that magnificent warrior who was the proudest boast of europe and their chivalry and with whose dreadful name the saracens according to a historian of their own country were wont to rebuke their startled horses do you think said they that king richard is on the track that you stray so wildly from it the most curious register of the history of king richard is an ancient romance translated originally from the norman and at first certainly having a pretence to be termed a work of chivalry but latterly becoming stuffed with the most astonishing and monstrous fables there is perhaps no metrical romance upon record where along with curious and genuine history are mingled more absurd and exaggerated incidents we have placed in the appendix to this introduction the passage of the romance in which richard figures as an ogre or literal cannibal  a principal incident in the story is that from which the title is derived of all people who ever lived the persians were perhaps most remarkable for their unshaken credulity in amulets spells periapts and similar charms framed it was said under the influence of particular planets and bestowing high medical powers as well as the means of advancing mens fortunes in various manners a story of this kind relating to a crusader of eminence is often told in the west of scotland and the relic alluded to is still in existence and even yet held in veneration  sir simon lockhart of lee and gartland made a considerable figure in the reigns of robert the bruce and of his son david he was one of the chief of that band of scottish chivalry who accompanied james the good lord douglas on his expedition to the holy land with the heart of king robert bruce douglas impatient to get at the saracens entered into war with those of spain and was killed there lockhart proceeded to the holy land with such scottish knights as had escaped the fate of their leader and assisted for some time in the wars against the saracens  the following adventure is said by tradition to have befallen him  he made prisoner in battle an emir of considerable wealth and consequence the aged mother of the captive came to the christian camp to redeem her son from his state of captivity lockhart is said to have fixed the price at which his prisoner should ransom himself and the lady pulling out a large embroidered purse proceeded to tell down the ransom like a mother who pays little respect to gold in comparison of her sons liberty in this operation a pebble inserted in a coin some say of the lower empire fell out of the purse and the saracen matron testified so much haste to recover it as gave the scottish knight a high idea of its value when compared with gold or silver i will not consent he said to grant your sons liberty unless that amulet be added to his ransom the lady not only consented to this but explained to sir simon lockhart the mode in which the talisman was to be used and the uses to which it might be put the water in which it was dipped operated as a styptic as a febrifuge and possessed other properties as a medical talisman  sir simon lockhart after much experience of the wonders which it wrought brought it to his own country and left it to his heirs by whom and by clydesdale in general it was and is still distinguished by the name of the leepenny from the name of his native seat of lee  the most remarkable part of its history perhaps was that it so especially escaped condemnation when the church of scotland chose to impeach many other cures which savoured of the miraculous as occasioned by sorcery and censured the appeal to them excepting only that to the amulet called the leepenny to which it had pleased god to annex certain healing virtues which the church did not presume to condemn it still as has been said exists and its powers are sometimes resorted to of late they have been chiefly restricted to the cure of persons bitten by mad dogs and as the illness in such cases frequently arises from imagination there can be no reason for doubting that water which has been poured on the leepenny furnishes a congenial cure  such is the tradition concerning the talisman which the author has taken the liberty to vary in applying it to his own purposes  considerable liberties have also been taken with the truth of history both with respect to conrade of montserrats life as well as his death that conrade however was reckoned the enemy of richard is agreed both in history and romance the general opinion of the terms upon which they stood may be guessed from the proposal of the saracens that the marquis of montserrat should be invested with certain parts of syria which they were to yield to the christians richard according to the romance which bears his name could no longer repress his fury the marquis he said was a traitor who had robbed the knights hospitallers of sixty thousand pounds the present of his father henry that he was a renegade whose treachery had occasioned the loss of acre and he concluded by a solemn oath that he would cause him to be drawn to pieces by wild horses if he should ever venture to pollute the christian camp by his presence philip attempted to intercede in favour of the marquis and throwing down his glove offered to become a pledge for his fidelity to the christians but his offer was rejected and he was obliged to give way to richards impetuosityhistory of chivalry  conrade of montserrat makes a considerable figure in those wars and was at length put to death by one of the followers of the scheik or old man of the mountain nor did richard remain free of the suspicion of having instigated his death  it may be said in general that most of the incidents introduced in the following tale are fictitious and that reality where it exists is only retained in the characters of the piece  abbotsford 1st july 1832     appendix to introduction  while warring in the holy land richard was seized with an ague  the best leeches of the camp were unable to effect the cure of the kings disease but the prayers of the army were more successful he became convalescent and the first symptom of his recovery was a violent longing for pork but pork was not likely to be plentiful in a country whose inhabitants had an abhorrence for swines flesh and       though his men should be hanged      they ne might in that countrey      for gold ne silver ne no money      no pork find take ne get      that king richard might aught of eat      an old knight with richard biding      when he heard of that tiding      that the kings wants were

by richard in person the consequence of which is told in the following lines       when king richard had rested a whyle      a knight his arms gan unlace      him to comfort and solace      him was

fet the head and let him see      he fell on knees and made a cry      lo here the head  my lord mercy  the cook had certainly some reason to fear that his master would be struck with horror at the recollection of the dreadful banquet to which he owed his recovery but his fears were soon dissipated       the swarte vis black face when the king seeth      his black beard and white teeth      how

public treasure military machines and arms were delivered to the victors together with the further ransom of one hundred thousand bezants after this capitulation the following extraordinary scene took place we shall give it in the words of the humorous and amiable george ellis the collector and the editor of these romances  though the garrison had faithfully performed the other articles of their contract they were unable to restore the cross which was not in their possession and were therefore treated by the christians with great cruelty daily reports of their sufferings were carried to saladin and as many of them were persons of the highest distinction that monarch at the solicitation of their friends dispatched an embassy to king richard with magnificent presents which he offered for the ransom of the captives the ambassadors were persons the most respectable from their age their rank and their eloquence they delivered their message in terms of the utmost humility and without arraigning the justice of the conqueror in his severe treatment of their countrymen only solicited a period to that severity laying at his feet the treasures with which they were entrusted and pledging themselves and their master for the payment of any further sums which he might demand as the price of mercy       king richard spake with wordes mild      the gold to take god me shield

gratefully accepted richard in the meantime gave secret orders to his marshal that he should repair to the prison select a certain number of the most distinguished captives and after carefully noting their names on a roll of parchment cause their heads to be instantly struck off that these heads should be delivered to the cook with instructions to clear away the hair and after boiling them in a cauldron to distribute them on several platters one to each guest observing to fasten on the forehead of each the piece of parchment expressing the name and family of the victim       an hot head bring me beforn      as i were well apayed withall      eat thereof fast i shall      as it were a tender chick      to see how the others will like  this horrible order was punctually executed at noon the guests were summoned to wash by the music of the waits the king took his seat attended by the principal officers of his court at the high table and the rest of the company were marshalled at a long table below him on the cloth were placed portions of salt at the usual distances but neither bread wine nor water the ambassadors rather surprised at this omission but still free from apprehension awaited in silence the arrival of the dinner which was announced by the sound of pipes trumpets and tabours and beheld with horror and dismay the unnatural banquet introduced by the steward and his officers yet their sentiments of disgust and abhorrence and even their fears were for a time suspended by their curiosity their eyes were fixed on the king who without the slightest change of countenance swallowed the morsels as fast as they could be supplied by the knight who carved them       every man then poked other      they said this is the devils brother      that slays our men and thus hem eats  their attention was then involuntarily fixed on the smoking heads before them they traced in the swollen and distorted features the resemblance of a friend or near relation and received from the fatal scroll which accompanied each dish the sad assurance that this resemblance was not imaginary they sat in torpid silence anticipating their own fate in that of their countrymen while their ferocious entertainer with fury in his eyes but with courtesy on his lips insulted them by frequent invitations to merriment at length this first course was removed and its place supplied by venison cranes and other dainties accompanied by the richest wines the king then apologized to them for what had passed which he attributed to his ignorance of their taste and assured them of his religious respect for their characters as ambassadors and of his readiness to grant them a safeconduct for their return this boon was all that they now wished to claim and       king richard spake to an old man      wendes home to your soudan      his melancholy that ye abate      and sayes that ye came too late      too slowly was your time yguessed      ere ye came the

specimens of early english metricel romances  the reader may be curious to know owing to what circumstances so extraordinary an invention as that which imputed cannibalism to the king of england should have found its way into his history mr james to whom we owe so much that is curious seems to have traced the origin of this extraordinary rumour  with the army of the cross also was a multitude of men the same author declares who made it a profession to be without money they walked barefoot carried no arms and even preceded the beasts of burden in their march living upon roots and herbs and presenting a spectacle both disgusting and pitiable  a norman who according to all accounts was of noble birth but who having lost his horse continued to follow as a foot soldier took the strange resolution of putting himself at the head of this race of vagabonds who willingly received him as their king amongst the saracens these men became well known under the name of thafurs which guibert translates trudentes and were beheld with great horror from the general persuasion that they fed on the dead bodies of their enemies a report which was occasionally justified and which the king of the thafurs took care to encourage this respectable monarch was frequently in the habit of stopping his followers one by one in a narrow defile and of causing them to be searched carefully lest the possession of the least sum of money should render them unworthy of the name of his subjects if even two sous were found upon any one he was instantly expelled the society of his tribe the king bidding him contemptuously buy arms and fight  this troop so far from being cumbersome to the army was infinitely serviceable carrying burdens bringing in forage provisions and tribute working the machines in the sieges and above all spreading consternation among the turks who feared death from the lances of the knights less than that further consummation they heard of under the teeth of the thafurs jamess history of chivalry  it is easy to conceive that an ignorant minstrel finding the taste and ferocity of the thafurs commemorated in the historical accounts of the holy wars has ascribed their practices and propensities to the monarch of england whose ferocity was considered as an object of exaggeration as legitimate as his valour  abbotsford 1st july 1832      tales of the crusaders tale iithe talisman     chapter i       they too retired      to the wilderness but twas with arms          paradise regained  the burning sun of syria had not yet attained its highest point in the horizon when a knight of the red cross who had left his distant northern home and joined the host of the crusaders in palestine was pacing slowly along the sandy deserts which lie in the vicinity of the dead sea or as it is called the lake asphaltites where the waves of the jordan pour themselves into an inland sea from which there is no discharge of waters  the warlike pilgrim had toiled among cliffs and precipices during the earlier part of the morning more lately issuing from those rocky and dangerous defiles he had entered upon that great plain where the accursed cities provoked in ancient days the direct and dreadful vengeance of the omnipotent  the toil the thirst the dangers of the way were forgotten as the traveller recalled the fearful catastrophe which had converted into an arid and dismal wilderness the fair and fertile valley of siddim once well watered even as the garden of the lord now a parched and blighted waste condemned to eternal sterility  crossing himself as he viewed the dark mass of rolling waters in colour as in duality unlike those of any other lake the traveller shuddered as he remembered that beneath these sluggish waves lay the once proud cities of the plain whose grave was dug by the thunder of the heavens or the eruption of subterraneous fire and whose remains were hid even by that sea which holds no living fish in its bosom bears no skiff on its surface and as if its own dreadful bed were the only fit receptacle for its sullen waters sends not like other lakes a tribute to the ocean the whole land around as in the days of moses was brimstone and salt it is not sown nor beareth nor any grass groweth thereon the land as well as the lake might be termed dead as producing nothing having resemblance to vegetation and even the very air was entirely devoid of its ordinary winged inhabitants deterred probably by the odour of bitumen and sulphur which the burning sun exhaled from the waters of the lake in steaming clouds frequently assuming the appearance of waterspouts masses of the slimy and sulphureous substance called naphtha which floated idly on the sluggish and sullen waves supplied those rolling clouds with new vapours and afforded awful testimony to the truth of the mosaic history  upon this scene of desolation the sun shone with almost intolerable splendour and all living nature seemed to have hidden itself from the rays excepting the solitary figure which moved through the flitting sand at a foots pace and appeared the sole breathing thing on the wide surface of the plain the dress of the rider and the accoutrements of his horse were peculiarly unfit for the traveller in such a country a coat of linked mail with long sleeves plated gauntlets and a steel breastplate had not been esteemed a sufficient weight of armour there were also his triangular shield suspended round his neck and his barred helmet of steel over which he had a hood and collar of mail which was drawn around the warriors shoulders and throat and filled up the vacancy between the hauberk and the headpiece his lower limbs were sheathed like his body in flexible mail securing the legs and thighs while the feet rested in plated shoes which corresponded with the gauntlets a long broad straightshaped doubleedged falchion with a handle formed like a cross corresponded with a stout poniard on the other side the knight also bore secured to his saddle with one end resting on his stirrup the long steelheaded lance his own proper weapon which as he rode projected backwards and displayed its little pennoncelle to dally with the faint breeze or drop in the dead calm to this cumbrous equipment must be added a surcoat of embroidered cloth much frayed and worn which was thus far useful that it excluded the burning rays of the sun from the armour which they would otherwise have rendered intolerable to the wearer the surcoat bore in several places the arms of the owner although much defaced these seemed to be a couchant leopard with the motto i sleep wake me not an outline of the same device might be traced on his shield though many a blow had almost effaced the painting the flat top of his cumbrous cylindrical helmet was unadorned with any crest in retaining their own unwieldy defensive armour the northern crusaders seemed to set at defiance the nature of the climate and country to which they had come to war  the accoutrements of the horse were scarcely less massive and unwieldy than those of the rider the animal had a heavy saddle plated with steel uniting in front with a species of breastplate and behind with defensive armour made to cover the loins then there was a steel axe or hammer called a maceofarms and which hung to the saddlebow the reins were secured by chainwork and the frontstall of the bridle was a steel plate with apertures for the eyes and nostrils having in the midst a short sharp pike projecting from the forehead of the horse like the horn of the fabulous unicorn  but habit had made the endurance of this load of panoply a second nature both to the knight and his gallant charger numbers indeed of the western warriors who hurried to palestine died ere they became inured to the burning climate but there were others to whom that climate became innocent and even friendly and among this fortunate number was the solitary horseman who now traversed the border of the dead sea  nature which cast his limbs in a mould of uncommon strength fitted to wear his linked hauberk with as much ease as if the meshes had been formed of cobwebs had endowed him with a constitution as strong as his limbs and which bade defiance to almost all changes of climate as well as to fatigue and privations of every kind his disposition seemed in some degree to partake of the qualities of his bodily frame and as the one possessed great strength and endurance united with the power of violent exertion the other under a calm and undisturbed semblance had much of the fiery and enthusiastic love of glory which constituted the principal attribute of the renowned norman line and had rendered them sovereigns in every corner of europe where they had drawn their adventurous swords  it was not however to all the race that fortune proposed such tempting rewards and those obtained by the solitary knight during two years campaign in palestine had been only temporal fame and as he was taught to believe spiritual privileges meantime his slender stock of money had melted away the rather that he did not pursue any of the ordinary modes by which the followers of the crusade condescended to recruit their diminished resources at the expense of the people of palestinehe exacted no gifts from the wretched natives for sparing their possessions when engaged in warfare with the saracens and he had not availed himself of any opportunity of enriching himself by the ransom of prisoners of consequence the small train which had followed him from his native country had been gradually diminished as the means of maintaining them disappeared and his only remaining squire was at present on a sickbed and unable to attend his master who travelled as we have seen singly and alone this was of little consequence to the crusader who was accustomed to consider his good sword as his safest escort and devout thoughts as his best companion  nature had however her demands for refreshment and repose even on the iron frame and patient disposition of the knight of the sleeping leopard and at noon when the dead sea lay at some distance on his right he joyfully hailed the sight of two or three palmtrees which arose beside the well which was assigned for his midday station his good horse too which had plodded forward with the steady endurance of his master now lifted his head expanded his nostrils and quickened his pace as if he snuffed afar off the living waters which marked the place of repose and refreshment but labour and danger were doomed to intervene ere the horse or horseman reached the desired spot  as the knight of the couchant leopard continued to fix his eyes attentively on the yet distant cluster of palmtrees it seemed to him as if some object was moving among them the distant form separated itself from the trees which partly hid its motions and advanced towards the knight with a speed which soon showed a mounted horseman whom his turban long spear and green caftan floating in the wind on his nearer approach showed to be a saracen cavalier in the desert saith an eastern proverb no man meets a friend the crusader was totally indifferent whether the infidel who now approached on his gallant barb as if borne on the wings of an eagle came as friend or foeperhaps as a vowed champion of the cross he might rather have preferred the latter he disengaged his lance from his saddle seized it with the right hand placed it in rest with its point half elevated gathered up the reins in the left waked his horses mettle with the spur and prepared to encounter the stranger with the calm selfconfidence belonging to the victor in many contests  the saracen came on at the speedy gallop of an arab horseman managing his steed more by his limbs and the inflection of his body than by any use of the reins which hung loose in his left hand so that he was enabled to wield the light round buckler of the skin of the rhinoceros ornamented with silver loops which he wore on his arm swinging it as if he meant to oppose its slender circle to the formidable thrust of the western lance his own long spear was not couched or levelled like that of his antagonist but grasped by the middle with his right hand and brandished at armslength above his head as the cavalier approached his enemy at full career he seemed to expect that the knight of the leopard should put his horse to the gallop to encounter him but the christian knight well acquainted with the customs of eastern warriors did not mean to exhaust his good horse by any unnecessary exertion and on the contrary made a dead halt confident that if the enemy advanced to the actual shock his own weight and that of his powerful charger would give him sufficient advantage without the additional momentum of rapid motion equally sensible and apprehensive of such a probable result the saracen cavalier when he had approached towards the christian within twice the length of his lance wheeled his steed to the left with inimitable dexterity and rode twice around his antagonist who turning without quitting his ground and presenting his front constantly to his enemy frustrated his attempts to attack him on an unguarded point so that the saracen wheeling his horse was fain to retreat to the distance of a hundred yards a second time like a hawk attacking a heron the heathen renewed the charge and a second time was fain to retreat without coming to a close struggle a third time he approached in the same manner when the christian knight desirous to terminate this illusory warfare in which he might at length have been worn out by the activity of his foeman suddenly seized the mace which hung at his saddlebow and with a strong hand and unerring aim hurled it against the head of the emir for such and not less his enemy appeared the saracen was just aware of the formidable missile in time to interpose his light buckler betwixt the mace and his head but the violence of the blow forced the buckler down on his turban and though that defence also contributed to deaden its violence the saracen was beaten from his horse ere the christian could avail himself of this mishap his nimble foeman sprung from the ground and calling on his steed which instantly returned to his side he leaped into his seat without touching the stirrup and regained all the advantage of which the knight of the leopard hoped to deprive him but the latter had in the meanwhile recovered his mace and the eastern cavalier who remembered the strength and dexterity with which his antagonist had aimed it seemed to keep cautiously out of reach of that weapon of which he had so lately felt the force while he showed his purpose of waging a distant warfare with missile weapons of his own planting his long spear in the sand at a distance from the scene of combat he strung with great address a short bow which he carried at his back and putting his horse to the gallop once more described two or three circles of a wider extent than formerly in the course of which he discharged six arrows at the christian with such unerring skill that the goodness of his harness alone saved him from being wounded in as many places the seventh shaft apparently found a less perfect part of the armour and the christian dropped heavily from his horse but what was the surprise of the saracen when dismounting to examine the condition of his prostrate enemy he found himself suddenly within the grasp of the european who had had recourse to this artifice to bring his enemy within his reach even in this deadly grapple the saracen was saved by his agility and presence of mind he unloosed the swordbelt in which the knight of the leopard had fixed his hold and thus eluding his fatal grasp mounted his horse which seemed to watch his motions with the intelligence of a human being and again rode off but in the last encounter the saracen had lost his sword and his quiver of arrows both of which were attached to the girdle which he was obliged to abandon he had also lost his turban in the struggle  these disadvantages seemed to incline the moslem to a truce he approached the christian with his right hand extended but no longer in a menacing attitude  there is truce betwixt our nations he said in the lingua franca commonly used for the purpose of communication with the crusaders wherefore should there be war betwixt thee and me let there be peace betwixt us  i am well contented answered he of the couchant leopard but what security dost thou offer that thou wilt observe the truce  the word of a follower of the prophet was never broken answered the emir it is thou brave nazarene from whom i should demand security did i not know that treason seldom dwells with courage  the crusader felt that the confidence of the moslem made him ashamed of his own doubts  by the cross of my sword he said laying his hand on the weapon as he spoke i will be true companion to thee saracen while our fortune wills that we remain in company together  by mohammed prophet of god and by allah god of the prophet replied his late foeman there is not treachery in my heart towards thee and now wend we to yonder fountain for the hour of rest is at hand and the stream had hardly touched my lip when i was called to battle by thy approach  the knight of the couchant leopard yielded a ready and courteous assent and the late foes without an angry look or gesture of doubt rode side by side to the little cluster of palmtrees    chapter ii  times of danger have always and in a peculiar degree their seasons of goodwill and security and this was particularly so in the ancient feudal ages in which as the manners of the period had assigned war to be the chief and most worthy occupation of mankind the intervals of peace or rather of truce were highly relished by those warriors to whom they were seldom granted and endeared by the very circumstances which rendered them transitory it is not worth while preserving any permanent enmity against a foe whom a champion has fought with today and may again stand in bloody opposition to on the next morning the time and situation afforded so much room for the ebullition of violent passions that men unless when peculiarly opposed to each other or provoked by the recollection of private and individual wrongs cheerfully enjoyed in each others society the brief intervals of pacific intercourse which a warlike life admitted  the distinction of religions nay the fanatical zeal which animated the followers of the cross and of the crescent against each other was much softened by a feeling so natural to generous combatants and especially cherished by the spirit of chivalry this last strong impulse had extended itself gradually from the christians to their mortal enemies the saracens both of spain and of palestine the latter were indeed no longer the fanatical savages who had burst from the centre of arabian deserts with the sabre in one hand and the koran in the other to inflict death or the faith of mohammed or at the best slavery and tribute upon all who dared to oppose the belief of the prophet of mecca these alternatives indeed had been offered to the unwarlike greeks and syrians but in contending with the western christians animated by a zeal as fiery as their own and possessed of as unconquerable courage address and success in arms the saracens gradually caught a part of their manners and especially of those chivalrous observances which were so well calculated to charm the minds of a proud and conquering people they had their tournaments and games of chivalry they had even their knights or some rank analogous and above all the saracens observed their plighted faith with an accuracy which might sometimes put to shame those who owned a better religion their truces whether national or betwixt individuals were faithfully observed and thus it was that war in itself perhaps the greatest of evils yet gave occasion for display of good faith generosity clemency and even kindly affections which less frequently occur in more tranquil periods where the passions of men experiencing wrongs or entertaining quarrels which cannot be brought to instant decision are apt to smoulder for a length of time in the bosoms of those who are so unhappy as to be their prey  it was under the influence of these milder feelings which soften the horrors of warfare that the christian and saracen who had so lately done their best for each others mutual destruction rode at a slow pace towards the fountain of palmtrees to which the knight of the couchant leopard had been tending when interrupted in midpassage by his fleet and dangerous adversary each was wrapt for some time in his own reflections and took breath after an encounter which had threatened to be fatal to one or both and their good horses seemed no less to enjoy the interval of repose  that of the saracen however though he had been forced into much the more violent and extended sphere of motion appeared to have suffered less from fatigue than the charger of the european knight the sweat hung still clammy on the limbs of the latter when those of the noble arab were completely dried by the interval of tranquil exercise all saving the foamflakes which were still visible on his bridle and housings the loose soil on which he trod so much augmented the distress of the christians horse heavily loaded by his own armour and the weight of his rider that the latter jumped from his saddle and led his charger along the deep dust of the loamy soil which was burnt in the sun into a substance more impalpable than the finest sand and thus gave the faithful horse refreshment at the expense of his own additional toil for ironsheathed as he was he sunk over the mailed shoes at every step which he placed on a surface so light and unresisting  you are right said the saracenand it was the first word that either had spoken since their truce was concluded your strong horse deserves your care but what do you in the desert with an animal which sinks over the fetlock at every step as if he would plant each foot deep as the root of a datetree  thou speakest rightly saracen said the christian knight not delighted at the tone with which the infidel criticized his favourite steedrightly according to thy knowledge and observation but my good horse hath ere now borne me in mine own land over as wide a lake as thou seest yonder spread out behind us yet not wet one hair above his hoof  the saracen looked at him with as much surprise as his manners permitted him to testify which was only expressed by a slight approach to a disdainful smile that hardly curled perceptibly the broad thick moustache which enveloped his upper lip  it is justly spoken he said instantly composing himself to his usual serene gravity list to a frank and hear a fable  thou art not courteous misbeliever replied the crusader to doubt the word of a dubbed knight and were it not that thou speakest in ignorance and not in malice our truce had its ending ere it is well begun thinkest thou i tell thee an untruth when i say that i one of five hundred horsemen armed in complete mail have riddenay and ridden for miles upon water as solid as the crystal and ten times less brittle  what wouldst thou tell me answered the moslem yonder inland sea thou dost point at is peculiar in this that by the especial curse of god it suffereth nothing to sink in its waves but wafts them away and casts them on its margin but neither the dead sea nor any of the seven oceans which environ the earth will endure on their surface the pressure of a horses foot more than the red sea endured to sustain the advance of pharaoh and his host  you speak truth after your knowledge saracen said the christian knight and yet trust me i fable not according to mine heat in this climate converts the soil into something almost as unstable as water and in my land cold often converts the water itself into a substance as hard as rock let us speak of this no longer for the thoughts of the calm clear blue refulgence of a winters lake glimmering to stars and moonbeam aggravate the horrors of this fiery desert where methinks the very air which we breathe is like the vapour of a fiery furnace seven times heated  the saracen looked on him with some attention as if to discover in what sense he was to understand words which to him must have appeared either to contain something of mystery or of imposition at length he seemed determined in what manner to receive the language of his new companion  you are he said of a nation that loves to laugh and you make sport with yourselves and with others by telling what is impossible and reporting what never chanced thou art one of the knights of france who hold it for glee and pastime to gab as they term it of exploits that are beyond human power gaber this french word signified a sort of sport much used among the french chivalry which consisted in vying with each other in making the most romantic gasconades the verb and the meaning are retained in scottish i were wrong to challenge for the time the privilege of thy speech since boasting is more natural to thee than truth  i am not of their land neither of their fashion said the knight which is as thou well sayest to gab of that which they dare not undertakeor undertaking cannot perfect but in this i have imitated their folly brave saracen that in talking to thee of what thou canst not comprehend i have even in speaking most simple truth fully incurred the character of a braggart in thy eyes so i pray you let my words pass  they had now arrived at the knot of palmtrees and the fountain which welled out from beneath their shade in sparkling profusion  we have spoken of a moment of truce in the midst of war and this a spot of beauty in the midst of a sterile desert was scarce less dear to the imagination it was a scene which perhaps would elsewhere have deserved little notice but as the single speck in a boundless horizon which promised the refreshment of shade and living water these blessings held cheap where they are common rendered the fountain and its neighbourhood a little paradise some generous or charitable hand ere yet the evil days of palestine began had walled in and arched over the fountain to preserve it from being absorbed in the earth or choked by the flitting clouds of dust with which the least breath of wind covered the desert the arch was now broken and partly ruinous but it still so far projected over and covered in the fountain that it excluded the sun in a great measure from its waters which hardly touched by a straggling beam while all around was blazing lay in a steady repose alike delightful to the eye and the imagination stealing from under the arch they were first received in a marble basin much defaced indeed but still cheering the eye by showing that the place was anciently considered as a station that the hand of man had been there and that mans accommodation had been in some measure attended to the thirsty and weary traveller was reminded by these signs that others had suffered similar difficulties reposed in the same spot and doubtless found their way in safety to a more fertile country again the scarce visible current which escaped from the basin served to nourish the few trees which surrounded the fountain and where it sunk into the ground and disappeared its refreshing presence was acknowledged by a carpet of velvet verdure  in this delightful spot the two warriors halted and each after his own fashion proceeded to relieve his horse from saddle bit and rein and permitted the animals to drink at the basin ere they refreshed themselves from the fountain head which arose under the vault they then suffered the steeds to go loose confident that their interest as well as their domesticated habits would prevent their straying from the pure water and fresh grass  christian and saracen next sat down together on the turf and produced each the small allowance of store which they carried for their own refreshment yet ere they severally proceeded to their scanty meal they eyed each other with that curiosity which the close and doubtful conflict in which they had been so lately engaged was calculated to inspire each was desirous to measure the strength and form some estimate of the character of an adversary so formidable and each was compelled to acknowledge that had he fallen in the conflict it had been by a noble hand  the champions formed a striking contrast to each other in person and features and might have formed no inaccurate representatives of their different nations the frank seemed a powerful man built after the ancient gothic cast of form with light brown hair which on the removal of his helmet was seen to curl thick and profusely over his head his features had acquired from the hot climate a hue much darker than those parts of his neck which were less frequently exposed to view or than was warranted by his full and wellopened blue eye the colour of his hair and of the moustaches which thickly shaded his upper lip while his chin was carefully divested of beard after the norman fashion his nose was grecian and well formed his mouth rather large in proportion but filled with wellset strong and beautifully white teeth his head small and set upon the neck with much grace his age could not exceed thirty but if the effects of toil and climate were allowed for might be three or four years under that period his form was tall powerful and athletic like that of a man whose strength might in later life become unwieldy but which was hitherto united with lightness and activity his hands when he withdrew the mailed gloves were long fair and wellproportioned the wristbones peculiarly large and strong and the arms remarkably wellshaped and brawny a military hardihood and careless frankness of expression characterized his language and his motions and his voice had the tone of one more accustomed to command than to obey and who was in the habit of expressing his sentiments aloud and boldly whenever he was called upon to announce them  the saracen emir formed a marked and striking contrast with the western crusader his stature was indeed above the middle size but he was at least three inches shorter than the european whose size approached the gigantic his slender limbs and long spare hands and arms though well proportioned to his person and suited to the style of his countenance did not at first aspect promise the display of vigour and elasticity which the emir had lately exhibited but on looking more closely his limbs where exposed to view seemed divested of all that was fleshy or cumbersome so that nothing being left but bone brawn and sinew it was a frame fitted for exertion and fatigue far beyond that of a bulky champion whose strength and size are counterbalanced by weight and who is exhausted by his own exertions the countenance of the saracen naturally bore a general national resemblance to the eastern tribe from whom he descended and was as unlike as possible to the exaggerated terms in which the minstrels of the day were wont to represent the infidel champions and the fabulous description which a sister art still presents as the saracens head upon signposts his features were small wellformed and delicate though deeply embrowned by the eastern sun and terminated by a flowing and curled black beard which seemed trimmed with peculiar care the nose was straight and regular the eyes keen deepset black and glowing and his teeth equalled in beauty the ivory of his deserts the person and proportions of the saracen in short stretched on the turf near to his powerful antagonist might have been compared to his sheeny and crescentformed sabre with its narrow and light but bright and keen damascus blade contrasted with the long and ponderous gothic warsword which was flung unbuckled on the same sod the emir was in the very flower of his age and might perhaps have been termed eminently beautiful but for the narrowness of his forehead and something of too much thinness and sharpness of feature or at least what might have seemed such in a european estimate of beauty  the manners of the eastern warrior were grave graceful and decorous indicating however in some particulars the habitual restraint which men of warm and choleric tempers often set as a guard upon their native impetuosity of disposition and at the same time a sense of his own dignity which seemed to impose a certain formality of behaviour in him who entertained it  this haughty feeling of superiority was perhaps equally entertained by his new european acquaintance but the effect was different and the same feeling which dictated to the christian knight a bold blunt and somewhat careless bearing as one too conscious of his own importance to be anxious about the opinions of others appeared to prescribe to the saracen a style of courtesy more studiously and formally observant of ceremony both were courteous but the courtesy of the christian seemed to flow rather from a good humoured sense of what was due to others that of the moslem from a high feeling of what was to be expected from himself  the provision which each had made for his refreshment was simple but the meal of the saracen was abstemious a handful of dates and a morsel of coarse barleybread sufficed to relieve the hunger of the latter whose education had habituated them to the fare of the desert although since their syrian conquests the arabian simplicity of life frequently gave place to the most unbounded profusion of luxury a few draughts from the lovely fountain by which they reposed completed his meal that of the christian though coarse was more genial dried hogs flesh the abomination of the moslemah was the chief part of his repast and his drink derived from a leathern bottle contained something better than pure element he fed with more display of appetite and drank with more appearance of satisfaction than the saracen judged it becoming to show in the performance of a mere bodily function and doubtless the secret contempt which each entertained for the other as the follower of a false religion was considerably increased by the marked difference of their diet and manners but each had found the weight of his opponents arm and the mutual respect which the bold struggle had created was sufficient to subdue other and inferior considerations yet the saracen could not help remarking the circumstances which displeased him in the christians conduct and manners and after he had witnessed for some time in silence the keen appetite which protracted the knights banquet long after his own was concluded he thus addressed him  valiant nazarene is it fitting that one who can fight like a man should feed like a dog or a wolf even a misbelieving jew would shudder at the food which you seem to eat with as much relish as if it were fruit from the trees of paradise  valiant saracen answered the christian looking up with some surprise at the accusation thus unexpectedly brought know thou that i exercise my christian freedom in using that which is forbidden to the jews being as they esteem themselves under the bondage of the old law of moses we saracen be it known to thee have a better warrant for what we doave mariabe we thankful and as if in defiance of his companions scruples he concluded a short latin grace with a long draught from the leathern bottle  that too you call a part of your liberty said the saracen and as you feed like the brutes so you degrade yourself to the bestial condition by drinking a poisonous liquor which even they refuse  know foolish saracen replied the christian without hesitation that thou blasphemest the gifts of god even with the blasphemy of thy father ishmael the juice of the grape is given to him that will use it wisely as that which cheers the heart of man after toil refreshes him in sickness and comforts him in sorrow he who so enjoyeth it may thank god for his winecup as for his daily bread and he who abuseth the gift of heaven is not a greater fool in his intoxication than thou in thine abstinence  the keen eye of the saracen kindled at this sarcasm and his hand sought the hilt of his poniard it was but a momentary thought however and died away in the recollection of the powerful champion with whom he had to deal and the desperate grapple the impression of which still throbbed in his limbs and veins and he contented himself with pursuing the contest in colloquy as more convenient for the time  thy words he said o nazarene might create anger did not thy ignorance raise compassion seest thou not o thou more blind than any who asks alms at the door of the mosque that the liberty thou dost boast of is restrained even in that which is dearest to mans happiness and to his household and that thy law if thou dost practise it binds thee in marriage to one single mate be she sick or healthy be she fruitful or barren bring she comfort and joy or clamour and strife to thy table and to thy bed this nazarene i do indeed call slavery whereas to the faithful hath the prophet assigned upon earth the patriarchal privileges of abraham our father and of solomon the wisest of mankind having given us here a succession of beauty at our pleasure and beyond the grave the blackeyed houris of paradise  now by his name that i most reverence in heaven said the christian and by hers whom i most worship on earth thou art but a blinded and a bewildered infidelthat diamond signet which thou wearest on thy finger thou holdest it doubtless as of inestimable value  balsora and bagdad cannot show the like replied the saracen but what avails it to our purpose  much replied the frank as thou shalt thyself confess take my waraxe and dash the stone into twenty shivers would each fragment be as valuable as the original gem or would they all collected bear the tenth part of its estimation  that is a childs question answered the saracen the fragments of such a stone would not equal the entire jewel in the degree of hundreds to one  saracen replied the christian warrior the love which a true knight binds on one only fair and faithful is the gem entire the affection thou flingest among thy enslaved wives and halfwedded slaves is worthless comparatively as the sparkling shivers of the broken diamond  now by the holy caaba said the emir thou art a madman who hugs his chain of iron as if it were of gold look more closely this ring of mine would lose half its beauty were not the signet encircled and enchased with these lesser brilliants which grace it and set it off the central diamond is man firm and entire his value depending on himself alone and this circle of lesser jewels are women borrowing his lustre which he deals out to them as best suits his pleasure or his convenience take the central stone from the signet and the diamond itself remains as valuable as ever while the lesser gems are comparatively of little value and this is the true reading of thy parable for what sayeth the poet mansour it is the favour of man which giveth beauty and comeliness to woman as the stream glitters no longer when the sun ceaseth to shine  saracen replied the crusader thou speakest like one who never saw a woman worthy the affection of a soldier believe me couldst thou look upon those of europe to whom after heaven we of the order of knighthood vow fealty and devotion thou wouldst loathe for ever the poor sensual slaves who form thy haram the beauty of our fair ones gives point to our spears and edge to our swords their words are our law and as soon will a lamp shed lustre when unkindled as a knight distinguish himself by feats of arms having no mistress of his affection  i have heard of this frenzy among the warriors of the west said the emir and have ever accounted it one of the accompanying symptoms of that insanity which brings you hither to obtain possession of an empty sepulchre but yet methinks so highly have the franks whom i have met with extolled the beauty of their women i could be well contented to behold with mine own eyes those charms which can transform such brave warriors into the tools of their pleasure  brave saracen said the knight if i were not on a pilgrimage to the holy sepulchre it should be my pride to conduct you on assurance of safety to the camp of richard of england than whom none knows better how to do honour to a noble foe and though i be poor and unattended yet have i interest to secure for thee or any such as thou seemest not safety only but respect and esteem there shouldst thou see several of the fairest beauties of france and britain form a small circle the brilliancy of which exceeds tenthousandfold the lustre of mines of diamonds such as thine  now by the cornerstone of the caaba said the saracen i will accept thy invitation as freely as it is given if thou wilt postpone thy present intent and credit me brave nazarene it were better for thyself to turn back thy horses head towards the camp of thy people for to travel towards jerusalem without a passport is but a wilful castingaway of thy life  i have a pass answered the knight producing a parchment under saladins hand and signet  the saracen bent his head to the dust as he recognized the seal and handwriting of the renowned soldan of egypt and syria and having kissed the paper with profound respect he pressed it to his forehead then returned it to the christian saying rash frank thou hast sinned against thine own blood and mine for not showing this to me when we met  you came with levelled spear said the knight had a troop of saracens so assailed me it might have stood with my honour to have shown the soldans pass but never to one man  and yet one man said the saracen haughtily was enough to interrupt your journey  true brave moslem replied the christian but there are few such as thou art such falcons fly not in flocks or if they do they pounce not in numbers upon one  thou dost us but justice said the saracen evidently gratified by the compliment as he had been touched by the implied scorn of the europeans previous boast from us thou shouldst have had no wrong but well was it for me that i failed to slay thee with the safeguard of the king of kings upon thy person certain it were that the cord or the sabre had justly avenged such guilt  i am glad to hear that its influence shall be availing to me said the knight for i have heard that the road is infested with robbertribes who regard nothing in comparison of an opportunity of plunder  the truth has been told to thee brave christian said the saracen but i swear to thee by the turban of the prophet that shouldst thou miscarry in any haunt of such villains i will myself undertake thy revenge with five thousand horse i will slay every male of them and send their women into such distant captivity that the name of their tribe shall never again be heard within five hundred miles of damascus i will sow with salt the foundations of their village and there shall never live thing dwell there even from that time forward  i had rather the trouble which you design for yourself were in revenge of some other more important person than of me noble emir replied the knight but my vow is recorded in heaven for good or for evil and i must be indebted to you for pointing me out the way to my restingplace for this evening  that said the saracen must be under the black covering of my fathers tent  this night answered the christian i must pass in prayer and penitence with a holy man theodorick of engaddi who dwells amongst these wilds and spends his life in the service of god  i will at least see you safe thither said the saracen  that would be pleasant convoy for me said the christian yet might endanger the future security of the good father for the cruel hand of your people has been red with the blood of the servants of the lord and therefore do we come hither in plate and mail with sword and lance to open the road to the holy sepulchre and protect the chosen saints and anchorites who yet dwell in this land of promise and of miracle  nazarene said the moslem in this the greeks and syrians have much belied us seeing we do but after the word of abubeker alwakel the successor of the prophet and after him the first commander of true believers go forth he said yezed ben sophian when he sent that renowned general to take syria from the infidels quit yourselves like men in battle but slay neither the aged the infirm the women nor the children waste not the land neither destroy corn and fruittrees they are the gifts of allah keep faith when you have made any covenant even if it be to your own harm if ye find holy men labouring with their hands and serving god in the desert hurt them not neither destroy their dwellings but when you find them with shaven crowns they are of the synagogue of satan smite with the sabre slay cease not till they become believers or tributaries as the caliph companion of the prophet hath told us so have we done and those whom our justice has smitten are but the priests of satan but unto the good men who without stirring up nation against nation worship sincerely in the faith of issa ben mariam we are a shadow and a shield and such being he whom you seek even though the light of the prophet hath not reached him from me he will only have love favour and regard  the anchorite whom i would now visit said the warlike pilgrim is i have heard no priest but were he of that anointed and sacred order i would prove with my good lance against paynim and infidel  let us not defy each other brother interrupted the saracen we shall find either of us enough of franks or of moslemah on whom to exercise both sword and lance this theodorick is protected both by turk and arab and though one of strange conditions at intervals yet on the whole he bears himself so well as the follower of his own prophet that he merits the protection of him who was sent  now by our lady saracen exclaimed the christian if thou darest name in the same breath the cameldriver of mecca with  an electrical shock of passion thrilled through the form of the emir but it was only momentary and the calmness of his reply had both dignity and reason in it when he said slander not him whom thou knowest notthe rather that we venerate the founder of thy religion while we condemn the doctrine which your priests have spun from it i will myself guide thee to the cavern of the hermit which methinks without my help thou wouldst find it a hard matter to reach and on the way let us leave to mollahs and to monks to dispute about the divinity of our faith and speak on themes which belong to youthful warriorsupon battles upon beautiful women upon sharp swords and upon bright armour    chapter iii  the warriors arose from their place of brief rest and simple refreshment and courteously aided each other while they carefully replaced and adjusted the harness from which they had relieved for the time their trusty steeds each seemed familiar with an employment which at that time was a part of necessary and indeed of indispensable duty each also seemed to possess as far as the difference betwixt the animal and rational species admitted the confidence and affection of the horse which was the constant companion of his travels and his warfare with the saracen this familiar intimacy was a part of his early habits for in the tents of the eastern military tribes the horse of the soldier ranks next to and almost equal in importance with his wife and his family and with the european warrior circumstances and indeed necessity rendered his warhorse scarcely less than his brother in arms the steeds therefore suffered themselves quietly to be taken from their food and liberty and neighed and snuffled fondly around their masters while they were adjusting their accoutrements for further travel and additional toil and each warrior as he prosecuted his own task or assisted with courtesy his companion looked with observant curiosity at the equipments of his fellowtraveller and noted particularly what struck him as peculiar in the fashion in which he arranged his riding accoutrements  ere they remounted to resume their journey the christian knight again moistened his lips and dipped his hands in the living fountain and said to his pagan associate of the journey i would i knew the name of this delicious fountain that i might hold it in my grateful remembrance for never did water slake more deliciously a more oppressive thirst than i have this day experienced  it is called in the arabic language answered the saracen by a name which signifies the diamond of the desert  and well is it so named replied the christian my native valley hath a thousand springs but not to one of them shall i attach hereafter such precious recollection as to this solitary fount which bestows its liquid treasures where they are not only delightful but nearly indispensable  you say truth said the saracen for the curse is still on yonder sea of death and neither man nor beast drinks of its waves nor of the river which feeds without filling it until this inhospitable desert be passed  they mounted and pursued their journey across the sandy waste the ardour of noon was now past and a light breeze somewhat alleviated the terrors of the desert though not without bearing on its wings an impalpable dust which the saracen little heeded though his heavilyarmed companion felt it as such an annoyance that he hung his iron casque at his saddlebow and substituted the light ridingcap termed in the language of the time a mortier from its resemblance in shape to an ordinary mortar they rode together for some time in silence the saracen performing the part of director and guide of the journey which he did by observing minute marks and bearings of the distant rocks to a ridge of which they were gradually approaching for a little time he seemed absorbed in the task as a pilot when navigating a vessel through a difficult channel but they had not proceeded half a league when he seemed secure of his route and disposed with more frankness than was usual to his nation to enter into conversation  you have asked the name he said of a mute fountain which hath the semblance but not the reality of a living thing let me be pardoned to ask the name of the companion with whom i have this day encountered both in danger and in repose and which i cannot fancy unknown even here among the deserts of palestine  it is not yet worth publishing said the christian know however that among the soldiers of the cross i am called kennethkenneth of the couching leopard at home i have other titles but they would sound harsh in an eastern ear brave saracen let me ask which of the tribes of arabia claims your descent and by what name you are known  sir kenneth said the moslem i joy that your name is such as my lips can easily utter for me i am no arab yet derive my descent from a line neither less wild nor less warlike know sir knight of the leopard that i am sheerkohf the lion of the mountain and that kurdistan from which i derive my descent holds no family more noble than that of seljook  i have heard answered the christian that your great soldan claims his blood from the same source  thanks to the prophet that hath so far honoured our mountains as to send from their bosom him whose word is victory answered the paynim i am but as a worm before the king of egypt and syria and yet in my own land something my name may avail stranger with how many men didst thou come on this warfare  by my faith said sir kenneth with aid of friends and kinsmen i was hardly pinched to furnish forth ten wellappointed lances with maybe some fifty more men archers and varlets included some have deserted my unlucky pennonsome have fallen in battleseveral have died of diseaseand one trusty armourbearer for whose life i am now doing my pilgrimage lies on the bed of sickness  christian said sheerkohf here i have five arrows in my quiver each feathered from the wing of an eagle when i send one of them to my tents a thousand warriors mount on horsebackwhen i send another an equal force will arisefor the five i can command five thousand men and if i send my bow ten thousand mounted riders will shake the desert and with thy fifty followers thou hast come to invade a land in which i am one of the meanest  now by the rood saracen retorted the western warrior thou shouldst know ere thou vauntest thyself that one steel glove can crush a whole handful of hornets  ay but it must first enclose them within its grasp said the saracen with a smile which might have endangered their new alliance had he not changed the subject by adding and is bravery so much esteemed amongst the christian princes that thou thus void of means and of men canst offer as thou didst of late to be my protector and security in the camp of thy brethren  know saracen said the christian since such is thy style that the name of a knight and the blood of a gentleman entitle him to place himself on the same rank with sovereigns even of the first degree in so far as regards all but regal authority and dominion were richard of england himself to wound the honour of a knight as poor as i am he could not by the law of chivalry deny him the combat  methinks i should like to look upon so strange a scene said the emir in which a leathern belt and a pair of spurs put the poorest on a level with the most powerful  you must add free blood and a fearless heart said the christian then perhaps you will not have spoken untruly of the dignity of knighthood  and mix you as boldly amongst the females of your chiefs and leaders asked the saracen  god forbid said the knight of the leopard that the poorest knight in christendom should not be free in all honourable service to devote his hand and sword the fame of his actions and the fixed devotion of his heart to the fairest princess who ever wore coronet on her brow  but a little while since said the saracen and you described love as the highest treasure of the heartthine hath undoubtedly been high and nobly bestowed  stranger answered the christian blushing deeply as he spoke we tell not rashly where it is we have bestowed our choicest treasures it is enough for thee to know that as thou sayest my love is highly and nobly bestowedmost highlymost nobly but if thou wouldst hear of love and broken lances venture thyself as thou sayest to the camp of the crusaders and thou wilt find exercise for thine ears and if thou wilt for thy hands too  the eastern warrior raising himself in his stirrups and shaking aloft his lance replied hardly i fear shall i find one with a crossed shoulder who will exchange with me the cast of the jerrid  i will not promise for that replied the knight though there be in the camp certain spaniards who have right good skill in your eastern game of hurling the javelin  dogs and sons of dogs ejaculated the saracen what have these spaniards to do to come hither to combat the true believers who in their own land are their lords and taskmasters with them i would mix in no warlike pastime  let not the knights of leon or asturias hear you speak thus of them said the knight of the leopard but added he smiling at the recollection of the mornings combat if instead of a reed you were inclined to stand the cast of a battleaxe there are enough of western warriors who would gratify your longing  by the beard of my father sir said the saracen with an approach to laughter the game is too rough for mere sport i will never shun them in battle but my head pressing his hand to his brow will not for a while permit me to seek them in sport  i would you saw the axe of king richard answered the western warrior to which that which hangs at my saddlebow weighs but as a feather  we hear much of that island sovereign said the saracen art thou one of his subjects  one of his followers i am for this expedition answered the knight and honoured in the service but not born his subject although a native of the island in which he reigns  how mean you  said the eastern soldier have you then two kings in one poor island  as thou sayest said the scot for such was sir kenneth by birth it is even so and yet although the inhabitants of the two extremities of that island are engaged in frequent war the country can as thou seest furnish forth such a body of menatarms as may go far to shake the unholy hold which your master hath laid on the cities of zion  by the beard of saladin nazarene but that it is a thoughtless and boyish folly i could laugh at the simplicity of your great sultan who comes hither to make conquests of deserts and rocks and dispute the possession of them with those who have tenfold numbers at command while he leaves a part of his narrow islet in which he was born a sovereign to the dominion of another sceptre than his surely sir kenneth you and the other good men of your country should have submitted yourselves to the dominion of this king richard ere you left your native land divided against itself to set forth on this expedition  hasty and fierce was kenneths answer no by the bright light of heaven if the king of england had not set forth to the crusade till he was sovereign of scotland the crescent might for me and all truehearted scots glimmer for ever on the walls of zion  thus far he had proceeded when suddenly recollecting himself he muttered mea culpa mea culpa what have i a soldier of the cross to do with recollection of war betwixt christian nations  the rapid expression of feeling corrected by the dictates of duty did not escape the moslem who if he did not entirely understand all which it conveyed saw enough to convince him with the assurance that christians as well as moslemah had private feelings of personal pique and national quarrels which were not entirely reconcilable but the saracens were a race polished perhaps to the utmost extent which their religion permitted and particularly capable of entertaining high ideas of courtesy and politeness and such sentiments prevented his taking any notice of the inconsistency of sir kenneths feelings in the opposite characters of a scot and a crusader  meanwhile as they advanced the scene began to change around them they were now turning to the eastward and had reached the range of steep and barren hills which binds in that quarter the naked plain and varies the surface of the country without changing its sterile character sharp rocky eminences began to rise around them and in a short time deep declivities and ascents both formidable in height and difficult from the narrowness of the path offered to the travellers obstacles of a different kind from those with which they had recently contended  dark caverns and chasms amongst the rocksthose grottoes so often alluded to in scriptureyawned fearfully on either side as they proceeded and the scottish knight was informed by the emir that these were often the refuge of beasts of prey or of men still more ferocious who driven to desperation by the constant war and the oppression exercised by the soldiery as well of the cross as of the crescent had become robbers and spared neither rank nor religion neither sex nor age in their depredations  the scottish knight listened with indifference to the accounts of ravages committed by wild beasts or wicked men secure as he felt himself in his own valour and personal strength but he was struck with mysterious dread when he recollected that he was now in the awful wilderness of the forty days fast and the scene of the actual personal temptation wherewith the evil principle was permitted to assail the son of man he withdrew his attention gradually from the light and worldly conversation of the infidel warrior beside him and however acceptable his gay and gallant bravery would have rendered him as a companion elsewhere sir kenneth felt as if in those wildernesses the waste and dry places in which the foul spirits were wont to wander when expelled the mortals whose forms they possessed a barefooted friar would have been a better associate than the gay but unbelieving paynim  these feelings embarrassed him the rather that the saracens spirits appeared to rise with the journey and because the farther he penetrated into the gloomy recesses of the mountains the lighter became his conversation and when he found that unanswered the louder grew his song sir kenneth knew enough of the eastern languages to be assured that he chanted sonnets of love containing all the glowing praises of beauty in which the oriental poets are so fond of luxuriating and which therefore were peculiarly unfitted for a serious or devotional strain of thought the feeling best becoming the wilderness of the temptation with inconsistency enough the saracen also sung lays in praise of wine the liquid ruby of the persian poets and his gaiety at length became so unsuitable to the christian knights contrary train of sentiments as but for the promise of amity which they had exchanged would most likely have made sir kenneth take measures to change his note as it was the crusader felt as if he had by his side some gay licentious fiend who endeavoured to ensnare his soul and endanger his immortal salvation by inspiring loose thoughts of earthly pleasure and thus polluting his devotion at a time when his faith as a christian and his vow as a pilgrim called on him for a serious and penitential state of mind he was thus greatly perplexed and undecided how to act and it was in a tone of hasty displeasure that at length breaking silence he interrupted the lay of the celebrated rudpiki in which he prefers the mole on his mistresss bosom to all the wealth of bokhara and samarcand  saracen said the crusader sternly blinded as thou art and plunged amidst the errors of a false law thou shouldst yet comprehend that there are some places more holy than others and that there are some scenes also in which the evil one hath more than ordinary power over sinful mortals i will not tell thee for what awful reason this placethese rocksthese caverns with their gloomy arches leading as it were to the central abyssare held an especial haunt of satan and his angels it is enough that i have been long warned to beware of this place by wise and holy men to whom the qualities of the unholy region are well known wherefore saracen forbear thy foolish and illtimed levity and turn thy thoughts to things more suited to the spotalthough alas for thee thy best prayers are but as blasphemy and sin  the saracen listened with some surprise and then replied with goodhumour and gaiety only so far repressed as courtesy required good sir kenneth methinks you deal unequally by your companion or else ceremony is but indifferently taught amongst your western tribes i took no offence when i saw you gorge hogs flesh and drink wine and permitted you to enjoy a treat which you called your christian liberty only pitying in my heart your foul pastimes wherefore then shouldst thou take scandal because i cheer to the best of my power a gloomy road with a cheerful verse what saith the poet song is like the dews of heaven on the bosom of the desert it cools the path of the traveller  friend saracen said the christian i blame not the love of minstrelsy and of the gai science albeit we yield unto it even too much room in our thoughts when they should be bent on better things but prayers and holy psalms are better fitting than lais of love or of winecups when men walk in this valley of the shadow of death full of fiends and demons whom the prayers of holy men have driven forth from the haunts of humanity to wander amidst scenes as accursed as themselves  speak not thus of the genii christian answered the saracen for know thou speakest to one whose line and nation drew their origin from the immortal race which your sect fear and blaspheme  i well thought answered the crusader that your blinded race had their descent from the foul fiend without whose aid you would never have been able to maintain this blessed land of palestine against so many valiant soldiers of god i speak not thus of thee in particular saracen but generally of thy people and religion strange is it to me however not that you should have the descent from the evil one but that you should boast of it  from whom should the bravest boast of descending saving from him that is bravest said the saracen from whom should the proudest trace their line so well as from the dark spirit which would rather fall headlong by force than bend the knee by his will eblis may be hated stranger but he must be feared and such as eblis are his descendants of kurdistan  tales of magic and of necromancy were the learning of the period and sir kenneth heard his companions confession of diabolical descent without any disbelief and without much wonder yet not without a secret shudder at finding himself in this fearful place in the company of one who avouched himself to belong to such a lineage naturally insusceptible however of fear he crossed himself and stoutly demanded of the saracen an account of the pedigree which he had boasted the latter readily complied  know brave stranger he said that when the cruel zohauk one of the descendants of giamschid held the throne of persia he formed a league with the powers of darkness amidst the secret vaults of istakhar vaults which the hands of the elementary spirits had hewn out of the living rock long before adam himself had an existence here he fed with daily oblations of human blood two devouring serpents which had become according to the poets a part of himself and to sustain whom he levied a tax of daily human sacrifices till the exhausted patience of his subjects caused some to raise up the scimitar of resistance like the valiant blacksmith and the victorious feridoun by whom the tyrant was at length dethroned and imprisoned for ever in the dismal caverns of the mountain damavend but ere that deliverance had taken place and whilst the power of the bloodthirsty tyrant was at its height the band of ravening slaves whom he had sent forth to purvey victims for his daily sacrifice brought to the vaults of the palace of istakhar seven sisters so beautiful that they seemed seven houris these seven maidens were the daughters of a sage who had no treasures save those beauties and his own wisdom the last was not sufficient to foresee this misfortune the former seemed ineffectual to prevent it the eldest exceeded not her twentieth year the youngest had scarce attained her thirteenth and so like were they to each other that they could not have been distinguished but for the difference of height in which they gradually rose in easy gradation above each other like the ascent which leads to the gates of paradise so lovely were these seven sisters when they stood in the darksome vault disrobed of all clothing saving a cymar of white silk that their charms moved the hearts of those who were not mortal thunder muttered the earth shook the wall of the vault was rent and at the chasm entered one dressed like a hunter with bow and shafts and followed by six others his brethren they were tall men and though dark yet comely to behold but their eyes had more the glare of those of the dead than the light which lives under the eyelids of the living zeineb said the leader of the bandand as he spoke he took the eldest sister by the hand and his voice was soft low and melancholyi am cothrob king of the subterranean world and supreme chief of ginnistan i and my brethren are of those who created out of the pure elementary fire disdained even at the command of omnipotence to do homage to a clod of earth because it was called man thou mayest have heard of us as cruel unrelenting and persecuting it is false we are by nature kind and generous only vengeful when insulted only cruel when affronted we are true to those who trust us and we have heard the invocations of thy father the sage mithrasp who wisely worships not alone the origin of good but that which is called the source of evil you and your sisters are on the eve of death but let each give to us one hair from your fair tresses in token of fealty and we will carry you many miles from hence to a place of safety where you may bid defiance to zohauk and his ministers the fear of instant death saith the poet is like the rod of the prophet haroun which devoured all other rods when transformed into snakes before the king of pharaoh and the daughters of the persian sage were less apt than others to be afraid of the addresses of a spirit they gave the tribute which cothrob demanded and in an instant the sisters were transported to an enchanted castle on the mountains of tugrut in kurdistan and were never again seen by mortal eye but in process of time seven youths distinguished in the war and in the chase appeared in the environs of the castle of the demons they were darker taller fiercer and more resolute than any of the scattered inhabitants of the valleys of kurdistan and they took to themselves wives and became fathers of the seven tribes of the kurdmans whose valour is known throughout the universe  the christian knight heard with wonder the wild tale of which kurdistan still possesses the traces and after a moments thought replied verily sir knight you have spoken wellyour genealogy may be dreaded and hated but it cannot be contemned neither do i any longer wonder at your obstinacy in a false faith since doubtless it is part of the fiendish disposition which hath descended from your ancestors those infernal huntsmen as you have described them to love falsehood rather than truth and i no longer marvel that your spirits become high and exalted and vent themselves in verse and in tunes when you approach to the places encumbered by the haunting of evil spirits which must excite in you that joyous feeling which others experience when approaching the land of their human ancestry  by my fathers beard i think thou hast the right said the saracen rather amused than offended by the freedom with which the christian had uttered his reflections for though the prophet blessed be his name hath sown amongst us the seed of a better faith than our ancestors learned in the ghostly halls of tugrut yet we are not willing like other moslemah to pass hasty doom on the lofty and powerful elementary spirits from whom we claim our origin these genii according to our belief and hope are not altogether reprobate but are still in the way of probation and may hereafter be punished or rewarded leave we this to the mollahs and the imauns enough that with us the reverence for these spirits is not altogether effaced by what we have learned from the koran and that many of us still sing in memorial of our fathers more ancient faith such verses as these  so saying he proceeded to chant verses very ancient in the language and structure which some have thought derive their source from the worshippers of arimanes the evil principle                   ahriman       dark ahriman whom irak still      holds origin of woe and ill      when bending at thy shrine      we view the world with troubled eye      where see we neath the extended sky      an empire matching thine       if the benigner power can yield      a fountain in the desert field      where weary pilgrims drink      thine are the waves that lash the rock      thine the tornados deadly shock      where countless navies sink       or if he bid the soil dispense      balsams to cheer the sinking sense      how few can they deliver      from lingering pains or pang intense      red fever spotted pestilence      the arrows of thy quiver       chief in mans bosom sits thy sway      and frequent while in words we pray      before another throne      whateer of specious form be there      the secret meaning of the prayer      is ahriman thine own       say hast thou feeling sense and form      thunder thy voice thy garments storm      as eastern magi say      with sentient soul of hate and wrath      and wings to sweep thy deadly path      and fangs to tear thy prey       or art thou mixd in natures source      an everoperating force      converting good to ill      an evil principle innate      contending with our better fate      and oh  victorious still       howeer it be dispute is vain      on all without thou holdst thy reign      nor less on all within      each mortal passions fierce career      love hate ambition joy and fear      thou goadest into sin       wheneer a sunny gleam appears      to brighten up our vale of tears      thou art not distant far      mid such brief solace of our lives      thou whettst our very banquetknives      to tools of death and war       thus from the moment of our birth      long as we linger on the earth      thou rulest the fate of men      thine are the pangs of lifes last hour      andwho dare answeris thy power      dark spirit  ended then       the worthy and learned clergyman by whom this species of      hymn has been translated desires that for fear of      misconception we should warn the reader to recollect that      it is composed by a heathen to whom the real causes of      moral and physical evil are unknown and who views their      predominance in the system of the universe as all must view      that appalling fact who have not the benefit of the      christian revelation  on our own part we beg to add that      we understand the style of the translator is more      paraphrastic than can be approved by those who are      acquainted with the singularly curious original  the      translator seems to have despaired of rendering into english      verse the flights of oriental poetry and possibly like      many learned and ingenious men finding it impossible to      discover the sense of the original he may have tacitly      substituted his own  these verses may perhaps have been the not unnatural effusion of some halfenlightened philosopher who in the fabled deity arimanes saw but the prevalence of moral and physical evil but in the ears of sir kenneth of the leopard they had a different effect and sung as they were by one who had just boasted himself a descendant of demons sounded very like an address of worship to the archfiend himself he weighed within himself whether on hearing such blasphemy in the very desert where satan had stood rebuked for demanding homage taking an abrupt leave of the saracen was sufficient to testify his abhorrence or whether he was not rather constrained by his vow as a crusader to defy the infidel to combat on the spot and leave him food for the beasts of the wilderness when his attention was suddenly caught by an unexpected apparition  the light was now verging low yet served the knight still to discern that they two were no longer alone in the desert but were closely watched by a figure of great height and very thin which skipped over rocks and bushes with so much agility as added to the wild and hirsute appearance of the individual reminded him of the fauns and silvans whose images he had seen in the ancient temples of rome as the singlehearted scottishman had never for a moment doubted these gods of the ancient gentiles to be actually devils so he now hesitated not to believe that the blasphemous hymn of the saracen had raised up an infernal spirit  but what recks it said stout sir kenneth to himself down with the fiend and his worshippers  he did not however think it necessary to give the same warning of defiance to two enemies as he would unquestionably have afforded to one his hand was upon his mace and perhaps the unwary saracen would have been paid for his persian poetry by having his brains dashed out on the spot without any reason assigned for it but the scottish knight was spared from committing what would have been a sore blot in his shield of arms the apparition on which his eyes had been fixed for some time had at first appeared to dog their path by concealing itself behind rocks and shrubs using those advantages of the ground with great address and surmounting its irregularities with surprising agility at length just as the saracen paused in his song the figure which was that of a tall man clothed in goatskins sprung into the midst of the path and seized a rein of the saracens bridle in either hand confronting thus and bearing back the noble horse which unable to endure the manner in which this sudden assailant pressed the longarmed bit and the severe curb which according to the eastern fashion was a solid ring of iron reared upright and finally fell backwards on his master who however avoided the peril of the fall by lightly throwing himself to one side  the assailant then shifted his grasp from the bridle of the horse to the throat of the rider flung himself above the struggling saracen and despite of his youth and activity kept him undermost wreathing his long arms above those of his prisoner who called out angrily and yet halflaughing at the same timehamakofoolunloose methis passes thy privilegeunloose me or i will use my dagger  thy daggerinfidel dog said the figure in the goatskins hold it in thy gripe if thou canst and in an instant he wrenched the saracens weapon out of its owners hand and brandished it over his head  help nazarene cried sheerkohf now seriously alarmed help or the hamako will slay me  slay thee replied the dweller of the desert and well hast thou merited death for singing thy blasphemous hymns not only to the praise of thy false prophet who is the foul fiends harbinger but to that of the author of evil himself  the christian knight had hitherto looked on as one stupefied so strangely had this rencontre contradicted in its progress and event all that he had previously conjectured he felt however at length that it touched his honour to interfere in behalf of his discomfited companion and therefore addressed himself to the victorious figure in the goatskins  whosoeer thou art he said and whether of good or of evil know that i am sworn for the time to be true companion to the saracen whom thou holdest under thee therefore i pray thee to let him arise else i will do battle with thee in his behalf  and a proper quarrel it were answered the hamako for a crusader to do battle infor the sake of an unbaptized dog to combat one of his own holy faith art thou come forth to the wilderness to fight for the crescent against the cross a goodly soldier of god art thou to listen to those who sing the praises of satan  yet while he spoke thus he arose himself and suffering the saracen to rise also returned him his cangiar or poniard  thou seest to what a point of peril thy presumption hath brought thee continued he of the goatskins now addressing sheerkohf and by what weak means thy practised skill and boasted agility can be foiled when such is heavens pleasure wherefore beware o ilderim for know that were there not a twinkle in the star of thy nativity which promises for thee something that is good and gracious in heavens good time we two had not parted till i had torn asunder the throat which so lately trilled forth blasphemies  hamako said the saracen without any appearance of resenting the violent language and yet more violent assault to which he had been subjected i pray thee good hamako to beware how thou dost again urge thy privilege over far for though as a good moslem i respect those whom heaven hath deprived of ordinary reason in order to endow them with the spirit of prophecy yet i like not other mens hands on the bridle of my horse neither upon my own person speak therefore what thou wilt secure of any resentment from me but gather so much sense as to apprehend that if thou shalt again proffer me any violence i will strike thy shagged head from thy meagre shouldersand to thee friend kenneth he added as he remounted his steed i must needs say that in a companion through the desert i love friendly deeds better than fair words of the last thou hast given me enough but it had been better to have aided me more speedily in my struggle with this hamako who had wellnigh taken my life in his frenzy  by my faith said the knight i did somewhat failwas somewhat tardy in rendering thee instant help but the strangeness of the assailant the suddenness of the sceneit was as if thy wild and wicked lay had raised the devil among usand such was my confusion that two or three minutes elapsed ere i could take to my weapon  thou art but a cold and considerate friend said the saracen and had the hamako been one grain more frantic thy companion had been slain by thy side to thy eternal dishonour without thy stirring a finger in his aid although thou satest by mounted and in arms  by my word saracen said the christian if thou wilt have it in plain terms i thought that strange figure was the devil and being of thy lineage i knew not what family secret you might be communicating to each other as you lay lovingly rolling together on the sand  thy gibe is no answer brother kenneth said the saracen for know that had my assailant been in very deed the prince of darkness thou wert bound not the less to enter into combat with him in thy comrades behalf know also that whatever there may be of foul or of fiendish about the hamako belongs more to your lineage than to minethis hamako being in truth the anchorite whom thou art come hither to visit  this said sir kenneth looking at the athletic yet wasted figure before himthis thou mockest saracenthis cannot be the venerable theodorick  ask himself if thou wilt not believe me answered sheerkohf and ere the words had left his mouth the hermit gave evidence in his own behalf  i am theodorick of engaddi he saidi am the walker of the deserti am friend of the cross and flail of all infidels heretics and devilworshippers avoid ye avoid ye down with mahound termagaunt and all their adherentsso saying he pulled from under his shaggy garment a sort of flail or jointed club bound with iron which he brandished round his head with singular dexterity  thou seest thy saint said the saracen laughing for the first time at the unmitigated astonishment with which sir kenneth looked on the wild gestures and heard the wayward muttering of theodorick who after swinging his flail in every direction apparently quite reckless whether it encountered the head of either of his companions finally showed his own strength and the soundness of the weapon by striking into fragments a large stone which lay near him  this is a madman said sir kenneth  not the worse saint returned the moslem speaking according to the wellknown eastern belief that madmen are under the influence of immediate inspiration know christian that when one eye is extinguished the other becomes more keen when one hand is cut off the other becomes more powerful so when our reason in human things is disturbed or destroyed our view heavenward becomes more acute and perfect  here the voice of the saracen was drowned in that of the hermit who began to hollo aloud in a wild chanting tone i am theodorick of engaddii am the torchbrand of the deserti am the flail of the infidels the lion and the leopard shall be my comrades and draw nigh to my cell for shelter neither shall the goat be afraid of their fangs i am the torch and the lanternkyrie eleison  he closed his song by a short race and ended that again by three forward bounds which would have done him great credit in a gymnastic academy but became his character of hermit so indifferently that the scottish knight was altogether confounded and bewildered  the saracen seemed to understand him better you see he said that he expects us to follow him to his cell which indeed is our only place of refuge for the night you are the leopard from the portrait on your shield i am the lion as my name imports and by the goat alluding to his garb of goatskins he means himself we must keep him in sight however for he is as fleet as a dromedary  in fact the task was a difficult one for though the reverend guide stopped from time to time and waved his hand as if to encourage them to come on yet well acquainted with all the winding dells and passes of the desert and gifted with uncommon activity which perhaps an unsettled state of mind kept in constant exercise he led the knights through chasms and along footpaths where even the lightarmed saracen with his welltrained barb was in considerable risk and where the ironsheathed european and his overburdened steed found themselves in such imminent peril as the rider would gladly have exchanged for the dangers of a general action glad he was when at length after this wild race he beheld the holy man who had led it standing in front of a cavern with a large torch in his hand composed of a piece of wood dipped in bitumen which cast a broad and flickering light and emitted a strong sulphureous smell  undeterred by the stifling vapour the knight threw himself from his horse and entered the cavern which afforded small appearance of accommodation the cell was divided into two parts in the outward of which were an altar of stone and a crucifix made of reeds this served the anchorite for his chapel on one side of this outward cave the christian knight though not without scruple arising from religious reverence to the objects around fastened up his horse and arranged him for the night in imitation of the saracen who gave him to understand that such was the custom of the place the hermit meanwhile was busied putting his inner apartment in order to receive his guests and there they soon joined him at the bottom of the outer cave a small aperture closed with a door of rough plank led into the sleeping apartment of the hermit which was more commodious the floor had been brought to a rough level by the labour of the inhabitant and then strewed with white sand which he daily sprinkled with water from a small fountain which bubbled out of the rock in one corner affording in that stifling climate refreshment alike to the ear and the taste mattresses wrought of twisted flags lay by the side of the cell the sides like the floor had been roughly brought to shape and several herbs and flowers were hung around them two waxen torches which the hermit lighted gave a cheerful air to the place which was rendered agreeable by its fragrance and coolness  there were implements of labour in one corner of the apartment in another was a niche for a rude statue of the virgin a table and two chairs showed that they must be the handiwork of the anchorite being different in their form from oriental accommodations the former was covered not only with reeds and pulse but also with dried flesh which theodorick assiduously placed in such arrangement as should invite the appetite of his guests this appearance of courtesy though mute and expressed by gestures only seemed to sir kenneth something entirely irreconcilable with his former wild and violent demeanour the movements of the hermit were now become composed and apparently it was only a sense of religious humiliation which prevented his features emaciated as they were by his austere mode of life from being majestic and noble he trod his cell as one who seemed born to rule over men but who had abdicated his empire to become the servant of heaven still it must be allowed that his gigantic size the length of his unshaven locks and beard and the fire of a deepset and wild eye were rather attributes of a soldier than of a recluse  even the saracen seemed to regard the anchorite with some veneration while he was thus employed and he whispered in a low tone to sir kenneth the hamako is now in his better mind but he will not speak until we have eatensuch is his vow  it was in silence accordingly that theodorick motioned to the scot to take his place on one of the low chairs while sheerkohf placed himself after the custom of his nation upon a cushion of mats the hermit then held up both hands as if blessing the refreshment which he had placed before his guests and they proceeded to eat in silence as profound as his own to the saracen this gravity was natural and the christian imitated his taciturnity while he employed his thoughts on the singularity of his own situation and the contrast betwixt the wild furious gesticulations loud cries and fierce actions of theodorick when they first met him and the demure solemn decorous assiduity with which he now performed the duties of hospitality  when their meal was ended the hermit who had not himself eaten a morsel removed the fragments from the table and placing before the saracen a pitcher of sherbet assigned to the scot a flask of wine  drink he said my childrenthey were the first words he had spokenthe gifts of god are to be enjoyed when the giver is remembered  having said this he retired to the outward cell probably for performance of his devotions and left his guests together in the inner apartment when sir kenneth endeavoured by various questions to draw from sheerkohf what that emir knew concerning his host he was interested by more than mere curiosity in these inquiries difficult as it was to reconcile the outrageous demeanour of the recluse at his first appearance with his present humble and placid behaviour it seemed yet more impossible to think it consistent with the high consideration in which according to what sir kenneth had learned this hermit was held by the most enlightened divines of the christian world theodorick the hermit of engaddi had in that character been the correspondent of popes and councils to whom his letters full of eloquent fervour had described the miseries imposed by the unbelievers upon the latin christians in the holy land in colours scarce inferior to those employed at the council of clermont by the hermit peter when he preached the first crusade to find in a person so reverend and so much revered the frantic gestures of a mad fakir induced the christian knight to pause ere he could resolve to communicate to him certain important matters which he had in charge from some of the leaders of the crusade  it had been a main object of sir kenneths pilgrimage attempted by a route so unusual to make such communications but what he had that night seen induced him to pause and reflect ere he proceeded to the execution of his commission from the emir he could not extract much information but the general tenor was as followsthat as he had heard the hermit had been once a brave and valiant soldier wise in council and fortunate in battle which last he could easily believe from the great strength and agility which he had often seen him display that he had appeared at jerusalem in the character not of a pilgrim but in that of one who had devoted himself to dwell for the remainder of his life in the holy land shortly afterwards he fixed his residence amid the scenes of desolation where they now found him respected by the latins for his austere devotion and by the turks and arabs on account of the symptoms of insanity which he displayed and which they ascribed to inspiration it was from them he had the name of hamako which expresses such a character in the turkish language sheerkohf himself seemed at a loss how to rank their host he had been he said a wise man and could often for many hours together speak lessons of virtue or wisdom without the slightest appearance of inaccuracy at other times he was wild and violent but never before had he seen him so mischievously disposed as he had that day appeared to be his rage was chiefly provoked by any affront to his religion and there was a story of some wandering arabs who had insulted his worship and defaced his altar and whom he had on that account attacked and slain with the short flail which he carried with him in lieu of all other weapons this incident had made a great noise and it was as much the fear of the hermits iron flail as regard for his character as a hamako which caused the roving tribes to respect his dwelling and his chapel his fame had spread so far that saladin had issued particular orders that he should be spared and protected he himself and other moslem lords of rank had visited the cell more than once partly from curiosity partly that they expected from a man so learned as the christian hamako some insight into the secrets of futurity he had continued the saracen a rashid or observatory of great height contrived to view the heavenly bodies and particularly the planetary systemby whose movements and influences as both christian and moslem believed the course of human events was regulated and might be predicted  this was the substance of the emir sheerkohfs information and it left sir kenneth in doubt whether the character of insanity arose from the occasional excessive fervour of the hermits zeal or whether it was not altogether fictitious and assumed for the sake of the immunities which it afforded yet it seemed that the infidels had carried their complaisance towards him to an uncommon length considering the fanaticism of the followers of mohammed in the midst of whom he was living though the professed enemy of their faith he thought also there was more intimacy of acquaintance betwixt the hermit and the saracen than the words of the latter had induced him to anticipate and it had not escaped him that the former had called the latter by a name different from that which he himself had assumed all these considerations authorized caution if not suspicion he determined to observe his host closely and not to be overhasty in communicating with him on the important charge entrusted to him  beware saracen he said methinks our hosts imagination wanders as well on the subject of names as upon other matters thy name is sheerkohf and he called thee but now by another  my name when in the tent of my father replied the kurdman was ilderim and by this i am still distinguished by many in the field and to soldiers i am known as the lion of the mountain being the name my good sword hath won for me but hush the hamako comesit is to warn us to rest i know his custom none must watch him at his vigils  the anchorite accordingly entered and folding his arms on his bosom as he stood before them said with a solemn voice blessed be his name who hath appointed the quiet night to follow the busy day and the calm sleep to refresh the wearied limbs and to compose the troubled spirit  both warriors replied amen and arising from the table prepared to betake themselves to the couches which their host indicated by waving his hand as making a reverence to each he again withdrew from the apartment  the knight of the leopard then disarmed himself of his heavy panoply his saracen companion kindly assisting him to undo his buckler and clasps until he remained in the close dress of chamois leather which knights and menatarms used to wear under their harness the saracen if he had admired the strength of his adversary when sheathed in steel was now no less struck with the accuracy of proportion displayed in his nervous and wellcompacted figure the knight on the other hand as in exchange of courtesy he assisted the saracen to disrobe himself of his upper garments that he might sleep with more convenience was on his side at a loss to conceive how such slender proportions and slimness of figure could be reconciled with the vigour he had displayed in personal contest  each warrior prayed ere he addressed himself to his place of rest the moslem turned towards his keblah the point to which the prayer of each follower of the prophet was to be addressed and murmured his heathen orisons while the christian withdrawing from the contamination of the infidels neighbourhood placed his huge crosshandled sword upright and kneeling before it as the sign of salvation told his rosary with a devotion which was enhanced by the recollection of the scenes through which he had passed and the dangers from which he had been rescued in the course of the day both warriors worn by toil and travel were soon fast asleep each on his separate pallet    chapter iv  kenneth the scot was uncertain how long his senses had been lost in profound repose when he was roused to recollection by a sense of oppression on his chest which at first suggested a flirting dream of struggling with a powerful opponent and at length recalled him fully to his senses he was about to demand who was there when opening his eyes he beheld the figure of the anchorite wild and savagelooking as we have described him standing by his bedside and pressing his right hand upon his breast while he held a small silver lamp in the other  be silent said the hermit as the prostrate knight looked up in surprise i have that to say to you which yonder infidel must not hear  these words he spoke in the french language and not in the lingua franca or compound of eastern and european dialects which had hitherto been used amongst them  arise he continued put on thy mantle speak not but tread lightly and follow me  sir kenneth arose and took his sword  it needs not answered the anchorite in a whisper we are going where spiritual arms avail much and fleshly weapons are but as the reed and the decayed gourd  the knight deposited his sword by the bedside as before and armed only with his dagger from which in this perilous country he never parted prepared to attend his mysterious host  the hermit then moved slowly forwards and was followed by the knight still under some uncertainty whether the dark form which glided on before to show him the path was not in fact the creation of a disturbed dream they passed like shadows into the outer apartment without disturbing the paynim emir who lay still buried in repose before the cross and altar in the outward room a lamp was still burning a missal was displayed and on the floor lay a discipline or penitential scourge of small cord and wire the lashes of which were recently stained with blooda token no doubt of the severe penance of the recluse here theodorick kneeled down and pointed to the knight to take his place beside him upon the sharp flints which seemed placed for the purpose of rendering the posture of reverential devotion as uneasy as possible he read many prayers of the catholic church and chanted in a low but earnest voice three of the penitential psalms these last he intermixed with sighs and tears and convulsive throbs which bore witness how deeply he felt the divine poetry which he recited the scottish knight assisted with profound sincerity at these acts of devotion his opinion of his host beginning in the meantime to be so much changed that he doubted whether from the severity of his penance and the ardour of his prayers he ought not to regard him as a saint and when they arose from the ground he stood with reverence before him as a pupil before an honoured master the hermit was on his side silent and abstracted for the space of a few minutes  look into yonder recess my son he said pointing to the farther corner of the cell there thou wilt find a veilbring it hither  the knight obeyed and in a small aperture cut out of the wall and secured with a door of wicker he found the veil inquired for when he brought it to the light he discovered that it was torn and soiled in some places with some dark substance the anchorite looked at it with a deep but smothered emotion and ere he could speak to the scottish knight was compelled to vent his feelings in a convulsive groan  thou art now about to look upon the richest treasure that the earth possesses he at length said woe is me that my eyes are unworthy to be lifted towards it alas i am but the vile and despised sign which points out to the wearied traveller a harbour of rest and security but must itself remain for ever without doors in vain have i fled to the very depths of the rocks and the very bosom of the thirsty desert mine enemy hath found meeven he whom i have denied has pursued me to my fortresses  he paused again for a moment and turning to the scottish knight said in a firmer tone of voice you bring me a greeting from richard of england  i come from the council of christian princes said the knight but the king of england being indisposed i am not honoured with his majestys commands  your token demanded the recluse  sir kenneth hesitated former suspicions and the marks of insanity which the hermit had formerly exhibited rushed suddenly on his thoughts but how suspect a man whose manners were so saintly my password he said at length is thiskings begged of a beggar  it is right said the hermit while he paused i know you well but the sentinel upon his postand mine is an important onechallenges friend as well as foe  he then moved forward with the lamp leading the way into the room which they had left the saracen lay on his couch still fast asleep the hermit paused by his side and looked down on him  he sleeps he said in darkness and must not be awakened  the attitude of the emir did indeed convey the idea of profound repose one arm flung across his body as he lay with his face half turned to the wall concealed with its loose and long sleeve the greater part of his face but the high forehead was yet visible its nerves which during his waking hours were so uncommonly active were now motionless as if the face had been composed of dark marble and his long silken eyelashes closed over his piercing and hawklike eyes the open and relaxed hand and the deep regular and soft breathing all gave tokens of the most profound repose the slumberer formed a singular group along with the tall forms of the hermit in his shaggy dress of goatskins bearing the lamp and the knight in his close leathern coatthe former with an austere expression of ascetic gloom the latter with anxious curiosity deeply impressed on his manly features  he sleeps soundly said the hermit in the same low tone as before and repeating the words though he had changed the meaning from that which is literal to a metaphorical sensehe sleeps in darkness but there shall be for him a dayspringo ilderim thy waking thoughts are yet as vain and wild as those which are wheeling their giddy dance through thy sleeping brain but the trumpet shall be heard and the dream shall be dissolved  so saying and making the knight a sign to follow him the hermit went towards the altar and passing behind it pressed a spring which opening without noise showed a small iron door wrought in the side of the cavern so as to be almost imperceptible unless upon the most severe scrutiny the hermit ere he ventured fully to open the door dropped some oil on the hinges which the lamp supplied a small staircase hewn in the rock was discovered when the iron door was at length completely opened  take the veil which i hold said the hermit in a melancholy tone and blind mine eyes for i may not look on the treasure which thou art presently to behold without sin and presumption  without reply the knight hastily muffled the recluses head in the veil and the latter began to ascend the staircase as one too much accustomed to the way to require the use of light while at the same time he held the lamp to the scot who followed him for many steps up the narrow ascent at length they rested in a small vault of irregular form in one nook of which the staircase terminated while in another corner a corresponding stair was seen to continue the ascent in a third angle was a gothic door very rudely ornamented with the usual attributes of clustered columns and carving and defended by a wicket strongly guarded with iron and studded with large nails to this last point the hermit directed his steps which seemed to falter as he approached it  put off thy shoes he said to his attendant the ground on which thou standest is holy banish from thy innermost heart each profane and carnal thought for to harbour such while in this place were a deadly impiety  the knight laid aside his shoes as he was commanded and the hermit stood in the meanwhile as if communing with his soul in secret prayer and when he again moved commanded the knight to knock at the wicket three times he did so the door opened spontaneouslyat least sir kenneth beheld no oneand his senses were at once assailed by a stream of the purest light and by a strong and almost oppressive sense of the richest perfumes he stepped two or three paces back and it was the space of a minute ere he recovered the dazzling and overpowering effects of the sudden change from darkness to light  when he entered the apartment in which this brilliant lustre was displayed he perceived that the light proceeded from a combination of silver lamps fed with purest oil and sending forth the richest odours hanging by silver chains from the roof of a small gothic chapel hewn like most part of the hermits singular mansion out of the sound and solid rock but whereas in every other place which sir kenneth had seen the labour employed upon the rock had been of the simplest and coarsest description it had in this chapel employed the invention and the chisels of the most able architects the groined roofs rose from six columns on each side carved with the rarest skill and the manner in which the crossings of the concave arches were bound together as it were with appropriate ornaments were all in the finest tone of the architecture of the age corresponding to the line of pillars there were on each side six richlywrought niches each of which contained the image of one of the twelve apostles  at the upper and eastern end of the chapel stood the altar behind which a very rich curtain of persian silk embroidered deeply with gold covered a recess containing unquestionably some image or relic of no ordinary sanctity in honour of which this singular place of worship had been erected under the persuasion that this must be the case the knight advanced to the shrine and kneeling down before it repeated his devotions with fervency during which his attention was disturbed by the curtain being suddenly raised or rather pulled aside how or by whom he saw not but in the niche which was thus disclosed he beheld a cabinet of silver and ebony with a double foldingdoor the whole formed into the miniature resemblance of a gothic church  as he gazed with anxious curiosity on the shrine the two foldingdoors also flew open discovering a large piece of wood on which were blazoned the words vera crux at the same time a choir of female voices sung gloria patri the instant the strain had ceased the shrine was closed and the curtain again drawn and the knight who knelt at the altar might now continue his devotions undisturbed in honour of the holy relic which had been just disclosed to his view he did this under the profound impression of one who had witnessed with his own eyes an awful evidence of the truth of his religion and it was some time ere concluding his orisons he arose and ventured to look around him for the hermit who had guided him to this sacred and mysterious spot he beheld him his head still muffled in the veil which he had himself wrapped around it crouching like a rated hound upon the threshold of the chapel but apparently without venturing to cross itthe holiest reverence the most penitential remorse was expressed by his posture which seemed that of a man borne down and crushed to the earth by the burden of his inward feelings it seemed to the scot that only the sense of the deepest penitence remorse and humiliation could have thus prostrated a frame so strong and a spirit so fiery  he approached him as if to speak but the recluse anticipated his purpose murmuring in stifled tones from beneath the fold in which his head was muffled and which sounded like a voice proceeding from the cerements of a corpseabide abidehappy thou that mayestthe vision is not yet ended so saying he reared himself from the ground drew back from the threshold on which he had hitherto lain prostrate and closed the door of the chapel which secured by a spring bolt within the snap of which resounded through the place appeared so much like a part of the living rock from which the cavern was hewn that kenneth could hardly discern where the aperture had been he was now alone in the lighted chapel which contained the relic to which he had lately rendered his homage without other arms than his dagger or other companion than his pious thoughts and dauntless courage  uncertain what was next to happen but resolved to abide the course of events sir kenneth paced the solitary chapel till about the time of the earliest cockcrowing at this dead season when night and morning met together he heard but from what quarter he could not discover the sound of such a small silver bell as is rung at the elevation of the host in the ceremony or sacrifice as it has been called of the mass the hour and the place rendered the sound fearfully solemn and bold as he was the knight withdrew himself into the farther nook of the chapel at the end opposite to the altar in order to observe without interruption the consequences of this unexpected signal  he did not wait long ere the silken curtain was again withdrawn and the relic again presented to his view as he sunk reverentially on his knee he heard the sound of the lauds or earliest office of the catholic church sung by female voices which united together in the performance as they had done in the former service the knight was soon aware that the voices were no longer stationary in the distance but approached the chapel and became louder when a door imperceptible when closed like that by which he had himself entered opened on the other side of the vault and gave the tones of the choir more room to swell along the ribbed arches of the roof  the knight fixed his eyes on the opening with breathless anxiety and continuing to kneel in the attitude of devotion which the place and scene required expected the consequence of these preparations a procession appeared about to issue from the door first four beautiful boys whose arms necks and legs were bare showing the bronze complexion of the east and contrasting with the snowwhite tunics which they wore entered the chapel by two and two the first pair bore censers which they swung from side to side adding double fragrance to the odours with which the chapel already was impregnated the second pair scattered flowers  after these followed in due and majestic order the females who composed the choirsix who from their black scapularies and black veils over their white garments appeared to be professed nuns of the order of mount carmel and as many whose veils being white argued them to be novices or occasional inhabitants in the cloister who were not as yet bound to it by vows the former held in their hands large rosaries while the younger and lighter figures who followed carried each a chaplet of red and white roses they moved in procession around the chapel without appearing to take the slightest notice of kenneth although passing so near him that their robes almost touched him while they continued to sing the knight doubted not that he was in one of those cloisters where the noble christian maidens had formerly openly devoted themselves to the services of the church most of them had been suppressed since the mohammedans had reconquered palestine but many purchasing connivance by presents or receiving it from the clemency or contempt of the victors still continued to observe in private the ritual to which their vows had consecrated them yet though kenneth knew this to be the case the solemnity of the place and hour the surprise at the sudden appearance of these votaresses and the visionary manner in which they moved past him had such influence on his imagination that he could scarce conceive that the fair procession which he beheld was formed of creatures of this world so much did they resemble a choir of supernatural beings rendering homage to the universal object of adoration  such was the knights first idea as the procession passed him scarce moving save just sufficiently to continue their progress so that seen by the shadowy and religious light which the lamps shed through the clouds of incense which darkened the apartment they appeared rather to glide than to walk  but as a second time in surrounding the chapel they passed the spot on which he kneeled one of the whitestoled maidens as she glided by him detached from the chaplet which she carried a rosebud which dropped from her fingers perhaps unconsciously on the foot of sir kenneth the knight started as if a dart had suddenly struck his person for when the mind is wound up to a high pitch of feeling and expectation the slightest incident if unexpected gives fire to the train which imagination has already laid but he suppressed his emotion recollecting how easily an incident so indifferent might have happened and that it was only the uniform monotony of the movement of the choristers which made the incident in the slightest degree remarkable  still while the procession for the third time surrounded the chapel the thoughts and the eyes of kenneth followed exclusively the one among the novices who had dropped the rosebud her step her face her form were so completely assimilated to the rest of the choristers that it was impossible to perceive the least marks of individuality and yet kenneths heart throbbed like a bird that would burst from its cage as if to assure him by its sympathetic suggestions that the female who held the right file on the second rank of the novices was dearer to him not only than all the rest that were present but than the whole sex besides the romantic passion of love as it was cherished and indeed enjoined by the rules of chivalry associated well with the no less romantic feelings of devotion and they might be said much more to enhance than to counteract each other it was therefore with a glow of expectation that had something even of a religious character that sir kenneth his sensations thrilling from his heart to the ends of his fingers expected some second sign of the presence of one who he strongly fancied had already bestowed on him the first short as the space was during which the procession again completed a third perambulation of the chapel it seemed an eternity to kenneth at length the form which he had watched with such devoted attention drew nigh there was no difference betwixt that shrouded figure and the others with whom it moved in concert and in unison until just as she passed for the third time the kneeling crusader a part of a little and wellproportioned hand so beautifully formed as to give the highest idea of the perfect proportions of the form to which it belonged stole through the folds of the gauze like a moonbeam through the fleecy cloud of a summer night and again a rosebud lay at the feet of the knight of the leopard  this second intimation could not be accidentalit could not be fortuitous the resemblance of that halfseen but beautiful female hand with one which his lips had once touched and while they touched it had internally sworn allegiance to the lovely owner had further proof been wanting there was the glimmer of that matchless ruby ring on that snowwhite finger whose invaluable worth kenneth would yet have prized less than the slightest sign which that finger could have made and veiled too as she was he might see by chance or by favour a stray curl of the dark tresses each hair of which was dearer to him a hundred times than a chain of massive gold it was the lady of his love but that she should be herein the savage and sequestered desertamong vestals who rendered themselves habitants of wilds and of caverns that they might perform in secret those christian rites which they dared not assist in openly that this should be so in truth and in reality seemed too incredibleit must be a dreama delusive trance of the imagination while these thoughts passed through the mind of kenneth the same passage by which the procession had entered the chapel received them on their return the young sacristans the sable nuns vanished successively through the open door at length she from whom he had received this double intimation passed also yet in passing turned her head slightly indeed but perceptibly towards the place where he remained fixed as an image he marked the last wave of her veilit was goneand a darkness sunk upon his soul scarce less palpable than that which almost immediately enveloped his external sense for the last chorister had no sooner crossed the threshold of the door than it shut with a loud sound and at the same instant the voices of the choir were silent the lights of the chapel were at once extinguished and sir kenneth remained solitary and in total darkness but to kenneth solitude and darkness and the uncertainty of his mysterious situation were as nothinghe thought not of themcared not for themcared for nought in the world save the flitting vision which had just glided past him and the tokens of her favour which she had bestowed to grope on the floor for the buds which she had droppedto press them to his lips to his bosom now alternately now togetherto rivet his lips to the cold stones on which as near as he could judge she had so lately steppedto play all the extravagances which strong affection suggests and vindicates to those who yield themselves up to it were but the tokens of passionate love common to all ages but it was peculiar to the times of chivalry that in his wildest rapture the knight imagined of no attempt to follow or to trace the object of such romantic attachment that he thought of her as of a deity who having deigned to show herself for an instant to her devoted worshipper had again returned to the darkness of her sanctuaryor as an influential planet which having darted in some auspicious minute one favourable ray wrapped itself again in its veil of mist the motions of the lady of his love were to him those of a superior being who was to move without watch or control rejoice him by her appearance or depress him by her absence animate him by her kindness or drive him to despair by her crueltyall at her own free will and without other importunity or remonstrance than that expressed by the most devoted services of the heart and sword of the champion whose sole object in life was to fulfil her commands and by the splendour of his own achievements to exalt her fame  such were the rules of chivalry and of the love which was its ruling principle but sir kenneths attachment was rendered romantic by other and still more peculiar circumstances he had never even heard the sound of his ladys voice though he had often beheld her beauty with rapture she moved in a circle which his rank of knighthood permitted him indeed to approach but not to mingle with and highly as he stood distinguished for warlike skill and enterprise still the poor scottish soldier was compelled to worship his divinity at a distance almost as great as divides the persian from the sun which he adores but when was the pride of woman too lofty to overlook the passionate devotion of a lover however inferior in degree her eye had been on him in the tournament her ear had heard his praises in the report of the battles which were daily fought and while count duke and lord contended for her grace it flowed unwillingly perhaps at first or even unconsciously towards the poor knight of the leopard who to support his rank had little besides his sword when she looked and when she listened the lady saw and heard enough to encourage her in a partiality which had at first crept on her unawares if a knights personal beauty was praised even the most prudish dames of the military court of england would make an exception in favour of the scottish kenneth and it oftentimes happened that notwithstanding the very considerable largesses which princes and peers bestowed on the minstrels an impartial spirit of independence would seize the poet and the harp was swept to the heroism of one who had neither palfreys nor garments to bestow in guerdon of his applause  the moments when she listened to the praises of her lover became gradually more and more dear to the highborn edith relieving the flattery with which her ear was weary and presenting to her a subject of secret contemplation more worthy as he seemed by general report than those who surpassed him in rank and in the gifts of fortune as her attention became constantly though cautiously fixed on sir kenneth she grew more and more convinced of his personal devotion to herself and more and more certain in her mind that in kenneth of scotland she beheld the fated knight doomed to share with her through weal and woeand the prospect looked gloomy and dangerousthe passionate attachment to which the poets of the age ascribed such universal dominion and which its manners and morals placed nearly on the same rank with devotion itself  let us not disguise the truth from our readers when edith became aware of the state of her own sentiments chivalrous as were her sentiments becoming a maiden not distant from the throne of englandgratified as her pride must have been with the mute though unceasing homage rendered to her by the knight whom she had distinguished there were moments when the feelings of the woman loving and beloved murmured against the restraints of state and form by which she was surrounded and when she almost blamed the timidity of her lover who seemed resolved not to infringe them the etiquette to use a modern phrase of birth and rank had drawn around her a magical circle beyond which sir kenneth might indeed bow and gaze but within which he could no more pass than an evoked spirit can transgress the boundaries prescribed by the rod of a powerful enchanter the thought involuntarily pressed on her that she herself must venture were it but the point of her fairy foot beyond the prescribed boundary if she ever hoped to give a lover so reserved and bashful an opportunity of so slight a favour as but to salute her shoetie there was an examplethe noted precedent of the kings daughter of hungary who thus generously encouraged the squire of low degree and edith though of kingly blood was no kings daughter any more than her lover was of low degreefortune had put no such extreme barrier in obstacle to their affections something however within the maidens bosomthat modest pride which throws fetters even on love itself forbade her notwithstanding the superiority of her condition to make those advances which in every case delicacy assigns to the other sex above all sir kenneth was a knight so gentle and honourable so highly accomplished as her imagination at least suggested together with the strictest feelings of what was due to himself and to her that however constrained her attitude might be while receiving his adorations like the image of some deity who is neither supposed to feel nor to reply to the homage of its votaries still the idol feared that to step prematurely from her pedestal would be to degrade herself in the eyes of her devoted worshipper  yet the devout adorer of an actual idol can even discover signs of approbation in the rigid and immovable features of a marble image and it is no wonder that something which could be as favourably interpreted glanced from the bright eye of the lovely edith whose beauty indeed consisted rather more in that very power of expression than an absolute regularity of contour or brilliancy of complexion some slight marks of distinction had escaped from her notwithstanding her own jealous vigilance else how could sir kenneth have so readily and so undoubtingly recognized the lovely hand of which scarce two fingers were visible from under the veil or how could he have rested so thoroughly assured that two flowers successively dropped on the spot were intended as a recognition on the part of his ladylove by what train of observationby what secret signs looks or gesturesby what instinctive freemasonry of love this degree of intelligence came to subsist between edith and her lover we cannot attempt to trace for we are old and such slight vestiges of affection quickly discovered by younger eyes defy the power of ours enough that such affection did subsist between parties who had never even spoken to one anotherthough on the side of edith it was checked by a deep sense of the difficulties and dangers which must necessarily attend the further progress of their attachment and upon that of the knight by a thousand doubts and fears lest he had overestimated the slight tokens of the ladys notice varied as they necessarily were by long intervals of apparent coldness during which either the fear of exciting the observation of others and thus drawing danger upon her lover or that of sinking in his esteem by seeming too willing to be won made her behave with indifference and as if unobservant of his presence  this narrative tedious perhaps but which the story renders necessary may serve to explain the state of intelligence if it deserves so strong a name betwixt the lovers when ediths unexpected appearance in the chapel produced so powerful an effect on the feelings of her knight    chapter v       their necromantic forms in vain      haunt us on the tented plain      we bid these spectre shapes avaunt      ashtaroth and termagaunt     warton  the most profound silence the deepest darkness continued to brood for more than an hour over the chapel in which we left the knight of the leopard still kneeling alternately expressing thanks to heaven and gratitude to his lady for the boon which had been vouchsafed to him his own safety his own destiny for which he was at all times little anxious had not now the weight of a grain of dust in his reflections he was in the neighbourhood of lady edith he had received tokens of her grace he was in a place hallowed by relics of the most awful sanctity a christian soldier a devoted lover could fear nothing think of nothing but his duty to heaven and his devoir to his lady  at the lapse of the space of time which we have noticed a shrill whistle like that with which a falconer calls his hawk was heard to ring sharply through the vaulted chapel it was a sound ill suited to the place and reminded sir kenneth how necessary it was he should be upon his guard he started from his knee and laid his hand upon his poniard a creaking sound as of a screw or pulleys succeeded and a light streaming upwards as from an opening in the floor showed that a trapdoor had been raised or depressed in less than a minute a long skinny arm partly naked partly clothed in a sleeve of red samite arose out of the aperture holding a lamp as high as it could stretch upwards and the figure to which the arm belonged ascended step by step to the level of the chapel floor the form and face of the being who thus presented himself were those of a frightful dwarf with a large head a cap fantastically adorned with three peacock feathers a dress of red samite the richness of which rendered his ugliness more conspicuous distinguished by gold bracelets and armlets and a white silk sash in which he wore a goldhilted dagger this singular figure had in his left hand a kind of broom so soon as he had stepped from the aperture through which he arose he stood still and as if to show himself more distinctly moved the lamp which he held slowly over his face and person successively illuminating his wild and fantastic features and his misshapen but nervous limbs though disproportioned in person the dwarf was not so distorted as to argue any want of strength or activity while sir kenneth gazed on this disagreeable object the popular creed occurred to his remembrance concerning the gnomes or earthly spirits which make their abode in the caverns of the earth and so much did this figure correspond with ideas he had formed of their appearance that he looked on it with disgust mingled not indeed with fear but that sort of awe which the presence of a supernatural creature may infuse into the most steady bosom  the dwarf again whistled and summoned from beneath a companion this second figure ascended in the same manner as the first but it was a female arm in this second instance which upheld the lamp from the subterranean vault out of which these presentments arose and it was a female form much resembling the first in shape and proportions which slowly emerged from the floor her dress was also of red samite fantastically cut and flounced as if she had been dressed for some exhibition of mimes or jugglers and with the same minuteness which her predecessor had exhibited she passed the lamp over her face and person which seemed to rival the males in ugliness but with all this most unfavourable exterior there was one trait in the features of both which argued alertness and intelligence in the most uncommon degree this arose from the brilliancy of their eyes which deepset beneath black and shaggy brows gleamed with a lustre which like that in the eye of the toad seemed to make some amends for the extreme ugliness of countenance and person  sir kenneth remained as if spellbound while this unlovely pair moving round the chapel close to each other appeared to perform the duty of sweeping it like menials but as they used only one hand the floor was not much benefited by the exercise which they plied with such oddity of gestures and manner as befitted their bizarre and fantastic appearance when they approached near to the knight in the course of their occupation they ceased to use their brooms and placing themselves side by side directly opposite to sir kenneth they again slowly shifted the lights which they held so as to allow him distinctly to survey features which were not rendered more agreeable by being brought nearer and to observe the extreme quickness and keenness with which their black and glittering eyes flashed back the light of the lamps they then turned the gleam of both lights upon the knight and having accurately surveyed him turned their faces to each other and set up a loud yelling laugh which resounded in his ears the sound was so ghastly that sir kenneth started at hearing it and hastily demanded in the name of god who they were who profaned that holy place with such antic gestures and elritch exclamations  i am the dwarf nectabanus said the abortionseeming male in a voice corresponding to his figure and resembling the voice of the nightcrow more than any sound which is heard by daylight  and i am guenevra his lady and his love replied the female in tones which being shriller were yet wilder than those of her companion  wherefore are you here again demanded the knight scarcely yet assured that they were human beings which he saw before him  i am replied the male dwarf with much assumed gravity and dignity the twelfth imaum i am mohammed mohadi the guide and the conductor of the faithful a hundred horses stand ready saddled for me and my train at the holy city and as many at the city of refuge i am he who shall bear witness and this is one of my houris  thou liest answered the female interrupting her companion in tones yet shriller than his own i am none of thy houris and thou art no such infidel trash as the mohammed of whom thou speakest may my curse rest upon his coffin i tell thee thou ass of issachar thou art king arthur of britain whom the fairies stole away from the field of avalon and i am dame guenevra famed for her beauty  but in truth noble sir said the male we are distressed princes dwelling under the wing of king guy of jerusalem until he was driven out from his own nest by the foul infidelsheavens bolts consume them  hush said a voice from the side upon which the knight had enteredhush fools and begone your ministry is ended  the dwarfs had no sooner heard the command than gibbering in discordant whispers to each other they blew out their lights at once and left the knight in utter darkness which when the pattering of their retiring feet had died away was soon accompanied by its fittest companion total silence  the knight felt the departure of these unfortunate creatures a relief he could not from their language manners and appearance doubt that they belonged to the degraded class of beings whom deformity of person and weakness of intellect recommended to the painful situation of appendages to great families where their personal appearance and imbecility were food for merriment to the household superior in no respect to the ideas and manners of his time the scottish knight might at another period have been much amused by the mummery of these poor effigies of humanity but now their appearance gesticulations and language broke the train of deep and solemn feeling with which he was impressed and he rejoiced in the disappearance of the unhappy objects  a few minutes after they had retired the door at which he had entered opened slowly and remaining ajar discovered a faint light arising from a lantern placed upon the threshold its doubtful and wavering gleam showed a dark form reclined beside the entrance but without its precincts which on approaching it more nearly he recognized to be the hermit crouching in the same humble posture in which he had at first laid himself down and which doubtless he had retained during the whole time of his guests continuing in the chapel  all is over said the hermit as he heard the knight approaching and the most wretched of earthly sinners with him who should think himself most honoured and most happy among the race of humanity must retire from this place take the light and guide me down the descent for i must not uncover my eyes until i am far from this hallowed spot  the scottish knight obeyed in silence for a solemn and yet ecstatic sense of what he had seen had silenced even the eager workings of curiosity he led the way with considerable accuracy through the various secret passages and stairs by which they had ascended until at length they found themselves in the outward cell of the hermits cavern  the condemned criminal is restored to his dungeon reprieved from one miserable day to another until his awful judge shall at length appoint the welldeserved sentence to be carried into execution  as the hermit spoke these words he laid aside the veil with which his eyes had been bound and looked at it with a suppressed and hollow sigh no sooner had he restored it to the crypt from which he had caused the scot to bring it than he said hastily and sternly to his companion begone begoneto rest to rest you may sleepyou can sleepi neither can nor may  respecting the profound agitation with which this was spoken the knight retired into the inner cell but casting back his eye as he left the exterior grotto he beheld the anchorite stripping his shoulders with frantic haste of their shaggy mantle and ere he could shut the frail door which separated the two compartments of the cavern he heard the clang of the scourge and the groans of the penitent under his selfinflicted penance a cold shudder came over the knight as he reflected what could be the foulness of the sin what the depth of the remorse which apparently such severe penance could neither cleanse nor assuage he told his beads devoutly and flung himself on his rude couch after a glance at the still sleeping moslem and wearied by the various scenes of the day and the night soon slept as sound as infancy upon his awaking in the morning he held certain conferences with the hermit upon matters of importance and the result of their intercourse induced him to remain for two days longer in the grotto he was regular as became a pilgrim in his devotional exercises but was not again admitted to the chapel in which he had seen such wonders    chapter vi       now change the sceneand let the trumpets sound      for we must rouse the lion from his lair  old play  the scene must change as our programme has announced from the mountain wilderness of jordan to the camp of king richard of england then stationed betwixt jean dacre and ascalon and containing that army with which he of the lion heart had promised himself a triumphant march to jerusalem and in which he would probably have succeeded if not hindered by the jealousies of the christian princes engaged in the same enterprise and the offence taken by them at the uncurbed haughtiness of the english monarch and richards unveiled contempt for his brother sovereigns who his equals in rank were yet far his inferiors in courage hardihood and military talents such discords and particularly those betwixt richard and philip of france created disputes and obstacles which impeded every active measure proposed by the heroic though impetuous richard while the ranks of the crusaders were daily thinned not only by the desertion of individuals but of entire bands headed by their respective feudal leaders who withdrew from a contest in which they had ceased to hope for success  the effects of the climate became as usual fatal to soldiers from the north and the more so that the dissolute license of the crusaders forming a singular contrast to the principles and purpose of their taking up arms rendered them more easy victims to the insalubrious influence of burning heat and chilling dews to these discouraging causes of loss was to be added the sword of the enemy saladin than whom no greater name is recorded in eastern history had learned to his fatal experience that his lightarmed followers were little able to meet in close encounter with the ironclad franks and had been taught at the same time to apprehend and dread the adventurous character of his antagonist richard but if his armies were more than once routed with great slaughter his numbers gave the saracen the advantage in those lighter skirmishes of which many were inevitable  as the army of his assailants decreased the enterprises of the sultan became more numerous and more bold in this species of petty warfare the camp of the crusaders was surrounded and almost besieged by clouds of light cavalry resembling swarms of wasps easily crushed when they are once grasped but furnished with wings to elude superior strength and stings to inflict harm and mischief there was perpetual warfare of posts and foragers in which many valuable lives were lost without any corresponding object being gained convoys were intercepted and communications were cut off the crusaders had to purchase the means of sustaining life by life itself and water like that of the well of bethlehem longed for by king david one of its ancient monarchs was then as before only obtained by the expenditure of blood  these evils were in a great measure counterbalanced by the stern resolution and restless activity of king richard who with some of his best knights was ever on horseback ready to repair to any point where danger occurred and often not only bringing unexpected succour to the christians but discomfiting the infidels when they seemed most secure of victory but even the iron frame of coeur de lion could not support without injury the alternations of the unwholesome climate joined to ceaseless exertions of body and mind he became afflicted with one of those slow and wasting fevers peculiar to asia and in despite of his great strength and still greater courage grew first unfit to mount on horseback and then unable to attend the councils of war which were from time to time held by the crusaders it was difficult to say whether this state of personal inactivity was rendered more galling or more endurable to the english monarch by the resolution of the council to engage in a truce of thirty days with the sultan saladin for on the one hand if he was incensed at the delay which this interposed to the progress of the great enterprise he was on the other somewhat consoled by knowing that others were not acquiring laurels while he remained inactive upon a sickbed  that however which coeur de lion could least excuse was the general inactivity which prevailed in the camp of the crusaders so soon as his illness assumed a serious aspect and the reports which he extracted from his unwilling attendants gave him to understand that the hopes of the host had abated in proportion to his illness and that the interval of truce was employed not in recruiting their numbers reanimating their courage fostering their spirit of conquest and preparing for a speedy and determined advance upon the holy city which was the object of their expedition but in securing the camp occupied by their diminished followers with trenches palisades and other fortifications as if preparing rather to repel an attack from a powerful enemy so soon as hostilities should recommence than to assume the proud character of conquerors and assailants  the english king chafed under these reports like the imprisoned lion viewing his prey from the iron barriers of his cage naturally rash and impetuous the irritability of his temper preyed on itself he was dreaded by his attendants and even the medical assistants feared to assume the necessary authority which a physician to do justice to his patient must needs exercise over him one faithful baron who perhaps from the congenial nature of his disposition was devoutly attached to the kings person dared alone to come between the dragon and his wrath and quietly but firmly maintained a control which no other dared assume over the dangerous invalid and which thomas de multon only exercised because he esteemed his sovereigns life and honour more than he did the degree of favour which he might lose or even the risk which he might incur in nursing a patient so intractable and whose displeasure was so perilous  sir thomas was the lord of gilsland in cumberland and in an age when surnames and titles were not distinctly attached as now to the individuals who bore them he was called by the normans the lord de vaux and in english by the saxons who clung to their native language and were proud of the share of saxon blood in this renowned warriors veins he was termed thomas or more familiarly thom of the gills or narrow valleys from which his extensive domains derived their wellknown appellation  this chief had been exercised in almost all the wars whether waged betwixt england and scotland or amongst the various domestic factions which then tore the former country asunder and in all had been distinguished as well from his military conduct as his personal prowess he was in other respects a rude soldier blunt and careless in his bearing and taciturnnay almost sullenin his habits of society and seeming at least to disclaim all knowledge of policy and of courtly art there were men however who pretended to look deeply into character who asserted that the lord de vaux was not less shrewd and aspiring than he was blunt and bold and who thought that while he assimilated himself to the kings own character of blunt hardihood it was in some degree at least with an eye to establish his favour and to gratify his own hopes of deeplaid ambition but no one cared to thwart his schemes if such he had by rivalling him in the dangerous occupation of daily attendance on the sickbed of a patient whose disease was pronounced infectious and more especially when it was remembered that the patient was coeur de lion suffering under all the furious impatience of a soldier withheld from battle and a sovereign sequestered from authority and the common soldiers at least in the english army were generally of opinion that de vaux attended on the king like comrade upon comrade in the honest and disinterested frankness of military friendship contracted between the partakers of daily dangers  it was on the decline of a syrian day that richard lay on his couch of sickness loathing it as much in mind as his illness made it irksome to his body his bright blue eye which at all times shone with uncommon keenness and splendour had its vivacity augmented by fever and mental impatience and glanced from among his curled and unshorn locks of yellow hair as fitfully and as vividly as the last gleams of the sun shoot through the clouds of an approaching thunderstorm which still however are gilded by its beams his manly features showed the progress of wasting illness and his beard neglected and untrimmed had overgrown both lips and chin casting himself from side to side now clutching towards him the coverings which at the next moment he flung as impatiently from him his tossed couch and impatient gestures showed at once the energy and the reckless impatience of a disposition whose natural sphere was that of the most active exertion  beside his couch stood thomas de vaux in face attitude and manner the strongest possible contrast to the suffering monarch his stature approached the gigantic and his hair in thickness might have resembled that of samson though only after the israelitish champions locks had passed under the shears of the philistines for those of de vaux were cut short that they might be enclosed under his helmet the light of his broad large hazel eye resembled that of the autumn morn and it was only perturbed for a moment when from time to time it was attracted by richards vehement marks of agitation and restlessness his features though massive like his person might have been handsome before they were defaced with scars his upper lip after the fashion of the normans was covered with thick moustaches which grew so long and luxuriantly as to mingle with his hair and like his hair were dark brown slightly brindled with grey his frame seemed of that kind which most readily defies both toil and climate for he was thinflanked broadchested longarmed deepbreathed and stronglimbed he had not laid aside his buffcoat which displayed the cross cut on the shoulder for more than three nights enjoying but such momentary repose as the warder of a sick monarchs couch might by snatches indulge this baron rarely changed his posture except to administer to richard the medicine or refreshments which none of his less favoured attendants could persuade the impatient monarch to take and there was something affecting in the kindly yet awkward manner in which he discharged offices so strangely contrasted with his blunt and soldierly habits and manners  the pavilion in which these personages were had as became the time as well as the personal character of richard more of a warlike than a sumptuous or royal character weapons offensive and defensive several of them of strange and newlyinvented construction were scattered about the tented apartment or disposed upon the pillars which supported it skins of animals slain in the chase were stretched on the ground or extended along the sides of the pavilion and upon a heap of these silvan spoils lay three alans as they were then called wolfgreyhounds that is of the largest size and as white as snow their faces marked with many a scar from clutch and fang showed their share in collecting the trophies upon which they reposed and their eyes fixed from time to time with an expressive stretch and yawn upon the bed of richard evinced how much they marvelled at and regretted the unwonted inactivity which they were compelled to share these were but the accompaniments of the soldier and huntsman but on a small table close by the bed was placed a shield of wrought steel of triangular form bearing the three lions passant first assumed by the chivalrous monarch and before it the golden circlet resembling much a ducal coronet only that it was higher in front than behind which with the purple velvet and embroidered tiara that lined it formed then the emblem of englands sovereignty beside it as if prompt for defending the regal symbol lay a mighty curtalaxe which would have wearied the arm of any other than coeur de lion  in an outer partition of the pavilion waited two or three officers of the royal household depressed anxious for their masters health and not less so for their own safety in case of his decease their gloomy apprehensions spread themselves to the warders without who paced about in downcast and silent contemplation or resting on their halberds stood motionless on their post rather like armed trophies than living warriors  so thou hast no better news to bring me from without sir thomas said the king after a long and perturbed silence spent in the feverish agitation which we have endeavoured to describe all our knights turned women and our ladies become devotees and neither a spark of valour nor of gallantry to enlighten a camp which contains the choicest of europes chivalryha  the truce my lord said de vaux with the same patience with which he had twenty times repeated the explanationthe truce prevents us bearing ourselves as men of action and for the ladies i am no great reveller as is well known to your majesty and seldom exchange steel and buff for velvet and goldbut thus far i know that our choicest beauties are waiting upon the queens majesty and the princess to a pilgrimage to the convent of engaddi to accomplish their vows for your highnesss deliverance from this trouble  and is it thus said richard with the impatience of indisposition that royal matrons and maidens should risk themselves where the dogs who defile the land have as little truth to man as they have faith towards god  nay my lord said de vaux they have saladins word for their safety  true true replied richard and i did the heathen soldan injusticei owe him reparation for it would god i were but fit to offer it him upon my body between the two hostschristendom and heathenesse both looking on  as richard spoke he thrust his right arm out of bed naked to the shoulder and painfully raising himself in his couch shook his clenched hand as if it grasped sword or battleaxe and was then brandished over the jewelled turban of the soldan it was not without a gentle degree of violence which the king would scarce have endured from another that de vaux in his character of sicknurse compelled his royal master to replace himself in the couch and covered his sinewy arm neck and shoulders with the care which a mother bestows upon an impatient child  thou art a rough nurse though a willing one de vaux said the king laughing with a bitter expression while he submitted to the strength which he was unable to resist methinks a coif would become thy lowering features as well as a childs biggin would beseem mine we should be a babe and nurse to frighten girls with  we have frightened men in our time my liege said de vaux and i trust may live to frighten them again what is a feverfit that we should not endure it patiently in order to get rid of it easily  feverfit exclaimed richard impetuously thou mayest think and justly that it is a feverfit with me but what is it with all the other christian princeswith philip of france with that dull austrian with him of montserrat with the hospitallers with the templarswhat is it with all them i will tell thee it is a cold palsy a dead lethargy a disease that deprives them of speech and action a canker that has eaten into the heart of all that is noble and chivalrous and virtuous among themthat has made them false to the noblest vow ever knights were sworn tohas made them indifferent to their fame and forgetful of their god  for the love of heaven my liege said de vaux take it less violentlyyou will be heard without doors where such speeches are but too current already among the common soldiery and engender discord and contention in the christian host bethink you that your illness mars the mainspring of their enterprise a mangonel will work without screw and lever better than the christian host without king richard  thou flatterest me de vaux said richard and not insensible to the power of praise he reclined his head on the pillow with a more deliberate attempt to repose than he had yet exhibited but thomas de vaux was no courtier the phrase which had offered had risen spontaneously to his lips and he knew not how to pursue the pleasing theme so as to soothe and prolong the vein which he had excited he was silent therefore until relapsing into his moody contemplations the king demanded of him sharply despardieux this is smoothly said to soothe a sick man but does a league of monarchs an assemblage or nobles a convocation of all the chivalry of europe droop with the sickness of one man though he chances to be king of england why should richards illness or richards death check the march of thirty thousand men as brave as himself when the master stag is struck down the herd do not disperse upon his fall when the falcon strikes the leading crane another takes the guidance of the phalanx why do not the powers assemble and choose some one to whom they may entrust the guidance of the host  forsooth and if it please your majesty said de vaux i hear consultations have been held among the royal leaders for some such purpose  ha exclaimed richard his jealousy awakened giving his mental irritation another direction am i forgot by my allies ere i have taken the last sacrament do they hold me dead already but no no they are right and whom do they select as leader of the christian host  rank and dignity said de vaux point to the king of france  oh ay answered the english monarch philip of france and navarredenis mountjoiehis most christian majesty mouthfilling words these there is but one riskthat he might mistake the words en arriere for en avant and lead us back to paris instead of marching to jerusalem his politic head has learned by this time that there is more to be gotten by oppressing his feudatories and pillaging his allies than fighting with the turks for the holy sepulchre  they might choose the archduke of austria said de vaux  what because he is big and burly like thyself thomasnearly as thickheaded but without thy indifference to danger and carelessness of offence i tell thee that austria has in all that mass of flesh no bolder animation than is afforded by the peevishness of a wasp and the courage of a wren out upon him he a leader of chivalry to deeds of glory give him a flagon of rhenish to drink with his besmirched baarenhauters and lanceknechts  there is the grand master of the templars continued the baron not sorry to keep his masters attention engaged on other topics than his own illness though at the expense of the characters of prince and potentate there is the grand master of the templars he continued undaunted skilful brave in battle and sage in council having no separate kingdoms of his own to divert his exertions from the recovery of the holy landwhat thinks your majesty of the master as a general leader of the christian host  ha beauseant answered the king oh no exception can be taken to brother giles amaury he understands the ordering of a battle and the fighting in front when it begins but sir thomas were it fair to take the holy land from the heathen saladin so full of all the virtues which may distinguish unchristened man and give it to giles amaury a worse pagan than himself an idolater a devilworshipper a necromancer who practises crimes the most dark and unnatural in the vaults and secret places of abomination and darkness  the grand master of the hospitallers of st john of jerusalem is not tainted by fame either with heresy or magic said thomas de vaux  but is he not a sordid miser said richard hastily has he not been suspecteday more than suspectedof selling to the infidels those advantages which they would never have won by fair force tush man better give the army to be made merchandise of by venetian skippers and lombardy pedlars than trust it to the grand master of st john  well then i will venture but another guess said the baron de vaux what say you to the gallant marquis of montserrat so wise so elegant such a good manatarms  wisecunning you would say replied richard elegant in a ladys chamber if you will oh ay conrade of montserratwho knows not the popinjay politic and versatile he will change you his purposes as often as the trimmings of his doublet and you shall never be able to guess the hue of his inmost vestments from their outward colours a manatarms ay a fine figure on horseback and can bear him well in the tiltyard and at the barriers when swords are blunted at point and edge and spears are tipped with trenchers of wood instead of steel pikes wert thou not with me when i said to that same gay marquis here we be three good christians and on yonder plain there pricks a band of some threescore saracenswhat say you to charge them briskly there are but twenty unbelieving miscreants to each true knight  i recollect the marquis replied said de vaux that his limbs were of flesh not of iron and that he would rather bear the heart of a man than of a beast though that beast were the lion but i see how it iswe shall end where we began without hope of praying at the sepulchre until heaven shall restore king richard to health  at this grave remark richard burst out into a hearty fit of laughter the first which he had for some time indulged in why what a thing is conscience he said that through its means even such a thickwitted northern lord as thou canst bring thy sovereign to confess his folly it is true that did they not propose themselves as fit to hold my leadingstaff little should i care for plucking the silken trappings off the puppets thou hast shown me in succession what concerns it me what fine tinsel robes they swagger in unless when they are named as rivals in the glorious enterprise to which i have vowed myself yes de vaux i confess my weakness and the wilfulness of my ambition the christian camp contains doubtless many a better knight than richard of england and it would be wise and worthy to assign to the best of them the leading of the host but continued the warlike monarch raising himself in his bed and shaking the cover from his head while his eyes sparkled as they were wont to do on the eve of battle were such a knight to plant the banner of the cross on the temple of jerusalem while i was unable to bear my share in the noble task he should so soon as i was fit to lay lance in rest undergo my challenge to mortal combat for having diminished my fame and pressed in before to the object of my enterprise but hark what trumpets are those at a distance  those of king philip as i guess my liege said the stout englishman  thou art dull of ear thomas said the king endeavouring to start up hearest thou not that clash and clang by heaven the turks are in the campi hear their lelies the warcries of the moslemah  he again endeavoured to get out of bed and de vaux was obliged to exercise his own great strength and also to summon the assistance of the chamberlains from the inner tent to restrain him  thou art a false traitor de vaux said the incensed monarch when breathless and exhausted with struggling he was compelled to submit to superior strength and to repose in quiet on his couch i would i werei would i were but strong enough to dash thy brains out with my battleaxe  i would you had the strength my liege said de vaux and would even take the risk of its being so employed the odds would be great in favour of christendom were thomas multon dead and coeur de lion himself again  mine honest faithful servant said richard extending his hand which the baron reverentially saluted forgive thy masters impatience of mood it is this burning fever which chides thee and not thy kind master richard of england but go i prithee and bring me word what strangers are in the camp for these sounds are not of christendom  de vaux left the pavilion on the errand assigned and in his absence which he had resolved should be brief he charged the chamberlains pages and attendants to redouble their attention on their sovereign with threats of holding them to responsibility which rather added to than diminished their timid anxiety in the discharge of their duty for next perhaps to the ire of the monarch himself they dreaded that of the stern and inexorable lord of gilsland sir thomas multon of gilsland    chapter vii       there never was a time on the march parts yet      when scottish with english met      but it was marvel if the red blood ran not      as the rain does in the street      battle of otterbourne  a considerable band of scottish warriors had joined the crusaders and had naturally placed themselves under the command of the english monarch being like his native troops most of them of saxon and norman descent speaking the same languages possessed some of them of english as well as scottish demesnes and allied in some cases by blood and intermarriage the period also preceded that when the grasping ambition of edward i gave a deadly and envenomed character to the wars betwixt the two nationsthe english fighting for the subjugation of scotland and the scottish with all the stern determination and obstinacy which has ever characterized their nation for the defence of their independence by the most violent means under the most disadvantageous circumstances and at the most extreme hazard as yet wars betwixt the two nations though fierce and frequent had been conducted on principles of fair hostility and admitted of those softening shades by which courtesy and the respect for open and generous foemen qualify and mitigate the horrors of war in time of peace therefore and especially when both as at present were engaged in war waged in behalf of a common cause and rendered dear to them by their ideas of religion the adventurers of both countries frequently fought side by side their national emulation serving only to stimulate them to excel each other in their efforts against the common enemy  the frank and martial character of richard who made no distinction betwixt his own subjects and those of william of scotland excepting as they bore themselves in the field of battle tended much to conciliate the troops of both nations but upon his illness and the disadvantageous circumstances in which the crusaders were placed the national disunion between the various bands united in the crusade began to display itself just as old wounds break out afresh in the human body when under the influence of disease or debility  the scottish and english equally jealous and highspirited and apt to take offencethe former the more so because the poorer and the weaker nationbegan to fill up by internal dissension the period when the truce forbade them to wreak their united vengeance on the saracens like the contending roman chiefs of old the scottish would admit no superiority and their southern neighbours would brook no equality there were charges and recriminations and both the common soldiery and their leaders and commanders who had been good comrades in time of victory lowered on each other in the period of adversity as if their union had not been then more essential than ever not only to the success of their common cause but to their joint safety the same disunion had begun to show itself betwixt the french and english the italians and the germans and even between the danes and swedes but it is only that which divided the two nations whom one island bred and who seemed more animated against each other for the very reason that our narrative is principally concerned with  of all the english nobles who had followed their king to palestine de vaux was most prejudiced against the scottish they were his near neighbours with whom he had been engaged during his whole life in private or public warfare and on whom he had inflicted many calamities while he had sustained at their hands not a few his love and devotion to the king was like the vivid affection of the old english mastiff to his master leaving him churlish and inaccessible to all others even towards those to whom he was indifferentand rough and dangerous to any against whom he entertained a prejudice de vaux had never observed without jealousy and displeasure his king exhibit any mark of courtesy or favour to the wicked deceitful and ferocious race born on the other side of a river or an imaginary line drawn through waste and wilderness and he even doubted the success of a crusade in which they were suffered to bear arms holding them in his secret soul little better than the saracens whom he came to combat it may be added that as being himself a blunt and downright englishman unaccustomed to conceal the slightest movement either of love or of dislike he accounted the fairspoken courtesy which the scots had learned either from imitation of their frequent allies the french or which might have arisen from their own proud and reserved character as a false and astucious mark of the most dangerous designs against their neighbours over whom he believed with genuine english confidence they could by fair manhood never obtain any advantage  yet though de vaux entertained these sentiments concerning his northern neighbours and extended them with little mitigation even to such as had assumed the cross his respect for the king and a sense of the duty imposed by his vow as a crusader prevented him from displaying them otherwise than by regularly shunning all intercourse with his scottish brethrenatarms as far as possible by observing a sullen taciturnity when compelled to meet them occasionally and by looking scornfully upon them when they encountered on the march and in camp the scottish barons and knights were not men to bear his scorn unobserved or unreplied to and it came to that pass that he was regarded as the determined and active enemy of a nation whom after all he only disliked and in some sort despised nay it was remarked by close observers that if he had not towards them the charity of scripture which suffereth long and judges kindly he was by no means deficient in the subordinate and limited virtue which alleviates and relieves the wants of others the wealth of thomas of gilsland procured supplies of provisions and medicines and some of these usually flowed by secret channels into the quarters of the scottishhis surly benevolence proceeding on the principle that next to a mans friend his foe was of most importance to him passing over all the intermediate relations as too indifferent to merit even a thought this explanation is necessary in order that the reader may fully understand what we are now to detail  thomas de vaux had not made many steps beyond the entrance of the royal pavilion when he was aware of what the far more acute ear of the english monarchno mean proficient in the art of minstrelsyhad instantly discovered that the musical strains namely which had reached their ears were produced by the pipes shalms and kettledrums of the saracens and at the bottom of an avenue of tents which formed a broad access to the pavilion of richard he could see a crowd of idle soldiers assembled around the spot from which the music was heard almost in the centre of the camp and he saw with great surprise mingled amid the helmets of various forms worn by the crusaders of different nations white turbans and long pikes announcing the presence of armed saracens and the huge deformed heads of several camels or dromedaries overlooking the multitude by aid of their long disproportioned necks  wondering and displeased at a sight so unexpected and singularfor it was customary to leave all flags of truce and other communications from the enemy at an appointed place without the barriersthe baron looked eagerly round for some one of whom he might inquire the cause of this alarming novelty  the first person whom he met advancing to him he set down at once by his grave and haughty step as a spaniard or a scot and presently after muttered to himself and a scot it ishe of the leopard i have seen him fight indifferently well for one of his country  loath to ask even a passing question he was about to pass sir kenneth with that sullen and lowering port which seems to say i know thee but i will hold no communication with thee but his purpose was defeated by the northern knight who moved forward directly to him and accosting him with formal courtesy said my lord de vaux of gilsland i have in charge to speak with you  ha returned the english baron with me but say your pleasure so it be shortly spokeni am on the kings errand  mine touches king richard yet more nearly answered sir kenneth i bring him i trust health  the lord of gilsland measured the scot with incredulous eyes and replied thou art no leech i think sir scot i had as soon thought of your bringing the king of england wealth  sir kenneth though displeased with the manner of the barons reply answered calmly health to richard is glory and wealth to christendombut my time presses i pray you may i see the king  surely not fair sir said the baron until your errand be told more distinctly the sick chambers of princes open not to all who inquire like a northern hostelry  my lord said kenneth the cross which i wear in common with yourself and the importance of what i have to tell must for the present cause me to pass over a bearing which else i were unapt to endure in plain language then i bring with me a moorish physician who undertakes to work a cure on king richard  a moorish physician said de vaux and who will warrant that he brings not poisons instead of remedies  his own life my lordhis head which he offers as a guarantee  i have known many a resolute ruffian said de vaux who valued his own life as little as it deserved and would troop to the gallows as merrily as if the hangman were his partner in a dance  but thus it is my lord replied the scot saladin to whom none will deny the credit of a generous and valiant enemy hath sent this leech hither with an honourable retinue and guard befitting the high estimation in which el hakim the physician is held by the soldan and with fruits and refreshments for the kings private chamber and such message as may pass betwixt honourable enemies praying him to be recovered of his fever that he may be the fitter to receive a visit from the soldan with his naked scimitar in his hand and a hundred thousand cavaliers at his back will it please you who are of the kings secret council to cause these camels to be discharged of their burdens and some order taken as to the reception of the learned physician  wonderful said de vaux as speaking to himselfand who will vouch for the honour of saladin in a case when bad faith would rid him at once of his most powerful adversary  i myself replied sir kenneth will be his guarantee with honour life and fortune  strange again ejaculated de vaux the north vouches for the souththe scot for the turk may i crave of you sir knight how you became concerned in this affair  i have been absent on a pilgrimage in the course of which replied sir kenneth i had a message to discharge towards the holy hermit of engaddi  may i not be entrusted with it sir kenneth and with the answer of the holy man  it may not be my lord answered the scot  i am of the secret council of england said the englishman haughtily  to which land i owe no allegiance said kenneth though i have voluntarily followed in this war the personal fortunes of englands sovereign i was dispatched by the general council of the kings princes and supreme leaders of the army of the blessed cross and to them only i render my errand  ha sayest thou said the proud baron de vaux but know messenger of the kings and princes as thou mayest be no leech shall approach the sickbed of richard of england without the consent of him of gilsland and they will come on evil errand who dare to intrude themselves against it  he was turning loftily away when the scot placing himself closer and more opposite to him asked in a calm voice yet not without expressing his share of pride whether the lord of gilsland esteemed him a gentleman and a good knight  all scots are ennobled by their birthright answered thomas de vaux something ironically but sensible of his own injustice and perceiving that kenneths colour rose he added for a good knight it were sin to doubt you in one at least who has seen you well and bravely discharge your devoir  well then said the scottish knight satisfied with the frankness of the last admission and let me swear to you thomas of gilsland that as i am true scottish man which i hold a privilege equal to my ancient gentry and as sure as i am a belted knight and come hither to acquire los loslaus praise or renown and fame in this mortal life and forgiveness of my sins in that which is to comeso truly and by the blessed cross which i wear do i protest unto you that i desire but the safety of richard coeur de lion in recommending the ministry of this moslem physician  the englishman was struck with the solemnity of the obtestation and answered with more cordiality than he had yet exhibited tell me sir knight of the leopard granting which i do not doubt that thou art thyself satisfied in this matter shall i do well in a land where the art of poisoning is as general as that of cooking to bring this unknown physician to practise with his drugs on a health so valuable to christendom  my lord replied the scot thus only can i replythat my squire the only one of my retinue whom war and disease had left in attendance on me has been of late suffering dangerously under this same fever which in valiant king richard has disabled the principal limb of our holy enterprise this leech this el hakim hath ministered remedies to him not two hours since and already he hath fallen into a refreshing sleep that he can cure the disorder which has proved so fatal i nothing doubt that he hath the purpose to do it is i think warranted by his mission from the royal soldan who is truehearted and loyal so far as a blinded infidel may be called so and for his eventual success the certainty of reward in case of succeeding and punishment in case of voluntary failure may be a sufficient guarantee  the englishman listened with downcast looks as one who doubted yet was not unwilling to receive conviction at length he looked up and said may i see your sick squire fair sir  the scottish knight hesitated and coloured yet answered at last willingly my lord of gilsland but you must remember when you see my poor quarter that the nobles and knights of scotland feed not so high sleep not so soft and care not for the magnificence of lodgment which is proper to their southern neighbours i am poorly lodged my lord of gilsland he added with a haughty emphasis on the word while with some unwillingness he led the way to his temporary place of abode  whatever were the prejudices of de vaux against the nation of his new acquaintance and though we undertake not to deny that some of these were excited by its proverbial poverty he had too much nobleness of disposition to enjoy the mortification of a brave individual thus compelled to make known wants which his pride would gladly have concealed  shame to the soldier of the cross he said who thinks of worldly splendour or of luxurious accommodation when pressing forward to the conquest of the holy city fare as hard as we may we shall yet be better than the host of martyrs and of saints who having trod these scenes before us now hold golden lamps and evergreen palms  this was the most metaphorical speech which thomas of gilsland was ever known to utter the rather perhaps as will sometimes happen that it did not entirely express his own sentiments being somewhat a lover of good cheer and splendid accommodation by this time they reached the place of the camp where the knight of the leopard had assumed his abode  appearances here did indeed promise no breach of the laws of mortification to which the crusaders according to the opinion expressed by him of gilsland ought to subject themselves a space of ground large enough to accommodate perhaps thirty tents according to the crusaders rules of castrametation was partly vacantbecause in ostentation the knight had demanded ground to the extent of his original retinuepartly occupied by a few miserable huts hastily constructed of boughs and covered with palmleaves these habitations seemed entirely deserted and several of them were ruinous the central hut which represented the pavilion of the leader was distinguished by his swallowtailed pennon placed on the point of a spear from which its long folds dropped motionless to the ground as if sickening under the scorching rays of the asiatic sun but no pages or squiresnot even a solitary warderwas placed by the emblem of feudal power and knightly degree if its reputation defended it not from insult it had no other guard  sir kenneth cast a melancholy look around him but suppressing his feelings entered the hut making a sign to the baron of gilsland to follow he also cast around a glance of examination which implied pity not altogether unmingled with contempt to which perhaps it is as nearly akin as it is said to be to love he then stooped his lofty crest and entered a lowly hut which his bulky form seemed almost entirely to fill  the interior of the hut was chiefly occupied by two beds one was empty but composed of collected leaves and spread with an antelopes hide it seemed from the articles of armour laid beside it and from a crucifix of silver carefully and reverentially disposed at the head to be the couch of the knight himself the other contained the invalid of whom sir kenneth had spoken a strongbuilt and harshfeatured man past as his looks betokened the middle age of life his couch was trimmed more softly than his masters and it was plain that the more courtly garments of the latter the loose robe in which the knights showed themselves on pacific occasions and the other little spare articles of dress and adornment had been applied by sir kenneth to the accommodation of his sick domestic in an outward part of the hut which yet was within the range of the english barons eye a boy rudely attired with buskins of deers hide a blue cap or bonnet and a doublet whose original finery was much tarnished sat on his knees by a chafingdish filled with charcoal cooking upon a plate of iron the cakes of barleybread which were then and still are a favourite food with the scottish people part of an antelope was suspended against one of the main props of the hut nor was it difficult to know how it had been procured for a large stag greyhound nobler in size and appearance than those even which guarded king richards sickbed lay eyeing the process of baking the cake the sagacious animal on their first entrance uttered a stifled growl which sounded from his deep chest like distant thunder but he saw his master and acknowledged his presence by wagging his tail and couching his head abstaining from more tumultuous or noisy greeting as if his noble instinct had taught him the propriety of silence in a sick mans chamber  beside the couch sat on a cushion also composed of skins the moorish physician of whom sir kenneth had spoken crosslegged after the eastern fashion the imperfect light showed little of him save that the lower part of his face was covered with a long black beard which descended over his breast that he wore a high tolpach a tartar cap of the lambs wool manufactured at astracan bearing the same dusky colour and that his ample caftan or turkish robe was also of a dark hue two piercing eyes which gleamed with unusual lustre were the only lineaments of his visage that could be discerned amid the darkness in which he was enveloped  the english lord stood silent with a sort of reverential awe for notwithstanding the roughness of his general bearing a scene of distress and poverty firmly endured without complaint or murmur would at any time have claimed more reverence from thomas de vaux than would all the splendid formalities of a royal presencechamber unless that presencechamber were king richards own nothing was for a time heard but the heavy and regular breathings of the invalid who seemed in profound repose  he hath not slept for six nights before said sir kenneth as i am assured by the youth his attendant  noble scot said thomas de vaux grasping the scottish knights hand with a pressure which had more of cordiality than he permitted his words to utter this gear must be amended your esquire is but too evil fed and looked to  in the latter part of this speech he naturally raised his voice to its usual decided tone the sick man was disturbed in his slumbers  my master he said murmuring as in a dream noble sir kenneth taste not to you as to me the waters of the clyde cold and refreshing after the brackish springs of palestine  he dreams of his native land and is happy in his slumbers whispered sir kenneth to de vaux but had scarce uttered the words when the physician arising from the place which he had taken near the couch of the sick and laying the hand of the patient whose pulse he had been carefully watching quietly upon the couch came to the two knights and taking them each by the arm while he intimated to them to remain silent led them to the front of the hut  in the name of issa ben mariam he said whom we honour as you though not with the same blinded superstition disturb not the effect of the blessed medicine of which he hath partaken to awaken him now is death or deprivation of reason but return at the hour when the muezzin calls from the minaret to evening prayer in the mosque and if left undisturbed until then i promise you this same frankish soldier shall be able without prejudice to his health to hold some brief converse with you on any matters on which either and especially his master may have to question him  the knights retreated before the authoritative commands of the leech who seemed fully to comprehend the importance of the eastern proverb that the sick chamber of the patient is the kingdom of the physician  they paused and remained standing together at the door of the hutsir kenneth with the air of one who expected his visitor to say farewell and de vaux as if he had something on his mind which prevented him from doing so the hound however had pressed out of the tent after them and now thrust his long rough countenance into the hand of his master as if modestly soliciting some mark of his kindness he had no sooner received the notice which he desired in the shape of a kind word and slight caress than eager to acknowledge his gratitude and joy for his masters return he flew off at full speed galloping in full career and with outstretched tail here and there about and around crossways and endlong through the decayed huts and the esplanade we have described but never transgressing those precincts which his sagacity knew were protected by his masters pennon after a few gambols of this kind the dog coming close up to his master laid at once aside his frolicsome mood relapsed into his usual gravity and slowness of gesture and deportment and looked as if he were ashamed that anything should have moved him to depart so far out of his sober selfcontrol  both knights looked on with pleasure for sir kenneth was justly proud of his noble hound and the northern english baron was of course an admirer of the chase and a judge of the animals merits  a right able dog he said i think fair sir king richard hath not an alan which may match him if he be as stanch as he is swift but let me pray youspeaking in all honour and kindnesshave you not heard the proclamation that no one under the rank of earl shall keep hunting dogs within king richards camp without the royal license which i think sir kenneth hath not been issued to you i speak as master of the horse  and i answer as a free scottish knight said kenneth sternly for the present i follow the banner of england but i cannot remember that i have ever subjected myself to the forestlaws of that kingdom nor have i such respect for them as would incline me to do so when the trumpet sounds to arms my foot is in the stirrup as soon as anywhen it clangs for the charge my lance has not yet been the last laid in the rest but for my hours of liberty or of idleness king richard has no title to bar my recreation  nevertheless said de vaux it is a folly to disobey the kings ordinance so with your good leave i as having authority in that matter will send you a protection for my friend here  i thank you said the scot coldly but he knows my allotted quarters and within these i can protect him myselfand yet he said suddenly changing his manner this is but a cold return for a wellmeant kindness i thank you my lord most heartily the kings equerries or prickers might find roswal at disadvantage and do him some injury which i should not perhaps be slow in returning and so ill might come of it you have seen so much of my housekeeping my lord he added with a smile that i need not shame to say that roswal is our principal purveyor and well i hope our lion richard will not be like the lion in the minstrel fable that went ahunting and kept the whole booty to himself i cannot think he would grudge a poor gentleman who follows him faithfully his hour of sport and his morsel of game more especially when other food is hard enough to come by  by my faith you do the king no more than justice and yet said the baron there is something in these words vert and venison that turns the very brains of our norman princes  we have heard of late said the scot by minstrels and pilgrims that your outlawed yeomen have formed great bands in the shires of york and nottingham having at their head a most stout archer called robin hood with his lieutenant little john methinks it were better that richard relaxed his forestcode in england than endeavour to enforce it in the holy land  wild work sir kenneth replied de vaux shrugging his shoulders as one who would avoid a perilous or unpleasing topica mad world sir i must now bid you adieu having presently to return to the kings pavilion at vespers i will again with your leave visit your quarters and speak with this same infidel physician i would in the meantime were it no offence willingly send you what would somewhat mend your cheer  i thank you sir said sir kenneth but it needs not roswal hath already stocked my larder for two weeks since the sun of palestine if it brings diseases serves also to dry venison  the two warriors parted much better friends than they had met but ere they separated thomas de vaux informed himself at more length of the circumstances attending the mission of the eastern physician and received from the scottish knight the credentials which he had brought to king richard on the part of saladin    chapter viii       a wise physician skilled our wounds to heal      is more than armies to the common weal        popes illiad   this is a strange tale sir thomas said the sick monarch when he had heard the report of the trusty baron of gilsland art thou sure this scottish man is a tall man and true  i cannot say my lord replied the jealous borderer i live a little too near the scots to gather much truth among them having found them ever fair and false but this mans bearing is that of a true man were he a devil as well as a scot that i must needs say for him in conscience  and for his carriage as a knight how sayest thou de vaux demanded the king  it is your majestys business more than mine to note mens bearings and i warrant you have noted the manner in which this man of the leopard hath borne himself he hath been full well spoken of  and justly thomas said the king we have ourselves witnessed him it is indeed our purpose in placing ourselves ever in the front of battle to see how our liegemen and followers acquit themselves and not from a desire to accumulate vainglory to ourselves as some have supposed we know the vanity of the praise of man which is but a vapour and buckle on our armour for other purposes than to win it  de vaux was alarmed when he heard the king make a declaration so inconsistent with his nature and believed at first that nothing short of the approach of death could have brought him to speak in depreciating terms of military renown which was the very breath of his nostrils but recollecting he had met the royal confessor in the outer pavilion he was shrewd enough to place this temporary selfabasement to the effect of the reverend mans lesson and suffered the king to proceed without reply  yes continued richard i have indeed marked the manner in which this knight does his devoir my leadingstaff were not worth a fools bauble had he escaped my notice and he had ere now tasted of our bounty but that i have also marked his overweening and audacious presumption  my liege said the baron of gilsland observing the kings countenance change i fear i have transgressed your pleasure in lending some countenance to his transgression  how de multon thou said the king contracting his brows and speaking in a tone of angry surprise thou countenance his insolence it cannot be  nay your majesty will pardon me to remind you that i have by mine office right to grant liberty to men of gentle blood to keep them a hound or two within camp just to cherish the noble art of venerie and besides it were a sin to have maimed or harmed a thing so noble as this gentlemans dog  has he then a dog so handsome said the king  a most perfect creature of heaven said the baron who was an enthusiast in fieldsportsof the noblest northern breeddeep in the chest strong in the sternblack colour and brindled on the breast and legs not spotted with white but just shaded into greystrength to pull down a bull swiftness to cote an antelope  the king laughed at his enthusiasm well thou hast given him leave to keep the hound so there is an end of it be not however liberal of your licenses among those knights adventurers who have no prince or leader to depend upon they are ungovernable and leave no game in palestinebut to this piece of learned heathenessesayest thou the scot met him in the desert  no my liege the scots tale runs thus he was dispatched to the old hermit of engaddi of whom men talk so much  sdeath and hell said richard starting up by whom dispatched and for what who dared send any one thither when our queen was in the convent of engaddi upon her pilgrimage for our recovery  the council of the crusade sent him my lord answered the baron de vaux for what purpose he declined to account to me i think it is scarce known in the camp that your royal consort is on a pilgrimage and even the princes may not have been aware as the queen has been sequestered from company since your love prohibited her attendance in case of infection  well it shall be looked into said richard so this scottish man this envoy met with a wandering physician at the grotto of engaddiha  not so my liege replied de vaux but he met i think near that place with a saracen emir with whom he had some melee in the way of proof of valour and finding him worthy to bear brave men company they went together as errant knights are wont to the grotto of engaddi  here de vaux stopped for he was not one of those who can tell a long story in a sentence  and did they there meet the physician demanded the king impatiently  no my liege replied de vaux but the saracen learning your majestys grievous illness undertook that saladin should send his own physician to you and with many assurances of his eminent skill and he came to the grotto accordingly after the scottish knight had tarried a day for him and more he is attended as if he were a prince with drums and atabals and servants on horse and foot and brings with him letters of credence from saladin  have they been examined by giacomo loredani  i showed them to the interpreter ere bringing them hither and behold their contents in english  richard took a scroll in which were inscribed these words the blessing of allah and his prophet mohammed out upon the hound said richard spitting in contempt by way of interjection saladin king of kings saldan of egypt and of syria the light and refuge of the earth to the great melech ric richard of england greeting whereas we have been informed that the hand of sickness hath been heavy upon thee our royal brother and that thou hast with thee only such nazarene and jewish mediciners as work without the blessing of allah and our holy prophet confusion on his head again muttered the english monarch we have therefore sent to tend and wait upon thee at this time the physician to our own person adonbec el hakim before whose face the angel azrael the angel of death spreads his wings and departs from the sick chamber who knows the virtues of herbs and stones the path of the sun moon and stars and can save man from all that is not written on his forehead and this we do praying you heartily to honour and make use of his skill not only that we may do service to thy worth and valour which is the glory of all the nations of frangistan but that we may bring the controversy which is at present between us to an end either by honourable agreement or by open trial thereof with our weapons in a fair fieldseeing that it neither becomes thy place and courage to die the death of a slave who hath been overwrought by his taskmaster nor befits it our fame that a brave adversary be snatched from our weapon by such a disease and therefore may the holy  hold hold said richard i will have no more of his dog of a prophet it makes me sick to think the valiant and worthy soldan should believe in a dead dog yes i will see his physician i will put myself into the charge of this hakimi will repay the noble soldan his generosityi will meet saladin in the field as he so worthily proposes and he shall have no cause to term richard of england ungrateful i will strike him to the earth with my battleaxei will convert him to holy church with such blows as he has rarely endured he shall recant his errors before my good crosshandled sword and i will have him baptized on the battlefield from my own helmet though the cleansing waters were mixed with the blood of us bothhaste de vaux why dost thou delay a conclusion so pleasing fetch the hakim hither  my lord said the baron who perhaps saw some accession of fever in this overflow of confidence bethink you the soldan is a pagan and that you are his most formidable enemy  for which reason he is the more bound to do me service in this matter lest a paltry fever end the quarrel betwixt two such kings i tell thee he loves me as i love himas noble adversaries ever love each other by my honour it were sin to doubt his good faith  nevertheless my lord it were well to wait the issue of these medicines upon the scottish squire said the lord of gilsland my own life depends upon it for worthy were i to die like a dog did i proceed rashly in this matter and make shipwreck of the weal of christendom  i never knew thee before hesitate for fear of life said richard upbraidingly  nor would i now my liege replied the stouthearted baron save that yours lies at pledge as well as my own  well thou suspicious mortal answered richard begone then and watch the progress of this remedy i could almost wish it might either cure or kill me for i am weary of lying here like an ox dying of the murrain when tambours are beating horses stamping and trumpets sounding without  the baron hastily departed resolved however to communicate his errand to some churchman as he felt something burdened in conscience at the idea of his master being attended by an unbeliever  the archbishop of tyre was the first to whom he confided his doubts knowing his interest with his master richard who both loved and honoured that sagacious prelate the bishop heard the doubts which de vaux stated with that acuteness of intelligence which distinguishes the roman catholic clergy the religious scruples of de vaux he treated with as much lightness as propriety permitted him to exhibit on such a subject to a layman  mediciners he said like the medicines which they employed were often useful though the one were by birth or manners the vilest of humanity as the others are in many cases extracted from the basest materials men may use the assistance of pagans and infidels he continued in their need and there is reason to think that one cause of their being permitted to remain on earth is that they might minister to the convenience of true christians thus we lawfully make slaves of heathen captives again proceeded the prelate there is no doubt that the primitive christians used the services of the unconverted heathen thus in the ship of alexandria in which the blessed apostle paul sailed to italy the sailors were doubtless pagans yet what said the holy saint when their ministry was needfulnisi hi in navi manserint vos salvi fieri non potestisunless these men abide in the ship ye cannot be saved again jews are infidels to christianity as well as mohammedans but there are few physicians in the camp excepting jews and such are employed without scandal or scruple therefore mohammedans may be used for their service in that capacityquod erat demonstrandum  this reasoning entirely removed the scruples of thomas de vaux who was particularly moved by the latin quotation as he did not understand a word of it  but the bishop proceeded with far less fluency when he considered the possibility of the saracens acting with bad faith and here he came not to a speedy decision the baron showed him the letters of credence he read and reread them and compared the original with the translation  it is a dish choicely cooked he said to the palate of king richard and i cannot but have my suspicions of the wily saracen they are curious in the art of poisons and can so temper them that they shall be weeks in acting upon the party during which time the perpetrator has leisure to escape they can impregnate cloth and leather nay even paper and parchment with the most subtle venom our lady forgive me and wherefore knowing this hold i these letters of credence so close to my face take them sir thomastake them speedily  here he gave them at armslength and with some appearance of haste to the baron but come my lord de vaux he continued wend we to the tent of this sick squire where we shall learn whether this hakim hath really the art of curing which he professeth ere we consider whether there be safety in permitting him to exercise his art upon king richardyet hold let me first take my pouncetbox for these fevers spread like an infection i would advise you to use dried rosemary steeped in vinegar my lord i too know something of the healing art  i thank your reverend lordship replied thomas of gilsland but had i been accessible to the fever i had caught it long since by the bed of my master  the bishop of tyre blushed for he had rather avoided the presence of the sick monarch and he bid the baron lead on  as they paused before the wretched hut in which kenneth of the leopard and his follower abode the bishop said to de vaux now of a surety my lord these scottish knights have worse care of their followers than we of our dogs here is a knight valiant they say in battle and thought fitting to be graced with charges of weight in time of truce whose esquire of the body is lodged worse than in the worst dogkennel in england what say you of your neighbours  that a master doth well enough for his servant when he lodgeth him in no worse dwelling than his own said de vaux and entered the hut  the bishop followed not without evident reluctance for though he lacked not courage in some respects yet it was tempered with a strong and lively regard for his own safety he recollected however the necessity there was for judging personally of the skill of the arabian physician and entered the hut with a stateliness of manner calculated as he thought to impose respect on the stranger  the prelate was indeed a striking and commanding figure in his youth he had been eminently handsome and even in age was unwilling to appear less so his episcopal dress was of the richest fashion trimmed with costly fur and surrounded by a cope of curious needlework the rings on his fingers were worth a goodly barony and the hood which he wore though now unclasped and thrown back for heat had studs of pure gold to fasten it around his throat and under his chin when he so inclined his long beard now silvered with age descended over his breast one of two youthful acolytes who attended him created an artificial shade peculiar then to the east by bearing over his head an umbrella of palmetto leaves while the other refreshed his reverend master by agitating a fan of peacockfeathers  when the bishop of tyre entered the hut of the scottish knight the master was absent and the moorish physician whom he had come to see sat in the very posture in which de vaux had left him several hours before crosslegged upon a mat made of twisted leaves by the side of the patient who appeared in deep slumber and whose pulse he felt from time to time the bishop remained standing before him in silence for two or three minutes as if expecting some honourable salutation or at least that the saracen would seem struck with the dignity of his appearance but adonbec el hakim took no notice of him beyond a passing glance and when the prelate at length saluted him in the lingua franca current in the country he only replied by the ordinary oriental greeting salam alicumpeace be with you  art thou a physician infidel said the bishop somewhat mortified at this cold reception i would speak with thee on that art  if thou knewest aught of medicine answered el hakim thou wouldst be aware that physicians hold no counsel or debate in the sick chamber of their patient hear he added as the low growling of the staghound was heard from the inner hut even the dog might teach thee reason ulemat his instinct teaches him to suppress his barking in the sick mans hearing come without the tent said he rising and leading the way if thou hast ought to say with me  notwithstanding the plainness of the saracen leechs dress and his inferiority of size when contrasted with the tall prelate and gigantic english baron there was something striking in his manner and countenance which prevented the bishop of tyre from expressing strongly the displeasure he felt at this unceremonious rebuke when without the hut he gazed upon adonbec in silence for several minutes before he could fix on the best manner to renew the conversation no locks were seen under the high bonnet of the arabian which hid also part of a brow that seemed lofty and expanded smooth and free from wrinkles as were his cheeks where they were seen under the shade of his long beard we have elsewhere noticed the piercing quality of his dark eyes  the prelate struck with his apparent youth at length broke a pause which the other seemed in no haste to interrupt by demanding of the arabian how old he was  the years of ordinary men said the saracen are counted by their wrinkles those of sages by their studies i dare not call myself older than a hundred revolutions of the hegira meaning that his attainments were those which might have been made in a hundred years  the baron of gilsland who took this for a literal assertion that he was a century old looked doubtfully upon the prelate who though he better understood the meaning of el hakim answered his glance by mysteriously shaking his head he resumed an air of importance when he again authoritatively demanded what evidence adonbec could produce of his medical proficiency  ye have the word of the mighty saladin said the sage touching his cap in sign of reverencea word which was never broken towards friend or foe what nazarene wouldst thou demand more  i would have ocular proof of thy skill said the baron and without it thou approachest not to the couch of king richard  the praise of the physician said the arabian is in the recovery of his patient behold this sergeant whose blood has been dried up by the fever which has whitened your camp with skeletons and against which the art of your nazarene leeches hath been like a silken doublet against a lance of steel look at his fingers and arms wasted like the claws and shanks of the crane death had this morning his clutch on him but had azrael been on one side of the couch i being on the other his soul should not have been left from his body disturb me not with further questions but await the critical minute and behold in silent wonder the marvellous event  the physician had then recourse to his astrolabe the oracle of eastern science and watching with grave precision until the precise time of the evening prayer had arrived he sunk on his knees with his face turned to mecca and recited the petitions which close the moslemahs day of toil the bishop and the english baron looked on each other meanwhile with symptoms of contempt and indignation but neither judged it fit to interrupt el hakim in his devotions unholy as they considered them to be  the arab arose from the earth on which he had prostrated himself and walking into the hut where the patient lay extended he drew a sponge from a small silver box dipped perhaps in some aromatic distillation for when he put it to the sleepers nose he sneezed awoke and looked wildly around he was a ghastly spectacle as he sat up almost naked on his couch the bones and cartilages as visible through the surface of his skin as if they had never been clothed with flesh his face was long and furrowed with wrinkles but his eye though it wandered at first became gradually more settled he seemed to be aware of the presence of his dignified visitors for he attempted feebly to pull the covering from his head in token of reverence as he inquired in a subdued and submissive voice for his master  do you know us vassal said the lord of gilsland  not perfectly my lord replied the squire faintly my sleep has been long and full of dreams yet i know that you are a great english lord as seemeth by the red cross and this a holy prelate whose blessing i crave on me a poor sinner  thou hast itbenedictio domini sit vobiscum said the prelate making the sign of the cross but without approaching nearer to the patients bed  your eyes witness said the arabian the fever hath been subdued he speaks with calmness and recollectionhis pulse beats composedly as yourstry its pulsations yourself  the prelate declined the experiment but thomas of gilsland more determined on making the trial did so and satisfied himself that the fever was indeed gone  this is most wonderful said the knight looking to the bishop the man is assuredly cured i must conduct this mediciner presently to king richards tent what thinks your reverence  stay let me finish one cure ere i commence another said the arab i will pass with you when i have given my patient the second cup of this most holy elixir  so saying he pulled out a silver cup and filling it with water from a gourd which stood by the bedside he next drew forth a small silken bag made of network twisted with silver the contents of which the bystanders could not discover and immersing it in the cup continued to watch it in silence during the space of five minutes it seemed to the spectators as if some effervescence took place during the operation but if so it instantly subsided  drink said the physician to the sick mansleep and awaken free from malady  and with this simpleseeming draught thou wilt undertake to cure a monarch said the bishop of tyre  i have cured a beggar as you may behold replied the sage are the kings of frangistan made of other clay than the meanest of their subjects  let us have him presently to the king said the baron of gilsland he hath shown that he possesses the secret which may restore his health if he fails to exercise it i will put himself past the power of medicine  as they were about to leave the hut the sick man raising his voice as much as his weakness permitted exclaimed reverend father noble knight and you kind leech if you would have me sleep and recover tell me in charity what is become of my dear master  he is upon a distant expedition friend replied the prelateon an honourable embassy which may detain him for some days  nay said the baron of gilsland why deceive the poor fellowfriend thy master has returned to the camp and you will presently see him  the invalid held up as if in thankfulness his wasted hands to heaven and resisting no longer the soporiferous operation of the elixir sunk down in a gentle sleep  you are a better physician than i sir thomas said the prelatea soothing falsehood is fitter for a sickroom than an unpleasing truth  how mean you my reverend lord said de vaux hastily think you i would tell a falsehood to save the lives of a dozen such as he  you said replied the bishop with manifest symptoms of alarmyou said the esquires master was returnedhe i mean of the couchant leopard  and he is returned said de vaux i spoke with him but a few hours since this learned leech came in his company  holy virgin why told you not of his return to me said the bishop in evident perturbation  did i not say that this same knight of the leopard had returned in company with the physician i thought i had replied de vaux carelessly but what signified his return to the skill of the physician or the cure of his majesty  much sir thomasit signified much said the bishop clenching his hands pressing his foot against the earth and giving signs of impatience as if in an involuntary manner but where can he be gone now this same knight god be with ushere may be some fatal errors  yonder serf in the outer space said de vaux not without wonder at the bishops emotion can probably tell us whither his master has gone  the lad was summoned and in a language nearly incomprehensible to them gave them at length to understand that an officer had summoned his master to the royal tent some time before their arrival at that of his master the anxiety of the bishop appeared to rise to the highest and became evident to de vaux though neither an acute observer nor of a suspicious temper but with his anxiety seemed to increase his wish to keep it subdued and unobserved he took a hasty leave of de vaux who looked after him with astonishment and after shrugging his shoulders in silent wonder proceeded to conduct the arabian physician to the tent of king richard    chapter ix       this is the prince of leeches fever plague      cold rheum and hot podagra do but look on him      and quit their grasp upon the tortured sinews         anonymous  the baron of gilsland walked with slow step and an anxious countenance towards the royal pavilion he had much diffidence of his own capacity except in a field of battle and conscious of no very acute intellect was usually contented to wonder at circumstances which a man of livelier imagination would have endeavoured to investigate and understand or at least would have made the subject of speculation but it seemed very extraordinary even to him that the attention of the bishop should have been at once abstracted from all reflection on the marvellous cure which they had witnessed and upon the probability it afforded of richard being restored to health by what seemed a very trivial piece of information announcing the motions of a beggardly scottish knight than whom thomas of gilsland knew nothing within the circle of gentle blood more unimportant or contemptible and despite his usual habit of passively beholding passing events the barons spirit toiled with unwonted attempts to form conjectures on the cause  at length the idea occurred at once to him that the whole might be a conspiracy against king richard formed within the camp of the allies and to which the bishop who was by some represented as a politic and unscrupulous person was not unlikely to have been accessory it was true that in his own opinion there existed no character so perfect as that of his master for richard being the flower of chivalry and the chief of christian leaders and obeying in all points the commands of holy church de vauxs ideas of perfection went no further still he knew that however unworthily it had been always his masters fate to draw as much reproach and dislike as honour and attachment from the display of his great qualities and that in the very camp and amongst those princes bound by oath to the crusade were many who would have sacrificed all hope of victory over the saracens to the pleasure of ruining or at least of humbling richard of england  wherefore said the baron to himself it is in no sense impossible that this el hakim with this his cure or seeming cure wrought on the body of the scottish squire may mean nothing but a trick to which he of the leopard may be accessory and wherein the bishop of tyre prelate as he is may have some share  this hypothesis indeed could not be so easily reconciled with the alarm manifested by the bishop on learning that contrary to his expectation the scottish knight had suddenly returned to the crusaders camp but de vaux was influenced only by his general prejudices which dictated to him the assured belief that a wily italian priest a falsehearted scot and an infidel physician formed a set of ingredients from which all evil and no good was likely to be extracted he resolved however to lay his scruples bluntly before the king of whose judgment he had nearly as high an opinion as of his valour  meantime events had taken place very contrary to the suppositions which thomas de vaux had entertained scarce had he left the royal pavilion when betwixt the impatience of the fever and that which was natural to his disposition richard began to murmur at his delay and express an earnest desire for his return he had seen enough to try to reason himself out of this irritation which greatly increased his bodily malady he wearied his attendants by demanding from them amusements and the breviary of the priest the romance of the clerk even the harp of his favourite minstrel were had recourse to in vain at length some two hours before sundown and long therefore ere he could expect a satisfactory account of the process of the cure which the moor or arabian had undertaken he sent as we have already heard a messenger commanding the attendance of the knight of the leopard determined to soothe his impatience by obtaining from sir kenneth a more particular account of the cause of his absence from the camp and the circumstances of his meeting with this celebrated physician  the scottish knight thus summoned entered the royal presence as one who was no stranger to such scenes he was scarcely known to the king of england even by sight although tenacious of his rank as devout in the adoration of the lady of his secret heart he had never been absent on those occasions when the munificence and hospitality of england opened the court of its monarch to all who held a certain rank in chivalry the king gazed fixedly on sir kenneth approaching his bedside while the knight bent his knee for a moment then arose and stood before him in a posture of deference but not of subservience or humility as became an officer in the presence of his sovereign  thy name said the king is kenneth of the leopardfrom whom hadst thou degree of knighthood  i took it from the sword of william the lion king of scotland replied the scot  a weapon said the king well worthy to confer honour nor has it been laid on an undeserving shoulder we have seen thee bear thyself knightly and valiantly in press of battle when most need there was and thou hadst not been yet to learn that thy deserts were known to us but that thy presumption in other points has been such that thy services can challenge no better reward than that of pardon for thy transgression what sayest thouha  kenneth attempted to speak but was unable to express himself distinctly the consciousness of his too ambitious love and the keen falcon glance with which coeur de lion seemed to penetrate his inmost soul combining to disconcert him  and yet said the king although soldiers should obey command and vassals be respectful towards their superiors we might forgive a brave knight greater offence than the keeping a simple hound though it were contrary to our express public ordinance  richard kept his eye fixed on the scots face beheld and beholding smiling inwardly at the relief produced by the turn he had given to his general accusation  so please you my lord said the scot your majesty must be good to us poor gentlemen of scotland in this matter we are far from home scant of revenues and cannot support ourselves as your wealthy nobles who have credit of the lombards the saracens shall feel our blows the harder that we eat a piece of dried venison from time to time with our herbs and barleycakes  it skills not asking my leave said richard since thomas de vaux who doth like all around me that which is fittest in his own eyes hath already given thee permission for hunting and hawking  for hunting only and please you said the scot but if it please your majesty to indulge me with the privilege of hawking also and you list to trust me with a falcon on fist i trust i could supply your royal mess with some choice waterfowl  i dread me if thou hadst but the falcon said the king thou wouldst scarce wait for the permission i wot well it is said abroad that we of the line of anjou resent offence against our forestlaws as highly as we would do treason against our crown to brave and worthy men however we could pardon either misdemeanourbut enough of this i desire to know of you sir knight wherefore and by whose authority you took this recent journey to the wilderness of the dead sea and engaddi  by order replied the knight of the council of princes of the holy crusade  and how dared any one to give such an order when inot the least surely in the leaguewas unacquainted with it  it was not my part please your highness said the scot to inquire into such particulars i am a soldier of the crossserving doubtless for the present under your highnesss banner and proud of the permission to do so but still one who hath taken on him the holy symbol for the rights of christianity and the recovery of the holy sepulchre and bound therefore to obey without question the orders of the princes and chiefs by whom the blessed enterprise is directed that indisposition should seclude i trust for but a short time your highness from their councils in which you hold so potential a voice i must lament with all christendom but as a soldier i must obey those on whom the lawful right of command devolves or set but an evil example in the christian camp  thou sayest well said king richard and the blame rests not with thee but with those with whom when it shall please heaven to raise me from this accursed bed of pain and inactivity i hope to reckon roundly what was the purport of thy message  methinks and please your highness replied sir kenneth that were best asked of those who sent me and who can render the reasons of mine errand whereas i can only tell its outward form and purport  palter not with me sir scotit were ill for thy safety said the irritable monarch  my safety my lord replied the knight firmly i cast behind me as a regardless thing when i vowed myself to this enterprise looking rather to my immortal welfare than to that which concerns my earthly body  by the mass said king richard thou art a brave fellow hark thee sir knight i love the scottish people they are hardy though dogged and stubborn and i think true men in the main though the necessity of state has sometimes constrained them to be dissemblers i deserve some love at their hand for i have voluntarily done what they could not by arms have extorted from me any more than from my predecessors i have reestablished the fortresses of roxburgh and berwick which lay in pledge to england i have restored your ancient boundaries and finally i have renounced a claim to homage upon the crown of england which i thought unjustly forced on you i have endeavoured to make honourable and independent friends where former kings of england attempted only to compel unwilling and rebellious vassals  all this you have done my lord king said sir kenneth bowingall this you have done by your royal treaty with our sovereign at canterbury therefore have you me and many better scottish men making war against the infidels under your banners who would else have been ravaging your frontiers in england if their numbers are now few it is because their lives have been freely waged and wasted  i grant it true said the king and for the good offices i have done your land i require you to remember that as a principal member of the christian league i have a right to know the negotiations of my confederates do me therefore the justice to tell me what i have a title to be acquainted with and which i am certain to know more truly from you than from others  my lord said the scot thus conjured i will speak the truth for i well believe that your purposes towards the principal object of our expedition are singlehearted and honest and it is more than i dare warrant for others of the holy league be pleased therefore to know my charge was to propose through the medium of the hermit of engaddia holy man respected and protected by saladin himself  a continuation of the truce i doubt not said richard hastily interrupting him  no by saint andrew my liege said the scottish knight but the establishment of a lasting peace and the withdrawing our armies from palestine  saint george said richard in astonishment ill as i have justly thought of them i could not have dreamed they would have humbled themselves to such dishonour speak sir kenneth with what will did you carry such a message  with right good will my lord said kenneth because when we had lost our noble leader under whose guidance alone i hoped for victory i saw none who could succeed him likely to lead us to conquest and i accounted it well in such circumstances to avoid defeat  and on what conditions was this hopeful peace to be contracted said king richard painfully suppressing the passion with which his heart was almost bursting  these were not entrusted to me my lord answered the knight of the couchant leopard i delivered them sealed to the hermit  and for what hold you this reverend hermitfor fool madman traitor or saint said richard  his folly sire replied the shrewd scottish man i hold to be assumed to win favour and reverence from the paynimrie who regard madmen as the inspired of heavenat least it seemed to me as exhibited only occasionally and not as mixing like natural folly with the general tenor of his mind  shrewdly replied said the monarch throwing himself back on his couch from which he had halfraised himself now of his penitence  his penitence continued kenneth appears to me sincere and the fruits of remorse for some dreadful crime for which he seems in his own opinion condemned to reprobation  and for his policy said king richard  methinks my lord said the scottish knight he despairs of the security of palestine as of his own salvation by any means short of a miracleat least since the arm of richard of england hath ceased to strike for it  and therefore the coward policy of this hermit is like that of these miserable princes who forgetful of their knighthood and their faith are only resolved and determined when the question is retreat and rather than go forward against an armed saracen would trample in their flight over a dying ally  might i so far presume my lord king said the scottish knight this discourse but heats your disease the enemy from which christendom dreads more evil than from armed hosts of infidels  the countenance of king richard was indeed more flushed and his action became more feverishly vehement as with clenched hand extended arm and flashing eyes he seemed at once to suffer under bodily pain and at the same time under vexation of mind while his high spirit led him to speak on as if in contempt of both  you can flatter sir knight he said but you escape me not i must know more from you than you have yet told me saw you my royal consort when at engaddi  to my knowledgeno my lord replied sir kenneth with considerable perturbation for he remembered the midnight procession in the chapel of the rocks  i ask you said the king in a sterner voice whether you were not in the chapel of the carmelite nuns at engaddi and there saw berengaria queen of england and the ladies of her court who went thither on pilgrimage  my lord said sir kenneth i will speak the truth as in the confessional in a subterranean chapel to which the anchorite conducted me i beheld a choir of ladies do homage to a relic of the highest sanctity but as i saw not their faces nor heard their voices unless in the hymns which they chanted i cannot tell whether the queen of england was of the bevy  and was there no one of these ladies known to you  sir kenneth stood silent  i ask you said richard raising himself on his elbow as a knight and a gentlemanand i shall know by your answer how you value either characterdid you or did you not know any lady amongst that band of worshippers  my lord said kenneth not without much hesitation i might guess  and i also may guess said the king frowning sternly but it is enough leopard as you are sir knight beware tempting the lions paw hark yeto become enamoured of the moon would be but an act of folly but to leap from the battlements of a lofty tower in the wild hope of coming within her sphere were selfdestructive madness  at this moment some bustling was heard in the outer apartment and the king hastily changing to his more natural manner said enoughbegonespeed to de vaux and send him hither with the arabian physician my life for the faith of the soldan would he but abjure his false law i would aid him with my sword to drive this scum of french and austrians from his dominions and think palestine as well ruled by him as when her kings were anointed by the decree of heaven itself  the knight of the leopard retired and presently afterwards the chamberlain announced a deputation from the council who had come to wait on the majesty of england  it is well they allow that i am living yet was his reply who are the reverend ambassadors  the grand master of the templars and the marquis of montserrat  our brother of france loves not sickbeds said richard yet had philip been ill i had stood by his couch long sincejocelyn lay me the couch more fairlyit is tumbled like a stormy sea reach me yonder steel mirrorpass a comb through my hair and beard they look indeed liker a lions mane than a christian mans locks bring water  my lord said the trembling chamberlain the leeches say that cold water may be fatal  to the foul fiend with the leeches replied the monarch if they cannot cure me think you i will allow them to torment methere then he said after having made his ablutions admit the worshipful envoys they will now i think scarcely see that disease has made richard negligent of his person  the celebrated master of the templars was a tall thin warworn man with a slow yet penetrating eye and a brow on which a thousand dark intrigues had stamped a portion of their obscurity at the head of that singular body to whom their order was everything and their individuality nothingseeking the advancement of its power even at the hazard of that very religion which the fraternity were originally associated to protectaccused of heresy and witchcraft although by their character christian priestssuspected of secret league with the soldan though by oath devoted to the protection of the holy temple or its recoverythe whole order and the whole personal character of its commander or grand master was a riddle at the exposition of which most men shuddered the grand master was dressed in his white robes of solemnity and he bore the abacus a mystic staff of office the peculiar form of which has given rise to such singular conjectures and commentaries leading to suspicions that this celebrated fraternity of christian knights were embodied under the foulest symbols of paganism  conrade of montserrat had a much more pleasing exterior than the dark and mysterious priestsoldier by whom he was accompanied he was a handsome man of middle age or something past that term bold in the field sagacious in council gay and gallant in times of festivity but on the other hand he was generally accused of versatility of a narrow and selfish ambition of a desire to extend his own principality without regard to the weal of the latin kingdom of palestine and of seeking his own interest by private negotiations with saladin to the prejudice of the christian leaguers  when the usual salutations had been made by these dignitaries and courteously returned by king richard the marquis of montserrat commenced an explanation of the motives of their visit sent as he said they were by the anxious kings and princes who composed the council of the crusaders to inquire into the health of their magnanimous ally the valiant king of england  we know the importance in which the princes of the council hold our health replied the english king and are well aware how much they must have suffered by suppressing all curiosity concerning it for fourteen days for fear doubtless of aggravating our disorder by showing their anxiety regarding the event  the flow of the marquiss eloquence being checked and he himself thrown into some confusion by this reply his more austere companion took up the thread of the conversation and with as much dry and brief gravity as was consistent with the presence which he addressed informed the king that they came from the council to pray in the name of christendom that he would not suffer his health to be tampered with by an infidel physician said to be dispatched by saladin until the council had taken measures to remove or confirm the suspicion which they at present conceived did attach itself to the mission of such a person  grand master of the holy and valiant order of knights templars and you most noble marquis of montserrat replied richard if it please you to retire into the adjoining pavilion you shall presently see what account we make of the tender remonstrances of our royal and princely colleagues in this religious warfare  the marquis and grand master retired accordingly nor had they been many minutes in the outward pavilion when the eastern physician arrived accompanied by the baron of gilsland and kenneth of scotland the baron however was a little later of entering the tent than the other two stopping perchance to issue some orders to the warders without  as the arabian physician entered he made his obeisance after the oriental fashion to the marquis and grand master whose dignity was apparent both from their appearance and their bearing the grand master returned the salutation with an expression of disdainful coldness the marquis with the popular courtesy which he habitually practised to men of every rank and nation there was a pause for the scottish knight waiting for the arrival of de vaux presumed not of his own authority to enter the tent of the king of england and during this interval the grand master sternly demanded of the moslem infidel hast thou the courage to practise thine art upon the person of an anointed sovereign of the christian host  the sun of allah answered the sage shines on the nazarene as well as on the true believer and his servant dare make no distinction betwixt them when called on to exercise the art of healing  misbelieving hakim said the grand master or whatsoever they call thee for an unbaptized slave of darkness dost thou well know that thou shalt be torn asunder by wild horses should king richard die under thy charge  that were hard justice answered the physician seeing that i can but use human means and that the issue is written in the book of light  nay reverend and valiant grand master said the marquis of montserrat consider that this learned man is not acquainted with our christian order adopted in the fear of god and for the safety of his anointedbe it known to thee grave physician whose skill we doubt not that your wisest course is to repair to the presence of the illustrious council of our holy league and there to give account and reckoning to such wise and learned leeches as they shall nominate concerning your means of process and cure of this illustrious patient so shall you escape all the danger which rashly taking such a high matter upon your sole answer you may else most likely incur  my lords said el hakim i understand you well but knowledge hath its champions as well as your military artnay hath sometimes had its martyrs as well as religion i have the command of my sovereign the soldan saladin to heal this nazarene king and with the blessing of the prophet i will obey his commands if i fail ye wear swords thirsting for the blood of the faithful and i proffer my body to your weapons but i will not reason with one uncircumcised upon the virtue of the medicines of which i have obtained knowledge through the grace of the prophet and i pray you interpose no delay between me and my office  who talks of delay said the baron de vaux hastily entering the tent we have had but too much already i salute you my lord of montserrat and you valiant grand master but i must presently pass with this learned physician to the bedside of my master  my lord said the marquis in normanfrench or the language of ouie as it was then called are you well advised that we came to expostulate on the part of the council of the monarchs and princes of the crusade against the risk of permitting an infidel and eastern physician to tamper with a health so valuable as that of your master king richard  noble lord marquis replied the englishman bluntly i can neither use many words nor do i delight in listening to them moreover i am much more ready to believe what my eyes have seen than what my ears have heard i am satisfied that this heathen can cure the sickness of king richard and i believe and trust he will labour to do so time is precious if mohammedmay gods curse be on him stood at the door of the tent with such fair purpose as this adonbec el hakim entertains i would hold it sin to delay him for a minute so give ye goden my lords  nay but said conrade of montserrat the king himself said we should be present when this same physician dealt upon him  the baron whispered the chamberlain probably to know whether the marquis spoke truly and then replied my lords if you will hold your patience you are welcome to enter with us but if you interrupt by action or threat this accomplished physician in his duty be it known that without respect to your high quality i will enforce your absence from richards tent for know i am so well satisfied of the virtue of this mans medicines that were richard himself to refuse them by our lady of lanercost i think i could find in my heart to force him to take the means of his cure whether he would or nomove onward el hakim  the last word was spoken in the lingua franca and instantly obeyed by the physician the grand master looked grimly on the unceremonious old soldier but on exchanging a glance with the marquis smoothed his frowning brow as well as he could and both followed de vaux and the arabian into the inner tent where richard lay expecting them with that impatience with which the sick man watches the step of his physician sir kenneth whose attendance seemed neither asked nor prohibited felt himself by the circumstances in which he stood entitled to follow these high dignitaries but conscious of his inferior power and rank remained aloof during the scene which took place  richard when they entered his apartment immediately exclaimed so ho a goodly fellowship come to see richard take his leap in the dark my noble allies i greet you as the representatives of our assembled league richard will again be amongst you in his former fashion or ye shall bear to the grave what is left of himde vaux lives he or dies he thou hast the thanks of thy prince there is yet anotherbut this fever hath wasted my eyesight what the bold scot who would climb heaven without a ladder he is welcome toocome sir hakim to the work to the work  the physician who had already informed himself of the various symptoms of the kings illness now felt his pulse for a long time and with deep attention while all around stood silent and in breathless expectation the sage next filled a cup with spring water and dipped into it the small red purse which as formerly he took from his bosom when he seemed to think it sufficiently medicated he was about to offer it to the sovereign who prevented him by saying hold an instant thou hast felt my pulselet me lay my finger on thine i too as becomes a good knight know something of thine art  the arabian yielded his hand without hesitation and his long slender dark fingers were for an instant enclosed and almost buried in the large enfoldment of king richards hand  his blood beats calm as an infants said the king so throbs not theirs who poison princes de vaux whether we live or die dismiss this hakim with honour and safetycommend us friend to the noble saladin should i die it is without doubt of his faith should i live it will be to thank him as a warrior would desire to be thanked  he then raised himself in bed took the cup in his hand and turning to the marquis and the grand mastermark what i say and let my royal brethren pledge me in cyprus wine to the immortal honour of the first crusader who shall strike lance or sword on the gate of jerusalem and to the shame and eternal infamy of whomsoever shall turn back from the plough on which he hath laid his hand  he drained the cup to the bottom resigned it to the arabian and sunk back as if exhausted upon the cushions which were arranged to receive him the physician then with silent but expressive signs directed that all should leave the tent excepting himself and de vaux whom no remonstrance could induce to withdraw the apartment was cleared accordingly    chapter x       and now i will unclasp a secret book      and to your quickconceiving discontent      ill read you matter deep and dangerous        henry iv part i  the marquis of montserrat and the grand master of the knights templars stood together in the front of the royal pavilion within which this singular scene had passed and beheld a strong guard of bills and bows drawn out to form a circle around it and keep at distance all which might disturb the sleeping monarch the soldiers wore the downcast silent and sullen looks with which they trail their arms at a funeral and stepped with such caution that you could not hear a buckler ring or a sword clatter though so many men in armour were moving around the tent they lowered their weapons in deep reverence as the dignitaries passed through their files but with the same profound silence  there is a change of cheer among these island dogs said the grand master to conrade when they had passed richards guards what hoarse tumult and revel used to be before this pavilionnought but pitching the bar hurling the ball wrestling roaring of songs clattering of wine pots and quaffing of flagons among these burly yeomen as if they were holding some country wake with a maypole in the midst of them instead of a royal standard  mastiffs are a faithful race said conrade and the king their master has won their love by being ready to wrestle brawl or revel amongst the foremost of them whenever the humour seized him  he is totally compounded of humours said the grand master marked you the pledge he gave us instead of a prayer over his gracecup yonder  he would have felt it a gracecup and a wellspiced one too said the marquis were saladin like any other turk that ever wore turban or turned him to mecca at call of the muezzin but he affects faith and honour and generosity as if it were for an unbaptized dog like him to practise the virtuous bearing of a christian knight it is said he hath applied to richard to be admitted within the pale of chivalry  by saint bernard exclaimed the grand master it were time then to throw off our belts and spurs sir conrade deface our armorial bearings and renounce our burgonets if the highest honour of christianity were conferred on an unchristened turk of tenpence  you rate the soldan cheap replied the marquis yet though he be a likely man i have seen a better heathen sold for forty pence at the bagnio  they were now near their horses which stood at some distance from the royal tent prancing among the gallant train of esquires and pages by whom they were attended when conrade after a moments pause proposed that they should enjoy the coolness of the evening breeze which had arisen and dismissing their steeds and attendants walk homewards to their own quarters through the lines of the extended christian camp the grand master assented and they proceeded to walk together accordingly avoiding as if by mutual consent the more inhabited parts of the canvas city and tracing the broad esplanade which lay between the tents and the external defences where they could converse in private and unmarked save by the sentinels as they passed them  they spoke for a time upon the military points and preparations for defence but this sort of discourse in which neither seemed to take interest at length died away and there was a long pause which terminated by the marquis of montserrat stopping short like a man who has formed a sudden resolution and gazing for some moments on the dark inflexible countenance of the grand master he at length addressed him thus might it consist with your valour and sanctity reverend sir giles amaury i would pray you for once to lay aside the dark visor which you wear and to converse with a friend barefaced  the templar half smiled  there are lightcoloured masks he said as well as dark visors and the one conceals the natural features as completely as the other  be it so said the marquis putting his hand to his chin and withdrawing it with the action of one who unmasks himself there lies my disguise and now what think you as touching the interests of your own order of the prospects of this crusade  this is tearing the veil from my thoughts rather than exposing your own said the grand master yet i will reply with a parable told to me by a santon of the desert a certain farmer prayed to heaven for rain and murmured when it fell not at his need to punish his impatience allah said the santon sent the euphrates upon his farm and he was destroyed with all his possessions even by the granting of his own wishes  most truly spoken said the marquis conrade would that the ocean had swallowed up nineteen parts of the armaments of these western princes what remained would better have served the purpose of the christian nobles of palestine the wretched remnant of the latin kingdom of jerusalem left to ourselves we might have bent to the storm or moderately supported with money and troops we might have compelled saladin to respect our valour and grant us peace and protection on easy terms but from the extremity of danger with which this powerful crusade threatens the soldan we cannot suppose should it pass over that the saracen will suffer any one of us to hold possessions or principalities in syria far less permit the existence of the christian military fraternities from whom they have experienced so much mischief  ay but said the templar these adventurous crusaders may succeed and again plant the cross on the bulwarks of zion  and what will that advantage either the order of the templars or conrade of montserrat said the marquis  you it may advantage replied the grand master conrade of montserrat might become conrade king of jerusalem  that sounds like something said the marquis and yet it rings but hollow godfrey of bouillon might well choose the crown of thorns for his emblem grand master i will confess to you i have caught some attachment to the eastern form of governmenta pure and simple monarchy should consist but of king and subjects such is the simple and primitive structurea shepherd and his flock all this internal chain of feudal dependance is artificial and sophisticated and i would rather hold the baton of my poor marquisate with a firm gripe and wield it after my pleasure than the sceptre of a monarch to be in effect restrained and curbed by the will of as many proud feudal barons as hold land under the assizes of jerusalem the assises de jerusalem were the digest of feudal law composed by godfrey of boulogne for the government of the latin kingdom of palestine when reconquered from the saracens it was composed with advice of the patriarch and barons the clergy and laity and is says the historian gibbon a precious monument of feudatory jurisprudence founded upon those principles of freedom which were essential to the system a king should tread freely grand master and should not be controlled by here a ditch and there a fencehere a feudal privilege and there a mailclad baron with his sword in his hand to maintain it to sum the whole i am aware that guy de lusignans claims to the throne would be preferred to mine if richard recovers and has aught to say in the choice  enough said the grand master thou hast indeed convinced me of thy sincerity others may hold the same opinions but few save conrade of montserrat dared frankly avow that he desires not the restitution of the kingdom of jerusalem but rather prefers being master of a portion of its fragmentslike the barbarous islanders who labour not for the deliverance of a goodly vessel from the billows expecting rather to enrich themselves at the expense of the wreck  thou wilt not betray my counsel said conrade looking sharply and suspiciously know for certain that my tongue shall never wrong my head nor my hand forsake the defence of either impeach me if thou wilti am prepared to defend myself in the lists against the best templar who ever laid lance in rest  yet thou startst somewhat suddenly for so bold a steed said the grand master however i swear to thee by the holy temple which our order is sworn to defend that i will keep counsel with thee as a true comrade  by which temple said the marquis of montserrat whose love of sarcasm often outran his policy and discretion swearest thou by that on the hill of zion which was built by king solomon or by that symbolical emblematical edifice which is said to be spoken of in the councils held in the vaults of your preceptories as something which infers the aggrandizement of thy valiant and venerable order  the templar scowled upon him with an eye of death but answered calmly by whatever temple i swear be assured lord marquis my oath is sacred i would i knew how to bind thee by one of equal obligation  i will swear truth to thee said the marquis laughing by the earls coronet which i hope to convert ere these wars are over into something better it feels cold on my brow that same slight coronal a dukes cap of maintenance were a better protection against such a nightbreeze as now blows and a kings crown more preferable still being lined with comfortable ermine and velvet in a word our interests bind us together for think not lord grand master that were these allied princes to regain jerusalem and place a king of their own choosing there they would suffer your order any more than my poor marquisate to retain the independence which we now hold no by our lady in such case the proud knights of saint john must again spread plasters and dress plague sores in the hospitals and you most puissant and venerable knights of the temple must return to your condition of simple menatarms sleep three on a pallet and mount two upon one horse as your present seal still expresses to have been your ancient most simple custom  the rank privileges and opulence of our order prevent so much degradation as you threaten said the templar haughtily  these are your bane said conrade of montserrat and you as well as i reverend grand master know that were the allied princes to be successful in palestine it would be their first point of policy to abate the independence of your order which but for the protection of our holy father the pope and the necessity of employing your valour in the conquest of palestine you would long since have experienced give them complete success and you will be flung aside as the splinters of a broken lance are tossed out of the tiltyard  there may be truth in what you say said the templar darkly smiling but what were our hopes should the allies withdraw their forces and leave palestine in the grasp of saladin  great and assured replied conrade the soldan would give large provinces to maintain at his behest a body of wellappointed frankish lances in egypt in persia a hundred such auxiliaries joined to his own light cavalry would turn the battle against the most fearful odds this dependence would be but for a timeperhaps during the life of this enterprising soldan but in the east empires arise like mushrooms suppose him dead and us strengthened with a constant succession of fiery and adventurous spirits from europe what might we not hope to achieve uncontrolled by these monarchs whose dignity throws us at present into the shadeand were they to remain here and succeed in this expedition would willingly consign us for ever to degradation and dependence  you say well my lord marquis said the grand master and your words find an echo in my bosom yet must we be cautiousphilip of france is wise as well as valiant  true and will be therefore the more easily diverted from an expedition to which in a moment of enthusiasm or urged by his nobles he rashly bound himself he is jealous of king richard his natural enemy and longs to return to prosecute plans of ambition nearer to paris than palestine any fair pretence will serve him for withdrawing from a scene in which he is aware he is wasting the force of his kingdom  and the duke of austria said the templar  oh touching the duke returned conrade his selfconceit and folly lead him to the same conclusions as do philips policy and wisdom he conceives himself god help the while ungratefully treated because mens mouthseven those of his own minnesingers the german minstrels were so termedare filled with the praises of king richard whom he fears and hates and in whose harm he would rejoice like those unbred dastardly curs who if the foremost of the pack is hurt by the gripe of the wolf are much more likely to assail the sufferer from behind than to come to his assistance but wherefore tell i this to thee save to show that i am in sincerity in desiring that this league be broken up and the country freed of these great monarchs with their hosts and thou well knowest and hast thyself seen how all the princes of influence and power one alone excepted are eager to enter into treaty with the soldan  i acknowledge it said the templar he were blind that had not seen this in their last deliberations but lift yet thy mask an inch higher and tell me thy real reason for pressing upon the council that northern englishman or scot or whatever you call yonder knight of the leopard to carry their proposals for a treaty  there was a policy in it replied the italian his character of native of britain was sufficient to meet what saladin required who knew him to belong to the band of richard while his character of scot and certain other personal grudges which i wot of rendered it most unlikely that our envoy should on his return hold any communication with the sickbed of richard to whom his presence was ever unacceptable  oh too finespun policy said the grand master trust me that italian spiders webs will never bind this unshorn samson of the islewell if you can do it with new cords and those of the toughest see you not that the envoy whom you have selected so carefully hath brought us in this physician the means of restoring the lionhearted bullnecked englishman to prosecute his crusading enterprise and so soon as he is able once more to rush on which of the princes dare hold back they must follow him for very shame although they would march under the banner of satan as soon  be content said conrade of montserrat ere this physician if he work by anything short of miraculous agency can accomplish richards cure it may be possible to put some open rupture betwixt the frenchmanat least the austrianand his allies of england so that the breach shall be irreconcilable and richard may arise from his bed perhaps to command his own native troops but never again by his sole energy to wield the force of the whole crusade  thou art a willing archer said the templar but conrade of montserrat thy bow is overslack to carry an arrow to the mark  he then stopped short cast a suspicious glance to see that no one overheard him and taking conrade by the hand pressed it eagerly as he looked the italian in the face and repeated slowly richard arise from his bed sayest thou conrade he must never arise  the marquis of montserrat started what spoke you of richard of englandof coeur de lionthe champion of christendom  his cheek turned pale and his knees trembled as he spoke the templar looked at him with his iron visage contorted into a smile of contempt  knowest thou what thou lookst like sir conrade at this moment not like the politic and valiant marquis of montserrat not like him who would direct the council of princes and determine the fate of empiresbut like a novice who stumbling upon a conjuration in his masters book of gramarye has raised the devil when he least thought of it and now stands terrified at the spirit which appears before him  i grant you said conrade recovering himself thatunless some other sure road could be discoveredthou hast hinted at that which leads most direct to our purpose but blessed mary we shall become the curse of all europe the malediction of every one from the pope on his throne to the very beggar at the church gate who ragged and leprous in the last extremity of human wretchedness shall bless himself that he is neither giles amaury nor conrade of montserrat  if thou takest it thus said the grand master with the same composure which characterized him all through this remarkable dialogue let us hold there has nothing passed between usthat we have spoken in our sleephave awakened and the vision is gone  it never can depart answered conrade  visions of ducal crowns and kingly diadems are indeed somewhat tenacious of their place in the imagination replied the grand master  well answered conrade let me but first try to break peace between austria and england  they parted conrade remained standing still upon the spot and watching the flowing white cloak of the templar as he stalked slowly away and gradually disappeared amid the fastsinking darkness of the oriental night proud ambitious unscrupulous and politic the marquis of montserrat was yet not cruel by nature he was a voluptuary and an epicurean and like many who profess this character was averse even upon selfish motives from inflicting pain or witnessing acts of cruelty and he retained also a general sense of respect for his own reputation which sometimes supplies the want of the better principle by which reputation is to be maintained  i have he said as his eyes still watched the point at which he had seen the last slight wave of the templars mantlei have in truth raised the devil with a vengeance who would have thought this stern ascetic grand master whose whole fortune and misfortune is merged in that of his order would be willing to do more for its advancement than i who labour for my own interest to check this wild crusade was my motive indeed but i durst not think on the ready mode which this determined priest has dared to suggest yet it is the surestperhaps even the safest  such were the marquiss meditations when his muttered soliloquy was broken by a voice from a little distance which proclaimed with the emphatic tone of a herald remember the holy sepulchre  the exhortation was echoed from post to post for it was the duty of the sentinels to raise this cry from time to time upon their periodical watch that the host of the crusaders might always have in their remembrance the purpose of their being in arms but though conrade was familiar with the custom and had heard the warning voice on all former occasions as a matter of habit yet it came at the present moment so strongly in contact with his own train of thought that it seemed a voice from heaven warning him against the iniquity which his heart meditated he looked around anxiously as if like the patriarch of old though from very different circumstances he was expecting some ram caught in a thicket some substitution for the sacrifice which his comrade proposed to offer not to the supreme being but to the moloch of their own ambition as he looked the broad folds of the ensign of england heavily distending itself to the failing nightbreeze caught his eye it was displayed upon an artificial mound nearly in the midst of the camp which perhaps of old some hebrew chief or champion had chosen as a memorial of his place of rest if so the name was now forgotten and the crusaders had christened it saint georges mount because from that commanding height the banner of england was supereminently displayed as if an emblem of sovereignty over the many distinguished noble and even royal ensigns which floated in lower situations  a quick intellect like that of conrade catches ideas from the glance of a moment a single look on the standard seemed to dispel the uncertainty of mind which had affected him he walked to his pavilion with the hasty and determined step of one who has adopted a plan which he is resolved to achieve dismissed the almost princely train who waited to attend him and as he committed himself to his couch muttered his amended resolution that the milder means are to be tried before the more desperate are resorted to  tomorrow he said i sit at the board of the archduke of austria we will see what can be done to advance our purpose before prosecuting the dark suggestions of this templar    chapter xi       one thing is certain in our northern land      allow that birth or valour wealth or wit      give each precedence to their possessor      envy that follows on such eminence      as comes the lymehound on the roebucks trace      shall pull them down each one               sir david lindsay  leopold grand duke of austria was the first possessor of that noble country to whom the princely rank belonged he had been raised to the ducal sway in the german empire on account of his near relationship to the emperor henry the stern and held under his government the finest provinces which are watered by the danube his character has been stained in history on account of one action of violence and perfidy which arose out of these very transactions in the holy land and yet the shame of having made richard a prisoner when he returned through his dominions unattended and in disguise was not one which flowed from leopolds natural disposition he was rather a weak and a vain than an ambitious or tyrannical prince his mental powers resembled the qualities of his person he was tall strong and handsome with a complexion in which red and white were strongly contrasted and had long flowing locks of fair hair but there was an awkwardness in his gait which seemed as if his size was not animated by energy sufficient to put in motion such a mass and in the same manner wearing the richest dresses it always seemed as if they became him not as a prince he appeared too little familiar with his own dignity and being often at a loss how to assert his authority when the occasion demanded it he frequently thought himself obliged to recover by acts and expressions of illtimed violence the ground which might have been easily and gracefully maintained by a little more presence of mind in the beginning of the controversy  not only were these deficiencies visible to others but the archduke himself could not but sometimes entertain a painful consciousness that he was not altogether fit to maintain and assert the high rank which he had acquired and to this was joined the strong and sometimes the just suspicion that others esteemed him lightly accordingly  when he first joined the crusade with a most princely attendance leopold had desired much to enjoy the friendship and intimacy of richard and had made such advances towards cultivating his regard as the king of england ought in policy to have received and answered but the archduke though not deficient in bravery was so infinitely inferior to coeur de lion in that ardour of mind which wooed danger as a bride that the king very soon held him in a certain degree of contempt richard also as a norman prince a people with whom temperance was habitual despised the inclination of the german for the pleasures of the table and particularly his liberal indulgence in the use of wine for these and other personal reasons the king of england very soon looked upon the austrian prince with feelings of contempt which he was at no pains to conceal or modify and which therefore were speedily remarked and returned with deep hatred by the suspicious leopold the discord between them was fanned by the secret and politic arts of philip of france one of the most sagacious monarchs of the time who dreading the fiery and overbearing character of richard considering him as his natural rival and feeling offended moreover at the dictatorial manner in which he a vassal of france for his continental domains conducted himself towards his liege lord endeavoured to strengthen his own party and weaken that of richard by uniting the crusading princes of inferior degree in resistance to what he termed the usurping authority of the king of england such was the state of politics and opinions entertained by the archduke of austria when conrade of montserrat resolved upon employing his jealousy of england as the means of dissolving or loosening at least the league of the crusaders  the time which he chose for his visit was noon and the pretence to present the archduke with some choice cyprus wine which had lately fallen into his hands and discuss its comparative merits with those of hungary and of the rhine an intimation of his purpose was of course answered by a courteous invitation to partake of the archducal meal and every effort was used to render it fitting the splendour of a sovereign prince yet the refined taste of the italian saw more cumbrous profusion than elegance or splendour in the display of provisions under which the board groaned  the germans though still possessing the martial and frank character of their ancestorswho subdued the roman empirehad retained withal no slight tinge of their barbarism the practices and principles of chivalry were not carried to such a nice pitch amongst them as amongst the french and english knights nor were they strict observers of the prescribed rules of society which among those nations were supposed to express the height of civilization sitting at the table of the archduke conrade was at once stunned and amused with the clang of teutonic sounds assaulting his ears on all sides notwithstanding the solemnity of a princely banquet their dress seemed equally fantastic to him many of the austrian nobles retaining their long beards and almost all of them wearing short jerkins of various colours cut and flourished and fringed in a manner not common in western europe  numbers of dependants old and young attended in the pavilion mingled at times in the conversation received from their masters the relics of the entertainment and devoured them as they stood behind the backs of the company jesters dwarfs and minstrels were there in unusual numbers and more noisy and intrusive than they were permitted to be in better regulated society as they were allowed to share freely in the wine which flowed round in large quantities their licensed tumult was the more excessive  all this while and in the midst of a clamour and confusion which would better have become a german tavern during a fair than the tent of a sovereign prince the archduke was waited upon with a minuteness of form and observance which showed how anxious he was to maintain rigidly the state and character to which his elevation had entitled him he was served on the knee and only by pages of noble blood fed upon plate of silver and drank his tokay and rhenish wines from a cup of gold his ducal mantle was splendidly adorned with ermine his coronet might have equalled in value a royal crown and his feet cased in velvet shoes the length of which peaks included might be two feet rested upon a footstool of solid silver but it served partly to intimate the character of the man that although desirous to show attention to the marquis of montserrat whom he had courteously placed at his right hand he gave much more of his attention to his spruchsprecherthat is his man of conversation or sayerofsayingswho stood behind the dukes right shoulder  this personage was well attired in a cloak and doublet of black velvet the last of which was decorated with various silver and gold coins stitched upon it in memory of the munificent princes who had conferred them and bearing a short staff to which also bunches of silver coins were attached by rings which he jingled by way of attracting attention when he was about to say anything which he judged worthy of it this persons capacity in the household of the archduke was somewhat betwixt that of a minstrel and a counsellor he was by turns a flatterer a poet and an orator and those who desired to be well with the duke generally studied to gain the goodwill of the spruchsprecher  lest too much of this officers wisdom should become tiresome the dukes other shoulder was occupied by his hoffnarr or courtjester called jonas schwanker who made almost as much noise with his fools cap bells and bauble as did the orator or man of talk with his jingling baton  these two personages threw out grave and comic nonsense alternately while their master laughing or applauding them himself yet carefully watched the countenance of his noble guest to discern what impressions so accomplished a cavalier received from this display of austrian eloquence and wit it is hard to say whether the man of wisdom or the man of folly contributed most to the amusement of the party or stood highest in the estimation of their princely master but the sallies of both seemed excellently well received sometimes they became rivals for the conversation and clanged their flappers in emulation of each other with a most alarming contention but in general they seemed on such good terms and so accustomed to support each others play that the spruchsprecher often condescended to follow up the jesters witticisms with an explanation to render them more obvious to the capacity of the audience so that his wisdom became a sort of commentary on the buffoons folly and sometimes in requital the hoffnarr with a pithy jest wound up the conclusion of the orators tedious harangue  whatever his real sentiments might be conrade took especial care that his countenance should express nothing but satisfaction with what he heard and smiled or applauded as zealously to all appearance as the archduke himself at the solemn folly of the spruchsprecher and the gibbering wit of the fool in fact he watched carefully until the one or other should introduce some topic favourable to the purpose which was uppermost in his mind  it was not long ere the king of england was brought on the carpet by the jester who had been accustomed to consider dickon of the broom which irreverent epithet he substituted for richard plantagenet as a subject of mirth acceptable and inexhaustible the orator indeed was silent and it was only when applied to by conrade that he observed the genista or broomplant was an emblem of humility and it would be well when those who wore it would remember the warning  the allusion to the illustrious badge of plantagenet was thus rendered sufficiently manifest and jonas schwanker observed that they who humbled themselves had been exalted with a vengeance honour unto whom honour is due answered the marquis of montserrat we have all had some part in these marches and battles and methinks other princes might share a little in the renown which richard of england engrosses amongst minstrels and minnesingers has no one of the joyeuse science here present a song in praise of the royal archduke of austria our princely entertainer  three minstrels emulously stepped forward with voice and harp two were silenced with difficulty by the spruchsprecher who seemed to act as master of the revels and a hearing was at length procured for the poet preferred who sung in high german stanzas which may be thus translated  what brave chief shall head the forces where the redcross legions gather best of horsemen best of horses highest head and fairest feather  here the orator jingling his staff interrupted the bard to intimate to the partywhat they might not have inferred from the descriptionthat their royal host was the party indicated and a fullcrowned goblet went round to the acclamation hoch lebe der herzog leopold another stanza followed  ask not austria why midst princes still her banner rises highest ask as well the strongwingd eagle why to heaven he soars the highest  the eagle said the expounder of dark sayings is the cognizance of our noble lord the archdukeof his royal grace i would sayand the eagle flies the highest and nearest to the sun of all the feathered creation  the lion hath taken a spring above the eagle said conrade carelessly  the archduke reddened and fixed his eyes on the speaker while the spruchsprecher answered after a minutes consideration the lord marquis will pardon mea lion cannot fly above an eagle because no lion hath got wings  except the lion of saint mark responded the jester  that is the venetians banner said the duke but assuredly that amphibious race half nobles half merchants will not dare to place their rank in comparison with ours  nay it was not of the venetian lion that i spoke said the marquis of montserrat but of the three lions passant of england formerly it is said they were leopards but now they are become lions at all points and must take precedence of beast fish or fowl or woe worth the gainstander  mean you seriously my lord said the austrian now considerably flushed with wine think you that richard of england asserts any preeminence over the free sovereigns who have been his voluntary allies in this crusade  i know not but from circumstances answered conrade yonder hangs his banner alone in the midst of our camp as if he were king and generalissimo of our whole christian army  and do you endure this so patiently and speak of it so coldly said the archduke  nay my lord answered conrade it cannot concern the poor marquis of montserrat to contend against an injury patiently submitted to by such potent princes as philip of france and leopold of austria what dishonour you are pleased to submit to cannot be a disgrace to me  leopold closed his fist and struck on the table with violence  i have told philip of this he said i have often told him that it was our duty to protect the inferior princes against the usurpation of this islander but he answers me ever with cold respects of their relations together as suzerain and vassal and that it were impolitic in him to make an open breach at this time and period  the world knows that philip is wise said conrade and will judge his submission to be policy yours my lord you can yourself alone account for but i doubt not you have deep reasons for submitting to english domination  i submit said leopold indignantlyi the archduke of austria so important and vital a limb of the holy roman empirei submit myself to this king of half an island this grandson of a norman bastard no by heaven the camp and all christendom shall see that i know how to right myself and whether i yield ground one inch to the english bandogup my lieges and merry men up and follow me we willand that without losing one instantplace the eagle of austria where she shall float as high as ever floated the cognizance of king or kaiser  with that he started from his seat and amidst the tumultuous cheering of his guests and followers made for the door of the pavilion and seized his own banner which stood pitched before it  nay my lord said conrade affecting to interfere it will blemish your wisdom to make an affray in the camp at this hour and perhaps it is better to submit to the usurpation of england a little longer than to  not an hour not a moment longer vociferated the duke and with the banner in his hand and followed by his shouting guests and attendants marched hastily to the central mount from which the banner of england floated and laid his hand on the standardspear as if to pluck it from the ground  my master my dear master said jonas schwanker throwing his arms about the duke take heedlions have teeth  and eagles have claws said the duke not relinquishing his hold on the bannerstaff yet hesitating to pull it from the ground  the speaker of sentences notwithstanding such was his occupation had nevertheless some intervals of sound sense he clashed his staff loudly and leopold as if by habit turned his head towards his man of counsel  the eagle is king among the fowls of the air said the spruchsprecher as is the lion among the beasts of the fieldeach has his dominion separated as wide as england and germany do thou noble eagle no dishonour to the princely lion but let your banners remain floating in peace side by side  leopold withdrew his hand from the bannerspear and looked round for conrade of montserrat but he saw him not for the marquis so soon as he saw the mischief afoot had withdrawn himself from the crowd taking care in the first place to express before several neutral persons his regret that the archduke should have chosen the hours after dinner to avenge any wrong of which he might think he had a right to complain not seeing his guest to whom he wished more particularly to have addressed himself the archduke said aloud that having no wish to breed dissension in the army of the cross he did but vindicate his own privileges and right to stand upon an equality with the king of england without desiring as he might have done to advance his bannerwhich he derived from emperors his progenitorsabove that of a mere descendant of the counts of anjou and in the meantime he commanded a cask of wine to be brought hither and pierced for regaling the bystanders who with tuck of drum and sound of music quaffed many a carouse round the austrian standard  this disorderly scene was not acted without a degree of noise which alarmed the whole camp  the critical hour had arrived at which the physician according to the rules of his art had predicted that his royal patient might be awakened with safety and the sponge had been applied for that purpose and the leech had not made many observations ere he assured the baron of gilsland that the fever had entirely left his sovereign and that such was the happy strength of his constitution it would not be even necessary as in most cases to give a second dose of the powerful medicine richard himself seemed to be of the same opinion for sitting up and rubbing his eyes he demanded of de vaux what present sum of money was in the royal coffers  the baron could not exactly inform him of the amount  it matters not said richard be it greater or smaller bestow it all on this learned leech who hath i trust given me back again to the service of the crusade if it be less than a thousand byzants let him have jewels to make it up  i sell not the wisdom with which allah has endowed me answered the arabian physician and be it known to you great prince that the divine medicine of which you have partaken would lose its effects in my unworthy hands did i exchange its virtues either for gold or diamonds  the physician refuseth a gratuity said de vaux to himself this is more extraordinary than his being a hundred years old  thomas de vaux said richard thou knowest no courage but what belongs to the sword no bounty and virtue but what are used in chivalry i tell thee that this moor in his independence might set an example to them who account themselves the flower of knighthood  it is reward enough for me said the moor folding his arms on his bosom and maintaining an attitude at once respectful and dignified that so great a king as the melech ric richard was thus called by the eastern nations should thus speak of his servantbut now let me pray you again to compose yourself on your couch for though i think there needs no further repetition of the divine draught yet injury might ensue from any too early exertion ere your strength be entirely restored  i must obey thee hakim said the king yet believe me my bosom feels so free from the wasting fire which for so many days hath scorched it that i care not how soon i expose it to a brave mans lancebut hark what mean these shouts and that distant music in the camp go thomas de vaux and make inquiry  it is the archduke leopold said de vaux returning after a minutes absence who makes with his potcompanions some procession through the camp  the drunken fool exclaimed king richard can he not keep his brutal inebriety within the veil of his pavilion that he must needs show his shame to all christendomwhat say you sir marquis he added addressing himself to conrade of montserrat who at that moment entered the tent  thus much honoured prince answered the marquis that i delight to see your majesty so well and so far recovered and that is a long speech for any one to make who has partaken of the duke of austrias hospitality  what you have been dining with the teutonic wineskin said the monarch and what frolic has he found out to cause all this disturbance truly sir conrade i have still held you so good a reveller that i wonder at your quitting the game  de vaux who had got a little behind the king now exerted himself by look and sign to make the marquis understand that he should say nothing to richard of what was passing without but conrade understood not or heeded not the prohibition  what the archduke does he said is of little consequence to any one least of all to himself since he probably knows not what he is acting yet to say truth it is a gambol i should not like to share in since he is pulling down the banner of england from saint georges mount in the centre of the camp yonder and displaying his own in its stead  what sayest thou exclaimed the king in a tone which might have waked the dead  nay said the marquis let it not chafe your highness that a fool should act according to his folly  speak not to me said richard springing from his couch and casting on his clothes with a dispatch which seemed marvellousspeak not to me lord marquisde multon i command thee speak not a word to mehe that breathes but a syllable is no friend to richard plantagenethakim be silent i charge thee  all this while the king was hastily clothing himself and with the last word snatched his sword from the pillar of the tent and without any other weapon or calling any attendance he rushed out of his pavilion conrade holding up his hands as if in astonishment seemed willing to enter into conversation with de vaux but sir thomas pushed rudely past him and calling to one of the royal equerries said hastily fly to lord salisburys quarters and let him get his men together and follow me instantly to saint georges mount tell him the kings fever has left his blood and settled in his brain  imperfectly heard and still more imperfectly comprehended by the startled attendant whom de vaux addressed thus hastily the equerry and his fellowservants of the royal chamber rushed hastily into the tents of the neighbouring nobility and quickly spread an alarm as general as the cause seemed vague through the whole british forces the english soldiers waked in alarm from that noonday rest which the heat of the climate had taught them to enjoy as a luxury hastily asked each other the cause of the tumult and without waiting an answer supplied by the force of their own fancy the want of information some said the saracens were in the camp some that the kings life was attempted some that he had died of the fever the preceding night many that he was assassinated by the duke of austria the nobles and officers at an equal loss with the common men to ascertain the real cause of the disorder laboured only to get their followers under arms and under authority lest their rashness should occasion some great misfortune to the crusading army the english trumpets sounded loud shrill and continuously the alarmcry of bows and bills bows and bills was heard from quarter to quarter again and again shouted and again and again answered by the presence of the ready warriors and their national invocation saint george for merry england  the alarm went through the nearest quarter of the camp and men of all the various nations assembled where perhaps every people in christendom had their representatives flew to arms and drew together under circumstances of general confusion of which they knew neither the cause nor the object it was however lucky amid a scene so threatening that the earl of salisbury while he hurried after de vauxs summons with a few only of the readiest english menatarms directed the rest of the english host to be drawn up and kept under arms to advance to richards succour if necessity should require but in fit array and under due command and not with the tumultuary haste which their own alarm and zeal for the kings safety might have dictated  in the meanwhile without regarding for one instant the shouts the cries the tumult which began to thicken around him richard with his dress in the last disorder and his sheathed blade under his arm pursued his way with the utmost speed followed only by de vaux and one or two household servants to saint georges mount  he outsped even the alarm which his impetuosity only had excited and passed the quarter of his own gallant troops of normandy poitou gascony and anjou before the disturbance had reached them although the noise accompanying the german revel had induced many of the soldiery to get on foot to listen the handful of scots were also quartered in the vicinity nor had they been disturbed by the uproar but the kings person and his haste were both remarked by the knight of the leopard who aware that danger must be afoot and hastening to share in it snatched his shield and sword and united himself to de vaux who with some difficulty kept pace with his impatient and fiery master de vaux answered a look of curiosity which the scottish knight directed towards him with a shrug of his broad shoulders and they continued side by side to pursue richards steps  the king was soon at the foot of saint georges mount the sides as well as platform of which were now surrounded and crowded partly by those belonging to the duke of austrias retinue who were celebrating with shouts of jubilee the act which they considered as an assertion of national honour partly by bystanders of different nations whom dislike to the english or mere curiosity had assembled together to witness the end of these extraordinary proceedings through this disorderly troop richard burst his way like a goodly ship under full sail which cleaves her forcible passage through the rolling billows and heeds not that they unite after her passage and roar upon her stern  the summit of the eminence was a small level space on which were pitched the rival banners surrounded still by the archdukes friends and retinue in the midst of the circle was leopold himself still contemplating with selfsatisfaction the deed he had done and still listening to the shouts of applause which his partisans bestowed with no sparing breath while he was in this state of selfgratulation richard burst into the circle attended indeed only by two men but in his own headlong energies an irresistible host  who has dared he said laying his hands upon the austrian standard and speaking in a voice like the sound which precedes an earthquakewho has dared to place this paltry rag beside the banner of england  the archduke wanted not personal courage and it was impossible he could hear this question without reply yet so much was he troubled and surprised by the unexpected arrival of richard and affected by the general awe inspired by his ardent and unyielding character that the demand was twice repeated in a tone which seemed to challenge heaven and earth ere the archduke replied with such firmness as he could command it was i leopold of austria  then shall leopold of austria replied richard presentry see the rate at which his banner and his pretensions are held by richard of england  so saying he pulled up the standardspear splintered it to pieces threw the banner itself on the ground and placed his foot upon it  thus said he i trample on the banner of austria is there a knight among your teutonic chivalry dare impeach my deed  there was a momentary silence but there are no braver men than the germans  i and i and i was heard from several knights of the dukes followers and he himself added his voice to those which accepted the king of englands defiance  why do we dally thus said the earl wallenrode a gigantic warrior from the frontiers of hungary brethren and noble gentlemen this mans foot is on the honour of your countrylet us rescue it from violation and down with the pride of england  so saying he drew his sword and struck at the king a blow which might have proved fatal had not the scot intercepted and caught it upon his shield  i have sworn said king richardand his voice was heard above all the tumult which now waxed wild and loudnever to strike one whose shoulder bears the cross therefore live wallenrodebut live to remember richard of england  as he spoke he grasped the tall hungarian round the waist and unmatched in wrestling as in other military exercises hurled him backwards with such violence that the mass flew as if discharged from a military engine not only through the ring of spectators who witnessed the extraordinary scene but over the edge of the mount itself down the steep side of which wallenrode rolled headlong until pitching at length upon his shoulder he dislocated the bone and lay like one dead this almost supernatural display of strength did not encourage either the duke or any of his followers to renew a personal contest so inauspiciously commenced those who stood farthest back did indeed clash their swords and cry out cut the island mastiff to pieces but those who were nearer veiled perhaps their personal fears under an affected regard for order and cried for the most part peace peace the peace of the crossthe peace of holy church and our father the pope  these various cries of the assailants contradicting each other showed their irresolution while richard his foot still on the archducal banner glared round him with an eye that seemed to seek an enemy and from which the angry nobles shrunk appalled as from the threatened grasp of a lion de vaux and the knight of the leopard kept their places beside him and though the swords which they held were still sheathed it was plain that they were prompt to protect richards person to the very last and their size and remarkable strength plainly showed the defence would be a desperate one  salisbury and his attendants were also now drawing near with bills and partisans brandished and bows already bended  at this moment king philip of france attended by one or two of his nobles came on the platform to inquire the cause of the disturbance and made gestures of surprise at finding the king of england raised from his sickbed and confronting their common ally the duke of austria in such a menacing and insulting posture richard himself blushed at being discovered by philip whose sagacity he respected as much as he disliked his person in an attitude neither becoming his character as a monarch nor as a crusader and it was observed that he withdrew his foot as if accidentally from the dishonoured banner and exchanged his look of violent emotion for one of affected composure and indifference leopold also struggled to attain some degree of calmness mortified as he was by having been seen by philip in the act of passively submitting to the insults of the fiery king of england  possessed of many of those royal qualities for which he was termed by his subjects the august philip might be termed the ulysses as richard was indisputably the achilles of the crusade the king of france was sagacious wise deliberate in council steady and calm in action seeing clearly and steadily pursuing the measures most for the interest of his kingdomdignified and royal in his deportment brave in person but a politician rather than a warrior the crusade would have been no choice of his own but the spirit was contagious and the expedition was enforced upon him by the church and by the unanimous wish of his nobility in any other situation or in a milder age his character might have stood higher than that of the adventurous coeur de lion but in the crusade itself an undertaking wholly irrational sound reason was the quality of all others least estimated and the chivalric valour which both the age and the enterprise demanded was considered as debased if mingled with the least touch of discretion so that the merit of philip compared with that of his haughty rival showed like the clear but minute flame of a lamp placed near the glare of a huge blazing torch which not possessing half the utility makes ten times more impression on the eye philip felt his inferiority in public opinion with the pain natural to a highspirited prince and it cannot be wondered at if he took such opportunities as offered for placing his own character in more advantageous contrast with that of his rival the present seemed one of those occasions in which prudence and calmness might reasonably expect to triumph over obstinacy and impetuous violence  what means this unseemly broil betwixt the sworn brethren of the crossthe royal majesty of england and the princely duke leopold how is it possible that those who are the chiefs and pillars of this holy expedition  a truce with thy remonstrance france said richard enraged inwardly at finding himself placed on a sort of equality with leopold yet not knowing how to resent it this duke or prince or pillar if you will hath been insolent and i have chastised himthat is all here is a coil forsooth because of spurning a hound  majesty of france said the duke i appeal to you and every sovereign prince against the foul indignity which i have sustained this king of england hath pulled down my bannertorn and trampled on it  because he had the audacity to plant it beside mine said richard  my rank as thine equal entitled me replied the duke emboldened by the presence of philip  assert such equality for thy person said king richard and by saint george i will treat thy person as i did thy broidered kerchief there fit but for the meanest use to which kerchief may be put  nay but patience brother of england said philip and i will presently show austria that he is wrong in this matterdo not think noble duke he continued that in permitting the standard of england to occupy the highest point in our camp we the independent sovereigns of the crusade acknowledge any inferiority to the royal richard it were inconsistent to think so since even the oriflamme itselfthe great banner of france to which the royal richard himself in respect of his french possessions is but a vassalholds for the present an inferior place to the lions of england but as sworn brethren of the cross military pilgrims who laying aside the pomp and pride of this world are hewing with our swords the way to the holy sepulchre i myself and the other princes have renounced to king richard from respect to his high renown and great feats of arms that precedence which elsewhere and upon other motives would not have been yielded i am satisfied that when your royal grace of austria shall have considered this you will express sorrow for having placed your banner on this spot and that the royal majesty of england will then give satisfaction for the insult he has offered  the spruchsprecher and the jester had both retired to a safe distance when matters seemed coming to blows but returned when words their own commodity seemed again about to become the order of the day  the man of proverbs was so delighted with philips politic speech that he clashed his baton at the conclusion by way of emphasis and forgot the presence in which he was so far as to say aloud that he himself had never said a wiser thing in his life  it may be so whispered jonas schwanker but we shall be whipped if you speak so loud  the duke answered sullenly that he would refer his quarrel to the general council of the crusadea motion which philip highly applauded as qualified to take away a scandal most harmful to christendom  richard retaining the same careless attitude listened to philip until his oratory seemed exhausted and then said aloud i am drowsythis fever hangs about me still brother of france thou art acquainted with my humour and that i have at all times but few words to spare know therefore at once i will submit a matter touching the honour of england neither to prince pope nor council here stands my bannerwhatsoever pennon shall be reared within three butts length of itay were it the oriflamme of which you were i think but now speakingshall be treated as that dishonoured rag nor will i yield other satisfaction than that which these poor limbs can render in the lists to any bold challengeay were it against five champions instead of one  now said the jester whispering his companion that is as complete a piece of folly as if i myself had said it but yet i think there may be in this matter a greater fool than richard yet  and who may that be asked the man of wisdom  philip said the jester or our own royal duke should either accept the challenge but oh most sage spruchspecher what excellent kings wouldst thou and i have made since those on whose heads these crowns have fallen can play the proverbmonger and the fool as completely as ourselves  while these worthies plied their offices apart philip answered calmly to the almost injurious defiance of richard i came not hither to awaken fresh quarrels contrary to the oath we have sworn and the holy cause in which we have engaged i part from my brother of england as brothers should part and the only strife between the lions of england and the lilies of france shall be which shall be carried deepest into the ranks of the infidels  it is a bargain my royal brother said richard stretching out his hand with all the frankness which belonged to his rash but generous disposition and soon may we have the opportunity to try this gallant and fraternal wager  let this noble duke also partake in the friendship of this happy moment said philip and the duke approached halfsullenly halfwilling to enter into some accommodation  i think not of fools nor of their folly said richard carelessly and the archduke turning his back on him withdrew from the ground  richard looked after him as he retired  there is a sort of glowworm courage he said that shows only by night i must not leave this banner unguarded in darkness by daylight the look of the lions will alone defend it here thomas of gilsland i give thee the charge of the standardwatch over the honour of england  her safety is yet more dear to me said de vaux and the life of richard is the safety of england i must have your highness back to your tent and that without further tarriance  thou art a rough and peremptory nurse de vaux said the king smiling and then added addressing sir kenneth valiant scot i owe thee a boon and i will pay it richly there stands the banner of england watch it as novice does his armour on the night before he is dubbed stir not from it three spears length and defend it with thy body against injury or insult sound thy bugle if thou art assailed by more than three at once dost thou undertake the charge  willingly said kenneth and will discharge it upon penalty of my head i will but arm me and return hither instantly  the kings of france and england then took formal leave of each other hiding under an appearance of courtesy the grounds of complaint which either had against the otherrichard against philip for what he deemed an officious interference betwixt him and austria and philip against coeur de lion for the disrespectful manner in which his mediation had been received those whom this disturbance had assembled now drew off in different directions leaving the contested mount in the same solitude which had subsisted till interrupted by the austrian bravado men judged of the events of the day according to their partialities and while the english charged the austrian with having afforded the first ground of quarrel those of other nations concurred in casting the greater blame upon the insular haughtiness and assuming character of richard  thou seest said the marquis of montserrat to the grand master of the templars that subtle courses are more effective than violence i have unloosed the bonds which held together this bunch of sceptres and lancesthou wilt see them shortly fall asunder  i would have called thy plan a good one said the templar had there been but one man of courage among yonder coldblooded austrians to sever the bonds of which you speak with his sword a knot that is unloosed may again be fastened but not so the cord which has been cut to pieces    chapter xii       tis woman that seduces all mankind         gay  in the days of chivalry a dangerous post or a perilous adventure was a reward frequently assigned to military bravery as a compensation for its former trials just as in ascending a precipice the surmounting one crag only lifts the climber to points yet more dangerous  it was midnight and the moon rode clear and high in heaven when kenneth of scotland stood upon his watch on saint georges mount beside the banner of england a solitary sentinel to protect the emblem of that nation against the insults which might be meditated among the thousands whom richards pride had made his enemies high thoughts rolled one after each other upon the mind of the warrior it seemed to him as if he had gained some favour in the eyes of the chivalrous monarch who till now had not seemed to distinguish him among the crowds of brave men whom his renown had assembled under his banner and sir kenneth little recked that the display of royal regard consisted in placing him upon a post so perilous the devotion of his ambitious and highplaced affection inflamed his military enthusiasm hopeless as that attachment was in almost any conceivable circumstances those which had lately occurred had in some degree diminished the distance between edith and himself he upon whom richard had conferred the distinction of guarding his banner was no longer an adventurer of slight note but placed within the regard of a princess although he was as far as ever from her level an unknown and obscure fate could not now be his if he was surprised and slain on the post which had been assigned him his deathand he resolved it should be gloriousmust deserve the praises as well as call down the vengeance of coeur de lion and be followed by the regrets and even the tears of the highborn beauties of the english court he had now no longer reason to fear that he should die as a fool dieth  sir kenneth had full leisure to enjoy these and similar highsouled thoughts fostered by that wild spirit of chivalry which amid its most extravagant and fantastic flights was still pure from all selfish alloygenerous devoted and perhaps only thus far censurable that it proposed objects and courses of action inconsistent with the frailties and imperfections of man all nature around him slept in calm moonshine or in deep shadow the long rows of tents and pavilions glimmering or darkening as they lay in the moonlight or in the shade were still and silent as the streets of a deserted city beside the bannerstaff lay the large staghound already mentioned the sole companion of kenneths watch on whose vigilance he trusted for early warning of the approach of any hostile footstep the noble animal seemed to understand the purpose of their watch for he looked from time to time at the rich folds of the heavy pennon and when the cry of the sentinels came from the distant lines and defences of the camp he answered them with one deep and reiterated bark as if to affirm that he too was vigilant in his duty from time to time also he lowered his lofty head and wagged his tail as his master passed and repassed him in the short turns which he took upon his post or when the knight stood silent and abstracted leaning on his lance and looking up towards heaven his faithful attendant ventured sometimes in the phrase of romance to disturb his thoughts and awaken him from his reverie by thrusting his large rough snout into the knights gauntleted hand to solicit a transitory caress  thus passed two hours of the knights watch without anything remarkable occurring at length and upon a sudden the gallant staghound bayed furiously and seemed about to dash forward where the shadow lay the darkest yet waited as if in the slips till he should know the pleasure of his master  who goes there said sir kenneth aware that there was something creeping forward on the shadowy side of the mount  in the name of merlin and maugis answered a hoarse disagreeable voice tie up your fourfooted demon there or i come not at you  and who art thou that would approach my post said sir kenneth bending his eyes as keenly as he could on some object which he could just observe at the bottom of the ascent without being able to distinguish its form bewarei am here for death and life  take up thy longfanged sathanas said the voice or i will conjure him with a bolt from my arblast  at the same time was heard the sound of a spring or check as when a crossbow is bent  unbend thy arblast and come into the moonlight said the scot or by saint andrew i will pin thee to the earth be what or whom thou wilt  as he spoke he poised his long lance by the middle and fixing his eye upon the object which seemed to move he brandished the weapon as if meditating to cast it from his handa use of the weapon sometimes though rarely resorted to when a missile was necessary but sir kenneth was ashamed of his purpose and grounded his weapon when there stepped from the shadow into the moonlight like an actor entering upon the stage a stunted decrepit creature whom by his fantastic dress and deformity he recognized even at some distance for the male of the two dwarfs whom he had seen in the chapel at engaddi recollecting at the same moment the other and far different visions of that extraordinary night he gave his dog a signal which he instantly understood and returning to the standard laid himself down beside it with a stifled growl  the little distorted miniature of humanity assured of his safety from an enemy so formidable came panting up the ascent which the shortness of his legs rendered laborious and when he arrived on the platform at the top shifted to his left hand the little crossbow which was just such a toy as children at that period were permitted to shoot small birds with and assuming an attitude of great dignity gracefully extended his right hand to sir kenneth in an attitude as if he expected he would salute it but such a result not following he demanded in a sharp and angry tone of voice soldier wherefore renderest thou not to nectabanus the homage due to his dignity or is it possible that thou canst have forgotten him  great nectabanus answered the knight willing to soothe the creatures humour that were difficult for any one who has ever looked upon thee pardon me however that being a soldier upon my post with my lance in my hand i may not give to one of thy puissance the advantage of coming within my guard or of mastering my weapon suffice it that i reverence thy dignity and submit myself to thee as humbly as a manatarms in my place may  it shall suffice said nectabanus so that you presently attend me to the presence of those who have sent me hither to summon you  great sir replied the knight neither in this can i gratify thee for my orders are to abide by this banner till daybreakso i pray you to hold me excused in that matter also  so saying he resumed his walk upon the platform but the dwarf did not suffer him so easily to escape from his importunity  look you he said placing himself before sir kenneth so as to interrupt his way either obey me sir knight as in duty bound or i will lay the command upon thee in the name of one whose beauty could call down the genii from their sphere and whose grandeur could command the immortal race when they had descended  a wild and improbable conjecture arose in the knights mind but he repelled it it was impossible he thought that the lady of his love should have sent him such a message by such a messenger yet his voice trembled as he said go to nectabanus tell me at once and as a true man whether this sublime lady of whom thou speakest be other than the houri with whose assistance i beheld thee sweeping the chapel at engaddi  how presumptuous knight replied the dwarf thinkst thou the mistress of our own royal affections the sharer of our greatness and the partner of our comeliness would demean herself by laying charge on such a vassal as thou no highly as thou art honoured thou hast not yet deserved the notice of queen guenevra the lovely bride of arthur from whose high seat even princes seem but pigmies but look thou here and as thou knowest or disownest this token so obey or refuse her commands who hath deigned to impose them on thee  so saying he placed in the knights hand a ruby ring which even in the moonlight he had no difficulty to recognize as that which usually graced the finger of the highborn lady to whose service he had devoted himself could he have doubted the truth of the token he would have been convinced by the small knot of carnationcoloured ribbon which was fastened to the ring this was his ladys favourite colour and more than once had he himself assuming it for that of his own liveries caused the carnation to triumph over all other hues in the lists and in the battle  sir kenneth was struck nearly mute by seeing such a token in such hands  in the name of all that is sacred from whom didst thou receive this witness said the knight bring if thou canst thy wavering understanding to a right settlement for a minute or two and tell me the person by whom thou art sent and the real purpose of thy message and take heed what thou sayest for this is no subject for buffoonery  fond and foolish knight said the dwarf wouldst thou know more of this matter than that thou art honoured with commands from a princess delivered to thee by a king we list not to parley with thee further than to command thee in the name and by the power of that ring to follow us to her who is the owner of the ring every minute that thou tarriest is a crime against thy allegiance  good nectabanus bethink thyself said the knight can my lady know where and upon what duty i am this night engaged is she aware that my lifepshaw why should i speak of lifebut that my honour depends on my guarding this banner till daybreak and can it be her wish that i should leave it even to pay homage to her it is impossiblethe princess is pleased to be merry with her servant in sending him such a message and i must think so the rather that she hath chosen such a messenger  oh keep your belief said nectabanus turning round as if to leave the platform it is little to me whether you be traitor or true man to this royal ladyso fare thee well  stay stayi entreat you stay said sir kenneth answer me but one question is the lady who sent thee near to this place  what signifies it said the dwarf ought fidelity to reckon furlongs or miles or leagueslike the poor courier who is paid for his labour by the distance which he traverses nevertheless thou soul of suspicion i tell thee the fair owner of the ring now sent to so unworthy a vassal in whom there is neither truth nor courage is not more distant from this place than this arblast can send a bolt  the knight gazed again on that ring as if to ascertain that there was no possible falsehood in the token tell me he said to the dwarf is my presence required for any length of time  time answered nectabanus in his flighty manner what call you time i see it noti feel it notit is but a shadowy namea succession of breathings measured forth by night by the clank of a bell by day by a shadow crossing along a dialstone knowest thou not a true knights time should only be reckoned by the deeds that he performs in behalf of god and his lady  the words of truth though in the mouth of folly said the knight and doth my lady really summon me to some deed of action in her name and for her sakeand may it not be postponed for even the few hours till daybreak  she requires thy presence instantly said the dwarf and without the loss of so much time as would be told by ten grains of the sandglass hearken thou coldblooded and suspicious knight these are her very wordstell him that the hand which dropped roses can bestow laurels  this allusion to their meeting in the chapel of engaddi sent a thousand recollections through sir kenneths brain and convinced him that the message delivered by the dwarf was genuine the rosebuds withered as they were were still treasured under his cuirass and nearest to his heart he paused and could not resolve to forego an opportunity the only one which might ever offer to gain grace in her eyes whom he had installed as sovereign of his affections the dwarf in the meantime augmented his confusion by insisting either that he must return the ring or instantly attend him  hold hold yet a moment hold said the knight and proceeded to mutter to himself am i either the subject or slave of king richard more than as a free knight sworn to the service of the crusade and whom have i come hither to honour with lance and sword our holy cause and my transcendent lady  the ring the ring exclaimed the dwarf impatiently false and slothful knight return the ring which thou art unworthy to touch or to look upon  a moment a moment good nectabanus said sir kenneth disturb not my thoughtswhat if the saracens were just now to attack our lines should i stay here like a sworn vassal of england watching that her kings pride suffered no humiliation or should i speed to the breach and fight for the cross to the breach assuredly and next to the cause of god come the commands of my liege lady and yet coeur de lions behestmy own promise nectabanus i conjure thee once more to say are you to conduct me far from hence  but to yonder pavilion and since you must needs know replied nectabanus the moon is glimmering on the gilded ball which crowns its roof and which is worth a kings ransom  i can return in an instant said the knight shutting his eyes desperately to all further consequences i can hear from thence the bay of my dog if any one approaches the standard i will throw myself at my ladys feet and pray her leave to return to conclude my watchhere roswal calling his hound and throwing down his mantle by the side of the standardspear watch thou here and let no one approach  the majestic dog looked in his masters face as if to be sure that he understood his charge then sat down beside the mantle with ears erect and head raised like a sentinel understanding perfectly the purpose for which he was stationed there  come now good nectabanus said the knight let us hasten to obey the commands thou hast brought  haste he that will said the dwarf sullenly thou hast not been in haste to obey my summons nor can i walk fast enough to follow your long stridesyou do not walk like a man but bound like an ostrich in the desert  there were but two ways of conquering the obstinacy of nectabanus who as he spoke diminished his walk into a snails pace for bribes sir kenneth had no meansfor soothing no time so in his impatience he snatched the dwarf up from the ground and bearing him along notwithstanding his entreaties and his fear reached nearly to the pavilion pointed out as that of the queen in approaching it however the scot observed there was a small guard of soldiers sitting on the ground who had been concealed from him by the intervening tents wondering that the clash of his own armour had not yet attracted their attention and supposing that his motions might on the present occasion require to be conducted with secrecy he placed the little panting guide upon the ground to recover his breath and point out what was next to be done nectabanus was both frightened and angry but he had felt himself as completely in the power of the robust knight as an owl in the claws of an eagle and therefore cared not to provoke him to any further display of his strength  he made no complaints therefore of the usage he had received but turning amongst the labyrinth of tents he led the knight in silence to the opposite side of the pavilion which thus screened them from the observation of the warders who seemed either too negligent or too sleepy to discharge their duty with much accuracy arrived there the dwarf raised the under part of the canvas from the ground and made signs to sir kenneth that he should introduce himself to the inside of the tent by creeping under it the knight hesitated there seemed an indecorum in thus privately introducing himself into a pavilion pitched doubtless for the accommodation of noble ladies but he recalled to remembrance the assured tokens which the dwarf had exhibited and concluded that it was not for him to dispute his ladys pleasure  he stooped accordingly crept beneath the canvas enclosure of the tent and heard the dwarf whisper from without remain here until i call thee    chapter xiii       you talk of gaiety and innocence      the moment when the fatal fruit was eaten      they parted neer to meet again and malice      has ever since been playmate to light gaiety      from the first moment when the smiling infant      destroys the flower or butterfly he toys with      to the last chuckle of the dying miser      who on his deathbed laughs his last to hear      his wealthy neighbour has become a bankrupt          old play  sir kenneth was left for some minutes alone and in darkness here was another interruption which must prolong his absence from his post and he began almost to repent the facility with which he had been induced to quit it but to return without seeing the lady edith was now not to be thought of he had committed a breach of military discipline and was determined at least to prove the reality of the seductive expectations which had tempted him to do so meanwhile his situation was unpleasant there was no light to show him into what sort of apartment he had been ledthe lady edith was in immediate attendance on the queen of englandand the discovery of his having introduced himself thus furtively into the royal pavilion might were it discovered lead to much and dangerous suspicion while he gave way to these unpleasant reflections and began almost to wish that he could achieve his retreat unobserved he heard a noise of female voices laughing whispering and speaking in an adjoining apartment from which as the sounds gave him reason to judge he could only be separated by a canvas partition lamps were burning as he might perceive by the shadowy light which extended itself even to his side of the veil which divided the tent and he could see shades of several figures sitting and moving in the adjoining apartment it cannot be termed discourtesy in sir kenneth that situated as he was he overheard a conversation in which he found himself deeply interested  call hercall her for our ladys sake said the voice of one of these laughing invisibles nectabanus thou shalt be made ambassador to prester johns court to show them how wisely thou canst discharge thee of a mission  the shrill tone of the dwarf was heard yet so much subdued that sir kenneth could not understand what he said except that he spoke something of the means of merriment given to the guard  but how shall we rid us of the spirit which nectabanus hath raised my maidens  hear me royal madam said another voice if the sage and princely nectabanus be not overjealous of his most transcendent bride and empress let us send her to get us rid of this insolent knighterrant who can be so easily persuaded that highborn dames may need the use of his insolent and overweening valour  it were but justice methinks replied another that the princess guenever should dismiss by her courtesy him whom her husbands wisdom has been able to entice hither  struck to the heart with shame and resentment at what he had heard sir kenneth was about to attempt his escape from the tent at all hazards when what followed arrested his purpose  nay truly said the first speaker our cousin edith must first learn how this vaunted wight hath conducted himself and we must reserve the power of giving her ocular proof that he hath failed in his duty it may be a lesson will do good upon her for credit me calista i have sometimes thought she has let this northern adventurer sit nearer her heart than prudence would sanction  one of the other voices was then heard to mutter something of the lady ediths prudence and wisdom  prudence wench was the reply it is mere pride and the desire to be thought more rigid than any of us nay i will not quit my advantage you know well that when she has us at fault no one can in a civil way lay your error before you more precisely than can my lady edith but here she comes  a figure as if entering the apartment cast upon the partition a shade which glided along slowly until it mixed with those which already clouded it despite of the bitter disappointment which he had experienceddespite the insult and injury with which it seemed he had been visited by the malice or at best by the idle humour of queen berengaria for he already concluded that she who spoke loudest and in a commanding tone was the wife of richard the knight felt something so soothing to his feelings in learning that edith had been no partner to the fraud practised on him and so interesting to his curiosity in the scene which was about to take place that instead of prosecuting his more prudent purpose of an instant retreat he looked anxiously on the contrary for some rent or crevice by means of which he might be made eye as well as ear witness to what was to go forward  surely said he to himself the queen who hath been pleased for an idle frolic to endanger my reputation and perhaps my life cannot complain if i avail myself of the chance which fortune seems willing to afford me to obtain knowledge of her further intentions  it seemed in the meanwhile as if edith were waiting for the commands of the queen and as if the other were reluctant to speak for fear of being unable to command her laughter and that of her companions for sir kenneth could only distinguish a sound as of suppressed tittering and merriment  your majesty said edith at last seems in a merry mood though methinks the hour of night prompts a sleepy one i was well disposed bedward when i had your majestys commands to attend you  i will not long delay you cousin from your repose said the queen though i fear you will sleep less soundly when i tell you your wager is lost  nay royal madam said edith this surely is dwelling on a jest which has rather been worn out i laid no wager however it was your majestys pleasure to suppose or to insist that i did so  nay now despite our pilgrimage satan is strong with you my gentle cousin and prompts thee to leasing can you deny that you gaged your ruby ring against my golden bracelet that yonder knight of the libbard or how call you him could not be seduced from his post  your majesty is too great for me to gainsay you replied edith but these ladies can if they will bear me witness that it was your highness who proposed such a wager and took the ring from my finger even while i was declaring that i did not think it maidenly to gage anything on such a subject  nay but my lady edith said another voice you must needs grant under your favour that you expressed yourself very confident of the valour of that same knight of the leopard  and if i did minion said edith angrily is that a good reason why thou shouldst put in thy word to flatter her majestys humour i spoke of that knight but as all men speak who have seen him in the field and had no more interest in defending than thou in detracting from him in a camp what can women speak of save soldiers and deeds of arms  the noble lady edith said a third voice hath never forgiven calista and me since we told your majesty that she dropped two rosebuds in the chapel  if your majesty said edith in a tone which sir kenneth could judge to be that of respectful remonstrance have no other commands for me than to hear the gibes of your waitingwomen i must crave your permission to withdraw  silence florise said the queen and let not our indulgence lead you to forget the difference betwixt yourself and the kinswoman of englandbut you my dear cousin she continued resuming her tone of raillery how can you who are so goodnatured begrudge us poor wretches a few minutes laughing when we have had so many days devoted to weeping and gnashing of teeth  great be your mirth royal lady said edith yet would i be content not to smile for the rest of my life rather than  she stopped apparently out of respect but sir kenneth could hear that she was in much agitation  forgive me said berengaria a thoughtless but goodhumoured princess of the house of navarre but what is the great offence after all a young knight has been wiled hitherhas stolen or has been stolen from his post which no one will disturb in his absencefor the sake of a fair lady for to do your champion justice sweet one the wisdom of nectabanus could conjure him hither in no name but yours  gracious heaven your majesty does not say so said edith in a voice of alarm quite different from the agitation she had previously evincedyou cannot say so consistently with respect for your own honour and for mine your husbands kinswoman say you were jesting with me my royal mistress and forgive me that i could even for a moment think it possible you could be in earnest  the lady edith said the queen in a displeased tone of voice regrets the ring we have won of her we will restore the pledge to you gentle cousin only you must not grudge us in turn a little triumph over the wisdom which has been so often spread over us as a banner over a host  a triumph exclaimed edith indignantlya triumph the triumph will be with the infidel when he hears that the queen of england can make the reputation of her husbands kinswoman the subject of a light frolic  you are angry fair cousin at losing your favourite ring said the queen come since you grudge to pay your wager we will renounce our right it was your name and that pledge brought him hither and we care not for the bait after the fish is caught  madam replied edith impatiently you know well that your grace could not wish for anything of mine but it becomes instantly yours but i would give a bushel of rubies ere ring or name of mine had been used to bring a brave man into a fault and perhaps to disgrace and punishment  oh it is for the safety of our true knight that we fear said the queen you rate our power too low fair cousin when you speak of a life being lost for a frolic of ours o lady edith others have influence on the iron breasts of warriors as well as youthe heart even of a lion is made of flesh not of stone and believe me i have interest enough with richard to save this knight in whose fate lady edith is so deeply concerned from the penalty of disobeying his royal commands  for the love of the blessed cross most royal lady said edithand sir kenneth with feelings which it were hard to unravel heard her prostrate herself at the queens feetfor the love of our blessed lady and of every holy saint in the calendar beware what you do you know not king richardyou have been but shortly wedded to him your breath might as well combat the west wind when it is wildest as your words persuade my royal kinsman to pardon a military offence oh for gods sake dismiss this gentleman if indeed you have lured him hither i could almost be content to rest with the shame of having invited him did i know that he was returned again where his duty calls him  arise cousin arise said queen berengaria and be assured all will be better than you think rise dear edith i am sorry i have played my foolery with a knight in whom you take such deep interest nay wring not thy hands i will believe thou carest not for himbelieve anything rather than see thee look so wretchedly miserable i tell thee i will take the blame on myself with king richard in behalf of thy fair northern friendthine acquaintance i would say since thou ownst him not as a friend nay look not so reproachfully we will send nectabanus to dismiss this knight of the standard to his post and we ourselves will grace him on some future day to make amends for his wildgoose chase he is i warrant but lying perdu in some neighbouring tent  by my crown of lilies and my sceptre of a specially good waterreed said nectabanus your majesty is mistaken he is nearer at hand than you wothe lieth ensconced there behind that canvas partition  and within hearing of each word we have said exclaimed the queen in her turn violently surprised and agitated out monster of folly and malignity  as she uttered these words nectabanus fled from the pavilion with a yell of such a nature as leaves it still doubtful whether berengaria had confined her rebuke to words or added some more emphatic expression of her displeasure  what can now be done said the queen to edith in a whisper of undisguised uneasiness  that which must said edith firmly we must see this gentleman and place ourselves in his mercy  so saying she began hastily to undo a curtain which at one place covered an entrance or communication  for heavens sake forbearconsider said the queenmy apartmentour dressthe hourmy honour  but ere she could detail her remonstrances the curtain fell and there was no division any longer betwixt the armed knight and the party of ladies the warmth of an eastern night occasioned the undress of queen berengaria and her household to be rather more simple and unstudied than their station and the presence of a male spectator of rank required this the queen remembered and with a loud shriek fled from the apartment where sir kenneth was disclosed to view in a compartment of the ample pavilion now no longer separated from that in which they stood the grief and agitation of the lady edith as well as the deep interest she felt in a hasty explanation with the scottish knight perhaps occasioned her forgetting that her locks were more dishevelled and her person less heedfully covered than was the wont of highborn damsels in an age which was not after all the most prudish or scrupulous period of the ancient time a thin loose garment of pinkcoloured silk made the principal part of her vestments with oriental slippers into which she had hastily thrust her bare feet and a scarf hurriedly and loosely thrown about her shoulders her head had no other covering than the veil of rich and dishevelled locks falling round it on every side that half hid a countenance which a mingled sense of modesty and of resentment and other deep and agitated feelings had covered with crimson  but although edith felt her situation with all that delicacy which is her sexs greatest charm it did not seem that for a moment she placed her own bashfulness in comparison with the duty which as she thought she owed to him who had been led into error and danger on her account she drew indeed her scarf more closely over her neck and bosom and she hastily laid from her hand a lamp which shed too much lustre over her figure but while sir kenneth stood motionless on the same spot in which he was first discovered she rather stepped towards than retired from him as she exclaimed hasten to your post valiant knightyou are deceived in being trained hitherask no questions  i need ask none said the knight sinking upon one knee with the reverential devotion of a saint at the altar and bending his eyes on the ground lest his looks should increase the ladys embarrassment  have you heard all said edith impatiently gracious saints then wherefore wait you here when each minute that passes is loaded with dishonour  i have heard that i am dishonoured lady and i have heard it from you answered kenneth what reck i how soon punishment follows i have but one petition to you and then i seek among the sabres of the infidels whether dishonour may not be washed out with blood  do not so neither said the lady be wisedally not here all may yet be well if you will but use dispatch  i wait but for your forgiveness said the knight still kneeling for my presumption in believing that my poor services could have been required or valued by you  i do forgive youoh i have nothing to forgive have been the means of injuring you but oh begone i will forgivei will value youthat is as i value every brave crusaderif you will but begone  receive first this precious yet fatal pledge said the knight tendering the ring to edith who now showed gestures of impatience  oh no no  she said declining to receive it keep itkeep it as a mark of my regardmy regret i would say oh begone if not for your own sake for mine  almost recompensed for the loss even of honour which her voice had denounced to him by the interest which she seemed to testify in his safety sir kenneth rose from his knee and casting a momentary glance on edith bowed low and seemed about to withdraw at the same instant that maidenly bashfulness which the energy of ediths feelings had till then triumphed over became conqueror in its turn and she hastened from the apartment extinguishing her lamp as she went and leaving in sir kenneths thoughts both mental and natural gloom behind her  she must be obeyed was the first distinct idea which waked him from his reverie and he hastened to the place by which he had entered the pavilion to pass under the canvas in the manner he had entered required time and attention and he made a readier aperture by slitting the canvas wall with his poniard when in the free air he felt rather stupefied and overpowered by a conflict of sensations than able to ascertain what was the real import of the whole he was obliged to spur himself to action by recollecting that the commands of the lady edith had required haste even then engaged as he was amongst tentropes and tents he was compelled to move with caution until he should regain the path or avenue aside from which the dwarf had led him in order to escape the observation of the guards before the queens pavilion and he was obliged also to move slowly and with precaution to avoid giving an alarm either by falling or by the clashing of his armour a thin cloud had obscured the moon too at the very instant of his leaving the tent and sir kenneth had to struggle with this inconvenience at a moment when the dizziness of his head and the fullness of his heart scarce left him powers of intelligence sufficient to direct his motions  but at once sounds came upon his ear which instantly recalled him to the full energy of his faculties these proceeded from the mount of saint george he heard first a single fierce angry and savage bark which was immediately followed by a yell of agony no deer ever bounded with a wilder start at the voice of roswal than did sir kenneth at what he feared was the deathcry of that noble hound from whom no ordinary injury could have extracted even the slightest acknowledgment of pain he surmounted the space which divided him from the avenue and having attained it began to run towards the mount although loaded with his mail faster than most men could have accompanied him even if unarmed relaxed not his pace for the steep sides of the artificial mound and in a few minutes stood on the platform upon its summit  the moon broke forth at this moment and showed him that the standard of england was vanished that the spear on which it had floated lay broken on the ground and beside it was his faithful hound apparently in the agonies of death    chapter xiv       all my long arrear of honour lost      heapd up in youth and hoarded up for age      hath honours fountain then suckd up the stream      he hathand hooting boys may barefoot pass      and gather pebbles from the naked ford           don sebastian  after a torrent of afflicting sensations by which he was at first almost stunned and confounded sir kenneths first thought was to look for the authors of this violation of the english banner but in no direction could he see traces of them his next which to some persons but scarce to any who have made intimate acquaintances among the canine race may appear strange was to examine the condition of his faithful roswal mortally wounded as it seemed in discharging the duty which his master had been seduced to abandon he caressed the dying animal who faithful to the last seemed to forget his own pain in the satisfaction he received from his masters presence and continued wagging his tail and licking his hand even while by low moanings he expressed that his agony was increased by the attempts which sir kenneth made to withdraw from the wound the fragment of the lance or javelin with which it had been inflicted then redoubled his feeble endearments as if fearing he had offended his master by showing a sense of the pain to which his interference had subjected him there was something in the display of the dying creatures attachment which mixed as a bitter ingredient with the sense of disgrace and desolation by which sir kenneth was oppressed his only friend seemed removed from him just when he had incurred the contempt and hatred of all besides the knights strength of mind gave way to a burst of agonized distress and he groaned and wept aloud  while he thus indulged his grief a clear and solemn voice close beside him pronounced these words in the sonorous tone of the readers of the mosque and in the lingua franca mutually understood by christians and saracens  adversity is like the period of the former and of the latter raincold comfortless unfriendly to man and to animal yet from that season have their birth the flower and the fruit the date the rose and the pomegranate  sir kenneth of the leopard turned towards the speaker and beheld the arabian physician who approaching unheard had seated himself a little behind him crosslegged and uttered with gravity yet not without a tone of sympathy the moral sentences of consolation with which the koran and its commentators supplied him for in the east wisdom is held to consist less in a display of the sages own inventive talents than in his ready memory and happy application of and reference to that which is written  ashamed at being surprised in a womanlike expression of sorrow sir kenneth dashed his tears indignantly aside and again busied himself with his dying favourite  the poet hath said continued the arab without noticing the knights averted looks and sullen deportment the ox for the field and the camel for the desert were not the hand of the leech fitter than that of the soldier to cure wounds though less able to inflict them  this patient hakim is beyond thy help said sir kenneth and besides he is by thy law an unclean animal  where allah hath deigned to bestow life and a sense of pain and pleasure said the physician it were sinful pride should the sage whom he has enlightened refuse to prolong existence or assuage agony to the sage the cure of a miserable groom of a poor dog and of a conquering monarch are events of little distinction let me examine this wounded animal  sir kenneth acceded in silence and the physician inspected and handled roswals wound with as much care and attention as if he had been a human being he then took forth a case of instruments and by the judicious and skilful application of pincers withdrew from the wounded shoulder the fragment of the weapon and stopped with styptics and bandages the effusion of blood which followed the creature all the while suffering him patiently to perform these kind offices as if he had been aware of his kind intentions  the animal may be cured said el hakim addressing himself to sir kenneth if you will permit me to carry him to my tent and treat him with the care which the nobleness of his nature deserves for know that thy servant adonbec is no less skilful in the race and pedigree and distinctions of good dogs and of noble steeds than in the diseases which afflict the human race  take him with you said the knight i bestow him on you freely if he recovers i owe thee a reward for attendance on my squire and have nothing else to pay it with for myself i will never again wind bugle or halloo to hound  the arabian made no reply but gave a signal with a clapping of his hands which was instantly answered by the appearance of two black slaves he gave them his orders in arabic received the answer that to hear was to obey when taking the animal in their arms they removed him without much resistance on his part for though his eyes turned to his master he was too weak to struggle  fare thee well roswal then said sir kennethfare thee well my last and only friendthou art too noble a possession to be retained by one such as i must in future call myselfi would he said as the slaves retired that dying as he is i could exchange conditions with that noble animal  it is written answered the arabian although the exclamation had not been addressed to him that all creatures are fashioned for the service of man and the master of the earth speaketh folly when he would exchange in his impatience his hopes here and to come for the servile condition of an inferior being  a dog who dies in discharging his duty said the knight sternly is better than a man who survives the desertion of it leave me hakim thou hast on this side of miracle the most wonderful science which man ever possessed but the wounds of the spirit are beyond thy power  not if the patient will explain his calamity and be guided by the physician said adonbec el hakim  know then said sir kenneth since thou art so importunate that last night the banner of england was displayed from this moundi was its appointed guardianmorning is now breakingthere lies the broken bannerspear the standard itself is lost and here sit i a living man  how said el hakim examining him thy armour is wholethere is no blood on thy weapons and report speaks thee one unlikely to return thus from fight thou hast been trained from thy postay trained by the rosy cheek and black eye of one of those houris to whom you nazarenes vow rather such service as is due to allah than such love as may lawfully be rendered to forms of clay like our own it has been thus assuredly for so hath man ever fallen even since the days of sultan adam  and if it were so physician said sir kenneth sullenly what remedy  knowledge is the parent of power said el hakim as valour supplies strength listen to me man is not as a tree bound to one spot of earth nor is he framed to cling to one bare rock like the scarce animated shellfish thine own christian writings command thee when persecuted in one city to flee to another and we moslem also know that mohammed the prophet of allah driven forth from the holy city of mecca found his refuge and his helpmates at medina  and what does this concern me said the scot  much answered the physician even the sage flies the tempest which he cannot control use thy speed therefore and fly from the vengeance of richard to the shadow of saladins victorious banner  i might indeed hide my dishonour said sir kenneth ironically in a camp of infidel heathens where the very phrase is unknown but had i not better partake more fully in their reproach does not thy advice stretch so far as to recommend me to take the turban methinks i want but apostasy to consummate my infamy  blaspheme not nazarene said the physician sternly saladin makes no converts to the law of the prophet save those on whom its precepts shall work conviction open thine eyes to the light and the great soldan whose liberality is as boundless as his power may bestow on thee a kingdom remain blinded if thou will and being one whose second life is doomed to misery saladin will yet for this span of present time make thee rich and happy but fear not that thy brows shall be bound with the turban save at thine own free choice  my choice were rather said the knight that my writhen features should blacken as they are like to do in this evenings setting sun  yet thou art not wise nazarene said el hakim to reject this fair offer for i have power with saladin and can raise thee high in his grace look you my sonthis crusade as you call your wild enterprise is like a large dromond the largest sort of vessels then known were termed dromonds or dromedaries parting asunder in the waves thou thyself hast borne terms of truce from the kings and princes whose force is here assembled to the mighty soldan and knewest not perchance the full tenor of thine own errand  i knew not and i care not said the knight impatiently what avails it to me that i have been of late the envoy of princes when ere night i shall be a gibbeted and dishonoured corpse  nay i speak that it may not be so with thee said the physician saladin is courted on all sides the combined princes of this league formed against him have made such proposals of composition and peace as in other circumstances it might have become his honour to have granted to them others have made private offers on their own separate account to disjoin their forces from the camp of the kings of frangistan and even to lend their arms to the defence of the standard of the prophet but saladin will not be served by such treacherous and interested defection the king of kings will treat only with the lion king saladin will hold treaty with none but the melech ric and with him he will treat like a prince or fight like a champion to richard he will yield such conditions of his free liberality as the swords of all europe could never compel from him by force or terror he will permit a free pilgrimage to jerusalem and all the places where the nazarenes list to worship nay he will so far share even his empire with his brother richard that he will allow christian garrisons in the six strongest cities of palestine and one in jerusalem itself and suffer them to be under the immediate command of the officers of richard who he consents shall bear the name of king guardian of jerusalem yet further strange and incredible as you may think it know sir knightfor to your honour i can commit even that almost incredible secretknow that saladin will put a sacred seal on this happy union betwixt the bravest and noblest of frangistan and asia by raising to the rank of his royal spouse a christian damsel allied in blood to king richard and known by the name of the lady edith of plantagenet this may appear so extraordinary and improbable a proposition that it is necessary to say such a one was actually made the historians however substitute the widowed queen of naples sister of richard for the bride and saladins brother for the bridegroom they appear to have been ignorant of the existence of edith of plantagenetsee mills history of the crusades vol ii p 61  hasayest thou exclaimed sir kenneth who listening with indifference and apathy to the preceding part of el hakims speech was touched by this last communication as the thrill of a nerve unexpectedly jarred will awaken the sensation of agony even in the torpor of palsy then moderating his tone by dint of much effort he restrained his indignation and veiling it under the appearance of contemptuous doubt he prosecuted the conversation in order to get as much knowledge as possible of the plot as he deemed it against the honour and happiness of her whom he loved not the less that his passion had ruined apparently his fortunes at once and his honourand what christian he said with tolerable calmness would sanction a union so unnatural as that of a christian maiden with an unbelieving saracen  thou art but an ignorant bigoted nazarene said the hakim seest thou not how the mohammedan princes daily intermarry with the noble nazarene maidens in spain without scandal either to moor or christian and the noble soldan will in his full confidence in the blood of richard permit the english maid the freedom which your frankish manners have assigned to women he will allow her the free exercise of her religion seeing that in very truth it signifies but little to which faith females are addicted and he will assign her such place and rank over all the women of his zenana that she shall be in every respect his sole and absolute queen  what said sir kenneth darest thou think moslem that richard would give his kinswomana highborn and virtuous princessto be at best the foremost concubine in the haram of a misbeliever know hakim the meanest free christian noble would scorn on his childs behalf such splendid ignominy  thou errest said the hakim philip of france and henry of champagne and others of richards principal allies have heard the proposal without starting and have promised as far as they may to forward an alliance that may end these wasteful wars and the wise archpriest of tyre hath undertaken to break the proposal to richard not doubting that he shall be able to bring the plan to good issue the soldans wisdom hath as yet kept his proposition secret from others such as he of montserrat and the master of the templars because he knows they seek to thrive by richards death or disgrace not by his life or honour up therefore sir knight and to horse i will give thee a scroll which shall advance thee highly with the soldan and deem not that you are leaving your country or her cause or her religion since the interest of the two monarchs will speedily be the same to saladin thy counsel will be most acceptable since thou canst make him aware of much concerning the marriages of the christians the treatment of their wives and other points of their laws and usages which in the course of such treaty it much concerns him that he should know the right hand of the soldan grasps the treasures of the east and it is the fountain or generosity or if thou desirest it saladin when allied with england can have but little difficulty to obtain from richard not only thy pardon and restoration to favour but an honourable command in the troops which may be left of the king of englands host to maintain their joint government in palestine up then and mountthere lies a plain path before thee  hakim said the scottish knight thou art a man of peace also thou hast saved the life of richard of englandand moreover of my own poor esquire strauchan i have therefore heard to an end a matter which being propounded by another moslem than thyself i would have cut short with a blow of my dagger hakim in return for thy kindness i advise thee to see that the saracen who shall propose to richard a union betwixt the blood of plantagenet and that of his accursed race do put on a helmet which is capable to endure such a blow of a battleaxe as that which struck down the gate of acre certes he will be otherwise placed beyond the reach even of thy skill  thou art then wilfully determined not to fly to the saracen host said the physician yet remember thou stayest to certain destruction and the writings of thy law as well as ours prohibit man from breaking into the tabernacle of his own life  god forbid replied the scot crossing himself but we are also forbidden to avoid the punishment which our crimes have deserved and since so poor are thy thoughts of fidelity hakim it grudges me that i have bestowed my good hound on thee for should he live he will have a master ignorant of his value  a gift that is begrudged is already recalled said el hakim only we physicians are sworn not to send away a patient uncured if the dog recover he is once more yours  go to hakim answered sir kenneth men speak not of hawk and hound when there is but an hour of daybreaking betwixt them and death leave me to recollect my sins and reconcile myself to heaven  i leave thee in thine obstinacy said the physician the mist hides the precipice from those who are doomed to fall over it  he withdrew slowly turning from time to time his head as if to observe whether the devoted knight might not recall him either by word or signal at last his turbaned figure was lost among the labyrinth of tents which lay extended beneath whitening in the pale light of the dawning before which the moonbeam had now faded away  but although the physician adonbecs words had not made that impression upon kenneth which the sage desired they had inspired the scot with a motive for desiring life which dishonoured as he conceived himself to be he was before willing to part from as from a sullied vestment no longer becoming his wear much that had passed betwixt himself and the hermit besides what he had observed between the anchorite and sheerkohf or ilderim he now recalled to recollection and tended to confirm what the hakim had told him of the secret article of the treaty  the reverend impostor he exclaimed to himself the hoary hypocrite he spoke of the unbelieving husband converted by the believing wife and what do i know but that the traitor exhibited to the saracen accursed of god the beauties of edith plantagenet that the hound might judge if the princely christian lady were fit to be admitted into the haram of a misbeliever if i had yonder infidel ilderim or whatsoever he is called again in the gripe with which i once held him fast as ever hound held hare never again should he at least come on errand disgraceful to the honour of christian king or noble and virtuous maiden but imy hours are fast dwindling into minutesyet while i have life and breath something must be done and speedily  he paused for a few minutes threw from him his helmet then strode down the hill and took the road to king richards pavilion    chapter xv       the featherd songster chanticleer      had wound his buglehorn      and told the early villager      the coming of the morn      king edward saw the ruddy streaks      of light eclipse the grey      and heard the ravens croaking throat      proclaim the fated day      thourt right he said for by the god      that sits enthrond on high      charles baldwin and his fellows twain      this day shall surely die                    chatterton  on the evening on which sir kenneth assumed his post richard after the stormy event which disturbed its tranquillity had retired to rest in the plenitude of confidence inspired by his unbounded courage and the superiority which he had displayed in carrying the point he aimed at in presence of the whole christian host and its leaders many of whom he was aware regarded in their secret souls the disgrace of the austrian duke as a triumph over themselves so that his pride felt gratified that in prostrating one enemy he had mortified a hundred  another monarch would have doubled his guards on the evening after such a scene and kept at least a part of his troops under arms but coeur de lion dismissed upon the occasion even his ordinary watch and assigned to his soldiers a donative of wine to celebrate his recovery and to drink to the banner of saint george and his quarter of the camp would have assumed a character totally devoid of vigilance and military preparation but that sir thomas de vaux the earl of salisbury and other nobles took precautions to preserve order and discipline among the revellers  the physician attended the king from his retiring to bed till midnight was past and twice administered medicine to him during that period always previously observing the quarter of heaven occupied by the full moon whose influences he declared to be most sovereign or most baleful to the effect of his drugs it was three hours after midnight ere el hakim withdrew from the royal tent to one which had been pitched for himself and his retinue in his way thither he visited the tent of sir kenneth of the leopard in order to see the condition of his first patient in the christian camp old strauchan as the knights esquire was named inquiring there for sir kenneth himself el hakim learned on what duty he was employed and probably this information led him to saint georges mount where he found him whom he sought in the disastrous circumstances alluded to in the last chapter  it was about the hour of sunrise when a slow armed tread was heard approaching the kings pavilion and ere de vaux who slumbered beside his masters bed as lightly as ever sleep sat upon the eyes of a watchdog had time to do more than arise and say who comes the knight of the leopard entered the tent with a deep and devoted gloom seated upon his manly features  whence this bold intrusion sir knight said de vaux sternly yet in a tone which respected his masters slumbers  hold de vaux said richard awaking on the instant sir kenneth cometh like a good soldier to render an account of his guard to such the generals tent is ever accessible then rising from his slumbering posture and leaning on his elbow he fixed his large bright eye upon the warriorspeak sir scot thou comest to tell me of a vigilant safe and honourable watch dost thou not the rustling of the folds of the banner of england were enough to guard it even without the body of such a knight as men hold thee  as men will hold me no more said sir kenneth my watch hath neither been vigilant safe nor honourable the banner of england has been carried off  and thou alive to tell it said richard in a tone of derisive incredulity away it cannot be there is not even a scratch on thy face why dost thou stand thus mute speak the truthit is ill jesting with a king yet i will forgive thee if thou hast lied  lied sir king returned the unfortunate knight with fierce emphasis and one glance of fire from his eye bright and transient as the flash from the cold and stony flint but this also must be endured i have spoken the truth  by god and by saint george said the king bursting into fury which however he instantly checked de vaux go view the spot this fever has disturbed his brain this cannot be the mans courage is proof it cannot be go speedilyor send if thou wilt not go  the king was interrupted by sir henry neville who came breathless to say that the banner was gone and the knight who guarded it overpowered and most probably murdered as there was a pool of blood where the bannerspear lay shivered  but whom do i see here said neville his eyes suddenly resting upon sir kenneth  a traitor said the king starting to his feet and seizing the curtalaxe which was ever near his beda traitor whom thou shalt see die a traitors death and he drew back the weapon as in act to strike  colourless but firm as a marble statue the scot stood before him with his bare head uncovered by any protection his eyes cast down to the earth his lips scarcely moving yet muttering probably in prayer opposite to him and within the due reach for a blow stood king richard his large person wrapt in the folds of his camiscia or ample gown of linen except where the violence of his action had flung the covering from his right arm shoulder and a part of his breast leaving to view a specimen of a frame which might have merited his saxon predecessors epithet of ironside he stood for an instant prompt to strike then sinking the head of the weapon towards the ground he exclaimed but there was blood nevillethere was blood upon the place hark thee sir scotbrave thou wert once for i have seen thee fight say thou hast slain two of the thieves in defence of the standardsay but onesay thou hast struck but a good blow in our behalf and get thee out of the camp with thy life and thy infamy  you have called me liar my lord king replied kenneth firmly and therein at least you have done me wrong know that there was no blood shed in defence of the standard save that of a poor hound which more faithful than his master defended the charge which he deserted  now by saint george said richard again heaving up his arm but de vaux threw himself between the king and the object of his vengeance and spoke with the blunt truth of his character my liege this must not behere nor by your hand it is enough of folly for one night and day to have entrusted your banner to a scot said i not they were ever fair and false such were the terms in which the english used to speak of their poor northern neighbours forgetting that their own encroachments upon the independence of scotland obliged the weaker nation to defend themselves by policy as well as force the disgrace must be divided between edward i and edward iii who enforced their domination over a free country and the scots who were compelled to take compulsory oaths without any purpose of keeping them  thou didst de vaux thou wast right and i confess it said richard i should have known him betteri should have remembered how the fox william deceived me touching this crusade  my lord said sir kenneth william of scotland never deceived but circumstances prevented his bringing his forces  peace shameless said the king thou sulliest the name of a prince even by speaking itand yet de vaux it is strange he added to see the bearing of the man coward or traitor he must be yet he abode the blow of richard plantagenet as our arm had been raised to lay knighthood on his shoulder had he shown the slightest sign of fear had but a joint trembled or an eyelid quivered i had shattered his head like a crystal goblet but i cannot strike where there is neither fear nor resistance  there was a pause  my lord said kenneth  ha replied richard interrupting him hast thou found thy speech ask grace from heaven but none from me for england is dishonoured through thy fault and wert thou mine own and only brother there is no pardon for thy fault  i speak not to demand grace of mortal man said the scot it is in your graces pleasure to give or refuse me time for christian shriftif man denies it may god grant me the absolution which i would otherwise ask of his church but whether i die on the instant or half an hour hence i equally beseech your grace for one moments opportunity to speak that to your royal person which highly concerns your fame as a christian king  say on said the king making no doubt that he was about to hear some confession concerning the loss of the banner  what i have to speak said sir kenneth touches the royalty of england and must be said to no ears but thine own  begone with yourselves sirs said the king to neville and de vaux  the first obeyed but the latter would not stir from the kings presence  if you said i was in the right replied de vaux to his sovereign i will be treated as one should be who hath been found to be rightthat is i will have my own will i leave you not with this false scot  how de vaux said richard angrily and stamping slightly darest thou not venture our person with one traitor  it is in vain you frown and stamp my lord said de vaux i venture not a sick man with a sound one a naked man with one armed in proof  it matters not said the scottish knight i seek no excuse to put off time i will speak in presence of the lord of gilsland he is good lord and true  but half an hour since said de vaux with a groan implying a mixture of sorrow and vexation and i had said as much for thee  there is treason around you king of england continued sir kenneth  it may well be as thou sayest replied richard i have a pregnant example  treason that will injure thee more deeply than the loss of a hundred banners in a pitched field thethe sir kenneth hesitated and at length continued in a lower tone the lady edith  ha said the king drawing himself suddenly into a state of haughty attention and fixing his eye firmly on the supposed criminal what of her what of her what has she to do with this matter  my lord said the scot there is a scheme on foot to disgrace your royal lineage by bestowing the hand of the lady edith on the saracen soldan and thereby to purchase a peace most dishonourable to christendom by an alliance most shameful to england  this communication had precisely the contrary effect from that which sir kenneth expected richard plantagenet was one of those who in iagos words would not serve god because it was the devil who bade him advice or information often affected him less according to its real import than through the tinge which it took from the supposed character and views of those by whom it was communicated unfortunately the mention of his relatives name renewed his recollection of what he had considered as extreme presumption in the knight of the leopard even when he stood high in the roll of chivalry but which in his present condition appeared an insult sufficient to drive the fiery monarch into a frenzy of passion  silence he said infamous and audacious by heaven i will have thy tongue torn out with hot pincers for mentioning the very name of a noble christian damsel know degenerate traitor that i was already aware to what height thou hadst dared to raise thine eyes and endured it though it were insolence even when thou hadst cheated usfor thou art all a deceitinto holding thee as of some name and fame but now with lips blistered with the confession of thine own dishonourthat thou shouldst now dare to name our noble kinswoman as one in whose fate thou hast part or interest what is it to thee if she marry saracen or christian what is it to thee if in a camp where princes turn cowards by day and robbers by nightwhere brave knights turn to paltry deserters and traitorswhat is it i say to thee or any one if i should please to ally myself to truth and to valour in the person of saladin  little to me indeed to whom all the world will soon be as nothing answered sir kenneth boldly but were i now stretched on the rack i would tell thee that what i have said is much to thine own conscience and thine own fame i tell thee sir king that if thou dost but in thought entertain the purpose of wedding thy kinswoman the lady edith  name her notand for an instant think not of her said the king again straining the curtalaxe in his gripe until the muscles started above his brawny arm like cordage formed by the ivy around the limb of an oak  not namenot think of her answered sir kenneth his spirits stunned as they were by selfdepression beginning to recover their elasticity from this species of controversy now by the cross on which i place my hope her name shall be the last word in my mouth her image the last thought in my mind try thy boasted strength on this bare brow and see if thou canst prevent my purpose  he will drive me mad said richard who in his despite was once more staggered in his purpose by the dauntless determination of the criminal  ere thomas of gilsland could reply some bustle was heard without and the arrival of the queen was announced from the outer part of the pavilion  detain herdetain her neville cried the king this is no sight for womenfie that i have suffered such a paltry traitor to chafe me thusaway with him de vaux he whispered through the back entrance of our tent coop him up close and answer for his safe custody with your life and hark yehe is presently to dielet him have a ghostly fatherwe would not kill soul and body and stayhark theewe will not have him dishonouredhe shall die knightlike in his belt and spurs for if his treachery be as black as hell his boldness may match that of the devil himself  de vaux right glad if the truth may be guessed that the scene ended without richards descending to the unkingly act of himself slaying an unresisting prisoner made haste to remove sir kenneth by a private issue to a separate tent where he was disarmed and put in fetters for security de vaux looked on with a steady and melancholy attention while the provosts officers to whom sir kenneth was now committed took these severe precautions  when they were ended he said solemnly to the unhappy criminal it is king richards pleasure that you die undegradedwithout mutilation of your body or shame to your armsand that your head be severed from the trunk by the sword of the executioner  it is kind said the knight in a low and rather submissive tone of voice as one who received an unexpected favour my family will not then hear the worst of the tale oh my fathermy father  this muttered invocation did not escape the blunt but kindlynatured englishman and he brushed the back of his large hand over his rough features ere he could proceed  it is richard of englands further pleasure he said at length that you have speech with a holy man and i have met on the passage hither with a carmelite friar who may fit you for your passage he waits without until you are in a frame of mind to receive him  let it be instantly said the knight in this also richard is kind i cannot be more fit to see the good father at any time than now for life and i have taken farewell as two travellers who have arrived at the crossway where their roads separate  it is well said de vaux slowly and solemnly for it irks me somewhat to say that which sums my message it is king richards pleasure that you prepare for instant death  gods pleasure and the kings be done replied the knight patiently i neither contest the justice of the sentence nor desire delay of the execution  de vaux began to leave the tent but very slowlypaused at the door and looked back at the scot from whose aspect thoughts of the world seemed banished as if he was composing himself into deep devotion the feelings of the stout english baron were in general none of the most acute and yet on the present occasion his sympathy overpowered him in an unusual manner he came hastily back to the bundle of reeds on which the captive lay took one of his fettered hands and said with as much softness as his rough voice was capable of expressing sir kenneth thou art yet youngthou hast a father my ralph whom i left training his little galloway nag on the banks of the irthing may one day attain thy years and but for last night would to god i saw his youth bear such promise as thine can nothing be said or done in thy behalf  nothing was the melancholy answer i have deserted my chargethe banner entrusted to me is lost when the headsman and block are prepared the head and trunk are ready to part company  nay then god have mercy said de vaux yet would i rather than my best horse i had taken that watch myself there is mystery in it young man as a plain man may descry though he cannot see through it cowardice pshaw no coward ever fought as i have seen thee do treachery i cannot think traitors die in their treason so calmly thou hast been trained from thy post by some deep guilesome welldevised stratagemthe cry of some distressed maiden has caught thine ear or the laughful look of some merry one has taken thine eye never blush for it we have all been led aside by such gear come i pray thee make a clean conscience of it to me instead of the priest richard is merciful when his mood is abated hast thou nothing to entrust to me  the unfortunate knight turned his face from the kind warrior and answered nothing  and de vaux who had exhausted his topics of persuasion arose and left the tent with folded arms and in melancholy deeper than he thought the occasion meritedeven angry with himself to find that so simple a matter as the death of a scottish man could affect him so nearly  yet as he said to himself though the roughfooted knaves be our enemies in cumberland in palestine one almost considers them as brethren    chapter xvi       tis not her sense for sure in that      theres nothing more than common      and all her wit is only chat      like any other woman         song  the highborn berengaria daughter of sanchez king of navarre and the queenconsort of the heroic richard was accounted one of the most beautiful women of the period her form was slight though exquisitely moulded she was graced with a complexion not common in her country a profusion of fair hair and features so extremely juvenile as to make her look several years younger than she really was though in reality she was not above oneandtwenty perhaps it was under the consciousness of this extremely juvenile appearance that she affected or at least practised a little childish petulance and wilfulness of manner not unbefitting she might suppose a youthful bride whose rank and age gave her a right to have her fantasies indulged and attended to she was by nature perfectly goodhumoured and if her due share of admiration and homage in her opinion a very large one was duly resigned to her no one could possess better temper or a more friendly disposition but then like all despots the more power that was voluntarily yielded to her the more she desired to extend her sway sometimes even when all her ambition was gratified she chose to be a little out of health and a little out of spirits and physicians had to toil their wits to invent names for imaginary maladies while her ladies racked their imagination for new games new headgear and new courtscandal to pass away those unpleasant hours during which their own situation was scarce to be greatly envied their most frequent resource for diverting this malady was some trick or piece of mischief practised upon each other and the good queen in the buoyancy of her reviving spirits was to speak truth rather too indifferent whether the frolics thus practised were entirely befitting her own dignity or whether the pain which those suffered upon whom they were inflicted was not beyond the proportion of pleasure which she herself derived from them she was confident in her husbands favour in her high rank and in her supposed power to make good whatever such pranks might cost others in a word she gambolled with the freedom of a young lioness who is unconscious of the weight of her own paws when laid on those whom she sports with  the queen berengaria loved her husband passionately but she feared the loftiness and roughness of his character and as she felt herself not to be his match in intellect was not much pleased to see that he would often talk with edith plantagenet in preference to herself simply because he found more amusement in her conversation a more comprehensive understanding and a more noble cast of thoughts and sentiments than his beautiful consort exhibited berengaria did not hate edith on this account far less meditate her any harm for allowing for some selfishness her character was on the whole innocent and generous but the ladies of her train sharpsighted in such matters had for some time discovered that a poignant jest at the expense of the lady edith was a specific for relieving her grace of englands low spirits and the discovery saved their imagination much toil  there was something ungenerous in this because the lady edith was understood to be an orphan and though she was called plantagenet and the fair maid of anjou and admitted by richard to certain privileges only granted to the royal family and held her place in the circle accordingly yet few knew and none acquainted with the court of england ventured to ask in what exact degree of relationship she stood to coeur de lion she had come with eleanor the celebrated queen mother of england and joined richard at messina as one of the ladies destined to attend on berengaria whose nuptials then approached richard treated his kinswoman with much respectful observance and the queen made her her most constant attendant and even in despite of the petty jealousy which we have observed treated her generally with suitable respect  the ladies of the household had for a long time no further advantage over edith than might be afforded by an opportunity of censuring a less artfully disposed head attire or an unbecoming robe for the lady was judged to be inferior in these mysteries the silent devotion of the scottish knight did not indeed pass unnoticed his liveries his cognizances his feats of arms his mottoes and devices were nearly watched and occasionally made the subject of a passing jest but then came the pilgrimage of the queen and her ladies to engaddi a journey which the queen had undertaken under a vow for the recovery of her husbands health and which she had been encouraged to carry into effect by the archbishop of tyre for a political purpose it was then and in the chapel at that holy place connected from above with a carmelite nunnery from beneath with the cell of the anchorite that one of the queens attendants remarked that secret sign of intelligence which edith had made to her lover and failed not instantly to communicate it to her majesty the queen returned from her pilgrimage enriched with this admirable recipe against dullness or ennui and her train was at the same time augmented by a present of two wretched dwarfs from the dethroned queen of jerusalem as deformed and as crazy the excellence of that unhappy species as any queen could have desired one of berengarias idle amusements had been to try the effect of the sudden appearance of such ghastly and fantastic forms on the nerves of the knight when left alone in the chapel but the jest had been lost by the composure of the scot and the interference of the anchorite she had now tried another of which the consequences promised to be more serious  the ladies again met after sir kenneth had retired from the tent and the queen at first little moved by ediths angry expostulations only replied to her by upbraiding her prudery and by indulging her wit at the expense of the garb nation and above all the poverty of the knight of the leopard in which she displayed a good deal of playful malice mingled with some humour until edith was compelled to carry her anxiety to her separate apartment but when in the morning a female whom edith had entrusted to make inquiry brought word that the standard was missing and its champion vanished she burst into the queens apartment and implored her to rise and proceed to the kings tent without delay and use her powerful mediation to prevent the evil consequences of her jest  the queen frightened in her turn cast as is usual the blame of her own folly on those around her and endeavoured to comfort ediths grief and appease her displeasure by a thousand inconsistent arguments she was sure no harm had chancedthe knight was sleeping she fancied after his nightwatch what though for fear of the kings displeasure he had deserted with the standardit was but a piece of silk and he but a needy adventurer or if he was put under warding for a time she would soon get the king to pardon himit was but waiting to let richards mood pass away  thus she continued talking thick and fast and heaping together all sorts of inconsistencies with the vain expectation of persuading both edith and herself that no harm could come of a frolic which in her heart she now bitterly repented but while edith in vain strove to intercept this torrent of idle talk she caught the eye of one of the ladies who entered the queens apartment there was death in her look of affright and horror and edith at the first glance of her countenance had sunk at once on the earth had not strong necessity and her own elevation of character enabled her to maintain at least external composure  madam she said to the queen lose not another word in speaking but save lifeif indeed she added her voice choking as she said it life may yet be saved  it may it may answered the lady calista i have just heard that he has been brought before the king it is not yet overbut she added bursting into a vehement flood of weeping in which personal apprehensions had some share it will soon unless some course be taken  i will vow a golden candlestick to the holy sepulchre a shrine of silver to our lady of engaddi a pall worth one hundred byzants to saint thomas of orthez said the queen in extremity  up up madam said edith call on the saints if you list but be your own best saint  indeed madam said the terrified attendant the lady edith speaks truth up madam and let us to king richards tent and beg the poor gentlemans life  i will goi will go instantly said the queen rising and trembling excessively while her women in as great confusion as herself were unable to render her those duties which were indispensable to her levee calm composed only pale as death edith ministered to the queen with her own hand and alone supplied the deficiencies of her numerous attendants  how you wait wenches said the queen not able even then to forget frivolous distinctions suffer ye the lady edith to do the duties of your attendance seest thou edith they can do nothing i shall never be attired in time we will send for the archbishop of tyre and employ him as a mediator  oh no no exclaimed edith go yourself madam you have done the evil do you confer the remedy  i will goi will go said the queen but if richard be in his mood i dare not speak to himhe will kill me  yet go gracious madam said the lady calista who best knew her mistresss temper not a lion in his fury could look upon such a face and form and retain so much as an angry thought far less a lovetrue knight like the royal richard to whom your slightest word would be a command  dost thou think so calista said the queen ah thou little knowest yet i will go but see you here what means this you have bedizened me in green a colour he detests lo you let me have a blue robe andsearch for the ruby carcanet which was part of the king of cypruss ransom it is either in the steel casket or somewhere else  this and a mans life at stake said edith indignantly it passes human patience remain at your ease madam i will go to king richard i am a party interested i will know if the honour of a poor maiden of his blood is to be so far tampered with that her name shall be abused to train a brave gentleman from his duty bring him within the compass of death and infamy and make at the same time the glory of england a laughingstock to the whole christian army  at this unexpected burst of passion berengaria listened with an almost stupefied look of fear and wonder but as edith was about to leave the tent she exclaimed though faintly stop her stop her  you must indeed stop noble lady edith said calista taking her arm gently and you royal madam i am sure will go and without further dallying if the lady edith goes alone to the king he will be dreadfully incensed nor will it be one life that will stay his fury  i will goi will go said the queen yielding to necessity and edith reluctantly halted to wait her movements  they were now as speedy as she could have desired the queen hastily wrapped herself in a large loose mantle which covered all inaccuracies of the toilet in this guise attended by edith and her women and preceded and followed by a few officers and menatarms she hastened to the tent of her lionlike husband    chapter xvii       were every hair upon his head a life      and every life were to be supplicated      by numbers equal to those hairs quadrupled      life after life should out like waning stars      before the daybreakor as festive lamps      which have lent lustre to the midnight revel      each after each are quenchd when guests depart           old play   the entrance of queen berengaria into the interior of richards pavilion was withstoodin the most respectful and reverential manner indeed but still withstoodby the chamberlains who watched in the outer tent she could hear the stern command of the king from within prohibiting their entrance  you see said the queen appealing to edith as if she had exhausted all means of intercession in her power i knew itthe king will not receive us  at the same time they heard richard speak to some one withingo speed thine office quickly sirrah for in that consists thy mercyten byzants if thou dealest on him at one blow and hark thee villain observe if his cheek loses colour or his eye falters mark me the smallest twitch of the features or wink of the eyelid i love to know how brave souls meet death  if he sees my blade waved aloft without shrinking he is the first ever did so answered a harsh deep voice which a sense of unusual awe had softened into a sound much lower than its usual coarse tones  edith could remain silent no longer if your grace she said to the queen make not your own way i make it for you or if not for your majesty for myself at leastchamberlain the queen demands to see king richardthe wife to speak with her husband  noble lady said the officer lowering his wand of office it grieves me to gainsay you but his majesty is busied on matters of life and death  and we seek also to speak with him on matters of life and death said edith i will make entrance for your grace and putting aside the chamberlain with one hand she laid hold on the curtain with the other  i dare not gainsay her majestys pleasure said the chamberlain yielding to the vehemence of the fair petitioner and as he gave way the queen found herself obliged to enter the apartment of richard  the monarch was lying on his couch and at some distance as awaiting his further commands stood a man whose profession it was not difficult to conjecture he was clothed in a jerkin of red cloth which reached scantly below the shoulders leaving the arms bare from about half way above the elbow and as an upper garment he wore when about as at present to betake himself to his dreadful office a coat or tabard without sleeves something like that of a herald made of dressed bulls hide and stained in the front with many a broad spot and speckle of dull crimson the jerkin and the tabard over it reached the knee and the nether stocks or covering of the legs were of the same leather which composed the tabard a cap of rough shag served to hide the upper part of a visage which like that of a screech owl seemed desirous to conceal itself from light the lower part of the face being obscured by a huge red beard mingling with shaggy locks of the same colour what features were seen were stern and misanthropical the mans figure was short strongly made with a neck like a bull very broad shoulders arms of great and disproportioned length a huge square trunk and thick bandy legs this truculent official leant on a sword the blade of which was nearly four feet and a half in length while the handle of twenty inches surrounded by a ring of lead plummets to counterpoise the weight of such a blade rose considerably above the mans head as he rested his arm upon its hilt waiting for king richards further directions  on the sudden entrance of the ladies richard who was then lying on his couch with his face towards the entrance and resting on his elbow as he spoke to his grisly attendant flung himself hastily as if displeased and surprised to the other side turning his back to the queen and the females of her train and drawing around him the covering of his couch which by his own choice or more probably the flattering selection of his chamberlains consisted of two large lions skins dressed in venice with such admirable skill that they seemed softer than the hide of the deer  berengaria such as we have described her knew wellwhat woman knows nother own road to victory after a hurried glance of undisguised and unaffected terror at the ghastly companion of her husbands secret counsels she rushed at once to the side of richards couch dropped on her knees flung her mantle from her shoulders showing as they hung down at their full length her beautiful golden tresses and while her countenance seemed like the sun bursting through a cloud yet bearing on its pallid front traces that its splendours have been obscured she seized upon the right hand of the king which as he assumed his wonted posture had been employed in dragging the covering of his couch and gradually pulling it to her with a force which was resisted though but faintly she possessed herself of that arm the prop of christendom and the dread of heathenesse and imprisoning its strength in both her little fairy hands she bent upon it her brow and united to it her lips  what needs this berengaria said richard his head still averted but his hand remaining under her control  send away that man his look kills me muttered berengaria  begone sirrah said richard still without looking round what waitst thou for art thou fit to look on these ladies  your highnesss pleasure touching the head said the man  out with thee dog answered richarda christian burial the man disappeared after casting a look upon the beautiful queen in her deranged dress and natural loveliness with a smile of admiration more hideous in its expression than even his usual scowl of cynical hatred against humanity  and now foolish wench what wishest thou said richard turning slowly and half reluctantly round to his royal suppliant  but it was not in nature for any one far less an admirer of beauty like richard to whom it stood only in the second rank to glory to look without emotion on the countenance and the tremor of a creature so beautiful as berengaria or to feel without sympathy that her lips her brow were on his hand and that it was wetted by her tears by degrees he turned on her his manly countenance with the softest expression of which his large blue eye which so often gleamed with insufferable light was capable caressing her fair head and mingling his large fingers in her beautiful and dishevelled locks he raised and tenderly kissed the cherub countenance which seemed desirous to hide itself in his hand the robust form the broad noble brow and majestic looks the naked arm and shoulder the lions skins among which he lay and the fair fragile feminine creature that kneeled by his side might have served for a model of hercules reconciling himself after a quarrel to his wife dejanira  and once more what seeks the lady of my heart in her knights pavilion at this early and unwonted hour  pardon my most gracious liegepardon said the queen whose fears began again to unfit her for the duty of intercessor  pardonfor what asked the king  first for entering your royal presence too boldly and unadvisedly  she stopped  thou too boldlythe sun might as well ask pardon because his rays entered the windows of some wretchs dungeon but i was busied with work unfit for thee to witness my gentle one and i was unwilling besides that thou shouldst risk thy precious health where sickness had been so lately rife  but thou art now well said the queen still delaying the communication which she feared to make  well enough to break a lance on the bold crest of that champion who shall refuse to acknowledge thee the fairest dame in christendom  thou wilt not then refuse me one boononly oneonly a poor life  haproceed said king richard bending his brows  this unhappy scottish knight murmured the queen  speak not of him madam exclaimed richard sternly he dieshis doom is fixed  nay my royal liege and love tis but a silken banner neglected berengaria will give thee another broidered with her own hand and rich as ever dallied with the wind every pearl i have shall go to bedeck it and with every pearl i will drop a tear of thankfulness to my generous knight  thou knowest not what thou sayest said the king interrupting her in anger pearls can all the pearls of the east atone for a speck upon englands honourall the tears that ever womans eye wept wash away a stain on richards fame go to madam know your place and your time and your sphere at present we have duties in which you cannot be our partner  thou hearest edith whispered the queen we shall but incense him  be it so said edith stepping forwardmy lord i your poor kinswoman crave you for justice rather than mercy and to the cry of justice the ears of a monarch should be open at every time place and circumstance  ha our cousin edith said richard rising and sitting upright on the side of his couch covered with his long camiscia she speaks ever kinglike and kinglike will i answer her so she bring no request unworthy herself or me  the beauty of edith was of a more intellectual and less voluptuous cast than that of the queen but impatience and anxiety had given her countenance a glow which it sometimes wanted and her mien had a character of energetic dignity that imposed silence for a moment even on richard himself who to judge by his looks would willingly have interrupted her  my lord she said this good knight whose blood you are about to spill hath done in his time service to christendom he has fallen from his duty through a snare set for him in mere folly and idleness of spirit a message sent to him in the name of one whowhy should i not speak itit was in my owninduced him for an instant to leave his post and what knight in the christian camp might not have thus far transgressed at command of a maiden who poor howsoever in other qualities hath yet the blood of plantagenet in her veins  and you saw him then cousin replied the king biting his lips to keep down his passion  i did my liege said edith it is no time to explain wherefore i am here neither to exculpate myself nor to blame others  and where did you do him such a grace  in the tent of her majesty the queen  of our royal consort said richard now by heaven by saint george of england and every other saint that treads its crystal floor this is too audacious i have noticed and overlooked this warriors insolent admiration of one so far above him and i grudged him not that one of my blood should shed from her highborn sphere such influence as the sun bestows on the world beneath but heaven and earth that you should have admitted him to an audience by night in the very tent of our royal consortand dare to offer this as an excuse for his disobedience and desertion by my fathers soul edith thou shalt rue this thy life long in a monastery  my liege said edith your greatness licenses tyranny my honour lord king is as little touched as yours and my lady the queen can prove it if she think fit but i have already said i am not here to excuse myself or inculpate others i ask you but to extend to one whose fault was committed under strong temptation that mercy which even you yourself lord king must one day supplicate at a higher tribunal and for faults perhaps less venial  can this be edith plantagenet said the king bitterlyedith plantagenet the wise and the noble or is it some lovesick woman who cares not for her own fame in comparison of the life of her paramour now by king henrys soul little hinders but i order thy minions skull to be brought from the gibbet and fixed as a perpetual ornament by the crucifix in thy cell  and if thou dost send it from the gibbet to be placed for ever in my sight said edith i will say it is a relic of a good knight cruelly and unworthily done to death by she checked herselfby one of whom i shall only say he should have known better how to reward chivalry minion callest thou him she continued with increasing vehemence he was indeed my lover and a most true one but never sought he grace from me by look or wordcontented with such humble observance as men pay to the saints and the goodthe valiantthe faithful must die for this  oh peace peace for pitys sake whispered the queen you do but offend him more  i care not said edith the spotless virgin fears not the raging lion let him work his will on this worthy knight edith for whom he dies will know how to weep his memory to me no one shall speak more of politic alliances to be sanctioned with this poor hand i could noti would nothave been his bride livingour degrees were too distant but death unites the high and the lowi am henceforward the spouse of the grave  the king was about to answer with much anger when a carmelite monk entered the apartment hastily his head and person muffled in the long mantle and hood of striped cloth of the coarsest texture which distinguished his order and flinging himself on his knees before the king conjured him by every holy word and sign to stop the execution  now by both sword and sceptre said richard the world is leagued to drive me madfools women and monks cross me at every step how comes he to live still  my gracious liege said the monk i entreated of the lord of gilsland to stay the execution until i had thrown myself at your royal  and he was wilful enough to grant thy request said the king but it is of a piece with his wonted obstinacy and what is it thou hast to say speak in the fiends name  my lord there is a weighty secret but it rests under the seal of confession i dare not tell or even whisper it but i swear to thee by my holy order by the habit which i wear by the blessed elias our founder even him who was translated without suffering the ordinary pangs of mortality that this youth hath divulged to me a secret which if i might confide it to thee would utterly turn thee from thy bloody purpose in regard to him  good father said richard that i reverence the church let the arms which i now wear for her sake bear witness give me to know this secret and i will do what shall seem fitting in the matter but i am no blind bayard to take a leap in the dark under the stroke of a pair of priestly spurs  my lord said the holy man throwing back his cowl and upper vesture and discovering under the latter a garment of goatskin and from beneath the former a visage so wildly wasted by climate fast and penance as to resemble rather the apparition of an animated skeleton than a human face for twenty years have i macerated this miserable body in the caverns of engaddi doing penance for a great crime think you i who am dead to the world would contrive a falsehood to endanger my own soul or that one bound by the most sacred oaths to the contraryone such as i who have but one longing wish connected with earth to wit the rebuilding of our christian zionwould betray the secrets of the confessional both are alike abhorrent to my very soul  so answered the king thou art that hermit of whom men speak so much thou art i confess like enough to those spirits which walk in dry places but richard fears no hobgoblins and thou art he too as i bethink me to whom the christian princes sent this very criminal to open a communication with the soldan even while i who ought to have been first consulted lay on my sickbed thou and they may content themselvesi will not put my neck into the loop of a carmelites girdle and for your envoy he shall die the rather and the sooner that thou dost entreat for him  now god be gracious to thee lord king said the hermit with much emotion thou art setting that mischief on foot which thou wilt hereafter wish thou hadst stopped though it had cost thee a limb rash blinded man yet forbear  away away cried the king stamping the sun has risen on the dishonour of england and it is not yet avengedladies and priest withdraw if you would not hear orders which would displease you for by st george i swear  swear not said the voice of one who had just then entered the pavilion  ha my learned hakim said the king come i hope to tax our generosity  i come to request instant speech with youinstantand touching matters of deep interest  first look on my wife hakim and let her know in you the preserver of her husband  it is not for me said the physician folding his arms with an air of oriental modesty and reverence and bending his eyes on the groundit is not for me to look upon beauty unveiled and armed in its splendours  retire then berengaria said the monarch and edith do you retire alsonay renew not your importunities this i give to them that the execution shall not be till high noon go and be pacifieddearest berengaria begoneedith he added with a glance which struck terror even into the courageous soul of his kinswoman go if you are wise  the females withdrew or rather hurried from the tent rank and ceremony forgotten much like a flock of wildfowl huddled together against whom the falcon has made a recent stoop  they returned from thence to the queens pavilion to indulge in regrets and recriminations equally unavailing edith was the only one who seemed to disdain these ordinary channels of sorrow without a sigh without a tear without a word of upbraiding she attended upon the queen whose weak temperament showed her sorrow in violent hysterical ecstasies and passionate hypochondriacal effusions in the course of which edith sedulously and even affectionately attended her  it is impossible she can have loved this knight said florise to calista her senior in attendance upon the queens person we have been mistaken she is but sorry for his fate as for a stranger who has come to trouble on her account  hush hush answered her more experienced and more observant comrade she is of that proud house of plantagenet who never own that a hurt grieves them while they have themselves been bleeding to death under a mortal wound they have been known to bind up the scratches sustained by their more fainthearted comrades florise we have done frightfully wrong and for my own part i would buy with every jewel i have that our fatal jest had remained unacted    chapter xviii       this work desires a planetary intelligence      of jupiter and sol and those great spirits      are proud fantastical it asks great charges      to entice them from the guiding of their spheres      to wait on mortals             albumazar  the hermit followed the ladies from the pavilion of richard as shadow follows a beam of sunshine when the clouds are driving over the face of the sun but he turned on the threshold and held up his hand towards the king in a warning or almost a menacing posture as he said woe to him who rejects the counsel of the church and betaketh himself to the foul divan of the infidel king richard i do not yet shake the dust from my feet and depart from thy encampment the sword falls notbut it hangs but by a hair haughty monarch we shall meet again  be it so haughty priest returned richard prouder in thy goatskins than princes in purple and fine linen  the hermit vanished from the tent and the king continued addressing the arabian do the dervises of the east wise hakim use such familiarity with their princes  the dervise replied adonbec should be either a sage or a madman there is no middle course for him who wears the khirkhah literally the torn robe the habit of the dervises is so called who watches by night and fasts by day hence hath he either wisdom enough to bear himself discreetly in the presence of princes or else having no reason bestowed on him he is not responsible for his own actions  methinks our monks have adopted chiefly the latter character said richard but to the matter in what can i pleasure you my learned physician  great king said el hakim making his profound oriental obeisance let thy servant speak one word and yet live i would remind thee that thou owestnot to me their humble instrumentbut to the intelligences whose benefits i dispense to mortals a life  and i warrant me thou wouldst have another in requital ha interrupted the king  such is my humble prayer said the hakim to the great melech riceven the life of this good knight who is doomed to die and but for such fault as was committed by the sultan adam surnamed aboulbeschar or the father of all men  and thy wisdom might remind thee hakim that adam died for it said the king somewhat sternly and then began to pace the narrow space of his tent with some emotion and to talk to himself why godamercy i knew what he desired as soon as ever he entered the pavilion here is one poor life justly condemned to extinction and i a king and a soldier who have slain thousands by my command and scores with my own hand am to have no power over it although the honour of my arms of my house of my very queen hath been attainted by the culprit by saint george it makes me laugh by saint louis it reminds me of blondels tale of an enchanted castle where the destined knight was withstood successively in his purpose of entrance by forms and figures the most dissimilar but all hostile to his undertaking no sooner one sunk than another appeared wifekinswomanhermithakimeach appears in the lists as soon as the other is defeated why this is a single knight fighting against the whole melee of the tournamentha ha ha and richard laughed aloud for he had in fact begun to change his mood his resentment being usually too violent to be of long endurance  the physician meanwhile looked on him with a countenance of surprise not unmingled with contempt for the eastern people make no allowance for these mercurial changes in the temper and consider open laughter upon almost any account as derogatory to the dignity of man and becoming only to women and children at length the sage addressed the king when he saw him more composed  a doom of death should not issue from laughing lips let thy servant hope that thou hast granted him this mans life  take the freedom of a thousand captives instead said richard restore so many of thy countrymen to their tents and families and i will give the warrant instantly this mans life can avail thee nothing and it is forfeited  all our lives are forfeited said the hakim putting his hand to his cap but the great creditor is merciful and exacts not the pledge rigorously nor untimely  thou canst show me said richard no special interest thou hast to become intercessor betwixt me and the execution of justice to which i am sworn as a crowned king  thou art sworn to the dealing forth mercy as well as justice said el hakim but what thou seekest great king is the execution of thine own will and for the concern i have in this request know that many a mans life depends upon thy granting this boon  explain thy words said richard but think not to impose upon me by false pretexts  be it far from thy servant said adonbec know then that the medicine to which thou sir king and many one besides owe their recovery is a talisman composed under certain aspects of the heavens when the divine intelligences are most propitious i am but the poor administrator of its virtues i dip it in a cup of water observe the fitting hour to administer it to the patient and the potency of the draught works the cure  a most rare medicine said the king and a commodious and as it may be carried in the leechs purse would save the whole caravan of camels which they require to convey drugs and physic stuff i marvel there is any other in use  it is written answered the hakim with imperturbable gravity abuse not the steed which hath borne thee from the battle know that such talismans might indeed be framed but rare has been the number of adepts who have dared to undertake the application of their virtue severe restrictions painful observances fasts and penance are necessary on the part of the sage who uses this mode of cure and if through neglect of these preparations by his love of ease or his indulgence of sensual appetite he omits to cure at least twelve persons within the course of each moon the virtue of the divine gift departs from the amulet and both the last patient and the physician will be exposed to speedy misfortune neither will they survive the year i require yet one life to make up the appointed number  go out into the camp good hakim where thou wilt find amany said the king and do not seek to rob my headsman of his patients it is unbecoming a mediciner of thine eminence to interfere with the practice of another besides i cannot see how delivering a criminal from the death he deserves should go to make up thy tale of miraculous cures  when thou canst show why a draught of cold water should have cured thee when the most precious drugs failed said the hakim thou mayest reason on the other mysteries attendant on this matter for myself i am inefficient to the great work having this morning touched an unclean animal ask therefore no further questions it is enough that by sparing this mans life at my request you will deliver yourself great king and thy servant from a great danger  hark thee adonbec replied the king i have no objection that leeches should wrap their words in mist and pretend to derive knowledge from the stars but when you bid richard plantagenet fear that a danger will fall upon him from some idle omen or omitted ceremonial you speak to no ignorant saxon or doting old woman who foregoes her purpose because a hare crosses the path a raven croaks or a cat sneezes  i cannot hinder your doubt of my words said adonbec but yet let my lord the king grant that truth is on the tongue of his servantwill he think it just to deprive the world and every wretch who may suffer by the pains which so lately reduced him to that couch of the benefit of this most virtuous talisman rather than extend his forgiveness to one poor criminal bethink you lord king that though thou canst slay thousands thou canst not restore one man to health kings have the power of satan to torment sages that of allah to healbeware how thou hinderest the good to humanity which thou canst not thyself render thou canst cut off the head but not cure the aching tooth  this is overinsolent said the king hardening himself as the hakim assumed a more lofty and almost a commanding tone we took thee for our leech not for our counsellor or consciencekeeper  and is it thus the most renowned prince of frangistan repays benefit done to his royal person said el hakim exchanging the humble and stooping posture in which he had hitherto solicited the king for an attitude lofty and commanding know then he said that through every court of europe and asiato moslem and nazareneto knight and ladywherever harp is heard and sword wornwherever honour is loved and infamy detestedto every quarter of the worldwill i denounce thee melech ric as thankless and ungenerous and even the landsif there be any suchthat never heard of thy renown shall yet be acquainted with thy shame  are these terms to me vile infidel said richard striding up to him in fury art weary of thy life  strike said el hakim thine own deed shall then paint thee more worthless than could my words though each had a hornets sting  richard turned fiercely from him folded his arms traversed the tent as before and then exclaimed thankless and ungenerousas well be termed coward and infidel hakim thou hast chosen thy boon and though i had rather thou hadst asked my crown jewels yet i may not kinglike refuse thee take this scot therefore to thy keeping the provost will deliver him to thee on this warrant  he hastily traced one or two lines and gave them to the physician use him as thy bondslave to be disposed of as thou wiltonly let him beware how he comes before the eyes of richard hark theethou art wisehe hath been overbold among those in whose fair looks and weak judgments we trust our honour as you of the east lodge your treasures in caskets of silver wire as fine and as frail as the web of a gossamer  thy servant understands the words of the king said the sage at once resuming the reverent style of address in which he had commenced when the rich carpet is soiled the fool pointeth to the stainthe wise man covers it with his mantle i have heard my lords pleasure and to hear is to obey  it is well said the king let him consult his own safety and never appear in my presence more is there aught else in which i may do thee pleasure  the bounty of the king hath filled my cup to the brim said the sageyea it hath been abundant as the fountain which sprung up amid the camp of the descendants of israel when the rock was stricken by the rod of moussa ben amram  ay but said the king smiling it required as in the desert a hard blow on the rock ere it yielded its treasures i would that i knew something to pleasure thee which i might yield as freely as the natural fountain sends forth its waters  let me touch that victorious hand said the sage in token that if adonbec el hakim should hereafter demand a boon of richard of england he may do so yet plead his command  thou hast hand and glove upon it man replied richard only if thou couldst consistently make up thy tale of patients without craving me to deliver from punishment those who have deserved it i would more willingly discharge my debt in some other form  may thy days be multiplied answered the hakim and withdrew from the apartment after the usual deep obeisance  king richard gazed after him as he departed like one but halfsatisfied with what had passed  strange pertinacity he said in this hakim and a wonderful chance to interfere between that audacious scot and the chastisement he has merited so richly yet let him live there is one brave man the more in the world and now for the austrian ho is the baron of gilsland there without  sir thomas de vaux thus summoned his bulky form speedily darkened the opening of the pavilion while behind him glided as a spectre unannounced yet unopposed the savage form of the hermit of engaddi wrapped in his goatskin mantle  richard without noticing his presence called in a loud tone to the baron sir thomas de vaux of lanercost and gilsland take trumpet and herald and go instantly to the tent of him whom they call archduke of austria and see that it be when the press of his knights and vassals is greatest around him as is likely at this hour for the german boar breakfasts ere he hears massenter his presence with as little reverence as thou mayest and impeach him on the part of richard of england that he hath this night by his own hand or that of others stolen from its staff the banner of england wherefore say to him our pleasure that within an hour from the time of my speaking he restore the said banner with all reverencehe himself and his principal barons waiting the whilst with heads uncovered and without their robes of honour and that moreover he pitch beside it on the one hand his own banner of austria reversed as that which hath been dishonoured by theft and felony and on the other a lance bearing the bloody head of him who was his nearest counsellor or assistant in this base injury and say that such our behests being punctually discharged we will for the sake of our vow and the weal of the holy land forgive his other forfeits  and how if the duke of austria deny all accession to this act of wrong and of felony said thomas de vaux  tell him replied the king we will prove it upon his bodyay were he backed with his two bravest champions knightlike will we prove it on foot or on horse in the desert or in the field time place and arms all at his own choice  bethink you of the peace of god and the church my liege lord said the baron of gilsland among those princes engaged in this holy crusade  bethink you how to execute my commands my liege vassal answered richard impatiently methinks men expect to turn our purpose by their breath as boys blow feathers to and fro peace of the church who i prithee minds it the peace of the church among crusaders implies war with the saracens with whom the princes have made truce and the one ends with the other and besides see you not how every prince of them is seeking his own several ends i will seek mine alsoand that is honour for honour i came hither and if i may not win it upon the saracens at least i will not lose a jot from any respect to this paltry duke though he were bulwarked and buttressed by every prince in the crusade  de vaux turned to obey the kings mandate shrugging his shoulders at the same time the bluntness of his nature being unable to conceal that its tenor went against his judgment but the hermit of engaddi stepped forward and assumed the air of one charged with higher commands than those of a mere earthly potentate indeed his dress of shaggy skins his uncombed and untrimmed hair and beard his lean wild and contorted features and the almost insane fire which gleamed from under his bushy eyebrows made him approach nearly to our idea of some seer of scripture who charged with high mission to the sinful kings of judah or israel descended from the rocks and caverns in which he dwelt in abstracted solitude to abash earthly tyrants in the midst of their pride by discharging on them the blighting denunciations of divine majesty even as the cloud discharges the lightnings with which it is fraught on the pinnacles and towers of castles and palaces in the midst of his most wayward mood richard respected the church and its ministers and though offended at the intrusion of the hermit into his tent he greeted him with respectat the same time however making a sign to sir thomas de vaux to hasten on his message  but the hermit prohibited the baron by gesture look and word to stir a yard on such an errand and holding up his bare arm from which the goatskin mantle fell back in the violence of his action he waved it aloft meagre with famine and wealed with the blows of the discipline  in the name of god and of the most holy father the vicegerent of the christian church upon earth i prohibit this most profane bloodthirsty and brutal defiance betwixt two christian princes whose shoulders are signed with the blessed mark under which they swore brotherhood woe to him by whom it is brokenrichard of england recall the most unhallowed message thou hast given to that baron danger and death are nigh theethe dagger is glancing at thy very throat  danger and death are playmates to richard answered the monarch proudly and he hath braved too many swords to fear a dagger  danger and death are near replied the seer and sinking his voice to a hollow unearthly tone he added and after death the judgment  good and holy father said richard i reverence thy person and thy sanctity  reverence not me interrupted the hermit reverence sooner the vilest insect that crawls by the shores of the dead sea and feeds upon its accursed slime but reverence him whose commands i speakreverence him whose sepulchre you have vowed to rescuerevere the oath of concord which you have sworn and break not the silver cord of union and fidelity with which you have bound yourself to your princely confederates  good father said the king you of the church seem to me to presume somewhat if a layman may say so much upon the dignity of your holy character without challenging your right to take charge of our conscience methinks you might leave us the charge of our own honour  presume repeated the hermit is it for me to presume royal richard who am but the bell obeying the hand of the sextonbut the senseless and worthless trumpet carrying the command of him who sounds it see on my knees i throw myself before thee imploring thee to have mercy on christendom on england and on thyself  rise rise said richard compelling him to stand up it beseems not that knees which are so frequently bended to the deity should press the ground in honour of man what danger awaits us reverend father and when stood the power of england so low that the noisy bluster of this newmade dukes displeasure should alarm her or her monarch  i have looked forth from my mountain turret upon the starry host of heaven as each in his midnight circuit uttered wisdom to another and knowledge to the few who can understand their voice there sits an enemy in thy house of life lord king malign at once to thy fame and thy prosperityan emanation of saturn menacing thee with instant and bloody peril and which but thou yield thy proud will to the rule of thy duty will presently crush thee even in thy pride  away awaythis is heathen science said the king christians practise it notwise men believe it not old man thou dotest  i dote not richard answered the hermiti am not so happy i know my condition and that some portion of reason is yet permitted me not for my own use but that of the church and the advancement of the cross i am the blind man who holds a torch to others though it yields no light to himself ask me touching what concerns the weal of christendom and of this crusade and i will speak with thee as the wisest counsellor on whose tongue persuasion ever sat speak to me of my own wretched being and my words shall be those of the maniac outcast which i am  i would not break the bands of unity asunder among the princes of the crusade said richard with a mitigated tone and manner but what atonement can they render me for the injustice and insult which i have sustained  even of that i am prepared and commissioned to speak by the council which meeting hastily at the summons of philip of france have taken measures for that effect  strange replied richard that others should treat of what is due to the wounded majesty of england  they are willing to anticipate your demands if it be possible answered the hermit in a body they consent that the banner of england be replaced on saint georges mount and they lay under ban and condemnation the audacious criminal or criminals by whom it was outraged and will announce a princely reward to any who shall denounce the delinquents guilt and give his flesh to the wolves and ravens  and austria said richard upon whom rest such strong presumptions that he was the author of the deed  to prevent discord in the host replied the hermit austria will clear himself of the suspicion by submitting to whatsoever ordeal the patriarch of jerusalem shall impose  will he clear himself by the trial by combat said king richard  his oath prohibits it said the hermit and moreover the council of the princes  will neither authorize battle against the saracens interrupted richard nor against any one else but it is enough fatherthou hast shown me the folly of proceeding as i designed in this matter you shall sooner light your torch in a puddle of rain than bring a spark out of a coldblooded coward there is no honour to be gained on austria and so let him pass i will have him perjure himself however i will insist on the ordeal how i shall laugh to hear his clumsy fingers hiss as he grasps the redhot globe of iron ay or his huge mouth riven and his gullet swelling to suffocation as he endeavours to swallow the consecrated bread  peace richard said the hermitoh peace for shame if not for charity who shall praise or honour princes who insult and calumniate each other alas that a creature so noble as thou artso accomplished in princely thoughts and princely daringso fitted to honour christendom by thy actions and in thy calmer mood to rule her by thy wisdom should yet have the brute and wild fury of the lion mingled with the dignity and courage of that king of the forest  he remained an instant musing with his eyes fixed on the ground and then proceededbut heaven that knows our imperfect nature accepts of our imperfect obedience and hath delayed though not averted the bloody end of thy daring life the destroying angel hath stood still as of old by the threshingfloor of araunah the jebusite and the blade is drawn in his hand by which at no distant date richard the lionhearted shall be as low as the meanest peasant  must it then be so soon said richard yet even so be it may my course be bright if it be but brief  alas noble king said the solitary and it seemed as if a tear unwonted guest were gathering in his dry and glazened eye short and melancholy marked with mortification and calamity and captivity is the span that divides thee from the grave which yawns for theea grave in which thou shalt be laid without lineage to succeed theewithout the tears of a people exhausted by thy ceaseless wars to lament theewithout having extended the knowledge of thy subjectswithout having done aught to enlarge their happiness  but not without renown monknot without the tears of the lady of my love these consolations which thou canst neither know nor estimate await upon richard to his grave  do i not know can i not estimate the value of minstrels praise and of ladys love retorted the hermit in a tone which for a moment seemed to emulate the enthusiasm of richard himself king of england he continued extending his emaciated arm the blood which boils in thy blue veins is not more noble than that which stagnates in mine few and cold as the drops are they still are of the blood of the royal lusignanof the heroic and sainted godfrey i amthat is i was when in the worldalberick mortemar  whose deeds said richard have so often filled fames trumpet is it socan it be so could such a light as thine fall from the horizon of chivalry and yet men be uncertain where its embers had alighted  seek a fallen star said the hermit and thou shalt only light on some foul jelly which in shooting through the horizon has assumed for a moment an appearance of splendour richard if i thought that rending the bloody veil from my horrible fate could make thy proud heart stoop to the discipline of the church i could find in my heart to tell thee a tale which i have hitherto kept gnawing at my vitals in concealment like the selfdevoted youth of heathenesse listen then richard and may the grief and despair which cannot avail this wretched remnant of what was once a man be powerful as an example to so noble yet so wild a being as thou art yesi willi will tear open the longhidden wounds although in thy very presence they should bleed to death  king richard upon whom the history of alberick of mortemar had made a deep impression in his early years when minstrels were regaling his fathers halls with legends of the holy land listened with respect to the outlines of a tale which darkly and imperfectly sketched indicated sufficiently the cause of the partial insanity of this singular and most unhappy being  i need not he said tell thee that i was noble in birth high in fortune strong in arms wise in counsel all these i was but while the noblest ladies in palestine strove which should wind garlands for my helmet my love was fixedunalterably and devotedly fixedon a maiden of low degree her father an ancient soldier of the cross saw our passion and knowing the difference betwixt us saw no other refuge for his daughters honour than to place her within the shadow of the cloister i returned from a distant expedition loaded with spoils and honour to find my happiness was destroyed for ever i too sought the cloister and satan who had marked me for his own breathed into my heart a vapour of spiritual pride which could only have had its source in his own infernal regions i had risen as high in the church as before in the state i was forsooth the wise the selfsufficient the impeccablei was the counsellor of councilsi was the director of prelates how should i stumblewherefore should i fear temptation alas i became confessor to a sisterhood and amongst that sisterhood i found the longlovedthe longlost spare me further confessiona fallen nun whose guilt was avenged by selfmurder sleeps soundly in the vaults of engaddi while above her very grave gibbers moans and roars a creature to whom but so much reason is left as may suffice to render him completely sensible to his fate  unhappy man said richard i wonder no longer at thy misery how didst thou escape the doom which the canons denounce against thy offence  ask one who is yet in the gall of worldly bitterness said the hermit and he will speak of a life spared for personal respects and from consideration to high birth but richard i tell thee that providence hath preserved me to lift me on high as a light and beacon whose ashes when this earthly fuel is burnt out must yet be flung into tophet withered and shrunk as this poor form is it is yet animated with two spiritsone active shrewd and piercing to advocate the cause of the church of jerusalem one mean abject and despairing fluctuating between madness and misery to mourn over my own wretchedness and to guard holy relics on which it would be most sinful for me even to cast my eye pity me notit is but sin to pity the loss of such an abject pity me not but profit by my example thou standest on the highest and therefore on the most dangerous pinnacle occupied by any christian prince thou art proud of heart loose of life bloody of hand put from thee the sins which are to thee as daughtersthough they be dear to the sinful adam expel these adopted furies from thy breastthy pride thy luxury thy bloodthirstiness  he raves said richard turning from the solitary to de vaux as one who felt some pain from a sarcasm which yet he could not resent then turned him calmly and somewhat scornfully to the anchoret as he replied thou hast found a fair bevy of daughters reverend father to one who hath been but few months married but since i must put them from my roof it were but like a father to provide them with suitable matches therefore i will part with my pride to the noble canons of the churchmy luxury as thou callest it to the monks of the ruleand my bloodthirstiness to the knights of the temple  o heart of steel and hand of iron said the anchoret upon whom example as well as advice is alike thrown away yet shalt thou be spared for a season in case it so be thou shouldst turn and do that which is acceptable in the sight of heaven for me i must return to my place kyrie eleison i am he through whom the rays of heavenly grace dart like those of the sun through a burningglass concentrating them on other objects until they kindle and blaze while the glass itself remains cold and uninfluenced kyrie eleisonthe poor must be called for the rich have refused the banquetkyrie eleison  so saying he burst from the tent uttering loud cries  a mad priest said richard from whose mind the frantic exclamations of the hermit had partly obliterated the impression produced by the detail of his personal history and misfortunes after him de vaux and see he comes to no harm for crusaders as we are a juggler hath more reverence amongst our varlets than a priest or a saint and they may perchance put some scorn upon him  the knight obeyed and richard presently gave way to the thoughts which the wild prophecy of the monk had inspired to die earlywithout lineagewithout lamentation a heavy sentence and well that it is not passed by a more competent judge yet the saracens who are accomplished in mystical knowledge will often maintain that he in whose eyes the wisdom of the sage is but as folly inspires wisdom and prophecy into the seeming folly of the madman yonder hermit is said to read the stars too an art generally practised in these lands where the heavenly host was of yore the object of idolatry i would i had asked him touching the loss of my banner for not the blessed tishbite the founder of his order could seem more wildly rapt out of himself or speak with a tongue more resembling that of a prophethow now de vaux what news of the mad priest  mad priest call you him my lord answered de vaux methinks he resembles more the blessed baptist himself just issued from the wilderness he has placed himself on one of the military engines and from thence he preaches to the soldiers as never man preached since the time of peter the hermit the camp alarmed by his cries crowd around him in thousands and breaking off every now and then from the main thread of his discourse he addresses the several nations each in their own language and presses upon each the arguments best qualified to urge them to perseverance in the delivery of palestine  by this light a noble hermit said king richard but what else could come from the blood of godfrey he despair of safety because he hath in former days lived par amours i will have the pope send him an ample remission and i would not less willingly be intercessor had his belle amie been an abbess  as he spoke the archbishop of tyre craved audience for the purpose of requesting richards attendance should his health permit on a secret conclave of the chiefs of the crusade and to explain to him the military and political incidents which had occurred during his illness    chapter xix       must we then sheathe our still victorious sword      turn back our forward step which ever trod      oer foemens necks the onward path of glory      unclasp the mail which with a solemn vow      in gods own house we hung upon our shoulders      that vow as unaccomplishd as the promise      which village nurses make to still their children      and after think no more of            the crusade a tragedy  the archbishop of tyre was an emissary well chosen to communicate to richard tidings which from another voice the lionhearted king would not have brooked to hear without the most unbounded explosions of resentment even this sagacious and reverend prelate found difficulty in inducing him to listen to news which destroyed all his hopes of gaining back the holy sepulchre by force of arms and acquiring the renown which the universal allhail of christendom was ready to confer upon him as the champion of the cross  but by the archbishops report it appeared that saladin was assembling all the force of his hundred tribes and that the monarchs of europe already disgusted from various motives with the expedition which had proved so hazardous and was daily growing more so had resolved to abandon their purpose in this they were countenanced by the example of philip of france who with many protestations of regard and assurances that he would first see his brother of england in safety declared his intention to return to europe his great vassal the earl of champagne had adopted the same resolution and it could not excite surprise that leopold of austria affronted as he had been by richard was glad to embrace an opportunity of deserting a cause in which his haughty opponent was to be considered as chief others announced the same purpose so that it was plain that the king of england was to be left if he chose to remain supported only by such volunteers as might under such depressing circumstances join themselves to the english army and by the doubtful aid of conrade of montserrat and the military orders of the temple and of saint john who though they were sworn to wage battle against the saracens were at least equally jealous of any european monarch achieving the conquest of palestine where with shortsighted and selfish policy they proposed to establish independent dominions of their own  it needed not many arguments to show richard the truth of his situation and indeed after his first burst of passion he sat him calmly down and with gloomy looks head depressed and arms folded on his bosom listened to the archbishops reasoning on the impossibility of his carrying on the crusade when deserted by his companions nay he forbore interruption even when the prelate ventured in measured terms to hint that richards own impetuosity had been one main cause of disgusting the princes with the expedition  confiteor answered richard with a dejected look and something of a melancholy smilei confess reverend father that i ought on some accounts to sing culpa mea but is it not hard that my frailties of temper should be visited with such a penancethat for a burst or two of natural passion i should be doomed to see fade before me ungathered such a rich harvest of glory to god and honour to chivalry but it shall not fade by the soul of the conqueror i will plant the cross on the towers of jerusalem or it shall be planted over richards grave  thou mayest do it said the prelate yet not another drop of christian blood be shed in the quarrel  ah you speak of compromise lord prelate but the blood of the infidel hounds must also cease to flow said richard  there will be glory enough replied the archbishop in having extorted from saladin by force of arms and by the respect inspired by your fame such conditions as at once restore the holy sepulchre open the holy land to pilgrims secure their safety by strong fortresses and stronger than all assure the safety of the holy city by conferring on richard the title of king guardian of jerusalem  how said richard his eyes sparkling with unusual light iii the king guardian of the holy city victory itself but that it is victory could not gain morescarce so much when won with unwilling and disunited forces but saladin still proposes to retain his interest in the holy land  as a joint sovereign the sworn ally replied the prelate of the mighty richardhis relative if it may be permitted by marriage  by marriage said richard surprised yet less so than the prelate had expected haayedith plantagenet did i dream this or did some one tell me my head is still weak from this fever and has been agitated was it the scot or the hakim or yonder holy hermit that hinted such a wild bargain  the hermit of engaddi most likely said the archbishop for he hath toiled much in this matter and since the discontent of the princes has became apparent and a separation of their forces unavoidable he hath had many consultations both with christian and pagan for arranging such a pacification as may give to christendom at least in part the objects of this holy warfare  my kinswoman to an infidelha exclaimed richard as his eyes began to sparkle  the prelate hastened to avert his wrath  the popes consent must doubtless be first attained and the holy hermit who is well known at rome will treat with the holy father  howwithout our consent first given said the king  surely no said the bishop in a quieting and insinuating tone of voiceonly with and under your especial sanction  my sanction to marry my kinswoman to an infidel said richard yet he spoke rather in a tone of doubt than as distinctly reprobating the measure proposed could i have dreamed of such a composition when i leaped upon the syrian shore from the prow of my galley even as a lion springs on his prey and nowbut proceedi will hear with patience  equally delighted and surprised to find his task so much easier than he had apprehended the archbishop hastened to pour forth before richard the instances of such alliances in spainnot without countenance from the holy see the incalculable advantages which all christendom would derive from the union of richard and saladin by a bond so sacred and above all he spoke with great vehemence and unction on the probability that saladin would in case of the proposed alliance exchange his false faith for the true one  hath the soldan shown any disposition to become christian said richard if so the king lives not on earth to whom i would grant the hand of a kinswoman ay or sister sooner than to my noble saladinay though the one came to lay crown and sceptre at her feet and the other had nothing to offer but his good sword and better heart  saladin hath heard our christian teachers said the bishop somewhat evasivelymy unworthy self and othersand as he listens with patience and replies with calmness it can hardly be but that he be snatched as a brand from the burning magna est veritas et prevalebit moreover the hermit of engaddi few of whose words have fallen fruitless to the ground is possessed fully with the belief that there is a calling of the saracens and the other heathen approaching to which this marriage shall be matter of induction he readeth the course of the stars and dwelling with maceration of the flesh in those divine places which the saints have trodden of old the spirit of elijah the tishbite the founder of his blessed order hath been with him as it was with the prophet elisha the son of shaphat when he spread his mantle over him  king richard listened to the prelates reasoning with a downcast brow and a troubled look  i cannot tell he said how it is with me but methinks these cold counsels of the princes of christendom have infected me too with a lethargy of spirit the time hath been that had a layman proposed such alliance to me i had struck him to earthif a churchman i had spit at him as a renegade and priest of baal yet now this counsel sounds not so strange in mine ear for why should i not seek for brotherhood and alliance with a saracen brave just generouswho loves and honours a worthy foe as if he were a friendwhilst the princes of christendom shrink from the side of their allies and forsake the cause of heaven and good knighthood but i will possess my patience and will not think of them only one attempt will i make to keep this gallant brotherhood together if it be possible and if i fail lord archbishop we will speak together of thy counsel which as now i neither accept nor altogether reject wend we to the council my lordthe hour calls us thou sayest richard is hasty and proudthou shalt see him humble himself like the lowly broomplant from which he derives his surname  with the assistance of those of his privy chamber the king then hastily robed himself in a doublet and mantle of a dark and uniform colour and without any mark of regal dignity excepting a ring of gold upon his head he hastened with the archbishop of tyre to attend the council which waited but his presence to commence its sitting  the pavilion of the council was an ample tent having before it the large banner of the cross displayed and another on which was portrayed a female kneeling with dishevelled hair and disordered dress meant to represent the desolate and distressed church of jerusalem and bearing the motto afflictae sponsae ne obliviscaris warders carefully selected kept every one at a distance from the neighbourhood of this tent lest the debates which were sometimes of a loud and stormy character should reach other ears than those they were designed for  here therefore the princes of the crusade were assembled awaiting richards arrival and even the brief delay which was thus interposed was turned to his disadvantage by his enemies various instances being circulated of his pride and undue assumption of superiority of which even the necessity of the present short pause was quoted as an instance men strove to fortify each other in their evil opinion of the king of england and vindicated the offence which each had taken by putting the most severe construction upon circumstances the most trifling and all this perhaps because they were conscious of an instinctive reverence for the heroic monarch which it would require more than ordinary efforts to overcome  they had settled accordingly that they should receive him on his entrance with slight notice and no more respect than was exactly necessary to keep within the bounds of cold ceremonial but when they beheld that noble form that princely countenance somewhat pale from his late illnessthe eye which had been called by minstrels the bright star of battle and victorywhen his feats almost surpassing human strength and valour rushed on their recollection the council of princes simultaneously aroseeven the jealous king of france and the sullen and offended duke of austriaarose with one consent and the assembled princes burst forth with one voice in the acclamation god save king richard of england long life to the valiant lionsheart  with a countenance frank and open as the summer sun when it rises richard distributed his thanks around and congratulated himself on being once more among his royal brethren of the crusade  some brief words he desired to say such was his address to the assembly though on a subject so unworthy as himself even at the risk of delaying for a few minutes their consultations for the weal of christendom and the advancement of their holy enterprise  the assembled princes resumed their seats and there was a profound silence  this day continued the king of england is a high festival of the church and it well becomes christian men at such a tide to reconcile themselves with their brethren and confess their faults to each other noble princes and fathers of this holy expedition richard is a soldierhis hand is ever readier than his tongueand his tongue is but too much used to the rough language of his trade but do not for plantagenets hasty speeches and illconsidered actions forsake the noble cause of the redemption of palestinedo not throw away earthly renown and eternal salvation to be won here if ever they can be won by man because the act of a soldier may have been hasty and his speech as hard as the iron which he has worn from childhood is richard in default to any of you richard will make compensation both by word and actionnoble brother of france have i been so unlucky as to offend you  the majesty of france has no atonement to seek from that of england answered philip with kingly dignity accepting at the same time the offered hand of richard and whatever opinion i may adopt concerning the prosecution of this enterprise will depend on reasons arising out of the state of my own kingdomcertainly on no jealousy or disgust at my royal and most valorous brother  austria said richard walking up to the archduke with a mixture of frankness and dignity while leopold arose from his seat as if involuntarily and with the action of an automaton whose motions depended upon some external impulseaustria thinks he hath reason to be offended with england england that he hath cause to complain of austria let them exchange forgiveness that the peace of europe and the concord of this host may remain unbroken we are now joint supporters of a more glorious banner than ever blazed before an earthly prince even the banner of salvation let not therefore strife be betwixt us for the symbol of our more worldly dignities but let leopold restore the pennon of england if he has it in his power and richard will say though from no motive save his love for holy church that he repents him of the hasty mood in which he did insult the standard of austria  the archduke stood still sullen and discontented with his eyes fixed on the floor and his countenance lowering with smothered displeasure which awe mingled with awkwardness prevented his giving vent to in words  the patriarch of jerusalem hastened to break the embarrassing silence and to bear witness for the archduke of austria that he had exculpated himself by a solemn oath from all knowledge direct or indirect of the aggression done to the banner of england  then we have done the noble archduke the greater wrong said richard and craving his pardon for imputing to him an outrage so cowardly we extend our hand to him in token of renewed peace and amity but how is this austria refuses our uncovered hand as he formerly refused our mailed glove what are we neither to be his mate in peace nor his antagonist in war well let it be so we will take the slight esteem in which he holds us as a penance for aught which we may have done against him in heat of blood and will therefore hold the account between us cleared  so saying he turned from the archduke with an air rather of dignity than scorn leaving the austrian apparently as much relieved by the removal of his eye as is a sullen and truant schoolboy when the glance of his severe pedagogue is withdrawn  noble earl of champagneprincely marquis of montserratvaliant grand master of the templarsi am here a penitent in the confessional do any of you bring a charge or claim amends from me  i know not on what we could ground any said the smoothtongued conrade unless it were that the king of england carries off from his poor brothers of the war all the fame which they might have hoped to gain in the expedition  my charge if i am called on to make one said the master of the templars is graver and deeper than that of the marquis of montserrat it may be thought ill to beseem a military monk such as i to raise his voice where so many noble princes remain silent but it concerns our whole host and not least this noble king of england that he should hear from some one to his face those charges which there are enow to bring against him in his absence we laud and honour the courage and high achievements of the king of england but we feel aggrieved that he should on all occasions seize and maintain a precedence and superiority over us which it becomes not independent princes to submit to much we might yield of our free will to his bravery his zeal his wealth and his power but he who snatches all as matter of right and leaves nothing to grant out of courtesy and favour degrades us from allies into retainers and vassals and sullies in the eyes of our soldiers and subjects the lustre of our authority which is no longer independently exercised since the royal richard has asked the truth from us he must neither be surprised nor angry when he hears one to whom worldly pomp is prohibited and secular authority is nothing saving so far as it advances the prosperity of gods temple and the prostration of the lion which goeth about seeking whom he may devourwhen he hears i say such a one as i tell him the truth in reply to his question which truth even while i speak it is i know confirmed by the heart of every one who hears me however respect may stifle their voices  richard coloured very highly while the grand master was making this direct and unvarnished attack upon his conduct and the murmur of assent which followed it showed plainly that almost all who were present acquiesced in the justice of the accusation incensed and at the same time mortified he yet foresaw that to give way to his headlong resentment would be to give the cold and wary accuser the advantage over him which it was the templars principal object to obtain he therefore with a strong effort remained silent till he had repeated a pater noster being the course which his confessor had enjoined him to pursue when anger was likely to obtain dominion over him the king then spoke with composure though not without an embittered tone especially at the outset  and is it even so and are our brethren at such pains to note the infirmities of our natural temper and the rough precipitance of our zeal which may sometimes have urged us to issue commands when there was little time to hold council i could not have thought that offences casual and unpremeditated like mine could find such deep root in the hearts of my allies in this most holy cause that for my sake they should withdraw their hands from the plough when the furrow was near the endfor my sake turn aside from the direct path to jerusalem which their swords have opened i vainly thought that my small services might have outweighed my rash errorsthat if it were remembered that i pressed to the van in an assault it would not be forgotten that i was ever the last in the retreatthat if i elevated my banner upon conquered fields of battle it was all the advantage that i sought while others were dividing the spoil i may have called the conquered city by my name but it was to others that i yielded the dominion if i have been headstrong in urging bold counsels i have not methinks spared my own blood or my peoples in carrying them into as bold execution or if i have in the hurry of march or battle assumed a command over the soldiers of others such have been ever treated as my own when my wealth purchased the provisions and medicines which their own sovereigns could not procure but it shames me to remind you of what all but myself seem to have forgotten let us rather look forward to our future measures and believe me brethren he continued his face kindling with eagerness you shall not find the pride or the wrath or the ambition of richard a stumblingblock of offence in the path to which religion and glory summon you as with the trumpet of an archangel oh no no never would i survive the thought that my frailties and infirmities had been the means to sever this goodly fellowship of assembled princes i would cut off my left hand with my right could my doing so attest my sincerity i will yield up voluntarily all right to command in the hosteven mine own liege subjects they shall be led by such sovereigns as you may nominate and their king ever but too apt to exchange the leaders baton for the adventurers lance will serve under the banner of beauseant among the templarsay or under that of austria if austria will name a brave man to lead his forces or if ye are yourselves aweary of this war and feel your armour chafe your tender bodies leave but with richard some ten or fifteen thousand of your soldiers to work out the accomplishment of your vow and when zion is won he exclaimed waving his hand aloft as if displaying the standard of the cross over jerusalemwhen zion is won we will write upon her gates not the name of richard plantagenet but of those generous princes who entrusted him with the means of conquest  the rough eloquence and determined expression of the military monarch at once roused the drooping spirits of the crusaders reanimated their devotion and fixing their attention on the principal object of the expedition made most of them who were present blush for having been moved by such petty subjects of complaint as had before engrossed them eye caught fire from eye voice lent courage to voice they resumed as with one accord the warcry with which the sermon of peter the hermit was echoed back and shouted aloud lead us on gallant lionsheart none so worthy to lead where brave men follow lead us onto jerusalemto jerusalem it is the will of godit is the will of god blessed is he who shall lend an arm to its fulfilment  the shout so suddenly and generally raised was heard beyond the ring of sentinels who guarded the pavilion of council and spread among the soldiers of the host who inactive and dispirited by disease and climate had begun like their leaders to droop in resolution but the reappearance of richard in renewed vigour and the wellknown shout which echoed from the assembly of the princes at once rekindled their enthusiasm and thousands and tens of thousands answered with the same shout of zion zion war war instant battle with the infidels it is the will of godit is the will of god  the acclamations from without increased in their turn the enthusiasm which prevailed within the pavilion those who did not actually catch the flame were afraidat least for the timeto seem colder than others there was no more speech except of a proud advance towards jerusalem upon the expiry of the truce and the measures to be taken in the meantime for supplying and recruiting the army the council broke up all apparently filled with the same enthusiastic purposewhich however soon faded in the bosom of most and never had an existence in that of others  of the latter class were the marquis conrade and the grand master of the templars who retired together to their quarters ill at ease and malcontent with the events of the day  i ever told it to thee said the latter with the cold sardonic expression peculiar to him that richard would burst through the flimsy wiles you spread for him as would a lion through a spiders web thou seest he has but to speak and his breath agitates these fickle fools as easily as the whirlwind catcheth scattered straws and sweeps them together or disperses them at its pleasure  when the blast has passed away said conrade the straws which it made dance to its pipe will settle to earth again  but knowest thou not besides said the templar that it seems if this new purpose of conquest shall be abandoned and pass away and each mighty prince shall again be left to such guidance as his own scanty brain can supply richard may yet probably become king of jerusalem by compact and establish those terms of treaty with the soldan which thou thyself thoughtst him so likely to spurn at  now by mahound and termagaunt for christian oaths are out of fashion said conrade sayest thou the proud king of england would unite his blood with a heathen soldan my policy threw in that ingredient to make the whole treaty an abomination to him as bad for us that he become our master by an agreement as by victory  thy policy hath ill calculated richards digestion answered the templar i know his mind by a whisper from the archbishop and then thy masterstroke respecting yonder bannerit has passed off with no more respect than two cubits of embroidered silk merited marquis conrade thy wit begins to halt i will trust thy finespun measures no longer but will try my own knowest thou not the people whom the saracens call charegites  surely answered the marquis they are desperate and besotted enthusiasts who devote their lives to the advancement of religionsomewhat like templars only they are never known to pause in the race of their calling  jest not answered the scowling monk know that one of these men has set down in his bloody vow the name of the island emperor yonder to be hewn down as the chief enemy of the moslem faith  a most judicious paynim said conrade may mohammed send him his paradise for a reward  he was taken in the camp by one of our squires and in private examination frankly avowed his fixed and determined purpose to me said the grand master  now the heavens pardon them who prevented the purpose of this most judicious charegite answered conrade  he is my prisoner added the templar and secluded from speech with others as thou mayest suppose but prisons have been broken  chains left unlocked and captives have escaped answered the marquis it is an ancient saying no sure dungeon but the grave  when loose he resumes his quest continued the military priest for it is the nature of this sort of blood hound never to quit the suit of the prey he has once scented  say no more of it said the marquis i see thy policyit is dreadful but the emergency is imminent  i only told thee of it said the templar that thou mayest keep thyself on thy guard for the uproar will be dreadful and there is no knowing on whom the english may vent their rage ay and there is another risk my page knows the counsels of this charegite he continued and moreover he is a peevish selfwilled fool whom i would i were rid of as he thwarts me by presuming to see with his own eyes not mine but our holy order gives me power to put a remedy to such inconvenience or staythe saracen may find a good dagger in his cell and i warrant you he uses it as he breaks forth which will be of a surety so soon as the page enters with his food  it will give the affair a colour said conrade and yet  yet and but said the templar are words for fools wise men neither hesitate nor retractthey resolve and they execute    chapter xx       when beauty leads the lion in her toils      such are her charms he dare not raise his mane      far less expand the terror of his fangs      so great alcides made his club a distaff      and spun to please fair omphale                anonymous  richard the unsuspicious object of the dark treachery detailed in the closing part of the last chapter having effected for the present at least the triumphant union of the crusading princes in a resolution to prosecute the war with vigour had it next at heart to establish tranquillity in his own family and now that he could judge more temperately to inquire distinctly into the circumstances leading to the loss of his banner and the nature and the extent of the connection betwixt his kinswoman edith and the banished adventurer from scotland  accordingly the queen and her household were startled with a visit from sir thomas de vaux requesting the present attendance of the lady calista of montfaucon the queens principal bowerwoman upon king richard  what am i to say madam said the trembling attendant to the queen he will slay us all  nay fear not madam said de vaux his majesty hath spared the life of the scottish knight who was the chief offender and bestowed him upon the moorish physician he will not be severe upon a lady though faulty  devise some cunning tale wench said berengaria my husband hath too little time to make inquiry into the truth  tell the tale as it really happened said edith lest i tell it for thee  with humble permission of her majesty said de vaux i would say lady edith adviseth well for although king richard is pleased to believe what it pleases your grace to tell him yet i doubt his having the same deference for the lady calista and in this especial matter  the lord of gilsland is right said the lady calista much agitated at the thoughts of the investigation which was to take place and besides if i had presence of mind enough to forge a plausible story beshrew me if i think i should have the courage to tell it  in this candid humour the lady calista was conducted by de vaux to the king and made as she had proposed a full confession of the decoy by which the unfortunate knight of the leopard had been induced to desert his post exculpating the lady edith who she was aware would not fail to exculpate herself and laying the full burden on the queen her mistress whose share of the frolic she well knew would appear the most venial in the eyes of coeur de lion in truth richard was a fond almost a uxorious husband the first burst of his wrath had long since passed away and he was not disposed severely to censure what could not now be amended the wily lady calista accustomed from her earliest childhood to fathom the intrigues of a court and watch the indications of a sovereigns will hastened back to the queen with the speed of a lapwing charged with the kings commands that she should expect a speedy visit from him to which the bowerlady added a commentary founded on her own observation tending to show that richard meant just to preserve so much severity as might bring his royal consort to repent of her frolic and then to extend to her and all concerned his gracious pardon  sits the wind in that corner wench said the queen much relieved by this intelligence believe me that great commander as he is richard will find it hard to circumvent us in this matter and that as the pyrenean shepherds are wont to say in my native navarre many a one comes for wool and goes back shorn  having possessed herself of all the information which calista could communicate the royal berengaria arrayed herself in her most becoming dress and awaited with confidence the arrival of the heroic richard  he arrived and found himself in the situation of a prince entering an offending province in the confidence that his business will only be to inflict rebuke and receive submission when he unexpectedly finds it in a state of complete defiance and insurrection berengaria well knew the power of her charms and the extent of richards affection and felt assured that she could make her own terms good now that the first tremendous explosion of his anger had expended itself without mischief far from listening to the kings intended rebuke as what the levity of her conduct had justly deserved she extenuated nay defended as a harmless frolic that which she was accused of she denied indeed with many a pretty form of negation that she had directed nectabanus absolutely to entice the knight farther than the brink of the mount on which he kept watchand indeed this was so far true that she had not designed sir kenneth to be introduced into her tentand then eloquent in urging her own defence the queen was far more so in pressing upon richard the charge of unkindness in refusing her so poor a boon as the life of an unfortunate knight who by her thoughtless prank had been brought within the danger of martial law she wept and sobbed while she enlarged on her husbands obduracy on this score as a rigour which had threatened to make her unhappy for life whenever she should reflect that she had given unthinkingly the remote cause for such a tragedy the vision of the slaughtered victim would have haunted her dreamsnay for aught she knew since such things often happened his actual spectre might have stood by her waking couch to all this misery of the mind was she exposed by the severity of one who while he pretended to dote upon her slightest glance would not forego one act of poor revenge though the issue was to render her miserable  all this flow of female eloquence was accompanied with the usual arguments of tears and sighs and uttered with such tone and action as seemed to show that the queens resentment arose neither from pride nor sullenness but from feelings hurt at finding her consequence with her husband less than she had expected to possess  the good king richard was considerably embarrassed he tried in vain to reason with one whose very jealousy of his affection rendered her incapable of listening to argument nor could he bring himself to use the restraint of lawful authority to a creature so beautiful in the midst of her unreasonable displeasure he was therefore reduced to the defensive endeavoured gently to chide her suspicions and soothe her displeasure and recalled to her mind that she need not look back upon the past with recollections either of remorse or supernatural fear since sir kenneth was alive and well and had been bestowed by him upon the great arabian physician who doubtless of all men knew best how to keep him living but this seemed the unkindest cut of all and the queens sorrow was renewed at the idea of a saracena medicinerobtaining a boon for which with bare head and on bended knee she had petitioned her husband in vain at this new charge richards patience began rather to give way and he said in a serious tone of voice berengaria the physician saved my life if it is of value in your eyes you will not grudge him a higher recompense than the only one i could prevail on him to accept  the queen was satisfied she had urged her coquettish displeasure to the verge of safety  my richard she said why brought you not that sage to me that englands queen might show how she esteemed him who could save from extinction the lamp of chivalry the glory of england and the light of poor berengarias life and hope  in a word the matrimonial dispute was ended but that some penalty might be paid to justice both king and queen accorded in laying the whole blame on the agent nectabanus who the queen being by this time well weary of the poor dwarfs humour was with his royal consort guenevra sentenced to be banished from the court and the unlucky dwarf only escaped a supplementary whipping from the queens assurances that he had already sustained personal chastisement it was decreed further that as an envoy was shortly to be dispatched to saladin acquainting him with the resolution of the council to resume hostilities so soon as the truce was ended and as richard proposed to send a valuable present to the soldan in acknowledgment of the high benefit he had derived from the services of el hakim the two unhappy creatures should be added to it as curiosities which from their extremely grotesque appearance and the shattered state of their intellect were gifts that might well pass between sovereign and sovereign  richard had that day yet another female encounter to sustain but he advanced to it with comparative indifference for edith though beautiful and highly esteemed by her royal relativenay although she had from his unjust suspicions actually sustained the injury of which berengaria only affected to complainstill was neither richards wife nor mistress and he feared her reproaches less although founded in reason than those of the queen though unjust and fantastical having requested to speak with her apart he was ushered into her apartment adjoining that of the queen whose two female coptish slaves remained on their knees in the most remote corner during the interview a thin black veil extended its ample folds over the tall and graceful form of the highborn maiden and she wore not upon her person any female ornament of what kind soever she arose and made a low reverence when richard entered resumed her seat at his command and when he sat down beside her waited without uttering a syllable until he should communicate his pleasure  richard whose custom it was to be familiar with edith as their relationship authorized felt this reception chilling and opened the conversation with some embarrassment  our fair cousin he at length said is angry with us and we own that strong circumstances have induced us without cause to suspect her of conduct alien to what we have ever known in her course of life but while we walk in this misty valley of humanity men will mistake shadows for substances can my fair cousin not forgive her somewhat vehement kinsman richard  who can refuse forgiveness to richard answered edith provided richard can obtain pardon of the king  come my kinswoman replied coeur de lion this is all too solemn by our lady such a melancholy countenance and this ample sable veil might make men think thou wert a newmade widow or had lost a betrothed lover at least cheer up thou hast heard doubtless that there is no real cause for woe why then keep up the form of mourning  for the departed honour of plantagenetfor the glory which hath left my fathers house  richard frowned departed honour glory which hath left our house he repeated angrily but my cousin edith is privileged i have judged her too hastily she has therefore a right to deem of me too harshly but tell me at least in what i have faulted  plantagenet said edith should have either pardoned an offence or punished it it misbecomes him to assign free men christians and brave knights to the fetters of the infidels it becomes him not to compromise and barter or to grunt life under the forfeiture of liberty to have doomed the unfortunate to death might have been severity but had a show of justice to condemn him to slavery and exile was barefaced tyranny  i see my fair cousin said richard you are of those pretty ones who think an absent lover as bad as none or as a dead one be patient half a score of light horsemen may yet follow and redeem the error if thy gallant have in keeping any secret which might render his death more convenient than his banishment  peace with thy scurrile jests answered edith colouring deeply think rather that for the indulgence of thy mood thou hast lopped from this great enterprise one goodly limb deprived the cross of one of its most brave supporters and placed a servant of the true god in the hands of the heathen hast given too to minds as suspicious as thou hast shown thine own in this matter some right to say that richard coeur de lion banished the bravest soldier in his camp lest his name in battle might match his own  ii exclaimed richard now indeed greatly movedam i one to be jealous of renown i would he were here to profess such an equality i would waive my rank and my crown and meet him manlike in the lists that it might appear whether richard plantagenet had room to fear or to envy the prowess of mortal man come edith thou thinkst not as thou sayest let not anger or grief for the absence of thy lover make thee unjust to thy kinsman who notwithstanding all thy techiness values thy good report as high as that of any one living  the absence of my lover said the lady edith but yes he may be well termed my lover who hath paid so dear for the title unworthy as i might be of such homage i was to him like a light leading him forward in the noble path of chivalry but that i forgot my rank or that he presumed beyond his is false were a king to speak it  my fair cousin said richard do not put words in my mouth which i have not spoken i said not you had graced this man beyond the favour which a good knight may earn even from a princess whatever be his native condition but by our lady i know something of this lovegear it begins with mute respect and distant reverence but when opportunities occur familiarity increases and sobut it skills not talking with one who thinks herself wiser than all the world  my kinsmans counsels i willingly listen to when they are such said edith as convey no insult to my rank and character  kings my fair cousin do not counsel but rather command said richard  soldans do indeed command said edith but it is because they have slaves to govern  come you might learn to lay aside this scorn of soldanrie when you hold so high of a scot said the king i hold saladin to be truer to his word than this william of scotland who must needs be called a lion forsooth he hath foully faulted towards me in failing to send the auxiliary aid he promised let me tell thee edith thou mayest live to prefer a true turk to a false scot  nonever answered edithnot should richard himself embrace the false religion which he crossed the seas to expel from palestine  thou wilt have the last word said richard and thou shalt have it even think of me what thou wilt pretty edith i shall not forget that we are near and dear cousins  so saying he took his leave in fair fashion but very little satisfied with the result of his visit  it was the fourth day after sir kenneth had been dismissed from the camp and king richard sat in his pavilion enjoying an evening breeze from the west which with unusual coolness on her wings seemed breathed from merry england for the refreshment of her adventurous monarch as he was gradually recovering the full strength which was necessary to carry on his gigantic projects there was no one with him de vaux having been sent to ascalon to bring up reinforcements and supplies of military munition and most of his other attendants being occupied in different departments all preparing for the reopening of hostilities and for a grand preparatory review of the army of the crusaders which was to take place the next day the king sat listening to the busy hum among the soldiery the clatter from the forges where horseshoes were preparing and from the tents of the armourers who were repairing harness the voice of the soldiers too as they passed and repassed was loud and cheerful carrying with its very tone an assurance of high and excited courage and an omen of approaching victory while richards ear drank in these sounds with delight and while he yielded himself to the visions of conquest and of glory which they suggested an equerry told him that a messenger from saladin waited without  admit him instantly said the king and with due honour josceline  the english knight accordingly introduced a person apparently of no higher rank than a nubian slave whose appearance was nevertheless highly interesting he was of superb stature and nobly formed and his commanding features although almost jetblack showed nothing of negro descent he wore over his coalblack locks a milkwhite turban and over his shoulders a short mantle of the same colour open in front and at the sleeves under which appeared a doublet of dressed leopards skin reaching within a handbreadth of the knee the rest of his muscular limbs both legs and arms were bare excepting that he had sandals on his feet and wore a collar and bracelets of silver a straight broadsword with a handle of boxwood and a sheath covered with snakeskin was suspended from his waist in his right hand he held a short javelin with a broad bright steel head of a span in length and in his left he led by a leash of twisted silk and gold a large and noble staghound  the messenger prostrated himself at the same time partially uncovering his shoulders in sign of humiliation and having touched the earth with his forehead arose so far as to rest on one knee while he delivered to the king a silken napkin enclosing another of cloth of gold within which was a letter from saladin in the original arabic with a translation into normanenglish which may be modernized thus  saladin king of kings to melech ric the lion of england whereas we are informed by thy last message that thou hast chosen war rather than peace and our enmity rather than our friendship we account thee as one blinded in this matter and trust shortly to convince thee of thine error by the help of our invincible forces of the thousand tribes when mohammed the prophet of god and allah the god of the prophet shall judge the controversy betwixt us in what remains we make noble account of thee and of the gifts which thou hast sent us and of the two dwarfs singular in their deformity as ysop and mirthful as the lute of isaack and in requital of these tokens from the treasurehouse of thy bounty behold we have sent thee a nubian slave named zohauk of whom judge not by his complexion according to the foolish ones of the earth in respect the darkrinded fruit hath the most exquisite flavour know that he is strong to execute the will of his master as rustan of zablestan also he is wise to give counsel when thou shalt learn to hold communication with him for the lord of speech hath been stricken with silence betwixt the ivory walls of his palace we commend him to thy care hoping the hour may not be distant when he may render thee good service and herewith we bid thee farewell trusting that our most holy prophet may yet call thee to a sight of the truth failing which illumination our desire is for the speedy restoration of thy royal health that allah may judge between thee and us in a plain field of battle  and the missive was sanctioned by the signature and seal of the soldan  richard surveyed the nubian in silence as he stood before him his looks bent upon the ground his arms folded on his bosom with the appearance of a black marble statue of the most exquisite workmanship waiting life from the touch of a prometheus the king of england who as it was emphatically said of his successor henry the eighth loved to look upon a man was well pleased with the thews sinews and symmetry of him whom he now surveyed and questioned him in the lingua franca art thou a pagan  the slave shook his head and raising his finger to his brow crossed himself in token of his christianity then resumed his posture of motionless humility  a nubian christian doubtless said richard and mutilated of the organ of speech by these heathen dogs  the mute again slowly shook his head in token of negative pointed with his forefinger to heaven and then laid it upon his own lips  i understand thee said richard thou dost suffer under the infliction of god not by the cruelty of man canst thou clean an armour and belt and buckle it in time of need  the mute nodded and stepping towards the coat of mail which hung with the shield and helmet of the chivalrous monarch upon the pillar of the tent he handled it with such nicety of address as sufficiently to show that he fully understood the business of an armourbearer  thou art an apt and wilt doubtless be a useful knave thou shalt wait in my chamber and on my person said the king to show how much i value the gift of the royal soldan if thou hast no tongue it follows thou canst carry no tales neither provoke me to be sudden by any unfit reply  the nubian again prostrated himself till his brow touched the earth then stood erect at some paces distant as waiting for his new masters commands  nay thou shalt commence thy office presently said richard for i see a speck of rust darkening on that shield and when i shake it in the face of saladin it should be bright and unsullied as the soldans honour and mine own  a horn was winded without and presently sir henry neville entered with a packet of dispatches from england my lord he said as he delivered it  from englandour own england repeated richard in a tone of melancholy enthusiasm alas they little think how hard their sovereign has been beset by sickness and sorrowfaint friends and forward enemies then opening the dispatches he said hastily ha this comes from no peaceful landthey too have their feuds neville begone i must peruse these tidings alone and at leisure  neville withdrew accordingly and richard was soon absorbed in the melancholy details which had been conveyed to him from england concerning the factions that were tearing to pieces his native dominionsthe disunion of his brothers john and geoffrey and the quarrels of both with the high justiciary longchamp bishop of elythe oppressions practised by the nobles upon the peasantry and rebellion of the latter against their masters which had produced everywhere scenes of discord and in some instances the effusion of blood details of incidents mortifying to his pride and derogatory from his authority were intermingled with the earnest advice of his wisest and most attached counsellors that he should presently return to england as his presence offered the only hope of saving the kingdom from all the horrors of civil discord of which france and scotland were likely to avail themselves filled with the most painful anxiety richard read and again read the illomened letters compared the intelligence which some of them contained with the same facts as differently stated in others and soon became totally insensible to whatever was passing around him although seated for the sake of coolness close to the entrance of his tent and having the curtains withdrawn so that he could see and be seen by the guards and others who were stationed without  deeper in the shadow of the pavilion and busied with the task his new master had imposed sat the nubian slave with his back rather turned towards the king he had finished adjusting and cleaning the hauberk and brigandine and was now busily employed on a broad pavesse or buckler of unusual size and covered with steelplating which richard often used in reconnoitring or actually storming fortified places as a more effectual protection against missile weapons than the narrow triangular shield used on horseback this pavesse bore neither the royal lions of england nor any other device to attract the observation of the defenders of the walls against which it was advanced the care therefore of the armourer was addressed to causing its surface to shine as bright as crystal in which he seemed to be peculiarly successful beyond the nubian and scarce visible from without lay the large dog which might be termed his brother slave and which as if he felt awed by being transferred to a royal owner was couched close to the side of the mute with head and ears on the ground and his limbs and tail drawn close around and under him  while the monarch and his new attendant were thus occupied another actor crept upon the scene and mingled among the group of english yeomen about a score of whom respecting the unusually pensive posture and close occupation of their sovereign were contrary to their wont keeping a silent guard in front of his tent it was not however more vigilant than usual some were playing at games of hazard with small pebbles others spoke together in whispers of the approaching day of battle and several lay asleep their bulky limbs folded in their green mantles  amid these careless warders glided the puny form of a little old turk poorly dressed like a marabout or santon of the deserta sort of enthusiasts who sometimes ventured into the camp of the crusaders though treated always with contumely and often with violence indeed the luxury and profligate indulgence of the christian leaders had occasioned a motley concourse in their tents of musicians courtesans jewish merchants copts turks and all the varied refuse of the eastern nations so that the caftan and turban though to drive both from the holy land was the professed object of the expedition were nevertheless neither an uncommon nor an alarming sight in the camp of the crusaders when however the little insignificant figure we have described approached so nigh as to receive some interruption from the warders he dashed his dusky green turban from his head showed that his beard and eyebrows were shaved like those of a professed buffoon and that the expression of his fantastic and writhen features as well as of his little black eyes which glittered like jet was that of a crazed imagination  dance marabout cried the soldiers acquainted with the manners of these wandering enthusiasts dance or we will scourge thee with our bowstrings till thou spin as never top did under schoolboys lash thus shouted the reckless warders as much delighted at having a subject to tease as a child when he catches a butterfly or a schoolboy upon discovering a birds nest  the marabout as if happy to do their behests bounded from the earth and spun his giddy round before them with singular agility which when contrasted with his slight and wasted figure and diminutive appearance made him resemble a withered leaf twirled round and round at the pleasure of the winters breeze his single lock of hair streamed upwards from his bald and shaven head as if some genie upheld him by it and indeed it seemed as if supernatural art were necessary to the execution of the wild whirling dance in which scarce the tiptoe of the performer was seen to touch the ground amid the vagaries of his performance he flew here and there from one spot to another still approaching however though almost imperceptibly to the entrance of the royal tent so that when at length he sunk exhausted on the earth after two or three bounds still higher than those which he had yet executed he was not above thirty yards from the kings person  give him water said one yeoman they always crave a drink after their merrygoround  aha water sayest thou long allen exclaimed another archer with a most scornful emphasis on the despised element how wouldst like such beverage thyself after such a morrice dancing  the devil a waterdrop he gets here said a third we will teach the lightfooted old infidel to be a good christian and drink wine of cyprus  ay ay said a fourth and in case he be restive fetch thou dick hunters horn that he drenches his mare withal  a circle was instantly formed around the prostrate and exhausted dervise and while one tall yeoman raised his feeble form from the ground another presented to him a huge flagon of wine incapable of speech the old man shook his head and waved away from him with his hand the liquor forbidden by the prophet but his tormentors were not thus to be appeased  the horn the horn exclaimed one little difference between a turk and a turkish horse and we will use him conforming  by saint george you will choke him said long allen and besides it is a sin to throw away upon a heathen dog as much wine as would serve a good christian for a treble nightcap  thou knowest not the nature of these turks and pagans long allen replied henry woodstall i tell thee man that this flagon of cyprus will set his brains aspinning just in the opposite direction that they went whirling in the dancing and so bring him as it were to himself again choke he will no more choke on it than bens black bitch on the pound of butter  and for grudging it said tomalin blacklees why shouldst thou grudge the poor paynim devil a drop of drink on earth since thou knowest he is not to have a drop to cool the tip of his tongue through a long eternity  that were hard laws look ye said long allen only for being a turk as his father was before him had he been christian turned heathen i grant you the hottest corner had been good winter quarters for him  hold thy peace long allen said henry woodstall i tell thee that tongue of thine is not the shortest limb about thee and i prophesy that it will bring thee into disgrace with father francis as once about the blackeyed syrian wench but here comes the horn be active a bit man wilt thou and just force open his teeth with the haft of thy dudgeondagger  hold holdhe is conformable said tomalin see see he signs for the gobletgive him room boys oop sey es quoth the dutchmandown it goes like lambswool nay they are true topers when once they beginyour turk never coughs in his cup or stints in his liquoring  in fact the dervise or whatever he was drankor at least seemed to drinkthe large flagon to the very bottom at a single pull and when he took it from his lips after the whole contents were exhausted only uttered with a deep sigh the words allah kerim or god is merciful there was a laugh among the yeomen who witnessed this pottledeep potation so obstreperous as to rouse and disturb the king who raising his finger said angrily how knaves no respect no observance  all were at once hushed into silence well acquainted with the temper of richard which at some times admitted of much military familiarity and at others exacted the most precise respect although the latter humour was of much more rare occurrence hastening to a more reverent distance from the royal person they attempted to drag along with them the marabout who exhausted apparently by previous fatigue or overpowered by the potent draught he had just swallowed resisted being moved from the spot both with struggles and groans  leave him still ye fools whispered long allen to his mates by saint christopher you will make our dickon go beside himself and we shall have his dagger presently fly at our costards leave him alone in less than a minute he will sleep like a dormouse  at the same moment the monarch darted another impatient glance to the spot and all retreated in haste leaving the dervise on the ground unable as it seemed to stir a single limb or joint of his body in a moment afterward all was as still and quiet as it had been before the intrusion    chapter xxi       and witherd murder      alarumd by his sentinel the wolf      whose howls his watch thus with his stealthy pace      with tarquins ravishing strides towards his design      moves like a ghost                 macbeth  for the space of a quarter of an hour or longer after the incident related all remained perfectly quiet in the front of the royal habitation the king read and mused in the entrance of his pavilion behind and with his back turned to the same entrance the nubian slave still burnished the ample pavesse in front of all at a hundred paces distant the yeomen of the guard stood sat or lay extended on the grass attentive to their own sports but pursuing them in silence while on the esplanade betwixt them and the front of the tent lay scarcely to be distinguished from a bundle of rags the senseless form of the marabout  but the nubian had the advantage of a mirror from the brilliant reflection which the surface of the highlypolished shield now afforded by means of which he beheld to his alarm and surprise that the marabout raised his head gently from the ground so as to survey all around him moving with a welladjusted precaution which seemed entirely inconsistent with a state of ebriety he couched his head instantly as if satisfied he was unobserved and began with the slightest possible appearance of voluntary effort to drag himself as if by chance ever nearer and nearer to the king but stopping and remaining fixed at intervals like the spider which moving towards her object collapses into apparent lifelessness when she thinks she is the subject of observation this species of movement appeared suspicious to the ethiopian who on his part prepared himself as quietly as possible to interfere the instant that interference should seem to be necessary  the marabout meanwhile glided on gradually and imperceptibly serpentlike or rather snaillike till he was about ten yards distant from richards person when starting on his feet he sprung forward with the bound of a tiger stood at the kings back in less than an instant and brandished aloft the cangiar or poniard which he had hidden in his sleeve not the presence of his whole army could have saved their heroic monarch but the motions of the nubian had been as well calculated as those of the enthusiast and ere the latter could strike the former caught his uplifted arm turning his fanatical wrath upon what thus unexpectedly interposed betwixt him and his object the charegite for such was the seeming marabout dealt the nubian a blow with the dagger which however only grazed his arm while the far superior strength of the ethiopian easily dashed him to the ground aware of what had passed richard had now arisen and with little more of surprise anger or interest of any kind in his countenance than an ordinary man would show in brushing off and crushing an intrusive wasp caught up the stool on which he had been sitting and exclaiming only ha dog dashed almost to pieces the skull of the assassin who uttered twice once in a loud and once in a broken tone the words allah ackbargod is victoriousand expired at the kings feet  ye are careful warders said richard to his archers in a tone of scornful reproach as aroused by the bustle of what had passed in terror and tumult they now rushed into his tent watchful sentinels ye are to leave me to do such hangmans work with my own hand be silent all of you and cease your senseless clamoursaw ye never a dead turk before here cast that carrion out of the camp strike the head from the trunk and stick it on a lance taking care to turn the face to mecca that he may the easier tell the foul impostor on whose inspiration he came hither how he has sped on his errandfor thee my swart and silent friend he added turning to the ethiopianbut hows this thou art woundedand with a poisoned weapon i warrant me for by force of stab so weak an animal as that could scarce hope to do more than raze the lions hidesuck the poison from his wound one of youthe venom is harmless on the lips though fatal when it mingles with the blood  the yeomen looked on each other confusedly and with hesitation the apprehension of so strange a danger prevailing with those who feared no other  how now sirrahs continued the king are you daintylipped or do you fear death that you daily thus  not the death of a man said long allen to whom the king looked as he spoke but methinks i would not die like a poisoned rat for the sake of a black chattel there that is bought and sold in a market like a martlemas ox  his grace speaks to men of sucking poison muttered another yeoman as if he said go to swallow a gooseberry  nay said richard i never bade man do that which i would not do myself  and without further ceremony and in spite of the general expostulations of those around and the respectful opposition of the nubian himself the king of england applied his lips to the wound of the black slave treating with ridicule all remonstrances and overpowering all resistance he had no sooner intermitted his singular occupation than the nubian started from him and casting a scarf over his arm intimated by gestures as firm in purpose as they were respectful in manner his determination not to permit the monarch to renew so degrading an employment long allen also interposed saying that if it were necessary to prevent the king engaging again in a treatment of this kind his own lips tongue and teeth were at the service of the negro as he called the ethiopian and that he would eat him up bodily rather than king richards mouth should again approach him  neville who entered with other officers added his remonstrances  nay nay make not a needless halloo about a hart that the hounds have lost or a danger when it is over said the king the wound will be a trifle for the blood is scarce drawnan angry cat had dealt a deeper scratch and for me i have but to take a drachm of orvietan by way of precaution though it is needless   thus spoke richard a little ashamed perhaps of his own condescension though sanctioned both by humanity and gratitude but when neville continued to make remonstrances on the peril to his royal person the king imposed silence on him  peace i pritheemake no more of it i did it but to show these ignorant prejudiced knaves how they might help each other when these cowardly caitiffs come against us with sarbacanes and poisoned shafts but he added take thee this nubian to thy quarters nevillei have changed my mind touching himlet him be well cared for but hark in thine ear see that he escapes thee notthere is more in him than seems let him have all liberty so that he leave not the campand you ye beefdevouring wineswilling english mastiffs get ye to your guard again and be sure you keep it more warily think not you are now in your own land of fair play where men speak before they strike and shake hands ere they cut throats danger in our land walks openly and with his blade drawn and defies the foe whom he means to assault but here he challenges you with a silk glove instead of a steel gauntlet cuts your throat with the feather of a turtledove stabs you with the tongue of a priests brooch or throttles you with the lace of my ladys boddice go tokeep your eyes open and your mouths shutdrink less and look sharper about you or i will place your huge stomachs on such short allowance as would pinch the stomach of a patient scottish man  the yeomen abashed and mortified withdrew to their post and neville was beginning to remonstrate with his master upon the risk of passing over thus slightly their negligence upon their duty and the propriety of an example in a case so peculiarly aggravated as the permitting one so suspicious as the marabout to approach within daggers length of his person when richard interrupted him with speak not of it nevillewouldst thou have me avenge a petty risk to myself more severely than the loss of englands banner it has been stolenstolen by a thief or delivered up by a traitor and no blood has been shed for itmy sable friend thou art an expounder of mysteries saith the illustrious soldannow would i give thee thine own weight in gold if by raising one still blacker than thyself or by what other means thou wilt thou couldst show me the thief who did mine honour that wrong what sayest thou ha  the mute seemed desirous to speak but uttered only that imperfect sound proper to his melancholy condition then folded his arms looked on the king with an eye of intelligence and nodded in answer to his question  how said richard with joyful impatience wilt thou undertake to make discovery in this matter  the nubian slave repeated the same motion  but how shall we understand each other said the king canst thou write good fellow  the slave again nodded in assent  give him writingtools said the king they were readier in my fathers tent than mine but they be somewhere about if this scorching climate have not dried up the inkwhy this fellow is a jewela black diamond neville  so please you my liege said neville if i might speak my poor mind it were ill dealing in this ware this man must be a wizard and wizards deal with the enemy who hath most interest to sow tares among the wheat and bring dissension into our councils and  peace neville said richard hello to your northern hound when he is close on the haunch of the deer and hope to recall him but seek not to stop plantagenet when he hath hope to retrieve his honour  the slave who during this discussion had been writing in which art he seemed skilful now arose and pressing what he had written to his brow prostrated himself as usual ere he delivered it into the kings hands the scroll was in french although their intercourse had hitherto been conducted by richard in the lingua franca  to richard the conquering and invincible king of england this from the humblest of his slaves mysteries are the sealed caskets of heaven but wisdom may devise means to open the lock were your slave stationed where the leaders of the christian host were made to pass before him in order doubt nothing that if he who did the injury whereof my king complains shall be among the number he may be made manifest in his iniquity though it be hidden under seven veils  now by saint george said king richard thou hast spoken most opportunelyneville thou knowest that when we muster our troops tomorrow the princes have agreed that to expiate the affront offered to england in the theft of her banner the leaders should pass our new standard as it floats on saint georges mount and salute it with formal regard believe me the secret traitor will not dare to absent himself from an expurgation so solemn lest his very absence should be matter of suspicion there will we place our sable man of counsel and if his art can detect the villain leave me to deal with him  my liege said neville with the frankness of an english baron beware what work you begin here is the concord of our holy league unexpectedly renewedwill you upon such suspicion as a negro slave can instil tear open wounds so lately closed or will you use the solemn procession adopted for the reparation of your honour and establishment of unanimity amongst the discording princes as the means of again finding out new cause of offence or reviving ancient quarrels it were scarce too strong to say this were a breach of the declaration your grace made to the assembled council of the crusade  neville said the king sternly interrupting him thy zeal makes thee presumptuous and unmannerly never did i promise to abstain from taking whatever means were most promising to discover the infamous author of the attack on my honour ere i had done so i would have renounced my kingdom my life all my declarations were under this necessary and absolute qualificationonly if austria had stepped forth and owned the injury like a man i proffered for the sake of christendom to have forgiven him  but continued the baron anxiously what hope that this juggling slave of saladin will not palter with your grace  peace neville said the king thou thinkest thyself mighty wise and art but a fool mind thou my charge touching this fellow there is more in him than thy westmoreland wit can fathomand thou smart and silent prepare to perform the feat thou hast promised and by the word of a king thou shalt choose thine own recompenselo he writes again  the mute accordingly wrote and delivered to the king with the same form as before another slip of paper containing these words the will of the king is the law to his slave nor doth it become him to ask guerdon for discharge of his devoir  guerdon and devoir said the king interrupting himself as he read and speaking to neville in the english tongue with some emphasis on the words these eastern people will profit by the crusadersthey are acquiring the language of chivalry and see neville how discomposed that fellow looks were it not for his colour he would blush i should not think it strange if he understood what i saythey are perilous linguists  the poor slave cannot endure your graces eye said neville it is nothing more  well but continued the king striking the paper with his finger as he proceeded this bold scroll proceeds to say that our trusty mute is charged with a message from saladin to the lady edith plantagenet and craves means and opportunity to deliver it what thinkest thou of a request so modestha neville  i cannot say said neville how such freedom may relish with your grace but the lease of the messengers neck would be a short one who should carry such a request to the soldan on the part of your majesty  nay i thank heaven that i covet none of his sunburnt beauties said richard and for punishing this fellow for discharging his masters errand and that when he has just saved my lifemethinks it were something too summary ill tell thee neville a secret for although our sable and mute minister be present he cannot thou knowest tell it over again even if he should chance to understand us i tell thee that for this fortnight past i have been under a strange spell and i would i were disenchanted there has no sooner any one done me good service but lo you he cancels his interest in me by some deep injury and on the other hand he who hath deserved death at my hands for some treachery or some insult is sure to be the very person of all others who confers upon me some obligation that overbalances his demerits and renders respite of his sentence a debt due from my honour thus thou seest i am deprived of the best part of my royal function since i can neither punish men nor reward them until the influence of this disqualifying planet be passed away i will say nothing concerning the request of this our sable attendant save that it is an unusually bold one and that his best chance of finding grace in our eyes will be to endeavour to make the discovery which he proposes to achieve in our behalf meanwhile neville do thou look well to him and let him be honourably cared for and hark thee once more he said in a low whisper seek out yonder hermit of engaddi and bring him to me forthwith be he saint or savage madman or sane let me see him privately  neville retired from the royal tent signing to the nubian to follow him and much surprised at what he had seen and heard and especially at the unusual demeanour of the king in general no task was so easy as to discover richards immediate course of sentiment and feeling though it might in some cases be difficult to calculate its duration for no weathercock obeyed the changing wind more readily than the king his gusts of passion but on the present occasion his manner seemed unusually constrained and mysterious nor was it easy to guess whether displeasure or kindness predominated in his conduct towards his new dependant or in the looks with which from time to time he regarded him the ready service which the king had rendered to counteract the bad effects of the nubians wound might seem to balance the obligation conferred on him by the slave when he intercepted the blow of the assassin but it seemed as a much longer account remained to be arranged between them that the monarch was doubtful whether the settlement might leave him upon the whole debtor or creditor and that therefore he assumed in the meantime a neutral demeanour which might suit with either character as for the nubian by whatever means he had acquired the art of writing the european languages the king remained convinced that the english tongue at least was unknown to him since having watched him closely during the last part of the interview he conceived it impossible for any one understanding a conversation of which he was himself the subject to have so completely avoided the appearance of taking an interest in it    chapter xxii       whos thereapproachtis kindly done      my learned physician and a friend               sir eustace grey  our narrative retrogrades to a period shortly previous to the incidents last mentioned when as the reader must remember the unfortunate knight of the leopard bestowed upon the arabian physician by king richard rather as a slave than in any other capacity was exiled from the camp of the crusaders in whose ranks he had so often and so brilliantly distinguished himself he followed his new masterfor so he must now term the hakimto the moorish tents which contained his retinue and his property with the stupefied feelings of one who fallen from the summit of a precipice and escaping unexpectedly with life is just able to drag himself from the fatal spot but without the power of estimating the extent of the damage which he has sustained arrived at the tent he threw himself without speech of any kind upon a couch of dressed buffalos hide which was pointed out to him by his conductor and hiding his face betwixt his hands groaned heavily as if his heart were on the point of bursting the physician heard him as he was giving orders to his numerous domestics to prepare for their departure the next morning before daybreak and moved with compassion interrupted his occupation to sit down crosslegged by the side of his couch and administer comfort according to the oriental manner  my friend he said be of good comfort for what saith the poetit is better that a man should be the servant of a kind master than the slave of his own wild passions again be of good courage because whereas ysouf ben yagoube was sold to a king by his brethren even to pharaoh king of egypt thy king hath on the other hand bestowed thee on one who will be to thee as a brother  sir kenneth made an effort to thank the hakim but his heart was too full and the indistinct sounds which accompanied his abortive attempts to reply induced the kind physician to desist from his premature endeavours at consolation he left his new domestic or guest in quiet to indulge his sorrows and having commanded all the necessary preparations for their departure on the morning sat down upon the carpet of the tent and indulged himself in a moderate repast after he had thus refreshed himself similar viands were offered to the scottish knight but though the slaves let him understand that the next day would be far advanced ere they would halt for the purpose of refreshment sir kenneth could not overcome the disgust which he felt against swallowing any nourishment and could be prevailed upon to taste nothing saving a draught of cold water  he was awake long after his arab host had performed his usual devotions and betaken himself to his repose nor had sleep visited him at the hour of midnight when a movement took place among the domestics which though attended with no speech and very little noise made him aware they were loading the camels and preparing for departure in the course of these preparations the last person who was disturbed excepting the physician himself was the knight of scotland whom about three in the morning a sort of majordomo or master of the household acquainted that he must arise he did so without further answer and followed him into the moonlight where stood the camels most of which were already loaded and one only remained kneeling until its burden should be completed  a little apart from the camels stood a number of horses ready bridled and saddled and the hakim himself coming forth mounted on one of them with as much agility as the grave decorum of his character permitted and directed another which he pointed out to be led towards sir kenneth an english officer was in attendance to escort them through the camp of the crusaders and to ensure their leaving it in safety and all was ready for their departure the pavilion which they had left was in the meanwhile struck with singular dispatch and the tentpoles and coverings composed the burden of the last camelwhen the physician pronouncing solemnly the verse of the koran god be our guide and mohammed our protector in the desert as in the watered field the whole cavalcade was instantly in motion  in traversing the camp they were challenged by the various sentinels who maintained guard there and suffered to proceed in silence or with a muttered curse upon their prophet as they passed the post of some more zealous crusader at length the last barriers were left behind them and the party formed themselves for the march with military precaution two or three horsemen advanced in front as a vanguard one or two remained a bowshot in the rear and wherever the ground admitted others were detached to keep an outlook on the flanks in this manner they proceeded onward while sir kenneth looking back on the moonlit camp might now indeed seem banished deprived at once of honour and of liberty from the glimmering banners under which he had hoped to gain additional renown and the tented dwellings of chivalry of christianity andof edith plantagenet   the hakim who rode by his side observed in his usual tone of sententious consolation it is unwise to look back when the journey lieth forward and as he spoke the horse of the knight made such a perilous stumble as threatened to add a practical moral to the tale  the knight was compelled by this hint to give more attention to the management of his steed which more than once required the assistance and support of the checkbridle although in other respects nothing could be more easy at once and active than the ambling pace at which the animal which was a mare proceeded  the conditions of that horse observed the sententious physician are like those of human fortuneseeing that amidst his most swift and easy pace the rider must guard himself against a fall and that it is when prosperity is at the highest that our prudence should be awake and vigilant to prevent misfortune  the overloaded appetite loathes even the honeycomb and it is scarce a wonder that the knight mortified and harassed with misfortunes and abasement became something impatient of hearing his misery made at every turn the ground of proverbs and apothegms however just and apposite  methinks he said rather peevishly i wanted no additional illustration of the instability of fortune though i would thank thee sir hakim for the choice of a steed for me would the jade but stumble so effectually as at once to break my neck and her own  my brother answered the arab sage with imperturbable gravity thou speakest as one of the foolish thou sayest in thy heart that the sage should have given you as his guest the younger and better horse and reserved the old one for himself but know that the defects of the older steed may be compensated by the energies of the young rider whereas the violence of the young horse requires to be moderated by the cold temper of the older  so spoke the sage but neither to this observation did sir kenneth return any answer which could lead to a continuance of their conversation and the physician wearied perhaps of administering comfort to one who would not be comforted signed to one of his retinue  hassan he said hast thou nothing wherewith to beguile the way  hassan storyteller and poet by profession spurred up upon this summons to exercise his calling lord of the palace of life he said addressing the physician thou before whom the angel azrael spreadeth his wings for flightthou wiser than solimaun ben daoud upon whose signet was inscribed the real name which controls the spirits of the elementsforbid it heaven that while thou travellest upon the track of benevolence bearing healing and hope wherever thou comest thine own course should be saddened for lack of the tale and of the song behold while thy servant is at thy side he will pour forth the treasures of his memory as the fountain sendeth her stream beside the pathway for the refreshment or him that walketh thereon  after this exordium hassan uplifted his voice and began a tale of love and magic intermixed with feats of warlike achievement and ornamented with abundant quotations from the persian poets with whose compositions the orator seemed familiar the retinue of the physician such excepted as were necessarily detained in attendance on the camels thronged up to the narrator and pressed as close as deference for their master permitted to enjoy the delight which the inhabitants of the east have ever derived from this species of exhibition  at another time notwithstanding his imperfect knowledge of the language sir kenneth might have been interested in the recitation which though dictated by a more extravagant imagination and expressed in more inflated and metaphorical language bore yet a strong resemblance to the romances of chivalry then so fashionable in europe but as matters stood with him he was scarcely even sensible that a man in the centre of the cavalcade recited and sung in a low tone for nearly two hours modulating his voice to the various moods of passion introduced into the tale and receiving in return now low murmurs of applause now muttered expressions of wonder now sighs and tears and sometimes what it was far more difficult to extract from such an audience a tribute of smiles and even laughter  during the recitation the attention of the exile however abstracted by his own deep sorrow was occasionally awakened by the low wail of a dog secured in a wicker enclosure suspended on one of the camels which as an experienced woodsman he had no hesitation in recognizing to be that of his own faithful hound and from the plaintive tone of the animal he had no doubt that he was sensible of his masters vicinity and in his way invoking his assistance for liberty and rescue  alas poor roswal he said thou callest for aid and sympathy upon one in stricter bondage than thou thyself art i will not seem to heed thee or return thy affection since it would serve but to load our parting with yet more bitterness  thus passed the hours of night and the space of dim hazy dawn which forms the twilight of a syrian morning but when the very first line of the suns disk began to rise above the level horizon and when the very first level ray shot glimmering in dew along the surface of the desert which the travellers had now attained the sonorous voice of el hakim himself overpowered and cut short the narrative of the taleteller while he caused to resound along the sands the solemn summons which the muezzins thunder at morning from the minaret of every mosque  to prayerto prayer god is the one godto prayerto prayer mohammed is the prophet of godto prayerto prayer time is flying from youto prayerto prayer judgment is drawing nigh to you  in an instant each moslem cast himself from his horse turned his face towards mecca and performed with sand an imitation of those ablutions which were elsewhere required to be made with water while each individual in brief but fervent ejaculations recommended himself to the care and his sins to the forgiveness of god and the prophet  even sir kenneth whose reason at once and prejudices were offended by seeing his companions in that which he considered as an act of idolatry could not help respecting the sincerity of their misguided zeal and being stimulated by their fervour to apply supplications to heaven in a purer form wondering meanwhile what newborn feelings could teach him to accompany in prayer though with varied invocation those very saracens whose heathenish worship he had conceived a crime dishonourable to the land in which high miracles had been wrought and where the daystar of redemption had arisen  the act of devotion however though rendered in such strange society burst purely from his natural feelings of religious duty and had its usual effect in composing the spirits which had been long harassed by so rapid a succession of calamities the sincere and earnest approach of the christian to the throne of the almighty teaches the best lesson of patience under affliction since wherefore should we mock the deity with supplications when we insult him by murmuring under his decrees or how while our prayers have in every word admitted the vanity and nothingness of the things of time in comparison to those of eternity should we hope to deceive the searcher of hearts by permitting the world and worldly passions to reassume the reins even immediately after a solemn address to heaven but sir kenneth was not of these he felt himself comforted and strengthened and better prepared to execute or submit to whatever his destiny might call upon him to do or to suffer  meanwhile the party of saracens regained their saddles and continued their route and the taleteller hassan resumed the thread of his narrative but it was no longer to the same attentive audience a horseman who had ascended some high ground on the right hand of the little column had returned on a speedy gallop to el hakim and communicated with him four or five more cavaliers had then been dispatched and the little band which might consist of about twenty or thirty persons began to follow them with their eyes as men from whose gestures and advance or retreat they were to augur good or evil hassan finding his audience inattentive or being himself attracted by the dubious appearances on the flank stinted in his song and the march became silent save when a cameldriver called out to his patient charge or some anxious follower of the hakim communicated with his next neighbour in a hurried and low whisper  this suspense continued until they had rounded a ridge composed of hillocks of sand which concealed from their main body the object that had created this alarm among their scouts sir kenneth could now see at the distance of a mile or more a dark object moving rapidly on the bosom of the desert which his experienced eye recognized for a party of cavalry much superior to their own in numbers and from the thick and frequent flashes which flung back the level beams of the rising sun it was plain that these were europeans in their complete panoply  the anxious looks which the horsemen of el hakim now cast upon their leader seemed to indicate deep apprehension while he with gravity as undisturbed as when he called his followers to prayer detached two of his bestmounted cavaliers with instructions to approach as closely as prudence permitted to these travellers of the desert and observe more minutely their numbers their character and if possible their purpose the approach of danger or what was feared as such was like a stimulating draught to one in apathy and recalled sir kenneth to himself and his situation  what fear you from these christian horsemen for such they seem he said to the hakim  fear said el hakim repeating the word disdainfully the sage fears nothing but heaven but ever expects from wicked men the worst which they can do  they are christians said sir kenneth and it is the time of trucewhy should you fear a breach of faith  they are the priestly soldiers of the temple answered el hakim whose vow limits them to know neither truce nor faith with the worshippers of islam may the prophet blight them both root branch and twig their peace is war and their faith is falsehood other invaders of palestine have their times and moods of courtesy the lion richard will spare when he has conquered the eagle philip will close his wing when he has stricken a prey even the austrian bear will sleep when he is gorged but this horde of everhungry wolves know neither pause nor satiety in their rapine seest thou not that they are detaching a party from their main body and that they take an eastern direction yon are their pages and squires whom they train up in their accursed mysteries and whom as lighter mounted they send to cut us off from our wateringplace but they will be disappointed i know the war of the desert yet better than they  he spoke a few words to his principal officer and his whole demeanour and countenance was at once changed from the solemn repose of an eastern sage accustomed more to contemplation than to action into the prompt and proud expression of a gallant soldier whose energies are roused by the near approach of a danger which he at once foresees and despises  to sir kenneths eyes the approaching crisis had a different aspect and when adonbec said to him thou must tarry close by my side he answered solemnly in the negative  yonder he said are my comrades in armsthe men in whose society i have vowed to fight or fall on their banner gleams the sign of our most blessed redemptioni cannot fly from the cross in company with the crescent  fool said the hakim their first action would be to do thee to death were it only to conceal their breach of the truce  of that i must take my chance replied sir kenneth but i wear not the bonds of the infidels an instant longer than i can cast them from me  then will i compel thee to follow me said el hakim  compel answered sir kenneth angrily wert thou not my benefactor or one who has showed will to be such and were it not that it is to thy confidence i owe the freedom of these hands which thou mightst have loaded with fetters i would show thee that unarmed as i am compulsion would be no easy task  enough enough replied the arabian physician we lose time even when it is becoming precious  so saying he threw his arm aloft and uttered a loud and shrill cry as a signal to his retinue who instantly dispersed themselves on the face of the desert in as many different directions as a chaplet of beads when the string is broken sir kenneth had no time to note what ensued for at the same instant the hakim seized the rein of his steed and putting his own to its mettle both sprung forth at once with the suddenness of light and at a pitch of velocity which almost deprived the scottish knight of the power of respiration and left him absolutely incapable had he been desirous to have checked the career of his guide practised as sir kenneth was in horsemanship from his earliest youth the speediest horse he had ever mounted was a tortoise in comparison to those of the arabian sage they spurned the sand from behind them they seemed to devour the desert before them miles flew away with minutesand yet their strength seemed unabated and their respiration as free as when they first started upon the wonderful race the motion too as easy as it was swift seemed more like flying through the air than riding on the earth and was attended with no unpleasant sensation save the awe naturally felt by one who is moving at such astonishing speed and the difficulty of breathing occasioned by their passing through the air so rapidly  it was not until after an hour of this portentous motion and when all human pursuit was far far behind that the hakim at length relaxed his speed and slackening the pace of the horses into a handgallop began in a voice as composed and even as if he had been walking for the last hour a descant upon the excellence of his coursers to the scot who breathless half blind half deaf and altogether giddy from the rapidity of this singular ride hardly comprehended the words which flowed so freely from his companion  these horses he said are of the breed called the winged equal in speed to aught excepting the borak of the prophet they are fed on the golden barley of yemen mixed with spices and with a small portion of dried sheeps flesh kings have given provinces to possess them and their age is active as their youth thou nazarene art the first save a true believer that ever had beneath his loins one of this noble race a gift of the prophet himself to the blessed ali his kinsman and lieutenant well called the lion of god time lays his touch so lightly on these generous steeds that the mare on which thou now sittest has seen five times five years pass over her yet retains her pristine speed and vigour only that in the career the support of a bridle managed by a hand more experienced than thine hath now become necessary may the prophet be blessed who hath bestowed on the true believers the means of advance and retreat which causeth their ironclothed enemies to be worn out with their own ponderous weight how the horses of yonder dog templars must have snorted and blown when they had toiled fetlockdeep in the desert for onetwentieth part of the space which these brave steeds have left behind them without one thick pant or a drop of moisture upon their sleek and velvet coats  the scottish knight who had now begun to recover his breath and powers of attention could not help acknowledging in his heart the advantage possessed by these eastern warriors in a race of animals alike proper for advance or retreat and so admirably adapted to the level and sandy deserts of arabia and syria but he did not choose to augment the pride of the moslem by acquiescing in his proud claim of superiority and therefore suffered the conversation to drop and looking around him could now at the more moderate pace at which they moved distinguish that he was in a country not unknown to him  the blighted borders and sullen waters of the dead sea the ragged and precipitous chain of mountains arising on the left the two or three palms clustered together forming the single green speck on the bosom of the waste wildernessobjects which once seen were scarcely to be forgottenshowed to sir kenneth that they were approaching the fountain called the diamond of the desert which had been the scene of his interview on a former occasion with the saracen emir sheerkohf or ilderim in a few minutes they checked their horses beside the spring and the hakim invited sir kenneth to descend from horseback and repose himself as in a place of safety they unbridled their steeds el hakim observing that further care of them was unnecessary since they would be speedily joined by some of the best mounted among his slaves who would do what further was needful  meantime he said spreading some food on the grass eat and drink and be not discouraged fortune may raise up or abase the ordinary mortal but the sage and the soldier should have minds beyond her control  the scottish knight endeavoured to testify his thanks by showing himself docile but though he strove to eat out of complaisance the singular contrast between his present situation and that which he had occupied on the same spot when the envoy of princes and the victor in combat came like a cloud over his mind and fasting lassitude and fatigue oppressed his bodily powers el hakim examined his hurried pulse his red and inflamed eye his heated hand and his shortened respiration  the mind he said grows wise by watching but her sister the body of coarser materials needs the support of repose thou must sleep and that thou mayest do so to refreshment thou must take a draught mingled with this elixir  he drew from his bosom a small crystal vial cased in silver filigreework and dropped into a little golden drinkingcup a small portion of a darkcoloured fluid  this he said is one of those productions which allah hath sent on earth for a blessing though mans weakness and wickedness have sometimes converted it into a curse it is powerful as the winecup of the nazarene to drop the curtain on the sleepless eye and to relieve the burden of the overloaded bosom but when applied to the purposes of indulgence and debauchery it rends the nerves destroys the strength weakens the intellect and undermines life but fear not thou to use its virtues in the time of need for the wise man warms him by the same firebrand with which the madman burneth the tent some preparation of opium seems to be intimated  i have seen too much of thy skill sage hakim said sir kenneth to debate thine hest and swallowed the narcotic mingled as it was with some water from the spring then wrapped him in the haik or arab cloak which had been fastened to his saddlepommel and according to the directions of the physician stretched himself at ease in the shade to await the promised repose sleep came not at first but in her stead a train of pleasing yet not rousing or awakening sensations a state ensued in which still conscious of his own identity and his own condition the knight felt enabled to consider them not only without alarm and sorrow but as composedly as he might have viewed the story of his misfortunes acted upon a stageor rather as a disembodied spirit might regard the transactions of its past existence from this state of repose amounting almost to apathy respecting the past his thoughts were carried forward to the future which in spite of all that existed to overcloud the prospect glittered with such hues as under much happier auspices his unstimulated imagination had not been able to produce even in its most exalted state liberty fame successful love appeared to be the certain and not very distant prospect of the enslaved exile the dishonoured knight even of the despairing lover who had placed his hopes of happiness so far beyond the prospect of chance in her wildest possibilities serving to countenance his wishes gradually as the intellectual sight became overclouded these gay visions became obscure like the dying hues of sunset until they were at last lost in total oblivion and sir kenneth lay extended at the feet of el hakim to all appearance but for his deep respiration as inanimate a corpse as if life had actually departed    chapter xxiii       mid these wild scenes enchantment waves her hand      to change the face of the mysterious land      till the bewildering scenes around us seem      the vain productions of a feverish dream         astolpho a romance  when the knight of the leopard awoke from his long and profound repose he found himself in circumstances so different from those in which he had lain down to sleep that he doubted whether he was not still dreaming or whether the scene had not been changed by magic instead of the damp grass he lay on a couch of more than oriental luxury and some kind hands had during his repose stripped him of the cassock of chamois which he wore under his armour and substituted a nightdress of the finest linen and a loose gown of silk he had been canopied only by the palmtrees of the desert but now he lay beneath a silken pavilion which blazed with the richest colours of the chinese loom while a slight curtain of gauze displayed around his couch was calculated to protect his repose from the insects to which he had ever since his arrival in these climates been a constant and passive prey he looked around as if to convince himself that he was actually awake and all that fell beneath his eye partook of the splendour of his dormitory a portable bath of cedar lined with silver was ready for use and steamed with the odours which had been used in preparing it on a small stand of ebony beside the couch stood a silver vase containing sherbet of the most exquisite quality cold as snow and which the thirst that followed the use of the strong narcotic rendered peculiarly delicious still further to dispel the dregs of intoxication which it had left behind the knight resolved to use the bath and experienced in doing so a delightful refreshment having dried himself with napkins of the indian wool he would willingly have resumed his own coarse garments that he might go forth to see whether the world was as much changed without as within the place of his repose these however were nowhere to be seen but in their place he found a saracen dress of rich materials with sabre and poniard and all befitting an emir of distinction he was able to suggest no motive to himself for this exuberance of care excepting a suspicion that these attentions were intended to shake him in his religious professionas indeed it was well known that the high esteem of the european knowledge and courage made the soldan unbounded in his gifts to those who having become his prisoners had been induced to take the turban sir kenneth therefore crossing himself devoutly resolved to set all such snares at defiance and that he might do so the more firmly conscientiously determined to avail himself as moderately as possible of the attentions and luxuries thus liberally heaped upon him still however he felt his head oppressed and sleepy and aware too that his undress was not fit for appearing abroad he reclined upon the couch and was again locked in the arms of slumber  but this time his rest was not unbroken for he was awakened by the voice of the physician at the door of the tent inquiring after his health and whether he had rested sufficiently may i enter your tent he concluded for the curtain is drawn before the entrance  the master replied sir kenneth determined to show that he was not surprised into forgetfulness of his own condition need demand no permission to enter the tent of the slave  but if i come not as a master said el hakim still without entering  the physician answered the knight hath free access to the bedside of his patient  neither come i now as a physician replied el hakim and therefore i still request permission ere i come under the covering of thy tent  whoever comes as a friend said sir kenneth and such thou hast hitherto shown thyself to me the habitation of the friend is ever open to him  yet once again said the eastern sage after the periphrastical manner of his countrymen supposing that i come not as a friend  come as thou wilt said the scottish knight somewhat impatient of this circumlocution be what thou wiltthou knowest well it is neither in my power nor my inclination to refuse thee entrance  i come then said el hakim as your ancient foe but a fair and a generous one  he entered as he spoke and when he stood before the bedside of sir kenneth the voice continued to be that of adonbec the arabian physician but the form dress and features were those of ilderim of kurdistan called sheerkohf sir kenneth gazed upon him as if he expected the vision to depart like something created by his imagination  doth it so surprise thee said ilderim and thou an approved warrior to see that a soldier knows somewhat of the art of healing i say to thee nazarene that an accomplished cavalier should know how to dress his steed as well as how to ride him how to forge his sword upon the stithy as well as how to use it in battle how to burnish his arms as well as how to wear them and above all how to cure wounds as well as how to inflict them  as he spoke the christian knight repeatedly shut his eyes and while they remained closed the idea of the hakim with his long flowing dark robes high tartar cap and grave gestures was present to his imagination but so soon as he opened them the graceful and richlygemmed turban the light hauberk of steel rings entwisted with silver which glanced brilliantly as it obeyed every inflection of the body the features freed from their formal expression less swarthy and no longer shadowed by the mass of hair now limited to a welltrimmed beard announced the soldier and not the sage  art thou still so much surprised said the emir and hast thou walked in the world with such little observance as to wonder that men are not always what they seem thou thyselfart thou what thou seemest  no by saint andrew exclaimed the knight for to the whole christian camp i seem a traitor and i know myself to be a true though an erring man  even so i judged thee said ilderim and as we had eaten salt together i deemed myself bound to rescue thee from death and contumely but wherefore lie you still on your couch since the sun is high in the heavens or are the vestments which my sumptercamels have afforded unworthy of your wearing  not unworthy surely but unfitting for it replied the scot give me the dress of a slave noble ilderim and i will don it with pleasure but i cannot brook to wear the habit of the free eastern warrior with the turban of the moslem  nazarene answered the emir thy nation so easily entertain suspicion that it may well render themselves suspected have i not told thee that saladin desires no converts saving those whom the holy prophet shall dispose to submit themselves to his law violence and bribery are alike alien to his plan for extending the true faith hearken to me my brother when the blind man was miraculously restored to sight the scales dropped from his eyes at the divine pleasure thinkst thou that any earthly leech could have removed them no such mediciner might have tormented the patient with his instruments or perhaps soothed him with his balsams and cordials but dark as he was must the darkened man have remained and it is even so with the blindness of the understanding if there be those among the franks who for the sake of worldly lucre have assumed the turban of the prophet and followed the laws of islam with their own consciences be the blame themselves sought out the bait it was not flung to them by the soldan and when they shall hereafter be sentenced as hypocrites to the lowest gulf of hell below christian and jew magician and idolater and condemned to eat the fruit of the tree yacoun which is the heads of demons to themselves not to the soldan shall their guilt and their punishment be attributed wherefore wear without doubt or scruple the vesture prepared for you since if you proceed to the camp of saladin your own native dress will expose you to troublesome observation and perhaps to insult  if i go to the camp of saladin said sir kenneth repeating the words of the emir alas am i a free agent and rather must i not go wherever your pleasure carries me  thine own will may guide thine own motions said the emir as freely as the wind which moveth the dust of the desert in what direction it chooseth the noble enemy who met and wellnigh mastered my sword cannot become my slave like him who has crouched beneath it if wealth and power would tempt thee to join our people i could ensure thy possessing them but the man who refused the favours of the soldan when the axe was at his head will not i fear now accept them when i tell him he has his free choice  complete your generosity noble emir said sir kenneth by forbearing to show me a mode of requital which conscience forbids me to comply with permit me rather to express as bound in courtesy my gratitude for this most chivalrous bounty this undeserved generosity  say not undeserved replied the emir ilderim was it not through thy conversation and thy account of the beauties which grace the court of the melech ric that i ventured me thither in disguise and thereby procured a sight the most blessed that i have ever enjoyedthat i ever shall enjoy until the glories of paradise beam on my eyes  i understand you not said sir kenneth colouring alternately and turning pale as one who felt that the conversation was taking a tone of the most painful delicacy  not understand me exclaimed the emir if the sight i saw in the tent of king richard escaped thine observation i will account it duller than the edge of a buffoons wooden falchion true thou wert under sentence of death at the time but in my case had my head been dropping from the trunk the last strained glances of my eyeballs had distinguished with delight such a vision of loveliness and the head would have rolled itself towards the incomparable houris to kiss with its quivering lips the hem of their vestments yonder royalty of england who for her superior loveliness deserves to be queen of the universewhat tenderness in her blue eye what lustre in her tresses of dishevelled gold by the tomb of the prophet i scarce think that the houri who shall present to me the diamond cup of immortality will deserve so warm a caress  saracen said sir kenneth sternly thou speakest of the wife of richard of england of whom men think not and speak not as a woman to be won but as a queen to be revered  i cry you mercy said the saracen i had forgotten your superstitious veneration for the sex which you consider rather fit to be wondered at and worshipped than wooed and possessed i warrant since thou exactest such profound respect to yonder tender piece of frailty whose every motion step and look bespeaks her very woman less than absolute adoration must not be yielded to her of the dark tresses and nobly speaking eye she indeed i will allow hath in her noble port and majestic mien something at once pure and firm yet even she when pressed by opportunity and a forward lover would i warrant thee thank him in her heart rather for treating her as a mortal than as a goddess  respect the kinswoman of coeur de lion said sir kenneth in a tone of unrepressed anger  respect her answered the emir in scorn by the caaba and if i do it shall be rather as the bride of saladin  the infidel soldan is unworthy to salute even a spot that has been pressed by the foot of edith plantagenet exclaimed the christian springing from his couch  ha what said the giaour exclaimed the emir laying his hand on his poniard hilt while his forehead glowed like glancing copper and the muscles of his lips and cheeks wrought till each curl of his beard seemed to twist and screw itself as if alive with instinctive wrath but the scottish knight who had stood the lionanger of richard was unappalled at the tigerlike mood of the chafed saracen  what i have said continued sir kenneth with folded arms and dauntless look i would were my hands loose maintain on foot or horseback against all mortals and would hold it not the most memorable deed of my life to support it with my good broadsword against a score of these sickles and bodkins pointing at the curved sabre and small poniard of the emir  the saracen recovered his composure as the christian spoke so far as to withdraw his hand from his weapon as if the motion had been without meaning but still continued in deep ire  by the sword of the prophet he said which is the key both of heaven and hell he little values his own life brother who uses the language thou dost believe me that were thine hands loose as thou termst it one single true believer would find them so much to do that thou wouldst soon wish them fettered again in manacles of iron  sooner would i wish them hewn off by the shoulderblades replied sir kenneth  well thy hands are bound at present said the saracen in a more amicable tonebound by thine own gentle sense of courtesy nor have i any present purpose of setting them at liberty we have proved each others strength and courage ere now and we may again meet in a fair fieldand shame befall him who shall be the first to part from his foeman but now we are friends and i look for aid from thee rather than hard terms or defiances  we are friends repeated the knight and there was a pause during which the fiery saracen paced the tent like the lion who after violent irritation is said to take that method of cooling the distemperature of his blood ere he stretches himself to repose in his den the colder european remained unaltered in posture and aspect yet he doubtless was also engaged in subduing the angry feelings which had been so unexpectedly awakened  let us reason of this calmly said the saracen i am a physician as thou knowest and it is written that he who would have his wound cured must not shrink when the leech probes and tests it seest thou i am about to lay my finger on the sore thou lovest this kinswoman of the melech ric unfold the veil that shrouds thy thoughtsor unfold it not if thou wilt for mine eyes see through its coverings  i loved her answered sir kenneth after a pause as a man loves heavens grace and sued for her favour like a sinner for heavens pardon  and you love her no longer said the saracen  alas answered sir kenneth i am no longer worthy to love her i pray thee cease this discoursethy words are poniards to me  pardon me but a moment continued ilderim when thou a poor and obscure soldier didst so boldly and so highly fix thine affection tell me hadst thou good hope of its issue  love exists not without hope replied the knight but mine was as nearly allied to despair as that of the sailor swimming for his life who as he surmounts billow after billow catches by intervals some gleam of the distant beacon which shows him there is land in sight though his sinking heart and wearied limbs assure him that he shall never reach it  and now said ilderim these hopes are sunkthat solitary light is quenched for ever  for ever answered sir kenneth in the tone of an echo from the bosom of a ruined sepulchre  methinks said the saracen if all thou lackest were some such distant meteoric glimpse of happiness as thou hadst formerly thy beaconlight might be rekindled thy hope fished up from the ocean in which it has sunk and thou thyself good knight restored to the exercise and amusement of nourishing thy fantastic fashion upon a diet as unsubstantial as moonlight for if thou stoodst tomorrow fair in reputation as ever thou wert she whom thou lovest will not be less the daughter of princes and the elected bride of saladin  i would it so stood said the scot and if i did not  he stopped short like a man who is afraid of boasting under circumstances which did not permit his being put to the test the saracen smiled as he concluded the sentence  thou wouldst challenge the soldan to single combat said he  and if i did said sir kenneth haughtily saladins would neither be the first nor the best turban that i have couched lance at  ay but methinks the soldan might regard it as too unequal a mode of perilling the chance of a royal bride and the event of a great war said the emir  he may be met with in the front of battle said the knight his eyes gleaming with the ideas which such a thought inspired  he has been ever found there said ilderim nor is it his wont to turn his horses head from any brave encounter but it was not of the soldan that i meant to speak in a word if it will content thee to be placed in such reputation as may be attained by detection of the thief who stole the banner of england i can put thee in a fair way of achieving this taskthat is if thou wilt be governed for what says lokman if the child would walk the nurse must lead him if the ignorant would understand the wise must instruct  and thou art wise ilderim said the scotwise though a saracen and generous though an infidel i have witnessed that thou art both take then the guidance of this matter and so thou ask nothing of me contrary to my loyalty and my christian faith i will obey thee punctually do what thou hast said and take my life when it is accomplished  listen thou to me then said the saracen thy noble hound is now recovered by the blessing of that divine medicine which healeth man and beast and by his sagacity shall those who assailed him be discovered  ha said the knight methinks i comprehend thee i was dull not to think of this  but tell me added the emir hast thou any followers or retainers in the camp by whom the animal may be known  i dismissed said sir kenneth my old attendant thy patient with a varlet that waited on him at the time when i expected to suffer death giving him letters for my friends in scotland there are none other to whom the dog is familiar but then my own person is well knownmy very speech will betray me in a camp where i have played no mean part for many months  both he and thou shalt be disguised so as to escape even close examination i tell thee said the saracen that not thy brother in armsnot thy brother in bloodshall discover thee if thou be guided by my counsels thou hast seen me do matters more difficulthe that can call the dying from the darkness of the shadow of death can easily cast a mist before the eyes of the living but mark me there is still the condition annexed to this servicethat thou deliver a letter of saladin to the niece of the melech ric whose name is as difficult to our eastern tongue and lips as her beauty is delightful to our eyes  sir kenneth paused before he answered and the saracen observing his hesitation demanded of him if he feared to undertake this message  not if there were death in the execution said sir kenneth i do but pause to consider whether it consists with my honour to bear the letter of the soldan or with that of the lady edith to receive it from a heathen prince  by the head of mohammed and by the honour of a soldierby the tomb at mecca and by the soul of my father said the emir i swear to thee that the letter is written in all honour and respect the song of the nightingale will sooner blight the rosebower she loves than will the words of the soldan offend the ears of the lovely kinswoman of england  then said the knight i will bear the soldans letter faithfully as if i were his born vassalunderstanding that beyond this simple act of service which i will render with fidelity from me of all men he can least expect mediation or advice in this his strange lovesuit  saladin is noble answered the emir and will not spur a generous horse to a leap which he cannot achieve come with me to my tent he added and thou shalt be presently equipped with a disguise as unsearchable as midnight so thou mayest walk the camp of the nazarenes as if thou hadst on thy finger the signet of giaougi perhaps the same with gyges    chapter xxiv       a grain of dust      soiling our cup will make our sense reject      fastidiously the draught which we did thirst for      a rusted nail placed near the faithful compass      will sway it from the truth and wreck the argosy      even this small cause of anger and disgust      will break the bonds of amity mongst princes      and wreck their noblest purposes                   the crusade  the reader can now have little doubt who the ethiopian slave really was with what purpose he had sought richards camp and wherefore and with what hope he now stood close to the person of that monarch as surrounded by his valiant peers of england and normandy coeur de lion stood on the summit of saint georges mount with the banner of england by his side borne by the most goodly person in the army being his own natural brother william with the long sword earl of salisbury the offspring of henry the seconds amour with the celebrated rosamond of woodstock  from several expressions in the kings conversation with neville on the preceding day the nubian was left in anxious doubt whether his disguise had not been penetrated especially as that the king seemed to be aware in what manner the agency of the dog was expected to discover the thief who stole the banner although the circumstance of such an animals having been wounded on the occasion had been scarce mentioned in richards presence nevertheless as the king continued to treat him in no other manner than his exterior required the nubian remained uncertain whether he was or was not discovered and determined not to throw his disguise aside voluntarily  meanwhile the powers of the various crusading princes arrayed under their royal and princely leaders swept in long order around the base of the little mound and as those of each different country passed by their commanders advanced a step or two up the hill and made a signal of courtesy to richard and to the standard of england in sign of regard and amity as the protocol of the ceremony heedfully expressed it not of subjection or vassalage the spiritual dignitaries who in those days veiled not their bonnets to created being bestowed on the king and his symbol of command their blessing instead of rendering obeisance  thus the long files marched on and diminished as they were by so many causes appeared still an iron host to whom the conquest of palestine might seem an easy task the soldiers inspired by the consciousness of united strength sat erect in their steel saddles while it seemed that the trumpets sounded more cheerfully shrill and the steeds refreshed by rest and provender chafed on the bit and trod the ground more proudly on they passed troop after troop banners waving spears glancing plumes dancing in long perspectivea host composed of different nations complexions languages arms and appearances but all fired for the time with the holy yet romantic purpose of rescuing the distressed daughter of zion from her thraldom and redeeming the sacred earth which more than mortal had trodden from the yoke of the unbelieving pagan and it must be owned that if in other circumstances the species of courtesy rendered to the king of england by so many warriors from whom he claimed no natural allegiance had in it something that might have been thought humiliating yet the nature and cause of the war was so fitted to his preeminently chivalrous character and renowned feats in arms that claims which might elsewhere have been urged were there forgotten and the brave did willing homage to the bravest in an expedition where the most undaunted and energetic courage was necessary to success  the good king was seated on horseback about half way up the mount a morion on his head surmounted by a crown which left his manly features exposed to public view as with cool and considerate eye he perused each rank as it passed him and returned the salutation of the leaders his tunic was of skycoloured velvet covered with plates of silver and his hose of crimson silk slashed with cloth of gold by his side stood the seeming ethiopian slave holding the noble dog in a leash such as was used in woodcraft it was a circumstance which attracted no notice for many of the princes of the crusade had introduced black slaves into their household in imitation of the barbarous splendour of the saracens over the kings head streamed the large folds of the banner and as he looked to it from time to time he seemed to regard a ceremony indifferent to himself personally as important when considered as atoning an indignity offered to the kingdom which he ruled in the background and on the very summit of the mount a wooden turret erected for the occasion held the queen berengaria and the principal ladies of the court to this the king looked from time to time and then ever and anon his eyes were turned on the nubian and the dog but only when such leaders approached as from circumstances of previous illwill he suspected of being accessory to the theft of the standard or whom he judged capable of a crime so mean  thus he did not look in that direction when philip augustus of france approached at the head of his splendid troops of gallic chivalrynay he anticipated the motions of the french king by descending the mount as the latter came up the ascent so that they met in the middle space and blended their greetings so gracefully that it appeared they met in fraternal equality the sight of the two greatest princes in europe in rank at once and power thus publicly avowing their concord called forth bursts of thundering acclaim from the crusading host at many miles distance and made the roving arab scouts of the desert alarm the camp of saladin with intelligence that the army of the christians was in motion yet who but the king of kings can read the hearts of monarchs under this smooth show of courtesy richard nourished displeasure and suspicion against philip and philip meditated withdrawing himself and his host from the army of the cross and leaving richard to accomplish or fail in the enterprise with his own unassisted forces  richards demeanour was different when the darkarmed knights and squires of the temple chivalry approachedmen with countenances bronzed to asiatic blackness by the suns of palestine and the admirable state of whose horses and appointments far surpassed even that of the choicest troops of france and england the king cast a hasty glance aside but the nubian stood quiet and his trusty dog sat at his feet watching with a sagacious yet pleased look the ranks which now passed before them the kings look turned again on the chivalrous templars as the grand master availing himself of his mingled character bestowed his benediction on richard as a priest instead of doing him reverence as a military leader  the misproud and amphibious caitiff puts the monk upon me said richard to the earl of salisbury but longsword we will let it pass a punctilio must not lose christendom the services of these experienced lances because their victories have rendered them overweening lo you here comes our valiant adversary the duke of austria mark his manner and bearing longswordand thou nubian let the hound have full view of him by heaven he brings his buffoons along with him  in fact whether from habit or which is more likely to intimate contempt of the ceremonial he was about to comply with leopold was attended by his spruchsprecher and his jester and as he advanced towards richard he whistled in what he wished to be considered as an indifferent manner though his heavy features evinced the sullenness mixed with the fear with which a truant schoolboy may be seen to approach his master as the reluctant dignitary made with discomposed and sulky look the obeisance required the spruchsprecher shook his baton and proclaimed like a herald that in what he was now doing the archduke of austria was not to be held derogating from the rank and privileges of a sovereign prince to which the jester answered with a sonorous amen which provoked much laughter among the bystanders  king richard looked more than once at the nubian and his dog but the former moved not nor did the latter strain at the leash so that richard said to the slave with some scorn thy success in this enterprise my sable friend even though thou hast brought thy hounds sagacity to back thine own will not i fear place thee high in the rank of wizards or much augment thy merits towards our person  the nubian answered as usual only by a lowly obeisance  meantime the troops of the marquis of montserrat next passed in order before the king of england that powerful and wily baron to make the greater display of his forces had divided them into two bodies at the head of the first consisting of his vassals and followers and levied from his syrian possessions came his brother enguerrand and he himself followed leading on a gallant band of twelve hundred stradiots a kind of light cavalry raised by the venetians in their dalmatian possessions and of which they had entrusted the command to the marquis with whom the republic had many bonds of connection these stradiots were clothed in a fashion partly european but partaking chiefly of the eastern fashion they wore indeed short hauberks but had over them partycoloured tunics of rich stuffs with large wide pantaloons and halfboots on their heads were straight upright caps similar to those of the greeks and they carried small round targets bows and arrows scimitars and poniards they were mounted on horses carefully selected and well maintained at the expense of the state of venice their saddles and appointments resembled those of the turks and they rode in the same manner with short stirrups and upon a high seat these troops were of great use in skirmishing with the arabs though unable to engage in close combat like the ironsheathed menatarms of western and northern europe  before this goodly band came conrade in the same garb with the stradiots but of such rich stuff that he seemed to blaze with gold and silver and the milkwhite plume fastened in his cap by a clasp of diamonds seemed tall enough to sweep the clouds the noble steed which he reined bounded and caracoled and displayed his spirit and agility in a manner which might have troubled a less admirable horseman than the marquis who gracefully ruled him with the one hand while the other displayed the baton whose predominancy over the ranks which he led seemed equally absolute yet his authority over the stradiots was more in show than in substance for there paced beside him on an ambling palfrey of soberest mood a little old man dressed entirely in black without beard or moustaches and having an appearance altogether mean and insignificant when compared with the blaze of splendour around him but this meanlooking old man was one of those deputies whom the venetian government sent into camps to overlook the conduct of the generals to whom the leading was consigned and to maintain that jealous system of espial and control which had long distinguished the policy of the republic  conrade who by cultivating richards humour had attained a certain degree of favour with him no sooner was come within his ken than the king of england descended a step or two to meet him exclaiming at the same time ha lord marquis thou at the head of the fleet stradiots and thy black shadow attending thee as usual whether the sun shines or not may not one ask thee whether the rule of the troops remains with the shadow or the substance  conrade was commencing his reply with a smile when roswal the noble hound uttering a furious and savage yell sprung forward the nubian at the same time slipped the leash and the hound rushing on leapt upon conrades noble charger and seizing the marquis by the throat pulled him down from the saddle the plumed rider lay rolling on the sand and the frightened horse fled in wild career through the camp  thy hound hath pulled down the right quarry i warrant him said the king to the nubian and i vow to saint george he is a stag of ten tynes pluck the dog off lest he throttle him  the ethiopian accordingly though not without difficulty disengaged the dog from conrade and fastened him up still highly excited and struggling in the leash meanwhile many crowded to the spot especially followers of conrade and officers of the stradiots who as they saw their leader lie gazing wildly on the sky raised him up amid a tumultuary cry of cut the slave and his hound to pieces  but the voice of richard loud and sonorous was heard clear above all other exclamations he dies the death who injures the hound he hath but done his duty after the sagacity with which god and nature have endowed the brave animalstand forward for a false traitor thou conrade marquis of montserrat i impeach thee of treason  several of the syrian leaders had now come up and conradevexation and shame and confusion struggling with passion in his manner and voiceexclaimed what means this with what am i charged why this base usage and these reproachful terms is this the league of concord which england renewed but so lately  are the princes of the crusade turned hares or deers in the eyes of king richard that he should slip hounds on them said the sepulchral voice of the grand master of the templars  it must be some singular accidentsome fatal mistake said philip of france who rode up at the same moment  some deceit of the enemy said the archbishop of tyre  a stratagem of the saracens cried henry of champagne it were well to hang up the dog and put the slave to the torture  let no man lay hand upon them said richard as he loves his own life conrade stand forth if thou darest and deny the accusation which this mute animal hath in his noble instinct brought against thee of injury done to him and foul scorn to england  i never touched the banner said conrade hastily  thy words betray thee conrade said richard for how didst thou know save from conscious guilt that the question is concerning the banner  hast thou then not kept the camp in turmoil on that and no other score answered conrade and dost thou impute to a prince and an ally a crime which after all was probably committed by some paltry felon for the sake of the gold thread or wouldst thou now impeach a confederate on the credit of a dog  by this time the alarm was becoming general so that philip of france interposed  princes and nobles he said you speak in presence of those whose swords will soon be at the throats of each other if they hear their leaders at such terms together in the name of heaven let us draw off each his own troops into their separate quarters and ourselves meet an hour hence in the pavilion of council to take some order in this new state of confusion  content said king richard though i should have liked to have interrogated that caitiff while his gay doublet was yet besmirched with sand but the pleasure of france shall be ours in this matter  the leaders separated as was proposed each prince placing himself at the head of his own forces and then was heard on all sides the crying of warcries and the sounding of gatheringnotes upon bugles and trumpets by which the different stragglers were summoned to their princes banner and the troops were shortly seen in motion each taking different routes through the camp to their own quarters but although any immediate act of violence was thus prevented yet the accident which had taken place dwelt on every mind and those foreigners who had that morning hailed richard as the worthiest to lead their army now resumed their prejudices against his pride and intolerance while the english conceiving the honour of their country connected with the quarrel of which various reports had gone about considered the natives of other countries jealous of the fame of england and her king and disposed to undermine it by the meanest arts of intrigue many and various were the rumours spread upon the occasion and there was one which averred that the queen and her ladies had been much alarmed by the tumult and that one of them had swooned  the council assembled at the appointed hour conrade had in the meanwhile laid aside his dishonoured dress and with it the shame and confusion which in spite of his talents and promptitude had at first overwhelmed him owing to the strangeness of the accident and suddenness of the accusation he was now robed like a prince and entered the councilchamber attended by the archduke of austria the grand masters both of the temple and of the order of saint john and several other potentates who made a show of supporting him and defending his cause chiefly perhaps from political motives or because they themselves nourished a personal enmity against richard  this appearance of union in favour of conrade was far from influencing the king of england he entered the council with his usual indifference of manner and in the same dress in which he had just alighted from horseback he cast a careless and somewhat scornful glance on the leaders who had with studied affectation arranged themselves around conrade as if owning his cause and in the most direct terms charged conrade of montserrat with having stolen the banner of england and wounded the faithful animal who stood in its defence  conrade arose boldly to answer and in despite as he expressed himself of man and brute king or dog avouched his innocence of the crime charged  brother of england said philip who willingly assumed the character of moderator of the assembly this is an unusual impeachment we do not hear you avouch your own knowledge of this matter further than your belief resting upon the demeanour of this hound towards the marquis of montserrat surely the word of a knight and a prince should bear him out against the barking of a cur  royal brother returned richard recollect that the almighty who gave the dog to be companion of our pleasures and our toils hath invested him with a nature noble and incapable of deceit he forgets neither friend nor foeremembers and with accuracy both benefit and injury he hath a share of mans intelligence but no share of mans falsehood you may bribe a soldier to slay a man with his sword or a witness to take life by false accusation but you cannot make a hound tear his benefactor he is the friend of man save when man justly incurs his enmity dress yonder marquis in what peacockrobes you will disguise his appearance alter his complexion with drugs and washes hide him amidst a hundred meni will yet pawn my sceptre that the hound detects him and expresses his resentment as you have this day beheld this is no new incident although a strange one murderers and robbers have been ere now convicted and suffered death under such evidence and men have said that the finger of god was in it in thine own land royal brother and upon such an occasion the matter was tried by a solemn duel betwixt the man and the dog as appellant and defendant in a challenge of murder the dog was victorious the man was punished and the crime was confessed credit me royal brother that hidden crimes have often been brought to light by the testimony even of inanimate substances not to mention animals far inferior in instinctive sagacity to the dog who is the friend and companion of our race  such a duel there hath indeed been royal brother answered philip and that in the reign of one of our predecessors to whom god be gracious but it was in the olden time nor can we hold it a precedent fitting for this occasion the defendant in that case was a private gentleman of small rank or respect his offensive weapons were only a club his defensive a leathern jerkin but we cannot degrade a prince to the disgrace of using such rude arms or to the ignominy of such a combat  i never meant that you should said king richard it were foul play to hazard the good hounds life against that of such a doublefaced traitor as this conrade hath proved himself but there lies our own glove we appeal him to the combat in respect of the evidence we brought forth against him a king at least is more than the mate of a marquis  conrade made no hasty effort to seize on the pledge which richard cast into the middle of the assembly and king philip had time to reply ere the marquis made a motion to lift the glove  a king said he of france is as much more than a match for the marquis conrade as a dog would be less royal richard this cannot be permitted you are the leader of our expeditionthe sword and buckler of christendom  i protest against such a combat said the venetian proveditore until the king of england shall have repaid the fifty thousand byzants which he is indebted to the republic it is enough to be threatened with loss of our debt should our debtor fall by the hands of the pagans without the additional risk of his being slain in brawls amongst christians concerning dogs and banners  and i said william with the long sword earl of salisbury protest in my turn against my royal brother perilling his life which is the property of the people of england in such a cause here noble brother receive back your glove and think only as if the wind had blown it from your hand mine shall lie in its stead a kings son though with the bar sinister on his shield is at least a match for this marmoset of a marquis  princes and nobles said conrade i will not accept of king richards defiance he hath been chosen our leader against the saracens and if his conscience can answer the accusation of provoking an ally to the field on a quarrel so frivolous mine at least cannot endure the reproach of accepting it but touching his bastard brother william of woodstock or against any other who shall adopt or shall dare to stand godfather to this most false charge i will defend my honour in the lists and prove whosoever impeaches it a false liar  the marquis of montserrat said the archbishop of tyre hath spoken like a wise and moderate gentleman and methinks this controversy might without dishonour to any party end at this point  methinks it might so terminate said the king of france provided king richard will recall his accusation as made upon overslight grounds  philip of france answered coeur de lion my words shall never do my thoughts so much injury i have charged yonder conrade as a thief who under cloud of night stole from its place the emblem of englands dignity i still believe and charge him to be such and when a day is appointed for the combat doubt not that since conrade declines to meet us in person i will find a champion to appear in support of my challengefor thou william must not thrust thy long sword into this quarrel without our special license  since my rank makes me arbiter in this most unhappy matter said philip of france i appoint the fifth day from hence for the decision thereof by way of combat according to knightly usagerichard king of england to appear by his champion as appellant and conrade marquis of montserrat in his own person as defendant yet i own i know not where to find neutral ground where such a quarrel may be fought out for it must not be in the neighbourhood of this camp where the soldiers would make faction on the different sides  it were well said richard to apply to the generosity of the royal saladin since heathen as he is i have never known knight more fulfilled of nobleness or to whose good faith we may so peremptorily entrust ourselves i speak thus for those who may be doubtful of mishap for myself wherever i see my foe i make that spot my battleground  be it so said philip we will make this matter known to saladin although it be showing to an enemy the unhappy spirit of discord which we would willingly hide from even ourselves were it possible meanwhile i dismiss this assembly and charge you all as christian men and noble knights that ye let this unhappy feud breed no further brawling in the camp but regard it as a thing solemnly referred to the judgment of god to whom each of you should pray that he will dispose of victory in the combat according to the truth of the quarrel and therewith may his will be done  amen amen was answered on all sides while the templar whispered the marquis conrade wilt thou not add a petition to be delivered from the power of the dog as the psalmist hath it  peace thou replied the marquis there is a revealing demon abroad which may report amongst other tidings how far thou dost carry the motto of thy orderferiatur leo  thou wilt stand the brunt of challenge said the templar  doubt me not said conrade i would not indeed have willingly met the iron arm of richard himself and i shame not to confess that i rejoice to be free of his encounter but from his bastard brother downward the man breathes not in his ranks whom i fear to meet  it is well you are so confident continued the templar and in that case the fangs of yonder hound have done more to dissolve this league of princes than either thy devices or the dagger of the charegite seest thou how under a brow studiously overclouded philip cannot conceal the satisfaction which he feels at the prospect of release from the alliance which sat so heavy on him mark how henry of champagne smiles to himself like a sparkling goblet of his own wine and see the chuckling delight of austria who thinks his quarrel is about to be avenged without risk or trouble of his own hush he approachesa most grievous chance most royal austria that these breaches in the walls of our zion  if thou meanest this crusade replied the duke i would it were crumbled to pieces and each were safe at home i speak this in confidence  but said the marquis of montserrat to think this disunion should be made by the hands of king richard for whose pleasure we have been contented to endure so much and to whom we have been as submissive as slaves to a master in hopes that he would use his valour against our enemies instead of exercising it upon our friends  i see not that he is so much more valorous than others said the archduke i believe had the noble marquis met him in the lists he would have had the better for though the islander deals heavy blows with the poleaxe he is not so very dexterous with the lance i should have cared little to have met him myself on our old quarrel had the weal of christendom permitted to sovereign princes to breathe themselves in the lists and if thou desirest it noble marquis i will myself be your godfather in this combat  and i also said the grand master  come then and take your nooning in our tent noble sirs said the duke and well speak of this business over some right nierenstein  they entered together accordingly  what said our patron and these great folks together said jonas schwanker to his companion the spruchsprecher who had used the freedom to press nigh to his master when the council was dismissed while the jester waited at a more respectful distance  servant of folly said the spruchsprecher moderate thy curiosity it beseems not that i should tell to thee the counsels of our master  man of wisdom you mistake answered jonas we are both the constant attendants on our patron and it concerns us alike to know whether thou or iwisdom or follyhave the deeper interest in him  he told to the marquis answered the spruchsprecher and to the grand master that he was aweary of these wars and would be glad he was safe at home  that is a drawn cast and counts for nothing in the game said the jester it was most wise to think thus but great folly to tell it to othersproceed  ha hem said the spruchsprecher he next said to them that richard was not more valorous than others or overdexterous in the tiltyard  woodcock of my side said schwanker this was egregious folly what next  nay i am something oblivious replied the man of wisdomhe invited them to a goblet of nierenstein  that hath a show of wisdom in it said jonas thou mayest mark it to thy credit in the meantime but an he drink too much as is most likely i will have it pass to mine anything more  nothing worth memory answered the orator only he wished he had taken the occasion to meet richard in the lists  out upon itout upon it said jonas this is such dotage of folly that i am wellnigh ashamed of winning the game by it neertheless fool as he is we will follow him most sage spruchsprecher and have our share of the wine of nierenstein    chapter xxv       yet this inconstancy is such      as thou too shalt adore      i could not love thee love so much      loved i not honour more             montroses lines  when king richard returned to his tent he commanded the nubian to be brought before him he entered with his usual ceremonial reverence and having prostrated himself remained standing before the king in the attitude of a slave awaiting the orders of his master it was perhaps well for him that the preservation of his character required his eyes to be fixed on the ground since the keen glance with which richard for some time surveyed him in silence would if fully encountered have been difficult to sustain  thou canst well of woodcraft said the king after a pause and hast started thy game and brought him to bay as ably as if tristrem himself had taught thee a universal tradition ascribed to sir tristrem famous for his love of the fair queen yseult the laws concerning the practice of woodcraft or venerie as it was called being those that related to the rules of the chase which were deemed of much consequence during the middle ages but this is not allhe must be brought down at force i myself would have liked to have levelled my huntingspear at him there are it seems respects which prevent this thou art about to return to the camp of the soldan bearing a letter requiring of his courtesy to appoint neutral ground for the deed of chivalry and should it consist with his pleasure to concur with us in witnessing it now speaking conjecturally we think thou mightst find in that camp some cavalier who for the love of truth and his own augmentation of honour will do battle with this same traitor of montserrat  the nubian raised his eyes and fixed them on the king with a look of eager ardour then raised them to heaven with such solemn gratitude that the water soon glistened in them then bent his head as affirming what richard desired and resumed his usual posture of submissive attention  it is well said the king and i see thy desire to oblige me in this matter and herein i must needs say lies the excellence of such a servant as thou who hast not speech either to debate our purpose or to require explanation of what we have determined an english serving man in thy place had given me his dogged advice to trust the combat with some good lance of my household who from my brother longsword downwards are all on fire to do battle in my cause and a chattering frenchman had made a thousand attempts to discover wherefore i look for a champion from the camp of the infidels but thou my silent agent canst do mine errand without questioning or comprehending it with thee to hear is to obey  a bend of the body and a genuflection were the appropriate answer of the ethiopian to these observations  and now to another point said the king and speaking suddenly and rapidlyhave you yet seen edith plantagenet  the mute looked up as in the act of being about to speaknay his lips had begun to utter a distinct negativewhen the abortive attempt died away in the imperfect murmurs of the dumb  why lo you there said the king the very sound of the name of a royal maiden of beauty so surpassing as that of our lovely cousin seems to have power enough wellnigh to make the dumb speak what miracles then might her eye work upon such a subject i will make the experiment friend slave thou shalt see this choice beauty of our court and do the errand of the princely soldan  again a joyful glanceagain a genuflectionbut as he arose the king laid his hand heavily on his shoulder and proceeded with stern gravity thus let me in one thing warn you my sable envoy even if thou shouldst feel that the kindly influence of her whom thou art soon to behold should loosen the bonds of thy tongue presently imprisoned as the good soldan expresses it within the ivory walls of its castle beware how thou changest thy taciturn character or speakest a word in her presence even if thy powers of utterance were to be miraculously restored believe me that i should have thy tongue extracted by the roots and its ivory palacethat is i presume its range of teethdrawn out one by one wherefore be wise and silent still  the nubian so soon as the king had removed his heavy grasp from his shoulder bent his head and laid his hand on his lips in token of silent obedience  but richard again laid his hand on him more gently and added this behest we lay on thee as on a slave wert thou knight and gentleman we would require thine honour in pledge of thy silence which is one especial condition of our present trust  the ethiopian raised his body proudly looked full at the king and laid his right hand on his heart  richard then summoned his chamberlain  go neville he said with this slave to the tent of our royal consort and say it is our pleasure that he have an audiencea private audienceof our cousin edith he is charged with a commission to her thou canst show him the way also in case he requires thy guidance though thou mayst have observed it is wonderful how familiar he already seems to be with the purlieus of our campand thou too friend ethiop the king continued what thou dost do quickly and return hither within the halfhour  i stand discovered thought the seeming nubian as with downcast looks and folded arms he followed the hasty stride of neville towards the tent of queen berengariai stand undoubtedly discovered and unfolded to king richard yet i cannot perceive that his resentment is hot against me if i understand his wordsand surely it is impossible to misinterpret themhe gives me a noble chance of redeeming my honour upon the crest of this false marquis whose guilt i read in his craven eye and quivering lip when the charge was made against himroswal faithfully hast thou served thy master and most dearly shall thy wrong be avengedbut what is the meaning of my present permission to look upon her whom i had despaired ever to see again and why or how can the royal plantagenet consent that i should see his divine kinswoman either as the messenger of the heathen saladin or as the guilty exile whom he so lately expelled from his camphis audacious avowal of the affection which is his pride being the greatest enhancement of his guilt that richard should consent to her receiving a letter from an infidel lover by the hands of one of such disproportioned rank are either of them circumstances equally incredible and at the same time inconsistent with each other but richard when unmoved by his heady passions is liberal generous and truly noble and as such i will deal with him and act according to his instructions direct or implied seeking to know no more than may gradually unfold itself without my officious inquiry to him who has given me so brave an opportunity to vindicate my tarnished honour i owe acquiescence and obedience and painful as it may be the debt shall be paid and yetthus the proud swelling of his heart further suggestedcoeur de lion as he is called might have measured the feelings of others by his own i urge an address to his kinswoman i who never spoke word to her when i took a royal prize from her handwhen i was accounted not the lowest in feats of chivalry among the defenders of the cross i approach her when in a base disguise and in a servile habitand alas when my actual condition is that of a slave with a spot of dishonour on that which was once my shield i do this he little knows me yet i thank him for the opportunity which may make us all better acquainted with each other  as he arrived at this conclusion they paused before the entrance of the queens pavilion  they were of course admitted by the guards and neville leaving the nubian in a small apartment or antechamber which was but too well remembered by him passed into that which was used as the queens presencechamber he communicated his royal masters pleasure in a low and respectful tone of voice very different from the bluntness of thomas de vaux to whom richard was everything and the rest of the court including berengaria herself was nothing a burst of laughter followed the communication of his errand  and what like is the nubian slave who comes ambassador on such an errand from the soldana negro de neville is he not said a female voice easily recognized for that of berengaria a negro is he not de neville with black skin a head curled like a rams a flat nose and blubber lipsha worthy sir henry  let not your grace forget the shinbones said another voice bent outwards like the edge of a saracen scimitar  rather like the bow of a cupid since he comes upon a lovers errand said the queengentle neville thou art ever prompt to pleasure us poor women who have so little to pass away our idle moments we must see this messenger of love turks and moors have i seen many but negro never  i am created to obey your graces commands so you will bear me out with my sovereign for doing so answered the debonair knight yet let me assure your grace you will see something different from what you expect  so much the betteruglier yet than our imaginations can fancy yet the chosen lovemessenger of this gallant soldan  gracious madam said the lady calista may i implore you would permit the good knight to carry this messenger straight to the lady edith to whom his credentials are addressed we have already escaped hardly for such a frolic  escaped repeated the queen scornfully yet thou mayest be right calista in thy caution let this nubian as thou callest him first do his errand to our cousinbesides he is mute too is he not  he is gracious madam answered the knight  royal sport have these eastern ladies said berengaria attended by those before whom they may say anything yet who can report nothing whereas in our camp as the prelate of saint judes is wont to say a bird of the air will carry the matter  because said de neville your grace forgets that you speak within canvas walls  the voices sunk on this observation and after a little whispering the english knight again returned to the ethiopian and made him a sign to follow he did so and neville conducted him to a pavilion pitched somewhat apart from that of the queen for the accommodation it seemed of the lady edith and her attendants one of her coptic maidens received the message communicated by sir henry neville and in the space of a very few minutes the nubian was ushered into ediths presence while neville was left on the outside of the tent the slave who introduced him withdrew on a signal from her mistress and it was with humiliation not of the posture only but of the very inmost soul that the unfortunate knight thus strangely disguised threw himself on one knee with looks bent on the ground and arms folded on his bosom like a criminal who expects his doom edith was clad in the same manner as when she received king richard her long transparent dark veil hanging around her like the shade of a summer night on a beautiful landscape disguising and rendering obscure the beauties which it could not hide she held in her hand a silver lamp fed with some aromatic spirit which burned with unusual brightness  when edith came within a step of the kneeling and motionless slave she held the light towards his face as if to peruse his features more attentively then turned from him and placed her lamp so as to throw the shadow of his face in profile upon the curtain which hung beside she at length spoke in a voice composed yet deeply sorrowful  is it you it is indeed you brave knight of the leopardgallant sir kenneth of scotland is it indeed youthus servilely disguisedthus surrounded by a hundred dangers  at hearing the tones of his ladys voice thus unexpectedly addressed to him and in a tone of compassion approaching to tenderness a corresponding reply rushed to the knights lips and scarce could richards commands and his own promised silence prevent his answering that the sight he saw the sounds he just heard were sufficient to recompense the slavery of a life and dangers which threatened that life every hour he did recollect himself however and a deep and impassioned sigh was his only reply to the highborn ediths question  i seei know i have guessed right continued edith i marked you from your first appearance near the platform on which i stood with the queen i knew too your valiant hound she is no true lady and is unworthy of the service of such a knight as thou art from whom disguises of dress or hue could conceal a faithful servant speak then without fear to edith plantagenet she knows how to grace in adversity the good knight who served honoured and did deeds of arms in her name when fortune befriended himstill silent is it fear or shame that keeps thee so fear should be unknown to thee and for shame let it remain with those who have wronged thee  the knight in despair at being obliged to play the mute in an interview so interesting could only express his mortification by sighing deeply and laying his finger upon his lips edith stepped back as if somewhat displeased  what she said the asiatic mute in very deed as well as in attire this i looked not for or thou mayest scorn me perhaps for thus boldly acknowledging that i have heedfully observed the homage thou hast paid me hold no unworthy thoughts of edith on that account she knows well the bounds which reserve and modesty prescribe to highborn maidens and she knows when and how far they should give place to gratitudeto a sincere desire that it were in her power to repay services and repair injuries arising from the devotion which a good knight bore towards her why fold thy hands together and wring them with so much passion can it be she added shrinking back at the idea that their cruelty has actually deprived thee of speech thou shakest thy head be it a spellbe it obstinacy i question thee no further but leave thee to do thine errand after thine own fashion i also can be mute  the disguised knight made an action as if at once lamenting his own condition and deprecating her displeasure while at the same time he presented to her wrapped as usual in fine silk and cloth of gold the letter of the soldan she took it surveyed it carelessly then laid it aside and bending her eyes once more on the knight she said in a low tone not even a word to do thine errand to me  he pressed both his hands to his brow as if to intimate the pain which he felt at being unable to obey her but she turned from him in anger  begone she said i have spoken enoughtoo muchto one who will not waste on me a word in reply begoneand say if i have wronged thee i have done penance for if i have been the unhappy means of dragging thee down from a station of honour i have in this interview forgotten my own worth and lowered myself in thy eyes and in my own  she covered her eyes with her hands and seemed deeply agitated sir kenneth would have approached but she waved him back  stand off thou whose soul heaven hath suited to its new station aught less dull and fearful than a slavish mute had spoken a word of gratitude were it but to reconcile me to my own degradation why pause youbegone  the disguised knight almost involuntarily looked towards the letter as an apology for protracting his stay she snatched it up saying in a tone of irony and contempt i had forgottenthe dutiful slave waits an answer to his message hows thisfrom the soldan  she hastily ran over the contents which were expressed both in arabic and french and when she had done she laughed in bitter anger  now this passes imagination she said no jongleur can show so deft a transmutation his legerdemain can transform zechins and byzants into doits and maravedis but can his art convert a christian knight ever esteemed among the bravest of the holy crusade into the dustkissing slave of a heathen soldanthe bearer of a paynims insolent proposals to a christian maidennay forgetting the laws of honourable chivalry as well as of religion but it avails not talking to the willing slave of a heathen hound tell your master when his scourge shall have found thee a tongue that which thou hast seen me doso saying she threw the soldans letter on the ground and placed her foot upon itand say to him that edith plantagenet scorns the homage of an unchristened pagan  with these words she was about to shoot from the knight when kneeling at her feet in bitter agony he ventured to lay his hand upon her robe and oppose her departure  heardst thou not what i said dull slave she said turning short round on him and speaking with emphasis tell the heathen soldan thy master that i scorn his suit as much as i despise the prostration of a worthless renegade to religion and chivalryto god and to his lady  so saying she burst from him tore her garment from his grasp and left the tent  the voice of neville at the same time summoned him from without exhausted and stupefied by the distress he had undergone during this interview from which he could only have extricated himself by breach of the engagement which he had formed with king richard the unfortunate knight staggered rather than walked after the english baron till they reached the royal pavilion before which a party of horsemen had just dismounted there were light and motion within the tent and when neville entered with his disguised attendant they found the king with several of his nobility engaged in welcoming those who were newly arrived    chapter xxvi       the tears i shed must ever fall      i weep not for an absent swain      for time may happier hours recall      and parted lovers meet again       i weep not for the silent dead      their pains are past their sorrows oer      and those that loved their steps must tread      when death shall join to part no more       but worse than absence worse than death      she wept her lovers sullied fame      and fired with all the pride of birth      she wept a soldiers injured name             ballad  the frank and bold voice of richard was heard in joyous gratulation  thomas de vaux stout tom of the gills by the head of king henry thou art welcome to me as ever was flask of wine to a jolly toper i should scarce have known how to order my battlearray unless i had thy bulky form in mine eye as a landmark to form my ranks upon we shall have blows anon thomas if the saints be gracious to us and had we fought in thine absence i would have looked to hear of thy being found hanging upon an eldertree  i should have borne my disappointment with more christian patience i trust said thomas de vaux than to have died the death of an apostate but i thank your grace for my welcome which is the more generous as it respects a banquet of blows of which saving your pleasure you are ever too apt to engross the larger share but here have i brought one to whom your grace will i know give a yet warmer welcome  the person who now stepped forward to make obeisance to richard was a young man of low stature and slight form his dress was as modest as his figure was unimpressive but he bore on his bonnet a gold buckle with a gem the lustre of which could only be rivalled by the brilliancy of the eye which the bonnet shaded it was the only striking feature in his countenance but when once noticed it ever made a strong impression on the spectator about his neck there hung in a scarf of skyblue silk a wrest as it was calledthat is the key with which a harp is tuned and which was of solid gold  this personage would have kneeled reverently to richard but the monarch raised him in joyful haste pressed him to his bosom warmly and kissed him on either side of the face  blondel de nesle he exclaimed joyfullywelcome from cyprus my king of minstrelswelcome to the king of england who rates not his own dignity more highly than he does thine i have been sick man and by my soul i believe it was for lack of thee for were i half way to the gate of heaven methinks thy strains could call me back and what news my gentle master from the land of the lyre anything fresh from the trouveurs of provence anything from the minstrels of merry normandy above all hast thou thyself been busy but i need not ask theethou canst not be idle if thou wouldst thy noble qualities are like a fire burning within and compel thee to pour thyself out in music and song  something i have learned and something i have done noble king answered the celebrated blondel with a retiring modesty which all richards enthusiastic admiration of his skill had been unable to banish  we will hear thee manwe will hear thee instantly said the king then touching blondels shoulder kindly he added that is if thou art not fatigued with thy journey for i would sooner ride my best horse to death than injure a note of thy voice  my voice is as ever at the service of my royal patron said blondel but your majesty he added looking at some papers on the table seems more importantly engaged and the hour waxes late  not a whit man not a whit my dearest blondel i did but sketch an array of battle against the saracens a thing of a moment almost as soon done as the routing of them  methinks however said thomas de vaux it were not unfit to inquire what soldiers your grace hath to array i bring reports on that subject from ascalon  thou art a mule thomas said the kinga very mule for dullness and obstinacy come noblesa halla hallrange ye around him give blondel the tabouret where is his harpbeareror soft lend him my harp his own may be damaged by the journey  i would your grace would take my report said thomas de vaux i have ridden far and have more list to my bed than to have my ears tickled  thy ears tickled said the king that must be with a woodcocks feather and not with sweet sounds hark thee thomas do thine ears know the singing of blondel from the braying of an ass  in faith my liege replied thomas i cannot well say but setting blondel out of the question who is a born gentleman and doubtless of high acquirements i shall never for the sake of your graces question look on a minstrel but i shall think upon an ass  and might not your manners said richard have excepted me who am a gentleman born as well as blondel and like him a guildbrother of the joyeuse science  your grace should remember said de vaux smiling that tis useless asking for manners from a mule  most truly spoken said the king and an illconditioned animal thou art but come hither master mule and be unloaded that thou mayest get thee to thy litter without any music being wasted on thee meantime do thou good brother of salisbury go to our consorts tent and tell her that blondel has arrived with his budget fraught with the newest minstrelsy bid her come hither instantly and do thou escort her and see that our cousin edith plantagenet remain not behind  his eye then rested for a moment on the nubian with that expression of doubtful meaning which his countenance usually displayed when he looked at him  ha our silent and secret messenger returnedstand up slave behind the back of de neville and thou shalt hear presently sounds which will make thee bless god that he afflicted thee rather with dumbness than deafness  so saying he turned from the rest of the company towards de vaux and plunged instantly into the military details which that baron laid before him  about the time that the lord of gilsland had finished his audience a messenger announced that the queen and her attendants were approaching the royal tenta flask of wine ho said the king of old king isaacs longsaved cyprus which we won when we stormed famagosta fill to the stout lord of gilsland gentlesa more careful and faithful servant never had any prince  i am glad said thomas de vaux that your grace finds the mule a useful slave though his voice be less musical than horsehair or wire  what thou canst not yet digest that quip of the mule said richard wash it down with a brimming flagon man or thou wilt choke upon it why sowell pulledand now i will tell thee thou art a soldier as well as i and we must brook each others jests in the hall as each others blows in the tourney and love each other the harder we hit by my faith if thou didst not hit me as hard as i did thee in our late encounter thou gavest all thy wit to the thrust but here lies the difference betwixt thee and blondel thou art but my comradei might say my pupilin the art of war blondel is my master in the science of minstrelsy and music to thee i permit the freedom of intimacy to him i must do reverence as to my superior in his art come man be not peevish but remain and hear our glee  to see your majesty in such cheerful mood said the lord of gilsland by my faith i could remain till blondel had achieved the great romance of king arthur which lasts for three days  we will not tax your patience so deeply said the king but see yonder glare of torches without shows that our consort approaches away to receive her man and win thyself grace in the brightest eyes of christendom nay never stop to adjust thy cloak see thou hast let neville come between the wind and the sails of thy galley  he was never before me in the field of battle said de vaux not greatly pleased to see himself anticipated by the more active service of the chamberlain  no neither he nor any one went before thee there my good tom of the gills said the king unless it was ourself now and then  ay my liege said de vaux and let us do justice to the unfortunate the unhappy knight of the leopard hath been before me too at a season for look you he weighs less on horseback and so  hush said the king interrupting him in a peremptory tone not a word of him and instantly stepped forward to greet his royal consort and when he had done so he presented to her blondel as king of minstrelsy and his master in the gay science berengaria who well knew that her royal husbands passion for poetry and music almost equalled his appetite for warlike fame and that blondel was his especial favourite took anxious care to receive him with all the flattering distinctions due to one whom the king delighted to honour yet it was evident that though blondel made suitable returns to the compliments showered on him something too abundantly by the royal beauty he owned with deeper reverence and more humble gratitude the simple and graceful welcome of edith whose kindly greeting appeared to him perhaps sincere in proportion to its brevity and simplicity  both the queen and her royal husband were aware of this distinction and richard seeing his consort somewhat piqued at the preference assigned to his cousin by which perhaps he himself did not feel much gratified said in the hearing of both we minstrels berengaria as thou mayest see by the bearing of our master blondel pay more reverence to a severe judge like our kinswoman than to a kindly partial friend like thyself who is willing to take our worth upon trust  edith was moved by this sarcasm of her royal kinsman and hesitated not to reply that to be a harsh and severe judge was not an attribute proper to her alone of all the plantagenets  she had perhaps said more having some touch of the temper of that house which deriving their name and cognizance from the lowly broom planta genista assumed as an emblem of humility were perhaps one of the proudest families that ever ruled in england but her eye when kindling in her reply suddenly caught those of the nubian although he endeavoured to conceal himself behind the nobles who were present and she sunk upon a seat turning so pale that queen berengaria deemed herself obliged to call for water and essences and to go through the other ceremonies appropriate to a ladys swoon richard who better estimated ediths strength of mind called to blondel to assume his seat and commence his lay declaring that minstrelsy was worth every other recipe to recall a plantagenet to life sing us he said that song of the bloody vest of which thou didst formerly give me the argument ere i left cyprus thou must be perfect in it by this time or as our yeomen say thy bow is broken  the anxious eye of the minstrel however dwelt on edith and it was not till he observed her returning colour that he obeyed the repeated commands of the king then accompanying his voice with the harp so as to grace but yet not drown the sense of what he sung he chanted in a sort of recitative one of those ancient adventures of love and knighthood which were wont of yore to win the public attention so soon as he began to prelude the insignificance of his personal appearance seemed to disappear and his countenance glowed with energy and inspiration his full manly mellow voice so absolutely under command of the purest taste thrilled on every ear and to every heart richard rejoiced as after victory called out the appropriate summons for silence listen lords in bower and hall while with the zeal of a patron at once and a pupil he arranged the circle around and hushed them into silence and he himself sat down with an air of expectation and interest not altogether unmixed with the gravity of the professed critic the courtiers turned their eyes on the king that they might be ready to trace and imitate the emotions his features should express and thomas de vaux yawned tremendously as one who submitted unwillingly to a wearisome penance the song of blondel was of course in the norman language but the verses which follow express its meaning and its manner                   the bloody vest       twas near the fair city of benevent      when the sun was setting on bough and bent      and knights were preparing in bower and tent      on the eve of the baptists tournament      when in lincoln green a stripling gent      well seeming a page by a princess sent      wanderd the camp and still as he went      inquired for the englishman thomas a kent       far hath he fard and farther must fare      till he finds his pavilion nor stately nor rare      little save iron and steel was there      and as lacking the coin to pay armourers care      with his sinewy arms to the shoulders bare      the good knight with hammer and file did repair      the mail that tomorrow must see him wear      for the honour of saint john and his lady fair       thus speaks my lady the page said he      and the knight bent lowly both head and knee      she is benevents princess so high in degree      and thou art as lowly as knight may well be      he that would climb so lofty a tree      or spring such a gulf as divides her from thee      must dare some high deed by which all men may see      his ambition is backd by his hie chivalrie       therefore thus speaks my lady the fair page he said      and the knight lowly louted with hand and with head      fling aside the good armour in which thou art clad      and don thou this weed of her nightgear instead      for a hauberk of steel a kirtle of thread      and charge thus attird in the tournament dread      and fight as thy wont is where most blood is shed      and bring honour away or remain with the dead  untroubled in his look and untroubled in his breast the knight the weed hath taken and reverently hath kissd now blessed be the moment the messenger be blest much honourd do i hold me in my ladys high behest and say unto my lady in this dear nightweed dressd to the best armed champion i will not veil my crest but if i live and bear me well tis her turn to take the test here gentles ends the foremost fytte of the lay of the bloody vest  thou hast changed the measure upon us unawares in that last couplet my blondel said the king  most true my lord said blondel i rendered the verses from the italian of an old harper whom i met in cyprus and not having had time either to translate it accurately or commit it to memory i am fain to supply gaps in the music and the verse as i can upon the spur of the moment as you see boors mend a quickset fence with a fagot  nay on my faith said the king i like these rattling rolling alexandrines methinks they come more twangingly off to the music than that briefer measure  both are licensed as is well known to your grace answered blondel  they are so blondel said richard yet methinks the scene where there is like to be fighting will go best on in these same thundering alexandrines which sound like the charge of cavalry while the other measure is but like the sidelong amble of a ladys palfrey  it shall be as your grace pleases replied blondel and began again to prelude  nay first cherish thy fancy with a cup of fiery chios wine said the king and hark thee i would have thee fling away that newfangled restriction of thine of terminating in accurate and similar rhymes they are a constraint on thy flow of fancy and make thee resemble a man dancing in fetters  the fetters are easily flung off at least said blondel again sweeping his fingers over the strings as one who would rather have played than listened to criticism  but why put them on man continued the king wherefore thrust thy genius into iron bracelets i marvel how you got forward at all i am sure i should not have been able to compose a stanza in yonder hampered measure  blondel looked down and busied himself with the strings of his harp to hide an involuntary smile which crept over his features but it escaped not richards observation  by my faith thou laughest at me blondel he said and in good truth every man deserves it who presumes to play the master when he should be the pupil but we kings get bad habits of selfopinion come on with thy lay dearest blondelon after thine own fashion better than aught that we can suggest though we must needs be talking  blondel resumed the lay but as extemporaneous composition was familiar to him he failed not to comply with the kings hints and was perhaps not displeased to show with how much ease he could newmodel a poem even while in the act of recitation                      the bloody vest                      fytte second       the baptists fair morrow beheld gallant feats      there was winning of honour and losing of seats      there was hewing with falchions and splintering of staves      the victors won glory the vanquishd won graves      oh many a knight there fought bravely and well      yet one was accounted his peers to excel      and twas he whose sole armour on body and breast      seemd the weed of a damsel when bouned for her rest       there were some dealt him wounds that were bloody and sore      but others respected his plight and forbore      it is some oath of honour they said and i trow      twere unknightly to slay him achieving his vow      then the prince for his sake bade the tournament cease      he flung down his warder the trumpets sung peace      and the judges declare and competitors yield      that the knight of the nightgear was first in the field       the feast it was nigh and the mass it was nigher      when before the fair princess low looted a squire      and deliverd a garment unseemly to view      with swordcut and spearthrust all hackd and piercd through      all rent and all tatterd all clotted with blood      with foam of the horses with dust and with mud      not the point of that ladys small finger i ween      could have rested on spot was unsullied and clean       this token my master sir thomas a kent      restores to the princess of fair benevent      he that climbs the tall tree has won right to the fruit      he that leaps the wide gulf should prevail in his suit      through lifes utmost peril the prize i have won      and now must the faith of my mistress be shown      for she who prompts knights on such danger to run      must avouch his true service in front of the sun       i restore says my master the garment ive worn      and i claim of the princess to don it in turn      for its stains and its rents she should prize it the more      since by shame tis unsullied though crimsond with gore      then deep blushd the princessyet kissd she and pressd      the bloodspotted robes to her lips and her breast      go tell my true knight church and chamber shall show      if i value the blood on this garment or no       and when it was time for the nobles to pass      in solemn procession to minster and mass      the first walkd the princess in purple and pall      but the bloodbesmeard nightrobe she wore over all      and eke in the hall where they all sat at dine      when she knelt to her father and profferd the wine      over all her rich robes and state jewels she wore      that wimple unseemly bedabbled with gore       then lords whisperd ladies as well you may think      and ladies replied with nod titter and wink      and the prince who in anger and shame had lookd down      turnd at length to his daughter and spoke with a frown      now since thou hast publishd thy folly and guilt      een atone with thy hand for the blood thou hast spilt      yet sore for your boldness you both will repent      when you wander as exiles from fair benevent       then out spoke stout thomas in hall where he stood      exhausted and feeble but dauntless of mood      the blood that i lost for this daughter of thine      i pourd forth as freely as flask gives its wine      and if for my sake she brooks penance and blame      do not doubt i will save her from suffering and shame      and light will she reck of thy princedom and rent      when i hail her in england the countess of kent   a murmur of applause ran through the assembly following the example of richard himself who loaded with praises his favourite minstrel and ended by presenting him with a ring of considerable value the queen hastened to distinguish the favourite by a rich bracelet and many of the nobles who were present followed the royal example  is our cousin edith said the king become insensible to the sound of the harp she once loved  she thanks blondel for his lay replied edith but doubly the kindness of the kinsman who suggested it  thou art angry cousin said the king angry because thou hast heard of a woman more wayward than thyself but you escape me not i will walk a space homeward with you towards the queens pavilion we must have conference together ere the night has waned into morning  the queen and her attendants were now on foot and the other guests withdrew from the royal tent a train with blazing torches and an escort of archers awaited berengaria without the pavilion and she was soon on her way homeward richard as he had proposed walked beside his kinswoman and compelled her to accept of his arm as her support so that they could speak to each other without being overheard  what answer then am i to return to the noble soldan said richard the kings and princes are falling from me edith this new quarrel hath alienated them once more i would do something for the holy sepulchre by composition if not by victory and the chance of my doing this depends alas on the caprice of a woman i would lay my single spear in the rest against ten of the best lances in christendom rather than argue with a wilful wench who knows not what is for her own good what answer coz am i to return to the soldan it must be decisive  tell him said edith that the poorest of the plantagenets will rather wed with misery than with misbelief  shall i say with slavery edith said the king methinks that is nearer thy thoughts  there is no room said edith for the suspicion you so grossly insinuate slavery of the body might have been pitied but that of the soul is only to be despised shame to thee king of merry england thou hast enthralled both the limbs and the spirit of a knight one scarce less famed than thyself  should i not prevent my kinswoman from drinking poison by sullying the vessel which contained it if i saw no other means of disgusting her with the fatal liquor replied the king  it is thyself answered edith that would press me to drink poison because it is proffered in a golden chalice  edith said richard i cannot force thy resolution but beware you shut not the door which heaven opens the hermit of engaddihe whom popes and councils have regarded as a prophethath read in the stars that thy marriage shall reconcile me with a powerful enemy and that thy husband shall be christian leaving thus the fairest ground to hope that the conversion of the soldan and the bringing in of the sons of ishmael to the pale of the church will be the consequence of thy wedding with saladin come thou must make some sacrifice rather than mar such happy prospects  men may sacrifice rams and goats said edith but not honour and conscience i have heard that it was the dishonour of a christian maiden which brought the saracens into spain the shame of another is no likely mode of expelling them from palestine  dost thou call it shame to become an empress said the king  i call it shame and dishonour to profane a christian sacrament by entering into it with an infidel whom it cannot bind and i call it foul dishonour that i the descendant of a christian princess should become of free will the head of a haram of heathen concubines  well kinswoman said the king after a pause i must not quarrel with thee though i think thy dependent condition might have dictated more compliance  my liege replied edith your grace hath worthily succeeded to all the wealth dignity and dominion of the house of plantagenetdo not therefore begrudge your poor kinswoman some small share of their pride  by my faith wench said the king thou hast unhorsed me with that very word so we will kiss and be friends i will presently dispatch thy answer to saladin but after all coz were it not better to suspend your answer till you have seen him men say he is preeminently handsome  there is no chance of our meeting my lord said edith  by saint george but there is next to a certainty of it said the king for saladin will doubtless afford us a free field for the doing of this new battle of the standard and will witness it himself berengaria is wild to behold it also and i dare be sworn not a feather of you her companions and attendants will remain behindleast of all thou thyself fair coz but come we have reached the pavilion and must part not in unkindness thou ohnay thou must seal it with thy lip as well as thy hand sweet edithit is my right as a sovereign to kiss my pretty vassals  he embraced her respectfully and affectionately and returned through the moonlit camp humming to himself such snatches of blondels lay as he could recollect  on his arrival he lost no time in making up his dispatches for saladin and delivered them to the nubian with a charge to set out by peep of day on his return to the soldan    chapter xxvii       we heard the techirso these arabs call      their shout of onset when with loud acclaim      they challenge heaven to give them victory         siege of damascus  on the subsequent morning richard was invited to a conference by philip of france in which the latter with many expressions of his high esteem for his brother of england communicated to him in terms extremely courteous but too explicit to be misunderstood his positive intention to return to europe and to the cares of his kingdom as entirely despairing of future success in their undertaking with their diminished forces and civil discords richard remonstrated but in vain and when the conference ended he received without surprise a manifesto from the duke of austria and several other princes announcing a resolution similar to that of philip and in no modified terms assigning for their defection from the cause of the cross the inordinate ambition and arbitrary domination of richard of england all hopes of continuing the war with any prospect of ultimate success were now abandoned and richard while he shed bitter tears over his disappointed hopes of glory was little consoled by the recollection that the failure was in some degree to be imputed to the advantages which he had given his enemies by his own hasty and imprudent temper  they had not dared to have deserted my father thus he said to de vaux in the bitterness of his resentment no slanders they could have uttered against so wise a king would have been believed in christendom whereasfool that i ami have not only afforded them a pretext for deserting me but even a colour for casting all the blame of the rupture upon my unhappy foibles  these thoughts were so deeply galling to the king that de vaux was rejoiced when the arrival of an ambassador from saladin turned his reflections into a different channel  this new envoy was an emir much respected by the soldan whose name was abdallah el hadgi he derived his descent from the family of the prophet and the race or tribe of hashem in witness of which genealogy he wore a green turban of large dimensions he had also three times performed the journey to mecca from which he derived his epithet of el hadgi or the pilgrim notwithstanding these various pretensions to sanctity abdallah was for an arab a boon companion who enjoyed a merry tale and laid aside his gravity so far as to quaff a blithe flagon when secrecy ensured him against scandal he was likewise a statesman whose abilities had been used by saladin in various negotiations with the christian princes and particularly with richard to whom el hadgi was personally known and acceptable animated by the cheerful acquiescence with which the envoy of saladin afforded a fair field for the combat a safe conduct for all who might choose to witness it and offered his own person as a guarantee of his fidelity richard soon forgot his disappointed hopes and the approaching dissolution of the christian league in the interesting discussions preceding a combat in the lists  the station called the diamond of the desert was assigned for the place of conflict as being nearly at an equal distance betwixt the christian and saracen camps it was agreed that conrade of montserrat the defendant with his godfathers the archduke of austria and the grand master of the templars should appear there on the day fixed for the combat with a hundred armed followers and no more that richard of england and his brother salisbury who supported the accusation should attend with the same number to protect his champion and that the soldan should bring with him a guard of five hundred chosen followers a band considered as not more than equal to the two hundred christian lances such persons of consideration as either party chose to invite to witness the contest were to wear no other weapons than their swords and to come without defensive armour the soldan undertook the preparation of the lists and to provide accommodations and refreshments of every kind for all who were to assist at the solemnity and his letters expressed with much courtesy the pleasure which he anticipated in the prospect of a personal and peaceful meeting with the melech ric and his anxious desire to render his reception as agreeable as possible  all preliminaries being arranged and communicated to the defendant and his godfathers abdullah the hadgi was admitted to a more private interview where he heard with delight the strains of blondel having first carefully put his green turban out of sight and assumed a greek cap in its stead he requited the norman minstrels music with a drinking song from the persian and quaffed a hearty flagon of cyprus wine to show that his practice matched his principles on the next day grave and sober as the waterdrinker mirglip he bent his brow to the ground before saladins footstool and rendered to the soldan an account of his embassy  on the day before that appointed for the combat conrade and his friends set off by daybreak to repair to the place assigned and richard left the camp at the same hour and for the same purpose but as had been agreed upon he took his journey by a different routea precaution which had been judged necessary to prevent the possibility of a quarrel betwixt their armed attendants  the good king himself was in no humour for quarrelling with any one nothing could have added to his pleasurable anticipations of a desperate and bloody combat in the lists except his being in his own royal person one of the combatants and he was half in charity again even with conrade of montserrat lightly armed richly dressed and gay as a bridegroom on the eve of his nuptials richard caracoled along by the side of queen berengarias litter pointing out to her the various scenes through which they passed and cheering with tale and song the bosom of the inhospitable wilderness the former route of the queens pilgrimage to engaddi had been on the other side of the chain of mountains so that the ladies were strangers to the scenery of the desert and though berengaria knew her husbands disposition too well not to endeavour to seem interested in what he was pleased either to say or to sing she could not help indulging some female fears when she found herself in the howling wilderness with so small an escort which seemed almost like a moving speck on the bosom of the plain and knew at the same time they were not so distant from the camp of saladin but what they might be in a moment surprised and swept off by an overpowering host of his fieryfooted cavalry should the pagan be faithless enough to embrace an opportunity thus tempting but when she hinted these suspicions to richard he repelled them with displeasure and disdain it were worse than ingratitude he said to doubt the good faith of the generous soldan  yet the same doubts and fears recurred more than once not to the timid mind of the queen alone but to the firmer and more candid soul of edith plantagenet who had no such confidence in the faith of the moslem as to render her perfectly at ease when so much in their power and her surprise had been far less than her terror if the desert around had suddenly resounded with the shout of allah hu and a band of arab cavalry had pounced on them like vultures on their prey nor were these suspicions lessened when as evening approached they were aware of a single arab horseman distinguished by his turban and long lance hovering on the edge of a small eminence like a hawk poised in the air and who instantly on the appearance of the royal retinue darted off with the speed of the same bird when it shoots down the wind and disappears from the horizon  we must be near the station said king richard and yonder cavalier is one of saladins outpostsmethinks i hear the noise of the moorish horns and cymbals get you into order my hearts and form yourselves around the ladies soldierlike and firmly  as he spoke each knight squire and archer hastily closed in upon his appointed ground and they proceeded in the most compact order which made their numbers appear still smaller and to say the truth though there might be no fear there was anxiety as well as curiosity in the attention with which they listened to the wild bursts of moorish music which came ever and anon more distinctly from the quarter in which the arab horseman had been seen to disappear  de vaux spoke in a whisper to the king were it not well my liege to send a page to the top of that sandbank or would it stand with your pleasure that i prick forward methinks by all yonder clash and clang if there be no more than five hundred men beyond the sandhills half of the soldans retinue must be drummers and cymbaltossers shall i spur on  the baron had checked his horse with the bit and was just about to strike him with the spurs when the king exclaimed not for the world such a caution would express suspicion and could do little to prevent surprise which however i apprehend not  they advanced accordingly in close and firm order till they surmounted the line of low sandhills and came in sight of the appointed station when a splendid but at the same time a startling spectacle awaited them  the diamond of the desert so lately a solitary fountain distinguished only amid the waste by solitary groups of palmtrees was now the centre of an encampment the embroidered flags and gilded ornaments of which glittered far and wide and reflected a thousand rich tints against the setting sun the coverings of the large pavilions were of the gayest coloursscarlet bright yellow pale blue and other gaudy and gleaming huesand the tops of their pillars or tentpoles were decorated with golden pomegranates and small silken flags but besides these distinguished pavilions there were what thomas de vaux considered as a portentous number of the ordinary black tents of the arabs being sufficient as he conceived to accommodate according to the eastern fashion a host of five thousand men a number of arabs and kurds fully corresponding to the extent of the encampment were hastily assembling each leading his horse in his hand and their muster was accompanied by an astonishing clamour of their noisy instruments of martial music by which in all ages the warfare of the arabs has been animated  they soon formed a deep and confused mass of dismounted cavalry in front of their encampment when at the signal of a shrill cry which arose high over the clangour of the music each cavalier sprung to his saddle a cloud of dust arising at the moment of this manoeuvre hid from richard and his attendants the camp the palmtrees and the distant ridge of mountains as well as the troops whose sudden movement had raised the cloud and ascending high over their heads formed itself into the fantastic forms of writhed pillars domes and minarets another shrill yell was heard from the bosom of this cloudy tabernacle it was the signal for the cavalry to advance which they did at full gallop disposing themselves as they came forward so as to come in at once on the front flanks and rear of richards little bodyguard who were thus surrounded and almost choked by the dense clouds of dust enveloping them on each side through which were seen alternately and lost the grim forms and wild faces of the saracens brandishing and tossing their lances in every possible direction with the wildest cries and halloos and frequently only reining up their horses when within a spears length of the christians while those in the rear discharged over the heads of both parties thick volleys of arrows one of these struck the litter in which the queen was seated who loudly screamed and the red spot was on richards brow in an instant  ha saint george he exclaimed we must take some order with this infidel scum  but edith whose litter was near thrust her head out and with her hand holding one of the shafts exclaimed royal richard beware what you do see these arrows are headless  noble sensible wench exclaimed richard by heaven thou shamest us all by thy readiness of thought and eyebe not moved my english hearts he exclaimed to his followers their arrows have no headsand their spears too lack the steel points it is but a wild welcome after their savage fashion though doubtless they would rejoice to see us daunted or disturbed move onward slow and steady  the little phalanx moved forward accordingly accompanied on all sides by the arabs with the shrillest and most piercing cries the bowmen meanwhile displaying their agility by shooting as near the crests of the christians as was possible without actually hitting them while the lancers charged each other with such rude blows of their blunt weapons that more than one of them lost his saddle and wellnigh his life in this rough sport all this though designed to express welcome had rather a doubtful appearance in the eyes of the europeans  as they had advanced nearly half way towards the camp king richard and his suite forming as it were the nucleus round which this tumultuary body of horsemen howled whooped skirmished and galloped creating a scene of indescribable confusion another shrill cry was heard on which all these irregulars who were on the front and upon the flanks of the little body of europeans wheeled off and forming themselves into a long and deep column followed with comparative order and silence in the rear of richards troops the dust began now to dissipate in their front when there advanced to meet them through that cloudy veil a body of cavalry of a different and more regular description completely armed with offensive and defensive weapons and who might well have served as a bodyguard to the proudest of eastern monarchs this splendid troop consisted of five hundred men and each horse which it contained was worth an earls ransom the riders were georgian and circassian slaves in the very prime of life their helmets and hauberks were formed of steel rings so bright that they shone like silver their vestures were of the gayest colours and some of cloth of gold or silver the sashes were twisted with silk and gold their rich turbans were plumed and jewelled and their sabres and poniards of damascene steel were adorned with gold and gems on hilt and scabbard  this splendid array advanced to the sound of military music and when they met the christian body they opened their files to the right and left and let them enter between their ranks richard now assumed the foremost place in his troop aware that saladin himself was approaching nor was it long when in the centre of his bodyguard surrounded by his domestic officers and those hideous negroes who guard the eastern haram and whose misshapen forms were rendered yet more frightful by the richness of their attire came the soldan with the look and manners of one on whose brow nature had written this is a king in his snowwhite turban vest and wide eastern trousers wearing a sash of scarlet silk without any other ornament saladin might have seemed the plainestdressed man in his own guard but closer inspection discerned in his turban that inestimable gem which was called by the poets the sea of light the diamond on which his signet was engraved and which he wore in a ring was probably worth all the jewels of the english crown and a sapphire which terminated the hilt of his cangiar was not of much inferior value it should be added that to protect himself from the dust which in the vicinity of the dead sea resembles the finest ashes or perhaps out of oriental pride the soldan wore a sort of veil attached to his turban which partly obscured the view of his noble features he rode a milkwhite arabian which bore him as if conscious and proud of his noble burden  there was no need of further introduction the two heroic monarchsfor such they both werethrew themselves at once from horseback and the troops halting and the music suddenly ceasing they advanced to meet each other in profound silence and after a courteous inclination on either side they embraced as brethren and equals the pomp and display upon both sides attracted no further noticeno one saw aught save richard and saladin and they too beheld nothing but each other the looks with which richard surveyed saladin were however more intently curious than those which the soldan fixed upon him and the soldan also was the first to break silence  the melech ric is welcome to saladin as water to this desert i trust he hath no distrust of this numerous array excepting the armed slaves of my household those who surround you with eyes of wonder and of welcome areeven the humblest of themthe privileged nobles of my thousand tribes for who that could claim a title to be present would remain at home when such a prince was to be seen as richard with the terrors of whose name even on the sands of yemen the nurse stills her child and the free arab subdues his restive steed  and these are all nobles of araby said richard looking around on wild forms with their persons covered with haiks their countenance swart with the sunbeams their teeth as white as ivory their black eyes glancing with fierce and preternatural lustre from under the shade of their turbans and their dress being in general simple even to meanness  they claim such rank said saladin but though numerous they are within the conditions of the treaty and bear no arms but the sabreeven the iron of their lances is left behind  i fear muttered de vaux in english they have left them where they can be soon found a most flourishing house of peers i confess and would find westminster hall something too narrow for them  hush de vaux said richard i command theenoble saladin he said suspicion and thou cannot exist on the same ground seest thou pointing to the litters i too have brought some champions with me though armed perhaps in breach of agreement for bright eyes and fair features are weapons which cannot be left behind  the soldan turning to the litters made an obeisance as lowly as if looking towards mecca and kissed the sand in token of respect  nay said richard they will not fear a closer encounter brother wilt thou not ride towards their litters and the curtains will be presently withdrawn  that may allah prohibit said saladin since not an arab looks on who would not think it shame to the noble ladies to be seen with their faces uncovered  thou shalt see them then in private brother answered richard  to what purpose answered saladin mournfully thy last letter was to the hopes which i had entertained like water to fire and wherefore should i again light a flame which may indeed consume but cannot cheer me but will not my brother pass to the tent which his servant hath prepared for him my principal black slave hath taken order for the reception of the princesses the officers of my household will attend your followers and ourself will be the chamberlain of the royal richard  he led the way accordingly to a splendid pavilion where was everything that royal luxury could devise de vaux who was in attendance then removed the chappe capa or long ridingcloak which richard wore and he stood before saladin in the close dress which showed to advantage the strength and symmetry of his person while it bore a strong contrast to the flowing robes which disguised the thin frame of the eastern monarch it was richards twohanded sword that chiefly attracted the attention of the saracena broad straight blade the seemingly unwieldy length of which extended wellnigh from the shoulder to the heel of the wearer  had i not said saladin seen this brand flaming in the front of battle like that of azrael i had scarce believed that human arm could wield it might i request to see the melech ric strike one blow with it in peace and in pure trial of strength  willingly noble saladin answered richard and looking around for something whereon to exercise his strength he saw a steel mace held by one of the attendants the handle being of the same metal and about an inch and a half in diameter this he placed on a block of wood  the anxiety of de vaux for his masters honour led him to whisper in english for the blessed virgins sake beware what you attempt my liege your full strength is not as yet returnedgive no triumph to the infidel  peace fool said richard standing firm on his ground and casting a fierce glance around thinkest thou that i can fail in his presence  the glittering broadsword wielded by both his hands rose aloft to the kings left shoulder circled round his head descended with the sway of some terrific engine and the bar of iron rolled on the ground in two pieces as a woodsman would sever a sapling with a hedgingbill  by the head of the prophet a most wonderful blow said the soldan critically and accurately examining the iron bar which had been cut asunder and the blade of the sword was so well tempered as to exhibit not the least token of having suffered by the feat it had performed he then took the kings hand and looking on the size and muscular strength which it exhibited laughed as he placed it beside his own so lank and thin so inferior in brawn and sinew  ay look well said de vaux in english it will be long ere your long jackanapes fingers do such a feat with your fine gilded reapinghook there  silence de vaux said richard by our lady he understands or guesses thy meaningbe not so broad i pray thee  the soldan indeed presently said something i would fain attemptthough wherefore should the weak show their inferiority in presence of the strong yet each land hath its own exercises and this may be new to the melech ric so saying he took from the floor a cushion of silk and down and placed it upright on one end can thy weapon my brother sever that cushion he said to king richard  no surely replied the king no sword on earth were it the excalibur of king arthur can cut that which opposes no steady resistance to the blow  mark then said saladin and tucking up the sleeve of his gown showed his arm thin indeed and spare but which constant exercise had hardened into a mass consisting of nought but bone brawn and sinew he unsheathed his scimitar a curved and narrow blade which glittered not like the swords of the franks but was on the contrary of a dull blue colour marked with ten millions of meandering lines which showed how anxiously the metal had been welded by the armourer wielding this weapon apparently so inefficient when compared to that of richard the soldan stood resting his weight upon his left foot which was slightly advanced he balanced himself a little as if to steady his aim then stepping at once forward drew the scimitar across the cushion applying the edge so dexterously and with so little apparent effort that the cushion seemed rather to fall asunder than to be divided by violence  it is a jugglers trick said de vaux darting forward and snatching up the portion of the cushion which had been cut off as if to assure himself of the reality of the feat there is gramarye in this  the soldan seemed to comprehend him for he undid the sort of veil which he had hitherto worn laid it double along the edge of his sabre extended the weapon edgeways in the air and drawing it suddenly through the veil although it hung on the blade entirely loose severed that also into two parts which floated to different sides of the tent equally displaying the extreme temper and sharpness of the weapon and the exquisite dexterity of him who used it  now in good faith my brother said richard thou art even matchless at the trick of the sword and right perilous were it to meet thee still however i put some faith in a downright english blow and what we cannot do by sleight we eke out by strength nevertheless in truth thou art as expert in inflicting wounds as my sage hakim in curing them i trust i shall see the learned leech i have much to thank him for and had brought some small present  as he spoke saladin exchanged his turban for a tartar cap he had no sooner done so than de vaux opened at once his extended mouth and his large round eyes and richard gazed with scarce less astonishment while the soldan spoke in a grave and altered voice the sick man saith the poet while he is yet infirm knoweth the physician by his step but when he is recovered he knoweth not even his face when he looks upon him  a miraclea miracle exclaimed richard  of mahounds working doubtless said thomas de vaux  that i should lose my learned hakim said richard merely by absence of his cap and robe and that i should find him again in my royal brother saladin  such is oft the fashion of the world answered the soldan the tattered robe makes not always the dervise  and it was through thy intercession said richard that yonder knight of the leopard was saved from death and by thy artifice that he revisited my camp in disguise  even so replied saladin i was physician enough to know that unless the wounds of his bleeding honour were stanched the days of his life must be few his disguise was more easily penetrated than i had expected from the success of my own  an accident said king richard probably alluding to the circumstance of his applying his lips to the wound of the supposed nubian let me first know that his skin was artificially discoloured and that hint once taken detection became easy for his form and person are not to be forgotten i confidently expect that he will do battle on the morrow  he is full in preparation and high in hope said the soldan i have furnished him with weapons and horse thinking nobly of him from what i have seen under various disguises  knows he now said richard to whom he lies under obligation  he doth replied the saracen i was obliged to confess my person when i unfolded my purpose  and confessed he aught to you said the king of england  nothing explicit replied the soldan but from much that passed between us i conceive his love is too highly placed to be happy in its issue  and thou knowest that his daring and insolent passion crossed thine own wishes said richard  i might guess so much said saladin but his passion had existed ere my wishes had been formedand i must now add is likely to survive them i cannot in honour revenge me for my disappointment on him who had no hand in it or if this highborn dame loved him better than myself who can say that she did not justice to a knight of her own religion who is full of nobleness  yet of too mean lineage to mix with the blood of plantagenet said richard haughtily  such may be your maxims in frangistan replied the soldan our poets of the eastern countries say that a valiant cameldriver is worthy to kiss the lip of a fair queen when a cowardly prince is not worthy to salute the hem of her garment but with your permission noble brother i must take leave of thee for the present to receive the duke of austria and yonder nazarene knight much less worthy of hospitality but who must yet be suitably entreated not for their sakes but for mine own honourfor what saith the sage lokman say not that the food is lost unto thee which is given to the stranger for if his body be strengthened and fattened therewithal not less is thine own worship and good name cherished and augmented  the saracen monarch departed from king richards tent and having indicated to him rather with signs than with speech where the pavilion of the queen and her attendants was pitched he went to receive the marquis of montserrat and his attendants for whom with less goodwill but with equal splendour the magnificent soldan had provided accommodations the most ample refreshments both in the oriental and after the european fashion were spread before the royal and princely guests of saladin each in their own separate pavilion and so attentive was the soldan to the habits and taste of his visitors that grecian slaves were stationed to present them with the goblet which is the abomination of the sect of mohammed ere richard had finished his meal the ancient omrah who had brought the soldans letter to the christian camp entered with a plan of the ceremonial to be observed on the succeeding day of combat richard who knew the taste of his old acquaintance invited him to pledge him in a flagon of wine of shiraz but abdallah gave him to understand with a rueful aspect that selfdenial in the present circumstances was a matter in which his life was concerned for that saladin tolerant in many respects both observed and enforced by high penalties the laws of the prophet  nay then said richard if he loves not wine that lightener of the human heart his conversion is not to be hoped for and the prediction of the mad priest of engaddi goes like chaff down the wind  the king then addressed himself to settle the articles of combat which cost a considerable time as it was necessary on some points to consult with the opposite parties as well as with the soldan  they were at length finally agreed upon and adjusted by a protocol in french and in arabian which was subscribed by saladin as umpire of the field and by richard and leopold as guarantees for the two combatants as the omrah took his final leave of king richard for the evening de vaux entered  the good knight he said who is to do battle tomorrow requests to know whether he may not tonight pay duty to his royal godfather  hast thou seen him de vaux said the king smiling and didst thou know an ancient acquaintance  by our lady of lanercost answered de vaux there are so many surprises and changes in this land that my poor brain turns i scarce knew sir kenneth of scotland till his good hound that had been for a short while under my care came and fawned on me and even then i only knew the tyke by the depth of his chest the roundness of his foot and his manner of baying for the poor gazehound was painted like any venetian courtesan  thou art better skilled in brutes than men de vaux said the king  i will not deny said de vaux i have found them ofttimes the honester animals also your grace is pleased to term me sometimes a brute myself besides that i serve the lion whom all men acknowledge the king of brutes  by saint george there thou brokest thy lance fairly on my brow said the king i have ever said thou hast a sort of wit de vaux marry one must strike thee with a sledgehammer ere it can be made to sparkle but to the present gearis the good knight well armed and equipped  fully my liege and nobly answered de vaux i know the armour well it is that which the venetian commissary offered your highness just ere you became ill for five hundred byzants  and he hath sold it to the infidel soldan i warrant me for a few ducats more and present payment these venetians would sell the sepulchre itself  the armour will never be borne in a nobler cause said de vaux  thanks to the nobleness of the saracen said the king not to the avarice of the venetians  i would to god your grace would be more cautious said the anxious de vaux here are we deserted by all our allies for points of offence given to one or another we cannot hope to prosper upon the land and we have only to quarrel with the amphibious republic to lose the means of retreat by sea  i will take care said richard impatiently but school me no more tell me rather for it is of interest hath the knight a confessor  he hath answered de vaux the hermit of engaddi who erst did him that office when preparing for death attends him on the present occasion the fame of the duel having brought him hither  tis well said richard and now for the knights request say to him richard will receive him when the discharge of his devoir beside the diamond of the desert shall have atoned for his fault beside the mount of saint george and as thou passest through the camp let the queen know i will visit her pavilionand tell blondel to meet me there  de vaux departed and in about an hour afterwards richard wrapping his mantle around him and taking his ghittern in his hand walked in the direction of the queens pavilion several arabs passed him but always with averted heads and looks fixed upon the earth though he could observe that all gazed earnestly after him when he was past this led him justly to conjecture that his person was known to them but that either the soldans commands or their own oriental politeness forbade them to seem to notice a sovereign who desired to remain incognito  when the king reached the pavilion of his queen he found it guarded by those unhappy officials whom eastern jealousy places around the zenana blondel was walking before the door and touched his rote from time to time in a manner which made the africans show their ivory teeth and bear burden with their strange gestures and shrill unnatural voices  what art thou after with this herd of black cattle blondel said the king wherefore goest thou not into the tent  because my trade can neither spare the head nor the fingers said blondel and these honest blackamoors threatened to cut me joint from joint if i pressed forward  well enter with me said the king and i will be thy safeguard  the blacks accordingly lowered pikes and swords to king richard and bent their eyes on the ground as if unworthy to look upon him in the interior of the pavilion they found thomas de vaux in attendance on the queen while berengaria welcomed blondel king richard spoke for some time secretly and apart with his fair kinswoman  at length are we still foes my fair edith he said in a whisper  no my liege said edith in a voice just so low as not to interrupt the music none can bear enmity against king richard when he deigns to show himself as he really is generous and noble as well as valiant and honourable  so saying she extended her hand to him the king kissed it in token of reconciliation and then proceeded  you think my sweet cousin that my anger in this matter was feigned but you are deceived the punishment i inflicted upon this knight was just for he had betrayedno matter for how tempting a bribe fair cousinthe trust committed to him but i rejoice perchance as much as you that tomorrow gives him a chance to win the field and throw back the stain which for a time clung to him upon the actual thief and traitor nofuture times may blame richard for impetuous folly but they shall say that in rendering judgment he was just when he should and merciful when he could  laud not thyself cousin king said edith they may call thy justice cruelty thy mercy caprice  and do not thou pride thyself said the king as if thy knight who hath not yet buckled on his armour were unbelting it in triumphconrade of montserrat is held a good lance what if the scot should lose the day  it is impossible said edith firmly my own eyes saw yonder conrade tremble and change colour like a base thief he is guilty and the trial by combat is an appeal to the justice of god i myself in such a cause would encounter him without fear  by the mass i think thou wouldst wench said the king and beat him to boot for there never breathed a truer plantagenet than thou   he paused and added in a very serious tone see that thou continue to remember what is due to thy birth  what means that advice so seriously given at this moment said edith am i of such light nature as to forget my namemy condition  i will speak plainly edith answered the king and as to a friend what will this knight be to you should he come off victor from yonder lists  to me said edith blushing deep with shame and displeasure what can he be to me more than an honoured knight worthy of such grace as queen berengaria might confer on him had he selected her for his lady instead of a more unworthy choice the meanest knight may devote himself to the service of an empress but the glory of his choice she said proudly must be his reward  yet he hath served and suffered much for you said the king  i have paid his services with honour and applause and his sufferings with tears answered edith had he desired other reward he would have done wisely to have bestowed his affections within his own degree  you would not then wear the bloody nightgear for his sake said king richard  no more answered edith than i would have required him to expose his life by an action in which there was more madness than honour  maidens talk ever thus said the king but when the favoured lover presses his suit she says with a sigh her stars had decreed otherwise  your grace has now for the second time threatened me with the influence of my horoscope edith replied with dignity trust me my liege whatever be the power of the stars your poor kinswoman will never wed either infidel or obscure adventurer permit me that i listen to the music of blondel for the tone of your royal admonitions is scarce so grateful to the ear  the conclusion of the evening offered nothing worthy of notice    chapter xxviii       heard ye the din of battle bray      lance to lance and horse to horse           gray  it had been agreed on account of the heat of the climate that the judicial combat which was the cause of the present assemblage of various nations at the diamond of the desert should take place at one hour after sunrise the wide lists which had been constructed under the inspection of the knight of the leopard enclosed a space of hard sand which was one hundred and twenty yards long by forty in width they extended in length from north to south so as to give both parties the equal advantage of the rising sun saladins royal seat was erected on the western side of the enclosure just in the centre where the combatants were expected to meet in mid encounter opposed to this was a gallery with closed casements so contrived that the ladies for whose accommodation it was erected might see the fight without being themselves exposed to view at either extremity of the lists was a barrier which could be opened or shut at pleasure thrones had been also erected but the archduke perceiving that his was lower than king richards refused to occupy it and coeur de lion who would have submitted to much ere any formality should have interfered with the combat readily agreed that the sponsors as they were called should remain on horseback during the fight at one extremity of the lists were placed the followers of richard and opposed to them were those who accompanied the defender conrade around the throne destined for the soldan were ranged his splendid georgian guards and the rest of the enclosure was occupied by christian and mohammedan spectators  long before daybreak the lists were surrounded by even a larger number of saracens than richard had seen on the preceding evening when the first ray of the suns glorious orb arose above the desert the sonorous call to prayerto prayer was poured forth by the soldan himself and answered by others whose rank and zeal entitled them to act as muezzins it was a striking spectacle to see them all sink to earth for the purpose of repeating their devotions with their faces turned to mecca but when they arose from the ground the suns rays now strengthening fast seemed to confirm the lord of gilslands conjecture of the night before they were flashed back from many a spearhead for the pointless lances of the preceding day were certainly no longer such de vaux pointed it out to his master who answered with impatience that he had perfect confidence in the good faith of the soldan but if de vaux was afraid of his bulky body he might retire  soon after this the noise of timbrels was heard at the sound of which the whole saracen cavaliers threw themselves from their horses and prostrated themselves as if for a second morning prayer this was to give an opportunity to the queen with edith and her attendants to pass from the pavilion to the gallery intended for them fifty guards of saladins seraglio escorted them with naked sabres whose orders were to cut to pieces whomsoever were he prince or peasant should venture to gaze on the ladies as they passed or even presume to raise his head until the cessation of the music should make all men aware that they were lodged in their gallery not to be gazed on by the curious eye  this superstitious observance of oriental reverence to the fair sex called forth from queen berengaria some criticisms very unfavourable to saladin and his country but their den as the royal fair called it being securely closed and guarded by their sable attendants she was under the necessity of contenting herself with seeing and laying aside for the present the still more exquisite pleasure of being seen  meantime the sponsors of both champions went as was their duty to see that they were duly armed and prepared for combat the archduke of austria was in no hurry to perform this part of the ceremony having had rather an unusually severe debauch upon wine of shiraz the preceding evening but the grand master of the temple more deeply concerned in the event of the combat was early before the tent of conrade of montserrat to his great surprise the attendants refused him admittance  do you not know me ye knaves said the grand master in great anger  we do most valiant and reverend answered conrades squire but even you may not at present enterthe marquis is about to confess himself  confess himself exclaimed the templar in a tone where alarm mingled with surprise and scornand to whom i pray thee  my master bid me be secret said the squire on which the grand master pushed past him and entered the tent almost by force  the marquis of montserrat was kneeling at the feet of the hermit of engaddi and in the act of beginning his confession  what means this marquis said the grand master up for shameor if you must needs confess am not i here  i have confessed to you too often already replied conrade with a pale cheek and a faltering voice for gods sake grand master begone and let me unfold my conscience to this holy man  in what is he holier than i am said the grand masterhermit prophet madmansay if thou darest in what thou excellest me  bold and bad man replied the hermit know that i am like the latticed window and the divine light passes through to avail others though alas it helpeth not me thou art like the iron stanchions which neither receive light themselves nor communicate it to any one  prate not to me but depart from this tent said the grand master the marquis shall not confess this morning unless it be to me for i part not from his side  is this your pleasure said the hermit to conrade for think not i will obey that proud man if you continue to desire my assistance  alas said conrade irresolutely what would you have me say farewell for a whilewe will speak anon  o procrastination exclaimed the hermit thou art a soulmurdererunhappy man farewellnot for a while but until we shall both meet no matter where and for thee he added turning to the grand master tremble  tremble replied the templar contemptuously i cannot if i would  the hermit heard not his answer having left the tent  come to this gear hastily said the grand master since thou wilt needs go through the foolery hark theei think i know most of thy frailties by heart so we may omit the detail which may be somewhat a long one and begin with the absolution what signifies counting the spots of dirt that we are about to wash from our hands  knowing what thou art thyself said conrade it is blasphemous to speak of pardoning another  that is not according to the canon lord marquis said the templar thou art more scrupulous than orthodox the absolution of the wicked priest is as effectual as if he were himself a saintotherwise god help the poor penitent what wounded man inquires whether the surgeon that tends his gashes has clean hands or no come shall we to this toy  no said conrade i will rather die unconfessed than mock the sacrament  come noble marquis said the templar rouse up your courage and speak not thus in an hours time thou shalt stand victorious in the lists or confess thee in thy helmet like a valiant knight  alas grand master answered conrade all augurs ill for this affair the strange discovery by the instinct of a dogthe revival of this scottish knight who comes into the lists like a spectreall betokens evil  pshaw said the templar i have seen thee bend thy lance boldly against him in sport and with equal chance of success think thou art but in a tournament and who bears him better in the tiltyard than thoucome squires and armourers your master must be accoutred for the field  the attendants entered accordingly and began to arm the marquis  what morning is without said conrade  the sun rises dimly answered a squire  thou seest grand master said conrade nought smiles on us  thou wilt fight the more coolly my son answered the templar thank heaven that hath tempered the sun of palestine to suit thine occasion  thus jested the grand master but his jests had lost their influence on the harassed mind of the marquis and notwithstanding his attempts to seem gay his gloom communicated itself to the templar  this craven he thought will lose the day in pure faintness and cowardice of heart which he calls tender conscience i whom visions and auguries shake notwho am firm in my purpose as the living rocki should have fought the combat myself would to god the scot may strike him dead on the spot it were next best to his winning the victory but come what will he must have no other confessor than myselfour sins are too much in common and he might confess my share with his own  while these thoughts passed through his mind he continued to assist the marquis in arming but it was in silence  the hour at length arrived the trumpets sounded the knights rode into the lists armed at all points and mounted like men who were to do battle for a kingdoms honour they wore their visors up and riding around the lists three times showed themselves to the spectators both were goodly persons and both had noble countenances but there was an air of manly confidence on the brow of the scota radiancy of hope which amounted even to cheerfulness while although pride and effort had recalled much of conrades natural courage there lowered still on his brow a cloud of ominous despondence even his steed seemed to tread less lightly and blithely to the trumpetsound than the noble arab which was bestrode by sir kenneth and the spruchsprecher shook his head while he observed that while the challenger rode around the lists in the course of the sunthat is from right to leftthe defender made the same circuit widdersinsthat is from left to rightwhich is in most countries held ominous  a temporary altar was erected just beneath the gallery occupied by the queen and beside it stood the hermit in the dress of his order as a carmelite friar other churchmen were also present to this altar the challenger and defender were successively brought forward conducted by their respective sponsors dismounting before it each knight avouched the justice of his cause by a solemn oath on the evangelists and prayed that his success might be according to the truth or falsehood of what he then swore they also made oath that they came to do battle in knightly guise and with the usual weapons disclaiming the use of spells charms or magical devices to incline victory to their side the challenger pronounced his vow with a firm and manly voice and a bold and cheerful countenance when the ceremony was finished the scottish knight looked at the gallery and bent his head to the earth as if in honour of those invisible beauties which were enclosed within then loaded with armour as he was sprung to the saddle without the use of the stirrup and made his courser carry him in a succession of caracoles to his station at the eastern extremity of the lists conrade also presented himself before the altar with boldness enough but his voice as he took the oath sounded hollow as if drowned in his helmet the lips with which he appealed to heaven to adjudge victory to the just quarrel grew white as they uttered the impious mockery as he turned to remount his horse the grand master approached him closer as if to rectify something about the sitting of his gorget and whispered coward and fool recall thy senses and do me this battle bravely else by heaven shouldst thou escape him thou escapest not me  the savage tone in which this was whispered perhaps completed the confusion of the marquiss nerves for he stumbled as he made to horse and though he recovered his feet sprung to the saddle with his usual agility and displayed his address in horsemanship as he assumed his position opposite to the challengers yet the accident did not escape those who were on the watch for omens which might predict the fate of the day  the priests after a solemn prayer that god would show the rightful quarrel departed from the lists the trumpets of the challenger then rung a flourish and a heraldatarms proclaimed at the eastern end of the listshere stands a good knight sir kenneth of scotland champion for the royal king richard of england who accuseth conrade marquis of montserrat of foul treason and dishonour done to the said king  when the words kenneth of scotland announced the name and character of the champion hitherto scarce generally known a loud and cheerful acclaim burst from the followers of king richard and hardly notwithstanding repeated commands of silence suffered the reply of the defendant to be heard he of course avouched his innocence and offered his body for battle the esquires of the combatants now approached and delivered to each his shield and lance assisting to hang the former around his neck that his two hands might remain free one for the management of the bridle the other to direct the lance  the shield of the scot displayed his old bearing the leopard but with the addition of a collar and broken chain in allusion to his late captivity the shield of the marquis bore in reference to his title a serrated and rocky mountain each shook his lance aloft as if to ascertain the weight and toughness of the unwieldy weapon and then laid it in the rest the sponsors heralds and squires now retired to the barriers and the combatants sat opposite to each other face to face with couched lance and closed visor the human form so completely enclosed that they looked more like statues of molten iron than beings of flesh and blood the silence of suspense was now general men breathed thicker and their very souls seemed seated in their eyes while not a sound was to be heard save the snorting and pawing of the good steeds who sensible of what was about to happen were impatient to dash into career they stood thus for perhaps three minutes when at a signal given by the soldan a hundred instruments rent the air with their brazen clamours and each champion striking his horse with the spurs and slacking the rein the horses started into full gallop and the knights met in mid space with a shock like a thunderbolt the victory was not in doubtno not one moment conrade indeed showed himself a practised warrior for he struck his antagonist knightly in the midst of his shield bearing his lance so straight and true that it shivered into splinters from the steel spearhead up to the very gauntlet the horse of sir kenneth recoiled two or three yards and fell on his haunches but the rider easily raised him with hand and rein but for conrade there was no recovery sir kenneths lance had pierced through the shield through a plated corselet of milan steel through a secret or coat of linked mail worn beneath the corselet had wounded him deep in the bosom and borne him from his saddle leaving the truncheon of the lance fixed in his wound the sponsors heralds and saladin himself descending from his throne crowded around the wounded man while sir kenneth who had drawn his sword ere yet he discovered his antagonist was totally helpless now commanded him to avow his guilt the helmet was hastily unclosed and the wounded man gazing wildly on the skies replied what would you more god hath decided justlyi am guilty but there are worse traitors in the camp than i in pity to my soul let me have a confessor  he revived as he uttered these words  the talismanthe powerful remedy royal brother said king richard to saladin  the traitor answered the soldan is more fit to be dragged from the lists to the gallows by the heels than to profit by its virtues and some such fate is in his look he added after gazing fixedly upon the wounded man for though his wound may be cured yet azraels seal is on the wretchs brow  nevertheless said richard i pray you do for him what you may that he may at least have time for confession slay not soul and body to him one half hour of time may be worth more by ten thousandfold than the life of the oldest patriarch  my royal brothers wish shall be obeyed said saladinslaves bear this wounded man to our tent  do not so said the templar who had hitherto stood gloomily looking on in silence the royal duke of austria and myself will not permit this unhappy christian prince to be delivered over to the saracens that they may try their spells upon him we are his sponsors and demand that he be assigned to our care  that is you refuse the certain means offered to recover him said richard  not so said the grand master recollecting himself if the soldan useth lawful medicines he may attend the patient in my tent  do so i pray thee good brother said richard to saladin though the permission be ungraciously yieldedbut now to a more glorious work sound trumpetsshout englandin honour of englands champion  drum clarion trumpet and cymbal rung forth at once and the deep and regular shout which for ages has been the english acclamation sounded amidst the shrill and irregular yells of the arabs like the diapason of the organ amid the howling of a storm there was silence at length  brave knight of the leopard resumed coeur de lion thou hast shown that the ethiopian may change his skin and the leopard his spots though clerks quote scripture for the impossibility yet i have more to say to you when i have conducted you to the presence of the ladies the best judges and best rewarders of deeds of chivalry  the knight of the leopard bowed assent  and thou princely saladin wilt also attend them i promise thee our queen will not think herself welcome if she lacks the opportunity to thank her royal host for her most princely reception  saladin bent his head gracefully but declined the invitation  i must attend the wounded man he said the leech leaves not his patient more than the champion the lists even if he be summoned to a bower like those of paradise and further royal richard know that the blood of the east flows not so temperately in the presence of beauty as that of your land what saith the book itselfher eye is as the edge of the sword of the prophet who shall look upon it he that would not be burnt avoideth to tread on hot emberswise men spread not the flax before a flickering torch he saith the sage who hath forfeited a treasure doth not wisely to turn back his head to gaze at it  richard it may be believed respected the motives of delicacy which flowed from manners so different from his own and urged his request no further  at noon said the soldan as he departed i trust ye will all accept a collation under the black camelskin tent of a chief of kurdistan  the same invitation was circulated among the christians comprehending all those of sufficient importance to be admitted to sit at a feast made for princes  hark said richard the timbrels announce that our queen and her attendants are leaving their galleryand see the turbans sink on the ground as if struck down by a destroying angel all lie prostrate as if the glance of an arabs eye could sully the lustre of a ladys cheek come we will to the pavilion and lead our conqueror thither in triumph how i pity that noble soldan who knows but of love as it is known to those of inferior nature  blondel tuned his harp to his boldest measure to welcome the introduction of the victor into the pavilion of queen berengaria he entered supported on either side by his sponsors richard and thomas longsword and knelt gracefully down before the queen though more than half the homage was silently rendered to edith who sat on her right hand  unarm him my mistresses said the king whose delight was in the execution of such chivalrous usages let beauty honour chivalry undo his spurs berengaria queen though thou be thou owest him what marks of favour thou canst giveunlace his helmet edithby this hand thou shalt wert thou the proudest plantagenet of the line and he the poorest knight on earth  both ladies obeyed the royal commandsberengaria with bustling assiduity as anxious to gratify her husbands humour and edith blushing and growing pale alternately as slowly and awkwardly she undid with longswords assistance the fastenings which secured the helmet to the gorget  and what expect you from beneath this iron shell said richard as the removal of the casque gave to view the noble countenance of sir kenneth his face glowing with recent exertion and not less so with present emotion what think ye of him gallants and beauties said richard doth he resemble an ethiopian slave or doth he present the face of an obscure and nameless adventurer no by my good sword here terminate his various disguises he hath knelt down before you unknown save by his worth he arises equally distinguished by birth and by fortune the adventurous knight kenneth arises david earl of huntingdon prince royal of scotland  there was a general exclamation of surprise and edith dropped from her hand the helmet which she had just received  yes my masters said the king it is even so ye know how scotland deceived us when she proposed to send this valiant earl with a bold company of her best and noblest to aid our arms in this conquest of palestine but failed to comply with her engagements this noble youth under whom the scottish crusaders were to have been arrayed thought foul scorn that his arm should be withheld from the holy warfare and joined us at sicily with a small train of devoted and faithful attendants which was augmented by many of his countrymen to whom the rank of their leader was unknown the confidants of the royal prince had all save one old follower fallen by death when his secret but too well kept had nearly occasioned my cutting off in a scottish adventurer one of the noblest hopes of europewhy did you not mention your rank noble huntingdon when endangered by my hasty and passionate sentence was it that you thought richard capable of abusing the advantage i possessed over the heir of a king whom i have so often found hostile  i did you not that injustice royal richard answered the earl of huntingdon but my pride brooked not that i should avow myself prince of scotland in order to save my life endangered for default of loyalty and moreover i had made my vow to preserve my rank unknown till the crusade should be accomplished nor did i mention it save in articulo mortis and under the seal of confession to yonder reverend hermit  it was the knowledge of that secret then which made the good man so urgent with me to recall my severe sentence said richard well did he say that had this good knight fallen by my mandate i should have wished the deed undone though it had cost me a limb a limb i should have wished it undone had it cost me my lifesince the world would have said that richard had abused the condition in which the heir of scotland had placed himself by his confidence in his generosity  yet may we know of your grace by what strange and happy chance this riddle was at length read said the queen berengaria  letters were brought to us from england said the king in which we learned among other unpleasant news that the king of scotland had seized upon three of our nobles when on a pilgrimage to saint ninian and alleged as a cause that his heir being supposed to be fighting in the ranks of the teutonic knights against the heathen of borussia was in fact in our camp and in our power and therefore william proposed to hold these nobles as hostages for his safety this gave me the first light on the real rank of the knight of the leopard and my suspicions were confirmed by de vaux who on his return from ascalon brought back with him the earl of huntingdons sole attendant a thickskulled slave who had gone thirty miles to unfold to de vaux a secret he should have told to me  old strauchan must be excused said the lord of gilsland he knew from experience that my heart is somewhat softer than if i wrote myself plantagenet  thy heart soft thou commodity of old iron and cumberland flint that thou art exclaimed the kingit is we plantagenets who boast soft and feeling hearts edith turning to his cousin with an expression which called the blood into her cheek give me thy hand my fair cousin and prince of scotland thine  forbear my lord said edith hanging back and endeavouring to hide her confusion under an attempt to rally her royal kinsmans credulity remember you not that my hand was to be the signal of converting to the christian faith the saracen and arab saladin and all his turbaned host  ay but the wind of prophecy hath chopped about and sits now in another corner replied richard  mock not lest your bonds be made strong said the hermit stepping forward the heavenly host write nothing but truth in their brilliant records it is mans eyes which are too weak to read their characters aright know that when saladin and kenneth of scotland slept in my grotto i read in the stars that there rested under my roof a prince the natural foe of richard with whom the fate of edith plantagenet was to be united could i doubt that this must be the soldan whose rank was well known to me as he often visited my cell to converse on the revolutions of the heavenly bodies again the lights of the firmament proclaimed that this prince the husband of edith plantagenet should be a christian and iweak and wild interpreterargued thence the conversion of the noble saladin whose good qualities seemed often to incline him towards the better faith the sense of my weakness hath humbled me to the dust but in the dust i have found comfort i have not read aright the fate of otherswho can assure me but that i may have miscalculated mine own god will not have us break into his councilhouse or spy out his hidden mysteries we must wait his time with watching and prayerwith fear and with hope i came hither the stern seerthe proud prophetskilled as i thought to instruct princes and gifted even with supernatural powers but burdened with a weight which i deemed no shoulders but mine could have borne but my bands have been broken i go hence humble in mine ignorance penitentand not hopeless  with these words he withdrew from the assembly and it is recorded that from that period his frenzy fits seldom occurred and his penances were of a milder character and accompanied with better hopes of the future so much is there of selfopinion even in insanity that the conviction of his having entertained and expressed an unfounded prediction with so much vehemence seemed to operate like loss of blood on the human frame to modify and lower the fever of the brain  it is needless to follow into further particulars the conferences at the royal tent or to inquire whether david earl of huntingdon was as mute in the presence of edith plantagenet as when he was bound to act under the character of an obscure and nameless adventurer it may be well believed that he there expressed with suitable earnestness the passion to which he had so often before found it difficult to give words  the hour of noon now approached and saladin waited to receive the princes of christendom in a tent which but for its large size differed little from that of the ordinary shelter of the common kurdman or arab yet beneath its ample and sable covering was prepared a banquet after the most gorgeous fashion of the east extended upon carpets of the richest stuffs with cushions laid for the guests but we cannot stop to describe the cloth of gold and silverthe superb embroidery in arabesquethe shawls of kashmere and the muslins of india which were here unfolded in all their splendour far less to tell the different sweetmeats ragouts edged with rice coloured in various manners with all the other niceties of eastern cookery lambs roasted whole and game and poultry dressed in pilaus were piled in vessels of gold and silver and porcelain and intermixed with large mazers of sherbet cooled in snow and ice from the caverns of mount lebanon a magnificent pile of cushions at the head of the banquet seemed prepared for the master of the feast and such dignitaries as he might call to share that place of distinction while from the roof of the tent in all quarters but over this seat of eminence in particular waved many a banner and pennon the trophies of battles won and kingdoms overthrown but amongst and above them all a long lance displayed a shroud the banner of death with this impressive inscriptionsaladin king of kingssaladin victor of victorssaladin must die amid these preparations the slaves who had arranged the refreshments stood with drooped heads and folded arms mute and motionless as monumental statuary or as automata which waited the touch of the artist to put them in motion  expecting the approach of his princely guests the soldan imbued as most were with the superstitions of his time paused over a horoscope and corresponding scroll which had been sent to him by the hermit of engaddi when he departed from the camp  strange and mysterious science he muttered to himself which pretending to draw the curtain of futurity misleads those whom it seems to guide and darkens the scene which it pretends to illuminate who would not have said that i was that enemy most dangerous to richard whose enmity was to be ended by marriage with his kinswoman yet it now appears that a union betwixt this gallant earl and the lady will bring about friendship betwixt richard and scotland an enemy more dangerous than i as a wildcat in a chamber is more to be dreaded than a lion in a distant desert but then he continued to mutter to himself the combination intimates that this husband was to be christianchristian he repeated after a pause that gave the insane fanatic stargazer hopes that i might renounce my faith but me the faithful follower of our prophetme it should have undeceived lie there mysterious scroll he added thrusting it under the pile of cushions strange are thy bodements and fatal since even when true in themselves they work upon those who attempt to decipher their meaning all the effects of falsehoodhow now what means this intrusion  he spoke to the dwarf nectabanus who rushed into the tent fearfully agitated with each strange and disproportioned feature wrenched by horror into still more extravagant uglinesshis mouth open his eyes staring his hands with their shrivelled and deformed fingers wildly expanded  what now said the soldan sternly  accipe hoc groaned out the dwarf  ha sayest thou answered saladin  accipe hoc replied the panicstruck creature unconscious perhaps that he repeated the same words as before  hence i am in no vein for foolery said the emperor  nor am i further fool said the dwarf than to make my folly help out my wits to earn my bread poor helpless wretch hear hear me great soldan  nay if thou hast actual wrong to complain of said saladin fool or wise thou art entitled to the ear of a king retire hither with me and he led him into the inner tent  whatever their conference related to it was soon broken off by the fanfare of the trumpets announcing the arrival of the various christian princes whom saladin welcomed to his tent with a royal courtesy well becoming their rank and his own but chiefly he saluted the young earl of huntingdon and generously congratulated him upon prospects which seemed to have interfered with and overclouded those which he had himself entertained  but think not said the soldan thou noble youth that the prince of scotland is more welcome to saladin than was kenneth to the solitary ilderim when they met in the desert or the distressed ethiop to the hakim adonbec a brave and generous disposition like thine hath a value independent of condition and birth as the cool draught which i here proffer thee is as delicious from an earthen vessel as from a goblet of gold  the earl of huntingdon made a suitable reply gratefully acknowledging the various important services he had received from the generous soldan but when he had pledged saladin in the bowl of sherbet which the soldan had proffered to him he could not help remarking with a smile the brave cavalier ilderim knew not of the formation of ice but the munificent soldan cools his sherbet with snow  wouldst thou have an arab or a kurdman as wise as a hakim said the soldan he who does on a disguise must make the sentiments of his heart and the learning of his head accord with the dress which he assumes i desired to see how a brave and singlehearted cavalier of frangistan would conduct himself in debate with such a chief as i then seemed and i questioned the truth of a wellknown fact to know by what arguments thou wouldst support thy assertion  while they were speaking the archduke of austria who stood a little apart was struck with the mention of iced sherbet and took with pleasure and some bluntness the deep goblet as the earl of huntingdon was about to replace it  most delicious he exclaimed after a deep draught which the heat of the weather and the feverishness following the debauch of the preceding day had rendered doubly acceptable he sighed as he handed the cup to the grand master of the templars saladin made a sign to the dwarf who advanced and pronounced with a harsh voice the words accipe hoc the templar started like a steed who sees a lion under a bush beside the pathway yet instantly recovered and to hide perhaps his confusion raised the goblet to his lips but those lips never touched that goblets rim the sabre of saladin left its sheath as lightning leaves the cloud it was waved in the air and the head of the grand master rolled to the extremity of the tent while the trunk remained for a second standing with the goblet still clenched in its grasp then fell the liquor mingling with the blood that spurted from the veins  there was a general exclamation of treason and austria nearest to whom saladin stood with the bloody sabre in his hand started back as if apprehensive that his turn was to come next richard and others laid hand on their swords  fear nothing noble austria said saladin as composedly as if nothing had happenednor you royal england be wroth at what you have seen not for his manifold treasonsnot for the attempt which as may be vouched by his own squire he instigated against king richards lifenot that he pursued the prince of scotland and myself in the desert reducing us to save our lives by the speed of our horsesnot that he had stirred up the maronites to attack us upon this very occasion had i not brought up unexpectedly so many arabs as rendered the scheme abortivenot for any or all of these crimes does he now lie there although each were deserving such a doombut because scarce half an hour ere he polluted our presence as the simoom empoisons the atmosphere he poniarded his comrade and accomplice conrade of montserrat lest he should confess the infamous plots in which they had both been engaged  how conrade murderedand by the grand master his sponsor and most intimate friend exclaimed richard noble soldan i would not doubt thee yet this must be proved otherwise  there stands the evidence said saladin pointing to the terrified dwarf allah who sends the firefly to illuminate the night season can discover secret crimes by the most contemptible means  the soldan proceeded to tell the dwarfs story which amounted to this in his foolish curiosity or as he partly confessed with some thoughts of pilfering nectabanus had strayed into the tent of conrade which had been deserted by his attendants some of whom had left the encampment to carry the news of his defeat to his brother and others were availing themselves of the means which saladin had supplied for revelling the wounded man slept under the influence of saladins wonderful talisman so that the dwarf had opportunity to pry about at pleasure until he was frightened into concealment by the sound of a heavy step he skulked behind a curtain yet could see the motions and hear the words of the grand master who entered and carefully secured the covering of the pavilion behind him his victim started from sleep and it would appear that he instantly suspected the purpose of his old associate for it was in a tone of alarm that he demanded wherefore he disturbed him  i come to confess and to absolve thee answered the grand master  of their further speech the terrified dwarf remembered little save that conrade implored the grand master not to break a wounded reed and that the templar struck him to the heart with a turkish dagger with the words accipe hocwords which long afterwards haunted the terrified imagination of the concealed witness  i verified the tale said saladin by causing the body to be examined and i made this unhappy being whom allah hath made the discoverer of the crime repeat in your own presence the words which the murderer spoke and you yourselves saw the effect which they produced upon his conscience  the soldan paused and the king of england broke silence  if this be true as i doubt not we have witnessed a great act of justice though it bore a different aspect but wherefore in this presence wherefore with thine own hand  i had designed otherwise said saladin but had i not hastened his doom it had been altogether averted since if i had permitted him to taste of my cup as he was about to do how could i without incurring the brand of inhospitality have done him to death as he deserved had he murdered my father and afterwards partaken of my food and my bowl not a hair of his head could have been injured by me but enough of himlet his carcass and his memory be removed from amongst us  the body was carried away and the marks of the slaughter obliterated or concealed with such ready dexterity as showed that the case was not altogether so uncommon as to paralyze the assistants and officers of saladins household  but the christian princes felt that the scene which they had beheld weighed heavily on their spirits and although at the courteous invitation of the soldan they assumed their seats at the banquet yet it was with the silence of doubt and amazement the spirits of richard alone surmounted all cause for suspicion or embarrassment yet he too seemed to ruminate on some proposition as if he were desirous of making it in the most insinuating and acceptable manner which was possible at length he drank off a large bowl of wine and addressing the soldan desired to know whether it was not true that he had honoured the earl of huntingdon with a personal encounter  saladin answered with a smile that he had proved his horse and his weapons with the heir of scotland as cavaliers are wont to do with each other when they meet in the desert and modestly added that though the combat was not entirely decisive he had not on his part much reason to pride himself on the event the scot on the other hand disclaimed the attributed superiority and wished to assign it to the soldan  enough of honour thou hast had in the encounter said richard and i envy thee more for that than for the smiles of edith plantagenet though one of them might reward a bloody days workbut what say you noble princes is it fitting that such a royal ring of chivalry should break up without something being done for future times to speak of what is the overthrow and death of a traitor to such a fair garland of honour as is here assembled and which ought not to part without witnessing something more worthy of their regardhow say you princely soldan what if we two should now and before this fair company decide the longcontended question for this land of palestine and end at once these tedious wars yonder are the lists ready nor can paynimrie ever hope a better champion than thou i unless worthier offers will lay down my gauntlet in behalf of christendom and in all love and honour we will do mortal battle for the possession of jerusalem  there was a deep pause for the soldans answer his cheek and brow coloured highly and it was the opinion of many present that he hesitated whether he should accept the challenge at length he said fighting for the holy city against those whom we regard as idolaters and worshippers of stocks and stones and graven images i might confide that allah would strengthen my arm or if i fell beneath the sword of the melech ric i could not pass to paradise by a more glorious death but allah has already given jerusalem to the true believers and it were a tempting the god of the prophet to peril upon my own personal strength and skill that which i hold securely by the superiority of my forces  if not for jerusalem then said richard in the tone of one who would entreat a favour of an intimate friend yet for the love of honour let us run at least three courses with grinded lances  even this said saladin half smiling at coeur de lions affectionate earnestness for the combateven this i may not lawfully do the master places the shepherd over the flock not for the shepherds own sake but for the sake of the sheep had i a son to hold the sceptre when i fell i might have had the liberty as i have the will to brave this bold encounter but your own scripture saith that when the herdsman is smitten the sheep are scattered  thou hast had all the fortune said richard turning to the earl of huntingdon with a sigh i would have given the best year in my life for that one half hour beside the diamond of the desert  the chivalrous extravagance of richard awakened the spirits of the assembly and when at length they arose to depart saladin advanced and took coeur de lion by the hand  noble king of england he said we now part never to meet again that your league is dissolved no more to be reunited and that your native forces are far too few to enable you to prosecute your enterprise is as well known to me as to yourself i may not yield you up that jerusalem which you so much desire to holdit is to us as to you a holy city but whatever other terms richard demands of saladin shall be as willingly yielded as yonder fountain yields its waters ay and the same should be as frankly afforded by saladin if richard stood in the desert with but two archers in his train  the next day saw richards return to his own camp and in a short space afterwards the young earl of huntingdon was espoused by edith plantagenet the soldan sent as a nuptial present on this occasion the celebrated talisman but though many cures were wrought by means of it in europe none equalled in success and celebrity those which the soldan achieved it is still in existence having been bequeathed by the earl of huntingdon to a brave knight of scotland sir simon of the lee in whose ancient and highly honoured family it is still preserved and although charmed stones have been dismissed from the modern pharmacopoeia its virtues are still applied to for stopping blood and in cases of canine madness  our story closes here as the terms on which richard relinquished his conquests are to be found in every history of the period
