82969380	the light that failed  by rudyard kipling     chapter i        so we settled it all when the storm was done       as comfy as comfy could be       and i was to wait in the barn my dears       because i was only three       and teddy would run to the rainbows foot       because he was five and a man       and thats how it all began my dears       and thats how it all began        big barn stories  what do you think shed do if she caught us we oughtnt to have it you know said maisie  beat me and lock you up in your bedroom dick answered without hesitation have you got the cartridges  yes theyre in my pocket but they are joggling horribly do pinfire cartridges go off of their own accord  dont know take the revolver if you are afraid and let me carry them  im not afraid maisie strode forward swiftly a hand in her pocket and her chin in the air dick followed with a small pinfire revolver  the children had discovered that their lives would be unendurable without pistolpractice after much forethought and selfdenial dick had saved seven shillings and sixpence the price of a badly constructed belgian revolver maisie could only contribute half a crown to the syndicate for the purchase of a hundred cartridges you can save better than i can dick she explained i like nice things to eat and it doesnt matter to you besides boys ought to do these things  dick grumbled a little at the arrangement but went out and made the purchase which the children were then on their way to test revolvers did not lie in the scheme of their daily life as decreed for them by the guardian who was incorrectly supposed to stand in the place of a mother to these two orphans dick had been under her care for six years during which time she had made her profit of the allowances supposed to be expended on his clothes and partly through thoughtlessness partly through a natural desire to painshe was a widow of some years anxious to marry againhad made his days burdensome on his young shoulders  where he had looked for love she gave him first aversion and then hate  where he growing older had sought a little sympathy she gave him ridicule the many hours that she could spare from the ordering of her small house she devoted to what she called the hometraining of dick heldar her religion manufactured in the main by her own intelligence and a keen study of the scriptures was an aid to her in this matter at such times as she herself was not personally displeased with dick she left him to understand that he had a heavy account to settle with his creator wherefore dick learned to loathe his god as intensely as he loathed mrs jennett and this is not a wholesome frame of mind for the young since she chose to regard him as a hopeless liar but an economical and selfcontained one never throwing away the least unnecessary fib and never hesitating at the blackest were it only plausible that might make his life a little easier the treatment taught him at least the power of living alonea power that was of service to him when he went to a public school and the boys laughed at his clothes which were poor in quality and much mended in the holidays he returned to the teachings of mrs jennett and that the chain of discipline might not be weakened by association with the world was generally beaten on one account or another before he had been twelve hours under her roof  the autumn of one year brought him a companion in bondage a longhaired grayeyed little atom as selfcontained as himself who moved about the house silently and for the first few weeks spoke only to the goat that was her chiefest friend on earth and lived in the backgarden mrs jennett objected to the goat on the grounds that he was unchristianwhich he certainly was then said the atom choosing her words very deliberately i shall write to my lawyerpeoples and tell them that you are a very bad woman amomma is mine mine mine mrs jennett made a movement to the hall where certain umbrellas and canes stood in a rack the atom understood as clearly as dick what this meant i have been beaten before she said still in the same passionless voice i have been beaten worse than you can ever beat me if you beat me i shall write to my lawyerpeoples and tell them that you do not give me enough to eat i am not afraid of you mrs jennett did not go into the hall and the atom after a pause to assure herself that all danger of war was past went out to weep bitterly on amommas neck  dick learned to know her as maisie and at first mistrusted her profoundly for he feared that she might interfere with the small liberty of action left to him she did not however and she volunteered no friendliness until dick had taken the first steps long before the holidays were over the stress of punishment shared in common drove the children together if it were only to play into each others hands as they prepared lies for mrs jennetts use when dick returned to school maisie whispered now i shall be all alone to take care of myself but and she nodded her head bravely i can do it you promised to send amomma a grass collar send it soon a week later she asked for that collar by return of post and wa not pleased when she learned that it took time to make when at last dick forwarded the gift she forgot to thank him for it  many holidays had come and gone since that day and dick had grown into a lanky hobbledehoy more than ever conscious of his bad clothes not for a moment had mrs jennett relaxed her tender care of him but the average canings of a public schooldick fell under punishment about three times a monthfilled him with contempt for her powers she doesnt hurt he explained to maisie who urged him to rebellion and she is kinder to you after she has whacked me dick shambled through the days unkempt in body and savage in soul as the smaller boys of the school learned to know for when the spirit moved him he would hit them cunningly and with science the same spirit made him more than once try to tease maisie but the girl refused to be made unhappy we are both miserable as it is said she what is the use of trying to make things worse lets find things to do and forget things  the pistol was the outcome of that search it could only be used on the muddiest foreshore of the beach far away from the bathingmachines and pierheads below the grassy slopes of fort keeling the tide ran out nearly two miles on that coast and the manycoloured mudbanks touched by the sun sent up a lamentable smell of dead weed it was late in the afternoon when dick and maisie arrived on their ground amomma trotting patiently behind them  mf said maisie sniffing the air i wonder what makes the sea so smelly i dont like it  you never like anything that isnt made just for you said dick bluntly give me the cartridges and ill try first shot how far does one of these little revolvers carry  oh half a mile said maisie promptly at least it makes an awful noise be careful with the cartridges i dont like those jagged stickup things on the rim dick do be careful  all right i know how to load ill fire at the breakwater out there  he fired and amomma ran away bleating the bullet threw up a spurt of mud to the right of the woodwreathed piles  throws high and to the right you try maisie mind its loaded all round  maisie took the pistol and stepped delicately to the verge of the mud her hand firmly closed on the butt her mouth and left eye screwed up  dick sat down on a tuft of bank and laughed amomma returned very cautiously he was accustomed to strange experiences in his afternoon walks and finding the cartridgebox unguarded made investigations with his nose maisie fired but could not see where the bullet went  i think it hit the post she said shading her eyes and looking out across the sailless sea  i know it has gone out to the marazion bellbuoy said dick with a chuckle fire low and to the left then perhaps youll get it oh look at amommahes eating the cartridges  maisie turned the revolver in her hand just in time to see amomma scampering away from the pebbles dick threw after him nothing is sacred to a billygoat being well fed and the adored of his mistress amomma had naturally swallowed two loaded pinfire cartridges maisie hurried up to assure herself that dick had not miscounted the tale  yes hes eaten two  horrid little beast then theyll joggle about inside him and blow up and serve him right oh dick have i killed you  revolvers are tricky things for young hands to deal with maisie could not explain how it had happened but a veil of reeking smoke separated her from dick and she was quite certain that the pistol had gone off in his face then she heard him sputter and dropped on her knees beside him crying dick you arent hurt are you i didnt mean it  of course you didnt said dick coming out of the smoke and wiping his cheek but you nearly blinded me that powder stuff stings awfully a neat little splash of gray led on a stone showed where the bullet had gone maisie began to whimper  dont said dick jumping to his feet and shaking himself im not a bit hurt  no but i might have killed you protested maisie the corners of her mouth drooping what should i have done then  gone home and told mrs jennett dick grinned at the thought then softening please dont worry about it besides we are wasting time  weve got to get back to tea ill take the revolver for a bit  maisie would have wept on the least encouragement but dicks indifference albeit his hand was shaking as he picked up the pistol restrained her she lay panting on the beach while dick methodically bombarded the breakwater got it at last he exclaimed as a lock of weed flew from the wood  let me try said maisie imperiously im all right now  they fired in turns till the rickety little revolver nearly shook itself to pieces and amomma the outcastbecause he might blow up at any momentbrowsed in the background and wondered why stones were thrown at him then they found a balk of timber floating in a pool which was commanded by the seaward slope of fort keeling and they sat down together before this new target  next holidays said dick as the now thoroughly fouled revolver kicked wildly in his hand well get another pistolcentral firethat will carry farther  there wont b any next holidays for me said maisie im going away  where to  i dont know my lawyers have written to mrs jennett and ive got to be educated somewherein france perhapsi dont know where but i shall be glad to go away  i shant like it a bit i suppose i shall be left look here maisie is it really true youre going then these holidays will be the last i shall see anything of you and i go back to school next week i wish  the young blood turned his cheeks scarlet maisie was picking grasstufts and throwing them down the slope at a yellow seapoppy nodding all by itself to the illimitable levels of the mudflats and the milkwhite sea beyond  i wish she said after a pause that i could see you again sometime  you wish that too  yes but it would have been better ififyou hadshot straight over theredown by the breakwater  maisie looked with large eyes for a moment and this was the boy who only ten days before had decorated amommas horns with cutpaper hamfrills and turned him out a bearded derision among the public ways then she dropped her eyes this was not the boy  dont be stupid she said reprovingly and with swift instinct attacked the sideissue how selfish you are just think what i should have felt if that horrid thing had killed you im quite miserable enough already  why because youre going away from mrs jennett  no  from me then  no answer for a long time dick dared not look at her he felt though he did not know all that the past four years had been to him and this the more acutely since he had no knowledge to put his feelings in words  i dont know she said i suppose it is  maisie you must know im not supposing  lets go home said maisie weakly  but dick was not minded to retreat  i cant say things he pleaded and im awfully sorry for teasing you about amomma the other day its all different now maisie cant you see and you might have told me that you were going instead of leaving me to find out  you didnt i did tell oh dick whats the use of worrying  there isnt any but weve been together years and years and i didnt know how much i cared  i dont believe you ever did care  no i didnt but i doi care awfully now maisie he gulpedmaisie darling say you care too please  i do indeed i do but it wont be any use  why  because i am going away  yes but if you promise before you go only saywill you a second darling came to his lips more easily than the first there were few endearments in dicks home or school life he had to find them by instinct dick caught the little hand blackened with the escaped gas of the revolver  i promise she said solemnly but if i care there is no need for promising  and do you care for the first time in the past few minutes their eyes met and spoke for them who had no skill in speech  oh dick dont please dont it was all right when we said goodmorning but now its all different amomma looked on from afar  he had seen his property quarrel frequently but he had never seen kisses exchanged before the yellow seapoppy was wiser and nodded its head approvingly considered as a kiss that was a failure but since it was the first other than those demanded by duty in all the world that either had ever given or taken it opened to them new worlds and every one of them glorious so that they were lifted above the consideration of any worlds at all especially those in which tea is necessary and sat still holding each others hands and saying not a word  you cant forget now said dick at last there was that on his cheek that stung more than gunpowder  i shouldnt have forgotten anyhow said maisie and they looked at each other and saw that each was changed from the companion of an hour ago to a wonder and a mystery they could not understand the sun began to set and a nightwind thrashed along the bents of the foreshore  we shall be awfully late for tea said maisie lets go home  lets use the rest of the cartridges first said dick and he helped maisie down the slope of the fort to the seaa descent that she was quite capable of covering at full speed equally gravely maisie took the grimy hand dick bent forward clumsily maisie drew the hand away and dick blushed  its very pretty he said  pooh said maisie with a little laugh of gratified vanity she stood close to dick as he loaded the revolver for the last time and fired over the sea with a vague notion at the back of his head that he was protecting maisie from all the evils in the world a puddle far across the mud caught the last rays of the sun and turned into a wrathful red disc the light held dicks attention for a moment and as he raised his revolver there fell upon him a renewed sense of the miraculous in that he was standing by maisie who had promised to care for him for an indefinite length of time till such date as a gust of the growing wind drove the girls long black hair across his face as she stood with her hand on his shoulder calling amomma a little beast and for a moment he was in the darka darkness that stung the bullet went singing out to the empty sea  spoilt my aim said he shaking his head there arent any more cartridges we shall have to run home but they did not run they walked very slowly arm in arm and it was a matter of indifference to them whether the neglected amomma with two pinfire cartridges in his inside blew up or trotted beside them for they had come into a golden heritage and were disposing of it with all the wisdom of all their years  and i shall be quoth dick valiantly then he checked himself i dont know what i shall be i dont seem to be able to pass any exams but i can make awful caricatures of the masters ho ho  be an artist then said maisie youre always laughing at my trying to draw and it will do you good  ill never laugh at anything you do he answered ill be an artist and ill do things  artists always want money dont they  ive got a hundred and twenty pounds a year of my own my guardians tell me im to have it when i come of age that will be enough to begin with  ah im rich said maisie ive got three hundred a year all my own when im twentyone thats why mrs jennett is kinder to me than she is to you i wish though that i had somebody that belonged to mejust a father or a mother  you belong to me said dick for ever and ever  yes we belongfor ever its very nice she squeezed his arm the kindly darkness hid them both and emboldened because he could only just see the profile of maisies cheek with the long lashes veiling the gray eyes dick at the front door delivered himself of the words he had been boggling over for the last two hours  and ilove you maisie he said in a whisper that seemed to him to ring across the worldthe world that he would tomorrow or the next day set out to conquer  there was a scene not for the sake of discipline to be reported when mrs jennett would have fallen upon him first for disgraceful unpunctuality and secondly for nearly killing himself with a forbidden weapon  i was playing with it and it went off by itself said dick when the powderpocked cheek could no longer be hidden but if you think youre going to lick me youre wrong you are never going to touch me again  sit down and give me my tea you cant cheat us out of that anyhow  mrs jennett gasped and became livid maisie said nothing but encouraged dick with her eyes and he behaved abominably all that evening mrs jennett prophesied an immediate judgment of providence and a descent into tophet later but dick walked in paradise and would not hear only when he was going to bed mrs jennett recovered and asserted herself he had bidden maisie goodnight with downdropped eyes and from a distance  if you arent a gentleman you might try to behave like one said mrs  jennett spitefully youve been quarrelling with maisie again  this meant that the usual goodnight kiss had been omitted maisie white to the lips thrust her cheek forward with a fine air of indifference and was duly pecked by dick who tramped out of the room red as fire that night he dreamed a wild dream he had won all the world and brought it to maisie in a cartridgebox but she turned it over with her foot and instead of saying thank you criedwhere is the grass collar you promised for amomma oh how selfish you are    chapter ii       then we brought the lances down then the bugles blew      when we went to kandahar ridin two an two      ridin ridin ridin two an two      tarararararara      all the way to kandahar ridin two an two       barrackroom ballad  im not angry with the british public but i wish we had a few thousand of them scattered among these rooks they wouldnt be in such a hurry to get at their morning papers then cant you imagine the regulation householderlover of justice constant reader paterfamilias and all that lotfrizzling on hot gravel  with a blue veil over his head and his clothes in strips has any man here a needle ive got a piece of sugarsack  ill lend you a packingneedle for six square inches of it then both my knees are worn through  why not six square acres while youre about it but lend me the needle and ill see what i can do with the selvage i dont think theres enough to protect my royal body from the cold blast as it is what are you doing with that everlasting sketchbook of yours dick  study of our special correspondent repairing his wardrobe said dick gravely as the other man kicked off a pair of sorely worn ridingbreeches and began to fit a square of coarse canvas over the most obvious open space he grunted disconsolately as the vastness of the void developed itself  sugarbags indeed hi you pilot man there lend me all the sails for that whaleboat  a fezcrowned head bobbed up in the sternsheets divided itself into exact halves with one flashing grin and bobbed down again the man of the tattered breeches clad only in a norfolk jacket and a gray flannel shirt went on with his clumsy sewing while dick chuckled over the sketch  some twenty whaleboats were nuzzling a sandbank which was dotted with english soldiery of half a dozen corps bathing or washing their clothes a heap of boatrollers commissariatboxes sugarbags and flour and smallarmammunitioncases showed where one of the whaleboats had been compelled to unload hastily and a regimental carpenter was swearing aloud as he tried on a wholly insufficient allowance of white lead to plaster up the sunparched gaping seams of the boat herself  first the bloomin rudder snaps said he to the world in general then the mast goes an then s help me when she cant do nothin else she opens erself out like a cockeyes chinese lotus  exactly the case with my breeches whoever you are said the tailor without looking up dick i wonder when i shall see a decent shop again  there was no answer save the incessant angry murmur of the nile as it raced round a basaltwalled bend and foamed across a rockridge half a mile upstream it was as though the brown weight of the river would drive the white men back to their own country the indescribable scent of nile mud in the air told that the stream was falling and the next few miles would be no light thing for the whaleboats to overpass the desert ran down almost to the banks where among gray red and black hillocks a camelcorps was encamped no man dared even for a day lose touch of the slowmoving boats there had been no fighting for weeks past and throughout all that time the nile had never spared them rapid had followed rapid rock rock and islandgroup islandgroup till the rank and file had long since lost all count of direction and very nearly of time they were moving somewhere they did not know why to do something they did not know what before them lay the nile and at the other end of it was one gordon fighting for the dear life in a town called khartoum there were columns of british troops in the desert or in one of the many deserts there were yet more columns waiting to embark on the river there were fresh drafts waiting at assioot and assuan there were lies and rumours running over the face of the hopeless land from suakin to the sixth cataract and men supposed generally that there must be some one in authority to direct the general scheme of the many movements the duty of that particular rivercolumn was to keep the whaleboats afloat in the water to avoid trampling on the villagers crops when the gangs tracked the boats with lines thrown from midstream to get as much sleep and food as was possible and above all to press on without delay in the teeth of the churning nile  with the soldiers sweated and toiled the correspondents of the newspapers and they were almost as ignorant as their companions but it was above all things necessary that england at breakfast should be amused and thrilled and interested whether gordon lived or died or half the british army went to pieces in the sands the soudan campaign was a picturesque one and lent itself to vivid wordpainting now and again a special managed to get slainwhich was not altogether a disadvantage to the paper that employed himand more often the handtohand nature of the fighting allowed of miraculous escapes which were worth telegraphing home at eighteenpence the word there were many correspondents with many corps and columnsfrom the veterans who had followed on the heels of the cavalry that occupied cairo in 82 what time arabi pasha called himself king who had seen the first miserable work round suakin when the sentries were cut up nightly and the scrub swarmed with spears to youngsters jerked into the business at the end of a telegraphwire to take the places of their betters killed or invalided  among the seniorsthose who knew every shift and change in the perplexing postal arrangements the value of the seediest weediest egyptian garron offered for sale in cairo or alexandria who could talk a telegraphclerk into amiability and soothe the ruffled vanity of a newly appointed staffofficer when press regulations became burdensomewas the man in the flannel shirt the blackbrowed torpenhow he represented the central southern syndicate in the campaign as he had represented it in the egyptian war and elsewhere the syndicate did not concern itself greatly with criticisms of attack and the like it supplied the masses and all it demanded was picturesqueness and abundance of detail for there is more joy in england over a soldier who insubordinately steps out of square to rescue a comrade than over twenty generals slaving even to baldness at the gross details of transport and commissariat  he had met at suakin a young man sitting on the edge of a recently abandoned redoubt about the size of a hatbox sketching a clump of shelltorn bodies on the gravel plain  what are you for said torpenhow the greeting of the correspondent is that of the commercial traveller on the road  my own hand said the young man without looking up have you any tobacco  torpenhow waited till the sketch was finished and when he had looked at it said whats your business here  nothing there was a row so i came im supposed to be doing something down at the paintingslips among the boats or else im in charge of the condenser on one of the waterships ive forgotten which  youve cheek enough to build a redoubt with said torpenhow and took stock of the new acquaintance do you always draw like that  the young man produced more sketches row on a chinese pigboat  said he sententiously showing them one after anotherchief mate dirked by a compradorjunk ashore off hakodatesomali muleteer being floggedstarshelled bursting over camp at berberaslavedhow being chased round tajurrah bahsoldier lying dead in the moonlight outside suakinthroat cut by fuzzies  hm said torpenhow cant say i care for verestchaginandwater myself but theres no accounting for tastes doing anything now are you  no im amusing myself here  torpenhow looked at the sketches again and nodded yes youre right to take your first chance when you can get it  he rode away swiftly through the gate of the two warships rattled across the causeway into the town and wired to his syndicate got man here picturework good and cheap shall i arrange will do letterpress with sketches  the man on the redoubt sat swinging his legs and murmuring i knew the chance would come sooner or later by gad theyll have to sweat for it if i come through this business alive  in the evening torpenhow was able to announce to his friend that the central southern agency was willing to take him on trial paying expenses for three months and by the way whats your name said torpenhow  heldar do they give me a free hand  theyve taken you on chance you must justify the choice youd better stick to me im going upcountry with a column and ill do what i can for you give me some of your sketches taken here and ill send em along to himself he said thats the best bargain the central southern has ever made and they got me cheaply enough  so it came to pass that after some purchase of horseflesh and arrangements financial and political dick was made free of the new and honourable fraternity of war correspondents who all possess the inalienable right of doing as much work as they can and getting as much for it as providence and their owners shall please to these things are added in time if the brother be worthy the power of glib speech that neither man nor woman can resist when a meal or a bed is in question the eye of a horsecope the skill of a cook the constitution of a bullock the digestion of an ostrich and an infinite adaptability to all circumstances but many die before they attain to this degree and the pastmasters in the craft appear for the most part in dressclothes when they are in england and thus their glory is hidden from the multitude  dick followed torpenhow wherever the latters fancy chose to lead him and between the two they managed to accomplish some work that almost satisfied themselves it was not an easy life in any way and under its influence the two were drawn ver closely together for they ate from the same dish they shared the same waterbottle and most binding tie of all their mails went off together it was dick who managed to make gloriously drunk a telegraphclerk in a palm hut far beyond the second cataract and while the man lay in bliss on the floor possessed himself of some laboriously acquired exclusive information forwarded by a confiding correspondent of an opposition syndicate made a careful duplicate of the matter and brought the result to torpenhow who said that all was fair in love or war correspondence and built an excellent descriptive article from his rivals riotous waste of words it was torpenhow whobut the tale of their adventures together and apart from philae to the waste wilderness of herawi and muella would fill many books they had been penned into a square side by side in deadly fear of being shot by overexcited soldiers they had fought with baggagecamels in the chill dawn they had jogged along in silence under blinding sun on indefatigable little egyptian horses and they had floundered on the shallows of the nile when the whaleboat in which they had found a berth chose to hit a hidden rock and rip out half her bottomplanks  now they were sitting on the sandbank and the whaleboats were bringing up the remainder of the column  yes said torpenhow as he put the last rude stitches into his overlongneglected gear it has been a beautiful business  the patch or the campaign said dick dont think much of either myself  you want the euryalus brought up above the third cataract dont you and eightyoneton guns at jakdul now im quite satisfied with my breeches he turned round gravely to exhibit himself after the manner of a clown  its very pretty specially the lettering on the sack gbt government bullock train thats a sack from india  its my initialsgilbert belling torpenhow i stole the cloth on purpose  what the mischief are the camelcorps doing yonder torpenhow shaded his eyes and looked across the scrubstrewn gravel  a bugle blew furiously and the men on the bank hurried to their arms and accoutrements  pisan soldiery surprised while bathing remarked dick calmly  dyou remember the picture its by michael angelo all beginners copy it that scrubs alive with enemy  the camelcorps on the bank yelled to the infantry to come to them and a hoarse shouting down the river showed that the remainder of the column had wind of the trouble and was hastening to take share in it as swiftly as a reach of still water is crisped by the wind the rockstrewn ridges and scrubtopped hills were troubled and alive with armed men  mercifully it occurred to these to stand far off for a time to shout and gesticulate joyously one man even delivered himself of a long story the camelcorps did not fire they were only too glad of a little breathingspace until some sort of square could be formed the men on the sandbank ran to their side and the whaleboats as they toiled up within shouting distance were thrust into the nearest bank and emptied of all save the sick and a few men to guard them the arab orator ceased his outcries and his friends howled  they look like the mahdis men said torpenhow elbowing himself into the crush of the square but what thousands of em there are the tribes hereabout arent against us i know  then the mahdis taken another town said dick and set all these yelping devils free to show us up lend us your glass  our scouts should have told us of this weve been trapped said a subaltern arent the camel guns ever going to begin hurry up you men  there was no need of any order the men flung themselves panting against the sides of the square for they had good reason to know that whoso was left outside when the fighting began would very probably die in an extremely unpleasant fashion the little hundredandfiftypound camelguns posted at one corner of the square opened the ball as the square moved forward by its right to get possession of a knoll of rising ground all had fought in this manner many times before and there was no novelty in the entertainment always the same hot and stifling formation the smell of dust and leather the same boltlike rush of the enemy the same pressure on the weakest side the few minutes of handtohand scuffle and then the silence of the desert broken only by the yells of those whom their handful of cavalry attempted to purse they had become careless the camelguns spoke at intervals and the square slouched forward amid the protesting of the camels then came the attack of three thousand men who had not learned from books that it is impossible for troops in close order to attack against breechloading fire  a few dropping shots heralded their approach and a few horsemen led but the bulk of the force was naked humanity mad with rage and armed with the spear and the sword the instinct of the desert where there is always much war told them that the right flank of the square was the weakest for they swung clear of the front the camelguns shelled them as they passed and opened for an instant lanes through their midst most like those quickclosing vistas in a kentish hopgarden seen when the train races by at full speed and the infantry fire held till the opportune moment dropped them in closepacking hundreds no civilised troops in the world could have endured the hell through which they came the living leaping high to avoid the dying who clutched at their heels the wounded cursing and staggering forward till they fella torrent black as the sliding water above a milldamfull on the right flank of the square  then the line of the dusty troops and the faint blue desert sky overhead went out in rolling smoke and the little stones on the heated ground ant the tinderdry clumps of scrub became matters of surpassing interest for men measured their agonised retreat and recovery by these things counting mechanically and hewing their way back to chosen pebble and branch there was no semblance of any concerted fighting for aught the men knew the enemy might be attempting all four sides of the square at once their business was to destroy what lay in front of them to bayonet in the back those who passed over them and dying to drag down the slayer till he could be knocked on the head by some avenging gunbutt  dick waited with torpenhow and a young doctor till the stress grew unendurable it was hopeless to attend to the wounded till the attack was repulsed so the three moved forward gingerly towards the weakest side of the square there was a rush from without the short houghhough of the stabbing spears and a man on a horse followed by thirty or forty others dashed through yelling and hacking the right flank of the square sucked in after them and the other sides sent help the wounded who knew that they had but a few hours more to live caught at the enemys feet and brought them down or staggering into a discarded rifle fired blindly into the scuffle that raged in the centre of the square  dick was conscious that somebody had cut him violently across his helmet that he had fired his revolver into a black foamflecked face which forthwith ceased to bear any resemblance to a face and that torpenhow had gone down under an arab whom he had tried to collar low and was turning over and over with his captive feeling for the mans eyes the doctor jabbed at a venture with a bayonet and a helmetless soldier fired over dicks shoulder the flying grains of powder stung his cheek it was to torpenhow that dick turned by instinct the representative of the central southern syndicate had shaken himself clear of his enemy and rose wiping his thumb on his trousers the arab both hands to his forehead screamed aloud then snatched up his spear and rushed at torpenhow who was panting under shelter of dicks revolver dick fired twice and the man dropped limply his upturned face lacked one eye the musketryfire redoubled but cheers mingled with it the rush had failed and the enemy were flying if the heart of the square were shambles the ground beyond was a butchers shop dick thrust his way forward between the maddened men the remnant of the enemy were retiring as the fewthe very fewenglish cavalry rode down the laggards  beyond the lines of the dead a broad bloodstained arab spear cast aside in the retreat lay across a stump of scrub and beyond this again the illimitable dark levels of the desert the sun caught the steel and turned it into a red disc some one behind him was saying ah get away you brute dick raised his revolver and pointed towards the desert his eye was held by the red splash in the distance and the clamour about him seemed to die down to a very faraway whisper like the whisper of a level sea there was the revolver and the red light and the voice of some one scaring something away exactly as had fallen somewhere beforea darkness that stung he fired at random and the bullet went out across the desert as he muttered spoilt my aim there arent any more cartridges we shall have to run home he put his hand to his head and brought it away covered with blood  old man youre cut rather badly said torpenhow i owe you something for this business thanks stand up i say you cant be ill here  throughout the night when the troops were encamped by the whaleboats a black figure danced in the strong moonlight on the sandbar and shouted that khartoum the accursed one was deadwas deadwas deadthat two steamers were rockstaked on the nile outside the city and that of all their crews there remained not one and khartoum was deadwas deadwas dead  but torpenhow took no heed he was watching dick who called aloud to the restless nile for maisieand again maisie  behold a phenomenon said torpenhow rearranging the blanket here is a man presumably human who mentions the name of one woman only and ive seen a good deal of delirium toodick heres some fizzy drink  thank you maisie said dick    chapter iii       so he thinks he shall take to the sea again      for one more cruise with his buccaneers      to singe the beard of the king of spain      and capture another dean of jaen      and sell him in algiersa dutch picturelongfellow  the soudan campaign and dicks broken head had been some months ended and mended and the central southern syndicate had paid dick a certain sum on account for work done which work they were careful to assure him was not altogether up to their standard dick heaved the letter into the nile at cairo cashed the draft in the same town and bade a warm farewell to torpenhow at the station  i am going to lie up for a while and rest said torpenhow i dont know where i shall live in london but if god brings us to meet we shall meet  are you starying here on the offchance of another row there will be none till the southern soudan is reoccupied by our troops mark that  goodbye bless you come back when your moneys spent and give me your address  dick loitered in cairo alexandria ismailia and port saidespecially port said there is iniquity in many parts of the world and vice in all but the concentrated essence of all the iniquities and all the vices in all the continents finds itself at port said and through the heart of that sandbordered hell where the mirage flickers day long above the bitter lake move if you will only wait most of the men and women you have known in this life dick established himself in quarters more riotous than respectable he spent his evenings on the quay and boarded many ships and saw very many friendsgracious englishwomen with whom he had talked not too wisely in the veranda of shepherds hotel hurrying war correspondents skippers of the contract troopships employed in the campaign army officers by the score and others of less reputable trades  he had choice of all the races of the east and west for studies and the advantage of seeing his subjects under the influence of strong excitement at the gamingtables saloons dancinghells and elsewhere for recreation there was the straight vista of the canal the blazing sands the procession of shipping and the white hospitals where the english soldiers lay he strove to set down in black and white and colour all that providence sent him and when that supply was ended sought about for fresh material it was a fascinating employment but it ran away with his money and he had drawn in advance the hundred and twenty pounds to which he was entitled yearly now i shall have to work and starve thought he and was addressing himself to this new fate when a mysterious telegram arrived from torpenhow in england which said come back quick you have caught on come  a large smile overspread his face so soon thats a good hearing said he to himself there will be an orgy tonight ill stand or fall by my luck faith its time it came he deposited half of his funds in the hands of his wellknown friends monsieur and madame binat and ordered himself a zanzibar dance of the finest monsieur binat was shaking with drink but madame smiles sympatheticallymonsieur needs a chair of course and of course monsieur will sketch monsieur amuses himself strangely  binat raised a bluewhite face from a cot in the inner room i understand he quavered we all know monsieur monsieur is an artist as i have been dick nodded in the end said binat with gravity monsieur will descend alive into hell as i have descended and he laughed  you must come to the dance too said dick i shall want you  for my face i knew it would be so for my face my god and for my degradation so tremendous i will not take him away he is a devil or at least do thou celeste demand of him more the excellent binat began to kick and scream  all things are for sale in port said said madame if my husband comes it will be so much more eh how you callalf a sovereign  the money was paid and the mad dance was held at night in a walled courtyard at the back of madame binats house the lady herself in faded mauve silk always about to slide from her yellow shoulders played the piano and to the tinpot music of a western waltz the naked zanzibari girls danced furiously by the light of kerosene lamps binat sat upon a chair and stared with eyes that saw nothing till the whirl of the dance and the clang of the rattling piano stole into the drink that took the place of blood in his veins and his face glistened dick took him by the chin brutally and turned that face to the light madame binat looked over her shoulder and smiled with many teeth dick leaned against the wall and sketched for an hour till the kerosene lamps began to smell and the girls threw themselves panting on the hardbeaten ground then he shut his book with a snap and moved away binat plucking feebly at his elbow show me he whimpered i too was once an artist even i dick showed him the rough sketch am i that he screamed will you take that away with you and show all the world that it is ibinat he moaned and wept  monsieur has paid for all said madame to the pleasure of seeing monsieur again  the courtyard gate shut and dick hurried up the sandy street to the nearest gamblinghell where he was well known if the luck holds its an omen if i lose i must stay here he placed his money picturesquely about the board hardly daring to look at what he did the luck held  three turns of the wheel left him richer by twenty pounds and he went down to the shipping to make friends with the captain of a decayed cargosteamer who landed him in london with fewer pounds in his pocket than he cared to think about  a thin gray fog hung over the city and the streets were very cold for summer was in england  its a cheerful wilderness and it hasnt the knack of altering much dick thought as he tramped from the docks westward now what must i do  the packed houses gave no answer dick looked down the long lightless streets and at the appalling rush of traffic oh you rabbithutches said he addressing a row of highly respectable semidetached residences do you know what youve got to do later on you have to supply me with menservants and maidservantshere he smacked his lipsand the peculiar treasure of kings meantime ill clothes and boots and presently i will return and trample on you he stepped forward energetically he saw that one of his shoes was burst at the side as he stooped to make investigations a man jostled him into the gutter all right he said  thats another nick in the score ill jostle you later on  good clothes and boots are not cheap and dick left his last shop with the certainty that he would be respectably arrayed for a time but with only fifty shillings in his pocket he returned to streets by the docks and lodged himself in one room where the sheets on the bed were almost audibly marked in case of theft and where nobody seemed to go to bed at all when his clothes arrived he sought the central southern syndicate for torpenhows address and got it with the intimation that there was still some money waiting for him  how much said dick as one who habitually dealt in millions  between thirty and forty pounds if it would be any convenience to you of course we could let you have it at once but we usually settle accounts monthly  if i show that i want anything now im lost he said to himself all i need ill take later on then aloud its hardly worth while and im going to the country for a month too wait till i come back and ill see about it  but we trust mr heldar that you do not intend to sever your connection with us  dicks business in life was the study of faces and he watched the speaker keenly that man means something he said ill do no business till ive seen torpenhow theres a big deal coming so he departed making no promises to his one little room by the docks and that day was the seventh of the month and that month he reckoned with awful distinctness had thirtyone days in it  it is not easy for a man of catholic tastes and healthy appetites to exist for twentyfour days on fifty shillings nor is it cheering to begin the experiment alone in all the loneliness of london dick paid seven shillings a week for his lodging which left him rather less than a shilling a day for food and drink naturally his first purchase was of the materials of his craft he had been without them too long half a days investigations and comparison brought him to the conclusion that sausages and mashed potatoes twopence a plate were the best food now sausages once or twice a week for breakfast are not unpleasant as lunch even with mashed potatoes they become monotonous at dinner they are impertinent at the end of three days dick loathed sausages and going forth pawned his watch to revel on sheeps head which is not as cheap as it looks owing to the bones and the gravy then he returned to sausages and mashed potatoes then he confined himself entirely to mashed potatoes for a day and was unhappy because of pain in his inside then he pawned his waistcoat and his tie and thought regretfully of money thrown away in times past there are few things more edifying unto art than the actual bellypinch of hunger and dick in his few walks abroadhe did not care for exercise it raised desires that could not be satisfiedfound himself dividing mankind into two classesthose who looked as if they might give him something to eat and those who looked otherwise i never knew what i had to learn about the human face before he thought and as a reward for his humility providence caused a cabdriver at a sausageshop where dick fed that night to leave half eaten a great chunk of bread dick took itwould have fought all the world for its possessionand it cheered him  the month dragged through at last and nearly prancing with impatience he went to draw his money then he hastened to torpenhows address and smelt the smell of cooking meats all along the corridors of the chambers torpenhow was on the top floor and dick burst into his room to be received with a hug which nearly cracked his ribs as torpenhow dragged him tot he light and spoke of twenty different things in the same breath  but youre looking tucked up he concluded  got anything to eat said dick his eye roaming round the room  i shall be having breakfast in a minute what do you say to sausages  no anything but sausages torp ive been starving on that accursed horseflesh for thirty days and thirty nights  now what lunacy has been your latest  dick spoke of the last few weeks with unbridled speech then he opened his coat there was no waistcoat below i ran it fine awfully fine but ive just scraped through  you havent much sense but youve got a backbone anyhow eat and talk afterwards dick fell upon eggs and bacon and gorged till he could gorge no more torpenhow handed him a filled pipe and he smoked as men smoke who for three weeks have been deprived of good tobacco  ouf said he thats heavenly well  why in the world didnt you come to me  couldnt i owe you too much already old man besides i had a sort of superstition that this temporary starvationthats what it was and it hurtwould bring me luck later its over and done with now and none of the syndicate know how hard up i was fire away whats the exact state of affairs as regards myself  you had my wire youve caught on here people like your work immensely i dont know why but they do they say you have a fresh touch and a new way of drawing things and because theyre chiefly homebred english they say you have insight youre wanted by half a dozen papers youre wanted to illustrate books  dick grunted scornfully  youre wanted to work up your smaller sketches and sell them to the dealers they seem to think the money sunk in you is a good investment  good lord who can account for the fathomless folly of the public  theyre a remarkably sensible people  they are subject to fits if thats what you mean and you happen to be the object of the latest fit among those who are interested in what they call art just now youre a fashion a phenomenon or whatever you please i appeared to be the only person who knew anything about you here and i have been showing the most useful men a few of the sketches you gave me from time to time those coming after your work on the central southern syndicate appear to have done your business youre in luck  huh call it luck do call it luck when a man has been kicking about the world like a dog waiting for it to come ill luck em later on i want a place to work first  come here said torpenhow crossing the landing this place is a big box room really but it will do for you theres your skylight or your north light or whatever window you call it and plenty of room to thrash about in and a bedroom beyond what more do you need  good enough said dick looking round the large room that took up a third of a top story in the rickety chambers overlooking the thames a pale yellow sun shone through the skylight and showed the much dirt of the place three steps led from the door to the landing and three more to torpenhows room the well of the staircase disappeared into darkness pricked by tiny gasjets and there were sounds of men talking and doors slamming seven flights below in the warm gloom  do they give you a free hand here said dick cautiously he was ishmael enough to know the value of liberty  anything you like latchkeys and license unlimited we are permanent tenants for the most part here tisnt a place i would recommend for a young mens christian association but it will serve i took these rooms for you when i wired  youre a great deal too kind old man  you didnt suppose you were going away from me did you torpenhow put his hand on dicks shoulder and the two walked up and down the room henceforward to be called the studio in sweet and silent communion they heard rapping at torpenhows door thats some ruffian come up for a drink said torpenhow and he raised his voice cheerily there entered no one more ruffianly than a portly middleaged gentleman in a satinfaced frockcoat his lips were parted and pale and there were deep pouches under the eyes  weak heart said dick to himself and as he shook hands very weak heart his pulse is shaking his fingers  the man introduced himself as the head of the central southern syndicate and one of the most ardent admirers of your work mr  heldar i assure you in the name of the syndicate that we are immensely indebted to you and i trust mr heldar you wont forget that we were largely instrumental in bringing you before the public he panted because of the seven flights of stairs  dick glanced at torpenhow whose left eyelid lay for a moment dead on his cheek  i shant forget said dick every instinct of defence roused in him  youve paid me so well that i couldnt you know by the way when i am settled in this place i should like to send and get my sketches there must be nearly a hundred and fifty of them with you  that is eris what i came to speak about i fear we cant allow it exactly mr heldar in the absence of any specified agreement the sketches are our property of course  do you mean to say that you are going to keep them  yes and we hope to have your help on your own terms mr heldar to assist us in arranging a little exhibition which backed by our name and the influence we naturally command among the press should be of material service to you sketches such as yours  belong to me you engaged me by wire you paid me the lowest rates you dared you cant mean to keep them good god alive man theyre all ive got in the world  torpenhow watched dicks face and whistled  dick walked up and down thinking he saw the whole of his little stock in trade the first weapon of his equipment annexed at the outset of his campaign by an elderly gentleman whose name dick had not caught aright who said that he represented a syndicate which was a thing for which dick had not the least reverence the injustice of the proceedings did not much move him he had seen the strong hand prevail too often in other places to be squeamish over the moral aspects of right and wrong  but he ardently desired the blood of the gentleman in the frockcoat and when he spoke again and when he spoke again it was with a strained sweetness that torpenhow knew well for the beginning of strife  forgive me sir but you have nono younger man who can arrange this business with me  i speak for the syndicate i see no reason for a third party to  you will in a minute be good enough to give back my sketches  the man stared blankly at dick and then at torpenhow who was leaning against the wall he was not used to exemployees who ordered him to be good enough to do things  yes it is rather a coldblooded steal said torpenhow critically but im afraid i am very much afraid youve struck the wrong man be careful dick remember this isnt the soudan  considering what services the syndicate have done you in putting your name before the world  this was not a fortunate remark it reminded dick of certain vagrant years lived out in loneliness and strife and unsatisfied desires the memory did not contrast well with the prosperous gentleman who proposed to enjoy the fruit of those years  i dont know quite what to do with you began dick meditatively of course youre a thief and you ought to be half killed but in your case youd probably die i dont want you dead on this floor and besides its unlucky just as ones moving in dont hit sir youll only excite yourself  he put one hand on the mans forearm and ran the other down the plump body beneath the coat my goodness said he to torpenhow and this gray oaf dares to be a thief i have seen an esneh cameldriver have the black hide taken off his body in strips for stealing half a pound of wet dates and he was as tough as whipcord this things soft all overlike a woman  there are few things more poignantly humiliating than being handled by a man who does not intend to strike the head of the syndicate began to breathe heavily dick walked round him pawing him as a cat paws a soft hearthrug then he traced with his forefinger the leaden pouches underneath the eyes and shook his head you were going to steal my thingsmine mine mineyou who dont know when you may die  write a note to your officeyou say youre the head of itand order them to give torpenhow my sketchesevery one of them wait a minute your hands shaking now he thrust a pocketbook before him the note was written torpenhow took it and departed without a word while dick walked round and round the spellbound captive giving him such advice as he conceived best for the welfare of his soul when torpenhow returned with a gigantic portfolio he heard dick say almost soothingly now i hope this will be a lesson to you and if you worry me when i have settled down to work with any nonsense about actions for assault believe me ill catch you and manhandle you and youll die you havent very long to live anyhow go imshi vootsakget out the man departed staggering and dazed dick drew a long breath phew what a lawless lot these people are the first thing a poor orphan meets is gang robbery organised burglary think of the hideous blackness of that mans mind are my sketches all right torp  yes one hundred and fortyseven of them well i must say dick youve begun well  he was interfering with me it only meant a few pounds to him but it was everything to me i dont think hell bring an action i gave him some medical advice gratis about the state of his body it was cheap at the little flurry it cost him now lets look at my things  two minutes later dick had thrown himself down on the floor and was deep in the portfolio chuckling lovingly as he turned the drawings over and thought of the price at which they had been bought  the afternoon was well advanced when torpenhow came to the door and saw dick dancing a wild saraband under the skylight  i builded better than i knew torp he said without stopping the dance  theyre good theyre damned good theyll go like flame i shall have an exhibition of them on my own brazen hook and that man would have cheated me out of it do you know that im sorry now that i didnt actually hit him  go out said torpenhowgo out and pray to be delivered from the sin of arrogance which you never will be bring your things up from whatever place youre staying in and well try to make this barn a little more shipshape  and thenoh then said dick still capering we will spoil the egyptians   chapter iv       the wolfcub at even lay hid in the corn      when the smoke of the cooking hung gray      he knew where the doe made a couch for her fawn      and he looked to his strength for his prey       but the moon swept the smokewreaths away       and he turned from his meal in the villagers close      and he bayed to the moon as she rose       in seonee  well and how does success taste said torpenhow some three months later he had just returned to chambers after a holiday in the country  good said dick as he sat licking his lips before the easel in the studio  i want moreheaps more the lean years have passed and i approve of these fat ones  be careful old man that way lies bad work  torpenhow was sprawling in a long chair with a small foxterrier asleep on his chest while dick was preparing a canvas a dais a background and a layfigure were the only fixed objects in the place they rose from a wreck of oddments that began with feltcovered waterbottles belts and regimental badges and ended with a small bale of secondhand uniforms and a stand of mixed arms the mark of muddy feet on the dais showed that a military model had just gone away the watery autumn sunlight was falling and shadows sat in the corners of the studio  yes said dick deliberately i like the power i like the fun i like the fuss and above all i like the money i almost like the people who make the fuss and pay the money almost but theyre a queer gangan amazingly queer gang  they have been good enough to you at any rate than tinpot exhibition of your sketches must have paid did you see that the papers called it the wild work show  never mind i sold every shred of canvas i wanted to and on my word i believe it was because they believed i was a selftaught flagstone artist  i should have got better prices if i worked my things on wool or scratched them on camelbone instead of using mere black and white and colour verily they are a queer gang these people limited isnt the word to describe em i met a fellow the other day who told me that it was impossible that shadows on white sand should be blueultramarineas they are i found out later that the man had been as far as brighton beach but he knew all about art confound him he gave me a lecture on it and recommended me to go to school to learn technique i wonder what old kami would have said to that  when were you under kami man of extraordinary beginnings  i studied with him for two years in paris he taught by personal magnetism all he ever said was continuez mes enfants and you had to make the best you could of that he had a divine touch and he knew something about colour kami used to dream colour i swear he could never have seen the genuine article but he evolved it and it was good  recollect some of those views in the soudan said torpenhow with a provoking drawl  dick squirmed in his place dont it makes me want to get out there again what colour that was opal and umber and amber and claret and brickred and sulphurcockatoocrestsulphuragainst brown with a niggerblack rock sticking up in the middle of it all and a decorative frieze of camels festooning in front of a pure pale turquoise sky he began to walk up and down and yet you know if you try to give these people the thing as god gave it keyed down to their comprehension and according to the powers he has given you  modest man go on  half a dozen epicene young pagans who havent even been to algiers will tell you first that your notion is borrowed and secondly that it isnt art  this comes of my leaving town for a month dickie youve been promenading among the toyshops and hearing people talk  i couldnt help it said dick penitently you werent here and it was lonely these long evenings a man cant work for ever  a man might have gone to a pub and got decently drunk  i wish i had but i forgathered with some men of sorts they said they were artists and i knew some of them could drawbut they wouldnt draw they gave me teatea at five in the afternoonand talked about art and the state of their souls as if their souls mattered ive heard more about art and seen less of her in the last six months than in the whole of my life do you remember cassavetti who worked for some continental syndicate out with the desert column he was a regular christmastree of contraptions when he took the field in full fig with his waterbottle lanyard revolver writingcase housewife giglamps and the lord knows what all he used to fiddle about with em and show us how they worked but he never seemed to do much except fudge his reports from the nilghai see  dear old nilghai hes in town fatter than ever he ought to be up here this evening i see the comparison perfectly you should have kept clear of all that manmillinery serves you right and i hope it will unsettle your mind  it wont it has taught me what artholy sacred artmeans  youve learnt something while ive been away what is art  give em what they know and when youve done it once do it again  dick dragged forward a canvas laid face to the wall heres a sample of real art its going to be a facsimile reproduction for a weekly i called it his last shot its worked up from the little watercolour i made outside el maghrib well i lured my model a beautiful rifleman up here with drink i drored him and i redrored him and i redrored him and i made him a flushed dishevelled bedevilled scallawag with his helmet at the back of his head and the living fear of death in his eye and the blood oozing out of a cut over his anklebone he wasnt pretty but he was all soldier and very much man  once more modest child  dick laughed well its only to you im talking i did him just as well as i knew how making allowance for the slickness of oils then the artmanager of that abandoned paper said that his subscribers wouldnt like it it was brutal and coarse and violentman being naturally gentle when hes fighting for his life they wanted something more restful with a little more colour i could have said a good deal but you might as well talk to a sheep as an artmanager i took my last shot back behold the result i put him into a lovely red coat without a speck on it that is art i polished his bootsobserve the high light on the toe that is art i cleaned his riflerifles are always clean on servicebecause that is art  i pipeclayed his helmetpipeclay is always used on active service and is indispensable to art i shaved his chin i washed his hands and gave him an air of fatted peace result military tailors patternplate price thank heaven twice as much as for the first sketch which was moderately decent  and do you suppose youre going to give that thing out as your work  why not i did it alone i did it in the interests of sacred homebred art and dickensons weekly  torpenhow smoked in silence for a while then came the verdict delivered from rolling clouds if you were only a mass of blathering vanity dick i wouldnt mindid let you go to the deuce on your own mahlstick but when i consider what you are to me and when i find that to vanity you add the twopennyhalfpenny pique of a twelveyearold girl then i bestir myself in your behalf thus  the canvas ripped as torpenhows booted foot shot through it and the terrier jumped down thinking rats were about  if you have any bad language to use use it you have not i continue  you are an idiot because no man born of woman is strong enough to take liberties with his public even though they bewhich they aintall you say they are  but they dont know any better what can you expect from creatures born and bred in this light dick pointed to the yellow fog if they want furniturepolish let them have furniturepolish so long as they pay for it  they are only men and women you talk as if they were gods  that sounds very fine but it has nothing to do with the case they are they people you have to do work for whether you like it or not they are your masters dont be deceived dickie you arent strong enough to trifle with themor with yourself which is more important  moreovercome back binkie that red daub isnt going anywhereunless you take precious good care you will fall under the damnation of the checkbook and thats worse than death you will get drunkyoure half drunk alreadyon easily acquired money for that money and you own infernal vanity you are willing to deliberately turn out bad work youll do quite enough bad work without knowing it and dickie as i love you and as i know you love me i am not going to let you cut off your nose to spite your face for all the gold in england thats settled now swear  dont know said dick ive been trying to make myself angry but i cant youre so abominably reasonable there will be a row on dickensons weekly i fancy  why the dickenson do you want to work on a weekly paper its slow bleeding of power  it brings in the very desirable dollars said dick his hands in his pockets  torpenhow watched him with large contempt why i thought it was a man said he its a child  no it isnt said dick wheeling quickly youve no notion owhat the certainty of cash means to a man who has always wanted it badly  nothing will pay me for some of my lifes joys on that chinese pigboat for instance when we ate bread and jam for every meal because howang wouldnt allow us anything better and it all tasted of pigchinese pig ive worked for this ive sweated and ive starved for this line on line and month after month and now ive got it i am going to make the most of it while it lasts let them paytheyve no knowledge  what does your majesty please to want you cant smoke more than you do you wont drink youre a gross feeder and you dress in the dark by the look of you you wouldnt keep a horse the other day when i suggested because you said it might fall lame and whenever you cross the street you take a hansom even you are not foolish enough to suppose that theatres and all the live things you can by thereabouts mean life  what earthly need have you for money  its there bless its golden heart said dick its there all the time  providence has sent me nuts while i have teeth to crack em with i havent yet found the nut i wish to crack but im keeping my teeth filed  perhaps some day you and i will go for a walk round the wide earth  with no work to do nobody to worry us and nobody to compete with you would be unfit to speak to in a week besides i shouldnt go i dont care to profit by the price of a mans soulfor thats what it would mean  dick its no use arguing youre a fool  dont see it when i was on that chinese pigboat our captain got credit for saving about twentyfive thousand very seasick little pigs when our old tramp of a steamer fell foul of a timberjunk now taking those pigs as a parallel  oh confound your parallels whenever i try to improve your soul you always drag in some anecdote from your very shady past pigs arent the british public and selfrespect is selfrespect the world over go out for a walk and try to catch some selfrespect and i say if the nilghai comes up this evening can i show him your diggings  surely and dick departed to take counsel with himself in the rapidly gathering london fog  half an hour after he had left the nilghai laboured up the staircase he was the chiefest as he was the youngest of the war correspondents and his experiences dated from the birth of the needlegun saving only his ally keneu the great war eagle there was no man higher in the craft than he and he always opened his conversation with the news that there would be trouble in the balkans in the spring torpenhow laughed as he entered  never mind the trouble in the balkans those little states are always screeching youve heard about dicks luck  yes he has been called up to notoriety hasnt he i hope you keep him properly humble he wants suppressing from time to time  he does hes beginning to take liberties with what he thinks is his reputation  already by jove he has cheek i dont know about his reputation but hell come a cropper if he tries that sort of thing  so i told him i dont think he believes it  they never do when they first start off whats that wreck on the ground there  specimen of his latest impertinence torpenhow thrust the torn edges of the canvas together and showed the wellgroomed picture to the nilghai who looked at it for a moment and whistled  its a chromo said hea chromolitholeomargarine fake what possessed him to do it and yet how thoroughly he has caught the note that catches a public who think with their boots and read with their elbows the coldblooded insolence of the work almost saves it but he mustnt go on with this hasnt he been praised and cockered up too much you know these people here have no sense of proportion theyll call him a second detaille and a thirdhand meissonier while his fashion lasts its windy diet for a colt  i dont think it affects dick much you might as well call a young wolf a lion and expect him to take the compliment in exchange for a shinbone  dicks soul is in the bank hes working for cash  now he has thrown up war work i suppose he doesnt see that the obligations of the service are just the same only the proprietors are changed  how should he know he thinks he is his own master  does he i could undeceive him for his good if theres any virtue in print he wants the whiplash  lay it on with science then id flay him myself but i like him too much  ive no scruples he had the audacity to try to cut me out with a woman at cairo once i forgot that but i remember now  did he cut you out  youll see when i have dealt with him but after all whats the good leave him alone and hell come home if he has any stuff in him dragging or wagging his tail behind him theres more in a week of life than in a lively weekly none the less ill slate him ill slate him ponderously in the cataclysm  good luck to you but i fancy nothing short of a crowbar would make dick wince his soul seems to have been fired before we came across him  hes intensely suspicious and utterly lawless  matter of temper said the nilghai its the same with horses some you wallop and they work some you wallop and they jib and some you wallop and they go out for a walk with their hands in their pockets  thats exactly what dick has done said torpenhow wait till he comes back in the meantime you can begin your slating here ill show you some of his last and worst work in his studio  dick had instinctively sought running water for a comfort to his mood of mind he was leaning over the embankment wall watching the rush of the thames through the arches of westminster bridge he began by thinking of torpenhows advice but as of custom lost himself in the study of the faces flocking past some had death written on their features and dick marvelled that they could laugh others clumsy and coarsebuilt for the most part were alight with love others were merely drawn and lined with work but there was something dick knew to be made out of them all the poor at least should suffer that he might learn and the rich should pay for the output of his learning thus his credit in the world and his cash balance at the bank would be increased so much the better for him he had suffered now he would take toll of the ills of others  the fog was driven apart for a moment and the sun shone a bloodred wafer on the water dick watched the spot till he heard the voice of the tide between the piers die down like the wash of the sea at low tide a girl hard pressed by her lover shouted shamelessly ah get away you beast and a shift of the same wind that had opened the fog drove across dicks face the black smoke of a riversteamer at her berth below the wall he was blinded for the moment then spun round and found himself face to face withmaisie  there was no mistaking the years had turned the child to a woman but they had not altered the darkgray eyes the thin scarlet lips or the firmly modelled mouth and chin and that all should be as it was of old she wore a closely fitting gray dress  since the human soul is finite and not in the least under its own command dick advancing said halloo after the manner of schoolboys and maisie answered oh dick is that you then against his will and before the brain newly released from considerations of the cash balance had time to dictate to the nerves every pulse of dicks body throbbed furiously and his palate dried in his mouth the fog shut down again and maisies face was pearlwhite through it no word was spoken but dick fell into step at her side and the two paced the embankment together keeping the step as perfectly as in their afternoon excursions to the mudflats then dick a little hoarselywhat has happened to amomma  he died dick not cartridges overeating he was always greedy isnt it funny  yes no do you mean amomma  yees no this where have you come from  over there he pointed eastward through the fog and you  oh im in the norththe black north across all the park i am very busy  what do you do  i paint a great deal thats all i have to do  why whats happened you had three hundred a year  i have that still i am painting thats all  are you alone then  theres a girl living with me dont walk so fast dick

tell me where you live i must see you again and perhaps i could help you ii paint a little myself  i may be in the park tomorrow if there is no working light i walk from the marble arch down and back again that is my little excursion but of course i shall see you again she stepped into the omnibus and was swallowed up by the fog  welliamdamned exclaimed dick and returned to the chambers  torpenhow and the nilghai found him sitting on the steps to the studio door repeating the phrase with an awful gravity  youll be more damned when im done with you said the nilghai upheaving his bulk from behind torpenhows shoulder and waving a sheaf of halfdry manuscript dick it is of common report that you are suffering from swelled head  halloo nilghai back again how are the balkans and all the little balkans one side of your face is out of drawing as usual  never mind that i am commissioned to smite you in print torpenhow refuses from false delicacy ive been overhauling the potboilers in your studio they are simply disgraceful  oho thats it is it if you think you can slate me youre wrong you can only describe and you need as much room to turn in on paper as a p and o cargoboat but continue and be swift im going to bed  hm hm hm the first part only deals with your pictures heres the peroration for work done without conviction for power wasted on trivialities for labour expended with levity for the deliberate purpose of winning the easy applause of a fashiondriven public thats his last shot second edition go on  public there remains but one endthe oblivion that is preceded by toleration and cenotaphed with contempt from that fate mr heldar has yet to prove himself out of danger  wowwowwowwowwow said dick profanely its a clumsy ending and vile journalese but its quite true and yethe sprang to his feet and snatched at the manuscriptyou scarred deboshed battered old gladiator youre sent out when a war begins to minister to the blind brutal british publics bestial thirst for blood they have no arenas now but they must have special correspondents youre a fat gladiator who comes up through a trapdoor and talks of what hes seen you stand on precisely the same level as an energetic bishop an affable actress a devastating cyclone ormine own sweet self and you presume to lecture me about my work nilghai if it were worth while id caricature you in four papers  the nilghai winced he had not thought of this  as it is i shall take this stuff and tear it smallso the manuscript fluttered in slips down the dark well of the staircase go home nilghai said dick go home to your lonely little bed and leave me in peace i am about to turn in till tomorrow  why it isnt seven yet said torpenhow with amazement  it shall be two in the morning if i choose said dick backing to the studio door i go to grapple with a serious crisis and i shant want any dinner  the door shut and was locked  what can you do with a man like that said the nilghai  leave him alone hes as mad as a hatter  at eleven there was a kicking on the studio door is the nilghai with you still said a voice from within then tell him he might have condensed the whole of his lumbering nonsense into an epigram only the free are bond and only the bond are free tell him hes an idiot torp and tell him im another  all right come out and have supper youre smoking on an empty stomach  there was no answer    chapter v       i have a thousand men said he      to wait upon my will      and towers nine upon the tyne      and three upon the till       and what care i for you men said she      or towers from tyne to till      sith you must go with me she said      to wait upon my will       sir hoggie and the fairies  next morning torpenhow found dick sunk in deepest repose of tobacco  well madman how dyou feel  i dont know im trying to find out  you had much better do some work  maybe but im in no hurry ive made a discovery torp theres too much ego in my cosmos  not really is this revelation due to my lectures or the nilghais  it came to me suddenly all on my own account much too much ego and now im going to work  he turned over a few halffinished sketches drummed on a new canvas cleaned three brushes set binkie to bite the toes of the lay figure rattled through his collection of arms and accoutrements and then went out abruptly declaring that he had done enough for the day  this is positively indecent said torpenhow and the first time that dick has ever broken up a light morning perhaps he has found out that he has a soul or an artistic temperament or something equally valuable  that comes of leaving him alone for a month perhaps he has been going out of evenings i must look to this he rang for the baldheaded old housekeeper whom nothing could astonish or annoy  beeton did mr heldar dine out at all while i was out of town  never laid is dressclothes out once sir all the time mostly e dined in but e brought some most remarkable young gentlemen up ere after theatres once or twice remarkable fancy they was you gentlemen on the top floor does very much as you likes but it do seem to me sir droppin a walkinstick down five flights o stairs an then goin down four abreast to pick it up again at halfpast two in the mornin singin bring back the whiskey willie darlinnot once or twice but scores o timesisnt charity to the other tenants what i say is do as you would be done by thats my motto  of course of course im afraid the top floor isnt the quietest in the house  i make no complaints sir i have spoke to mr heldar friendly an he laughed an did me a picture of the missis that is as good as a coloured print it asnt the high shine of a photograph but what i say is never look a gifthorse in the mouth mr heldars dressclothes avent been on him for weeks  then its all right said torpenhow to himself orgies are healthy and dick has a head of his own but when it comes to women making eyes im not so certainbinkie never you be a man little dorglums theyre contrary brutes and they do things without any reason  dick had turned northward across the park but he was walking in the spirit on the mudflats with maisie he laughed aloud as he remembered the day when he had decked amommas horns with the hamfrills and maisie white with rage had cuffed him how long those four years seemed in review and how closely maisie was connected with every hour of them storm across the sea and maisie in a gray dress on the beach sweeping her drenched hair out of her eyes and laughing at the homeward race of the fishingsmacks hot sunshine on the mudflats and maisie sniffing scornfully with her chin in the air maisie flying before the wind that threshed the foreshore and drove the sand like small shot about her ears maisie very composed and independent telling lies to mrs jennett while dick supported her with coarser perjuries maisie picking her way delicately from stone to stone a pistol in her hand and her teeth firmset and maisie in a gray dress sitting on the grass between the mouth of a cannon and a nodding yellow seapoppy the pictures passed before him one by one and the last stayed the longest  dick was perfectly happy with a quiet peace that was as new to his mind as it was foreign to his experiences it never occurred to him that there might be other calls upon his time than loafing across the park in the forenoon  theres a good working light now he said watching his shadow placidly some poor devil ought to be grateful for this and theres maisie  she was walking towards him from the marble arch and he saw that no mannerism of her gait had been changed it was good to find her still maisie and so to speak his nextdoor neighbour no greeting passed between them because there had been none in the old days  what are you doing out of your studio at this hour said dick as one who was entitled to ask  idling just idling i got angry with a chin and scraped it out then i left it in a little heap of paintchips and came away  i know what paletteknifing means what was the piccy  a fancy head that wouldnt come righthorrid thing  i dont like working over scraped paint when im doing flesh the grain comes up woolly as the paint dries  not if you scrape properly maisie waved her hand to illustrate her methods there was a dab of paint on the white cuff dick laughed  youre as untidy as ever  that comes well from you look at your own cuff  by jove yes its worse than yours i dont think weve much altered in anything lets see though he looked at maisie critically the pale blue haze of an autumn day crept between the treetrunks of the park and made a background for the gray dress the black velvet toque above the black hair and the resolute profile  no theres nothing changed how good it is dyou remember when i fastened your hair into the snap of a handbag  maisie nodded with a twinkle in her eyes and turned her full face to dick  wait a minute said he that mouth is down at the corners a little  whos been worrying you maisie  no one but myself i never seem to get on with my work and yet i try hard enough and kami says  continuez mesdemoiselles continuez toujours mes enfants kami is depressing i beg your pardon  yes thats what he says he told me last summer that i was doing better and hed let me exhibit this year  not in this place surely  of course not the salon  you fly high  ive been beating my wings long enough where do you exhibit dick  i dont exhibit i sell  what is your line then  havent you heard dicks eyes opened was this thing possible he cast about for some means of conviction they were not far from the marble arch come up oxford street a little and ill show you  a small knot of people stood round a printshop that dick knew well  some reproduction of my work inside he said with suppressed triumph never before had success tasted so sweet upon the tongue you see the sort of things i paint dyou like it  maisie looked at the wild whirling rush of a fieldbattery going into action under fire two artillerymen stood behind her in the crowd  theyve chucked the off leadorse said one to the other es tore up awful but theyre makin good time with the others that leaddriver drives better nor you tom see ow cunnin es nursin is orse  number threell be off the limber next jolt was the answer  no e wont see ow is foots braced against the iron es all right  dick watched maisies face and swelled with joyfine rank vulgar triumph she was more interested in the little crowd than in the picture  that was something that she could understand  and i wanted it so oh i did want it so she said at last under her breath  meall me said dick placidly look at their faces it hits em they dont know what makes their eyes and mouths open but i know and i know my works right  yes i see oh what a thing to have come to one  come to one indeed i had to go out and look for it what do you think  i call it success tell me how you got it  they returned to the park and dick delivered himself of the saga of his own doings with all the arrogance of a young man speaking to a woman  from the beginning he told the tale the iiis flashing through the records as telegraphpoles fly past the traveller maisie listened and nodded her head the histories of strife and privation did not move her a hairsbreadth at the end of each canto he would conclude and that gave me some notion of handling colour or light or whatever it might be that he had set out to pursue and understand he led her breathless across half the world speaking as he had never spoken in his life before  and in the floodtide of his exaltation there came upon him a great desire to pick up this maiden who nodded her head and said i understand go onto pick her up and carry her away with him because she was maisie and because she understood and because she was his right and a woman to be desired above all women  then he checked himself abruptly and so i took all i wanted he said and i had to fight for it now you tell  maisies tale was almost as gray as her dress it covered years of patient toil backed by savage pride that would not be broken thought dealers laughed and fogs delayed work and kami was unkind and even sarcastic and girls in other studios were painfully polite it had a few bright spots in pictures accepted at provincial exhibitions but it wound up with the oft repeated wail and so you see dick i had no success though i worked so hard  then pity filled dick even thus had maisie spoken when she could not hit the breakwater half an hour before she had kissed him and that had happened yesterday  never mind he said ill tell you something if youll believe it the words were shaping themselves of their own accord the whole thing lock stock and barrel isnt worth one big yellow seapoppy below fort keeling  maisie flushed a little its all very well for you to talk but youve had the success and i havent  let me talk then i know youll understand maisie dear it sounds a bit absurd but those ten years never existed and ive come back again it really is just the same cant you see youre alone now and im alone  whats the use of worrying come to me instead darling  maisie poked the gravel with her parasol they were sitting on a bench  i understand she said slowly but ive got my work to do and i must do it  do it with me then dear i wont interrupt  no i couldnt its my workmineminemine ive been alone all my life in myself and im not going to belong to anybody except myself i remember things as well as you do but that doesnt count we were babies then and we didnt know what was before us dick dont be selfish i think i see my way to a little success next year dont take it away from me  i beg your pardon darling its my fault for speaking stupidly i cant expect you to throw up all your life just because im back ill go to my own place and wait a little  but dick i dont want you togoout ofmy life now youve just come back  im at your orders forgive me dick devoured the troubled little face with his eyes there was triumph in them because he could not conceive that maisie should refuse sooner or later to love him since he loved her  its wrong of me said maisie more slowly than before its wrong and selfish but oh ive been so lonely no you misunderstand now ive seen you againits absurd but i want to keep you in my life  naturally we belong  we dont but you always understood me and there is so much in my work that you could help me in you know things and the ways of doing things you must  i do i fancy or else i dont know myself then you wont care to lose sight of me altogether andyou want me to help you in your work  yes but remember dick nothing will ever come of it thats why i feel so selfish cant things stay as they are i do want your help  you shall have it but lets consider i must see your pics first and overhaul your sketches and find out about your tendencies you should see what the papers say about my tendencies then ill give you good advice and you shall paint according isnt that it maisie  again there was triumph in dicks eye  its too good of youmuch too good because you are consoling yourself with what will never happen and i know that and yet i want to keep you dont blame me later please  im going into the matter with my eyes open moreover the queen can do no wrong it isnt your selfishness that impresses me its your audacity in proposing to make use of me  pooh youre only dickand a printshop  very good thats all i am but maisie you believe dont you that i love you i dont want you to have any false notions about brothers and sisters  maisie looked up for a moment and dropped her eyes  its absurd buti believe i wish i could send you away before you get angry with me butbut the girl that lives with me is redhaired and an impressionist and all our notions clash  so do ours i think never mind three months from today we shall be laughing at this together  maisie shook her head mournfully i knew you wouldnt understand and it will only hurt you more when you find out look at my face dick and tell me what you see  they stood up and faced each other for a moment the fog was gathering and it stifled the roar of the traffic of london beyond the railings dick brought all his painfully acquired knowledge of faces to bear on the eyes mouth and chin underneath the black velvet toque  its the same maisie and its the same me he said weve both nice little wills of our own and one or other of us has to be broken now about the future i must come and see your pictures some dayi suppose when the redhaired girl is on the premises  sundays are my best times you must come on sundays there are such heaps of things i want to talk about and ask your advice about now i must get back to work  try to find out before next sunday what i am said dick dont take my word for anything ive told you goodbye darling and bless you  maisie stole away like a little gray mouse dick watched her till she was out of sight but he did not hear her say to herself very soberly im a wretcha horrid selfish wretch but its dick and dick will understand  no one has yet explained what actually happens when an irresistible force meets the immovable post though many have thought deeply even as dick thought he tried to assure himself that maisie would be led in a few weeks by his mere presence and discourse to a better way of thinking then he remembered much too distinctly her face and all that was written on it  if i know anything of heads he said theres everything in that face but love i shall have to put that in myself and that chin and mouth wont be won for nothing but shes right she knows what she wants and shes going to get it what insolence me of all the people in the wide world to use me but then shes maisie theres no getting over that fact and its good to see her again this business must have been simmering at the back of my head for years shell use me as i used binat at port said  shes quite right it will hurt a little i shall have to see her every sundaylike a young man courting a housemaid shes sure to come around and yetthat mouth isnt a yielding mouth i shall be wanting to kiss her all the time and i shall have to look at her picturesi dont even know what sort of work she does yetand i shall have to talk about artwomans art therefore particularly and perpetually damn all varieties of art it did me a good turn once and now its in my way ill go home and do some art  halfway to the studio dick was smitten with a terrible thought the figure of a solitary woman in the fog suggested it  shes all alone in london with a redhaired impressionist girl who probably has the digestion of an ostrich most redhaired people have  maisies a bilious little body theyll eat like lone womenmeals at all hours and tea with all meals i remember how the students in paris used to pig along she may fall ill at any minute and i shant be able to help  whew this is ten times worse than owning a wife  torpenhow entered the studio at dusk and looked at dick with eyes full of the austere love that springs up between men who have tugged at the same oar together and are yoked by custom and use and the intimacies of toil this is a good love and since it allows and even encourages strife recrimination and brutal sincerity does not die but grows and is proof against any absence and evil conduct  dick was silent after he handed torpenhow the filled pipe of council he thought of maisie and her possible needs it was a new thing to think of anybody but torpenhow who could think for himself here at last was an outlet for that cash balance he could adorn maisie barbarically with jewelrya thick gold necklace round that little neck bracelets upon the rounded arms and rings of price upon her handsthe cool temperate ringless hands that he had taken between his own it was an absurd thought for maisie would not even allow him to put one ring on one finger and she would laugh at golden trappings it would be better to sit with her quietly in the dusk his arm around her neck and her face on his shoulder as befitted husband and wife torpenhows boots creaked that night and his strong voice jarred dicks brows contracted and he murmured an evil word because he had taken all his success as a right and part payment for past discomfort and now he was checked in his stride by a woman who admitted all the success and did not instantly care for him  i say old man said torpenhow who had made one or two vain attempts at conversation i havent put your back up by anything ive said lately have i  you no how could you  liver out of order  the truly healthy man doesnt know he has a liver im only a bit worried about things in general i suppose its my soul  the truly healthy man doesnt know he has a soul what business have you with luxuries of that kind  it came of itself whos the man that says that were all islands shouting lies to each other across seas of misunderstanding  hes right whoever he isexcept about the misunderstanding i dont think we could misunderstand each other  the blue smoke curled back from the ceiling in clouds then torpenhow insinuatinglydick is it a woman  be hanged if its anything remotely resembling a woman and if you begin to talk like that ill hire a redbrick studio with white paint trimmings and begonias and petunias and blue hungarias to play among threeandsixpenny potpalms and ill mount all my pics in anilinedye plush plasters and ill invite every woman who maunders over what her guidebooks tell her is art and you shall receive em torpin a snuffbrown velvet coat with yellow trousers and an orange tie youll like that  too thin dick a better man than you once denied with cursing and swearing youve overdone it just as he did its no business of mine of course but its comforting to think that somewhere under the stars theres saving up for you a tremendous thrashing whether itll come from heaven or earth i dont know but its bound to come and break you up a little you want hammering  dick shivered all right said he when this island is disintegrated it will call for you  i shall come round the corner and help to disintegrate it some more  were talking nonsense come along to a theatre    chapter vi       and you may lead a thousand men      nor ever draw the rein      but ere ye lead the faery queen      twill burst your heart in twain       he has slipped his foot from the stirrupbar      the bridle from his hand      and he is bound by hand and foot      to the queen o faeryland       sir hoggie and the fairies  some weeks later on a very foggy sunday dick was returning across the park to his studio this he said is evidently the thrashing that torp meant it hurts more than i expected but the queen can do no wrong and she certainly has some notion of drawing  he had just finished a sunday visit to maisiealways under the green eyes of the redhaired impressionist girl whom he learned to hate at sightand was tingling with a keen sense of shame sunday after sunday putting on his best clothes he had walked over to the untidy house north of the park first to see maisies pictures and then to criticise and advise upon them as he realised that they were productions on which advice would not be wasted sunday after sunday and his love grew with each visit he had been compelled to cram his heart back from between his lips when it prompted him to kiss maisie several times and very much indeed sunday after sunday the head above the heart had warned him that maisie was not yet attainable and that it would be better to talk as connectedly as possible upon the mysteries of the craft that was all in all to her therefore it was his fate to endure weekly torture in the studio built out over the clammy back garden of a frail stuffy little villa where nothing was ever in its right place and nobody every calledto endure and to watch maisie moving to and fro with the teacups he abhorred tea but since it gave him a little longer time in her presence he drank it devoutly and the redhaired girl sat in an untidy heap and eyed him without speaking she was always watching him  once and only once when she had left the studio maisie showed him an album that held a few poor cuttings from provincial papersthe briefest of hurried notes on some of her pictures sent to outlying exhibitions dick stooped and kissed the paintsmudged thumb on the open page oh my love my love he muttered do you value these things chuck em into the wastepaper basket  not till i get something better said maisie shutting the book  then dick moved by no respect for his public and a very deep regard for the maiden did deliberately propose in order to secure more of these coveted cuttings that he should paint a picture which maisie should sign  thats childish said maisie and i didnt think it of you it must be my work mineminemine  go and design decorative medallions for rich brewers houses you are thoroughly good at that dick was sick and savage  better things than medallions dick was the answer in tones that recalled a grayeyed atoms fearless speech to mrs jennett dick would have abased himself utterly but that other girl trailed in  next sunday he laid at maisies feet small gifts of pencils that could almost draw of themselves and colours in whose permanence he believed and he was ostentatiously attentive to the work in hand it demanded among other things an exposition of the faith that was in him  torpenhows hair would have stood on end had he heard the fluency with which dick preached his own gospel of art  a month before dick would have been equally astonished but it was maisies will and pleasure and he dragged his words together to make plain to her comprehension all that had been hidden to himself of the whys and wherefores of work there is not the least difficulty in doing a thing if you only know how to do it the trouble is to explain your method  i could put this right if i had a brush in my hand said dick despairingly over the modelling of a chin that maisie complained would not look fleshit was the same chin that she had scraped out with the palette knifebut i find it almost impossible to teach you theres a queer grin dutch touch about your painting that i like but ive a notion that youre weak in drawing you foreshorten as though you never used the model and youve caught kamis pasty way of dealing with flesh in shadow then again though you dont know it yourself you shirk hard work suppose you spend some of your time on line lone line doesnt allow of shirking oils do and three square inches of flashy tricky stuff in the corner of a pic sometimes carry a bad thing offas i know thats immoral do linework for a little while and then i can tell more about your powers as old kami used to say  maisie protested she did not care for the pure line  i know said dick you want to do your fancy heads with a bunch of flowers at the base of the neck to hide bad modelling the redhaired girl laughed a little you want to do landscapes with cattle kneedeep in grass to hide bad drawing you want to do a great deal more than you can do you have sense of colour but you want form colours a giftput it aside and think no more about itbut form you can be drilled into  now all your fancy headsand some of them are very goodwill keep you exactly where you are with line you must go forward or backward and it will show up all your weaknesses  but other people began maisie  you mustnt mind what other people do if their souls were your soul it would be different you stand and fall by your own work remember and its waste of time to think of any one else in this battle  dick paused and the longing that had been so resolutely put away came back into his eyes he looked at maisie and the look asked as plainly as words was it not time to leave all this barren wilderness of canvas and counsel and join hands with life and love  maisie assented to the new programme of schooling so adorably that dick could hardly restrain himself from picking her up then and there and carrying her off to the nearest registrars office it was the implicit obedience to the spoken word and the blank indifference to the unspoken desire that baffled and buffeted his soul he held authority in that houseauthority limited indeed to onehalf of one afternoon in seven but very real while it lasted maisie had learned to appeal to him on many subjects from the proper packing of pictures to the condition of a smoky chimney the redhaired girl never consulted him about anything  on the other hand she accepted his appearances without protest and watched him always he discovered that the meals of the establishment were irregular and fragmentary they depended chiefly on tea pickles and biscuit as he had suspected from the beginning the girls were supposed to market week and week about but they lived with the help of a charwoman as casually as the young ravens maisie spent most of her income on models and the other girl revelled in apparatus as refined as her work was rough armed with knowledge dearbought from the docks dick warned maisie that the end of semistarvation meant the crippling of power to work which was considerably worse than death  maisie took the warning and gave more thought to what she ate and drank when his trouble returned upon him as it generally did in the long winter twilights the remembrance of that little act of domestic authority and his coercion with a hearthbrush of the smoky drawingroom chimney stung dick like a whiplash  he conceived that this memory would be the extreme of his sufferings till one sunday the redhaired girl announced that she would make a study of dicks head and that he would be good enough to sit still andquite as an afterthoughtlook at maisie he sat because he could not well refuse and for the space of half an hour he reflected on all the people in the past whom he had laid open for the purposes of his own craft he remembered binat most distinctlythat binat who had once been an artist and talked about degradation  it was the merest monochrome roughing in of a head but it presented the dumb waiting the longing and above all the hopeless enslavement of the man in a spirit of bitter mockery  ill buy it said dick promptly at your own price  my price is too high but i dare say youll be as grateful if the wet sketch fluttered from the girls hand and fell into the ashes of the studio stove when she picked it up it was hopelessly smudged  oh its all spoiled said maisie and i never saw it was it like  thank you said dick under his breath to the redhaired girl and he removed himself swiftly  how that man hates me said the girl and how he loves you maisie  what nonsense i knew dicks very fond of me but he had his work to do and i have mine  yes he is fond of you and i think he knows there is something in impressionism after all maisie cant you see  see see what  nothing only i know that if i could get any man to look at me as that man looks at you idi dont know what id do but he hates me oh how he hates me  she was not altogether correct dicks hatred was tempered with gratitude for a few moments and then he forgot the girl entirely only the sense of shame remained and he was nursing it across the park in the fog therell be an explosion one of these days he said wrathfully but it isnt maisies fault shes right quite right as far as she knows and i cant blame her this business has been going on for three months nearly  three monthsand it cost me ten years knocking about to get at the notion the merest raw notion of my work thats true but then i didnt have pins drawingpins and paletteknives stuck into me every sunday  oh my little darling if ever i break you somebody will have a very bad time of it no she wont id be as big a fool about her as i am now ill poison that redhaired girl on my weddingdayshes unwholesomeand now ill pass on these present bad times to torp  torpenhow had been moved to lecture dick more than once lately on the sin of levity and dick and listened and replied not a word in the weeks between the first few sundays of his discipline he had flung himself savagely into his work resolved that maisie should at least know the full stretch of his powers then he had taught maisie that she must not pay the least attention to any work outside her own and maisie had obeyed him all too well she took his counsels but was not interested in his pictures  your things smell of tobacco and blood she said once cant you do anything except soldiers  i could do a head of you that would startle you thought dickthis was before the redhaired girl had brought him under the guillotinebut he only said i am very sorry and harrowed torpenhows soul that evening with blasphemies against art later insensibly and to a large extent against his own will he ceased to interest himself in his own work  for maisies sake and to soothe the selfrespect that it seemed to him he lost each sunday he would not consciously turn out bad stuff but since maisie did not care even for his best it were better not to do anything at all save wait and mark time between sunday and sunday torpenhow was disgusted as the weeks went by fruitless and then attacked him one sunday evening when dick felt utterly exhausted after three hours biting selfrestraint in maisies presence there was language and torpenhow withdrew to consult the nilghai who had come it to talk continental politics  boneidle is he careless and touched in the temper said the nilghai  it isnt worth worrying over dick is probably playing the fool with a woman  isnt that bad enough  no she may throw him out of gear and knock his work to pieces for a while she may even turn up here some day and make a scene on the staircase one never knows but until dick speaks of his own accord you had better not touch him he is no easytempered man to handle  no i wish he were he is such an aggressive cocksure youbedamned fellow  hell get that knocked out of him in time he must learn that he cant storm up and down the world with a box of moist tubes and a slick brush  youre fond of him  id take any punishment thats in store for him if i could but the worst of it is no man can save his brother  no and the worser of it is there is no discharge in this war dick must learn his lesson like the rest of us talking of war therell be trouble in the balkans in the spring  that trouble is long coming i wonder if we could drag dick out there when it comes off  dick entered the room soon afterwards and the question was put to him  not good enough he said shortly im too comfy where i am  surely you arent taking all the stuff in the papers seriously said the nilghai your vogue will be ended in less than six monthsthe public will know your touch and go on to something newand where will you be then  here in england  when you might be doing decent work among us out there nonsense i shall go the keneu will be there torp will be there cassavetti will be there and the whole lot of us will be there and we shall have as much as ever we can do with unlimited fighting and the chance for you of seeing things that would make the reputation of three verestchagins  um said dick pulling at his pipe  you prefer to stay here and imagine that all the world is gaping at your pictures just think how full an average mans life is of his own pursuits and pleasures when twenty thousand of him find time to look up between mouthfuls and grunt something about something they arent the least interested in the net result is called fame reputation or notoriety according to the taste and fancy of the speller my lord  i know that as well as you do give me credit for a little gumption  be hanged if i do  be hanged then you probably will befor a spy by excited turks  heighho im weary dead weary and virtue has gone out of me dick dropped into a chair and was fast asleep in a minute  thats a bad sign said the nilghai in an undertone  torpenhow picked the pipe from the waistcoat where it was beginning to burn and put a pillow behind the head we cant help we cant help he said its a good ugly sort of old cocoanut and im fond of it theres the scar of the wipe he got when he was cut over in the square  shouldnt wonder if that has made him a trifle mad  i should hes a most businesslike madman  then dick began to snore furiously  oh here no affection can stand this sort of thing wake up dick and go and sleep somewhere else if you intend to make a noise about it  when a cat has been out on the tiles all night said the nilghai in his beard i notice that she usually sleeps all day this is natural history  dick staggered away rubbing his eyes and yawning in the nightwatches he was overtaken with an idea so simple and so luminous that he wondered he had never conceived it before it was full of craft he would seek maisie on a weekdaywould suggest an excursion and would take her by train to fort keeling over the very ground that they two had trodden together ten years ago  as a general rule he explained to his chinlathered reflection in the morning it isnt safe to cross an old trail twice things remind one of things and a cold wind gets up and you feel said but this is an exception to every rule that ever was ill go to maisie at once  fortunately the redhaired girl was out shopping when he arrived and maisie in a paintspattered blouse was warring with her canvas she was not pleased to see him for weekday visits were a stretch of the bond and it needed all his courage to explain his errand  i know youve been working too hard he concluded with an air of authority if you do that youll break down you had much better come  where said maisie wearily she had been standing before her easel too long and was very tired  anywhere you please well take a train tomorrow and see where it stops well have lunch somewhere and ill bring you back in the evening  if theres a good working light tomorrow i lose a day maisie balanced the heavy white chestnut palette irresolutely  dick bit back an oath that was hurrying to his lips he had not yet learned patience with the maiden to whom her work was all in all  youll lose ever so many more dear if you use every hour of working light overworks only murderous idleness dont be unreasonable ill call for you tomorrow after breakfast early  but surely you are going to ask  no i am not i want you and nobody else besides she hates me as much as i hate her she wont care to come tomorrow then and pray that we get sunshine  dick went away delighted and by consequence did no work whatever  he strangled a wild desire to order a special train but bought a great gray kangaroo cloak lined with glossy black marten and then retired into himself to consider things  im going out for the day tomorrow with dick said maisie to the redhaired girl when the latter returned tired from marketing in the edgware road  he deserves it i shall have the studio floor thoroughly scrubbed while youre away its very dirty  maisie had enjoyed no sort of holiday for months and looked forward to the little excitement but not without misgivings  theres nobody nicer than dick when he talks sensibly she though but im sure hell be silly and worry me and im sure i cant tell him anything hed like to hear if hed only be sensible i should like him so much better  dicks eyes were full of joy when he made his appearance next morning and saw maisie grayulstered and blackvelvethatted standing in the hallway palaces of marble and not sordid imitation of grained wood were surely the fittest background for such a divinity the redhaired girl drew her into the studio for a moment and kissed her hurriedly  maisies eyebrows climbed to the top of her forehead she was altogether unused to these demonstrations mind my hat she said hurrying away and ran down the steps to dick waiting by the hansom  are you quite warm enough are you sure you wouldnt like some more breakfast put the cloak over you knees  im quite comfy thanks where are we going dick oh do stop singing like that people will think were mad  let em thinkif the exertion doesnt kill them they dont know who we are and im sure i dont care who they are my faith maisie youre looking lovely  maisie stared directly in front of her and did not reply the wind of a keen clear winter morning had put colour into her cheeks overhead the creamyyellow smokeclouds were thinning away one by one against a paleblue sky and the improvident sparrows broke off from waterspout committees and cabrank cabals to clamour of the coming of spring  it will be lovely weather in the country said dick  but where are we going  wait and see  the stopped at victoria and dick sought tickets for less than half the fraction of an instant it occurred to maisie comfortably settled by the waitingroom fire that it was much more pleasant to send a man to the bookingoffice than to elbow ones own way through the crowd dick put her into a pullmansolely on account of the warmth there and she regarded the extravagance with grave scandalised eyes as the train moved out into the country  i wish i knew where we are going she repeated for the twentieth time  the name of a wellremembered station flashed by towards the end of the run and maisie was delighted  oh dick you villain  well i thought you might like to see the place again you havent been here since the old times have you  no i never cared to see mrs jennett again and she was all that was ever there  not quite look out a minute theres the windmill above the potatofields they havent built villas there yet dyou remember when i shut you up in it  yes how she beat you for it i never told it was you  she guessed i jammed a stick under the door and told you that i was burying amomma alive in the potatoes and you believed me you had a trusting nature in those days  they laughed and leaned to look out identifying ancient landmarks with many reminiscences dick fixed his weather eye on the curve of maisies cheek very near his own and watched the blood rise under the clear skin he congratulated himself upon his cunning and looked that the evening would bring him a great reward  when the train stopped they went out to look at an old town with new eyes first but from a distance they regarded the house of mrs jennett  suppose she should come out now what would you do said dick with mock terror  i should make a face  show then said dick dropping into the speech of childhood  maisie made that face in the direction of the mean little villa and dick laughed  this is disgraceful said maisie mimicking mrs jennetts tone  maisie you run in at once and learn the collect gospel and epistle for the next three sundays after all ive taught you too and three helps every sunday at dinner dicks always leading you into mischief if you arent a gentleman dick you might at least  the sentence ended abruptly maisie remembered when it had last been used  try to behave like one said dick promptly quite right now well get some lunch and go on to fort keelingunless youd rather drive there  we must walk out of respect to the place how little changed it all is  they turned in the direction of the sea through unaltered streets and the influence of old things lay upon them presently they passed a confectioners shop much considered in the days when their joint pocketmoney amounted to a shilling a week  dick have you any pennies said maisie half to herself  only three and if you think youre going to have two of em to buy peppermints with youre wrong she says peppermints arent ladylike  again they laughed and again the colour came into maisies cheeks as the blood boiled through dicks heart after a large lunch they went down to the beach and to fort keeling across the waste windbitten land that no builder had thought it worth his while to defile the winter breeze came in from the sea and sang about their ears  maisie said dick your nose is getting a crude prussian blue at the tip  ill race you as far as you please for as much as you please  she looked round cautiously and with a laugh set off swiftly as the ulster allowed till she was out of breath  we used to run miles she panted its absurd that we cant run now  old age dear this it is to get fat and sleek in town when i wished to pull you hair you generally ran for three miles shrieking at the top of your voice i ought to know because those shrieks of yours were meant to call up mrs jennett with a cane and  dick i never got you a beating on purpose in my life  no of course you never did good heavens look at the sea  why its the same as ever said maisie  torpenhow had gathered from mr beeton that dick properly dressed and shaved had left the house at halfpast eight in the morning with a travellingrug over his arm the nilghai rolled in at midday for chess and polite conversation  its worse than anything i imagined said torpenhow  oh the everlasting dick i suppose you fuss over him like a hen with one chick let him run riot if he thinks itll amuse him you can whip a young pup off feather but you cant whip a young man  it isnt a woman its one woman and its a girl  wheres your proof  he got up and went out at eight this morninggot up in the middle of the night by jove a thing he never does except when hes on service  even then remember we had to kick him out of his blankets before the fight began at elmaghrib its disgusting  it looks odd but maybe hes decided to buy a horse at last he might get up for that mightnt he  buy a blazing wheelbarrow hed have told us if there was a horse in the wind its a girl  dont be certain perhaps its only a married woman  dick has some sense of humour if you havent who gets up in the gray dawn to call on another mans wife its a girl  let it be a girl then she may teach him that theres somebody else in the world besides himself  shell spoil his hand shell waste his time and shell marry him and ruin his work for ever hell be a respectable married man before we can stop him andhell ever go on the long trail again  all quite possible but the earth wont spin the other way when that happens no ho id give something to see dick go wooing with the boys dont worry about it these things be with allah and we can only look on get the chessmen  the redhaired girl was lying down in her own room staring at the ceiling the footsteps of people on the pavement sounded as they grew indistinct in the distance like a manytimesrepeated kiss that was all one long kiss her hands were by her side and they opened and shut savagely from time to time  the charwoman in charge of the scrubbing of the studio knocked at her door beg y pardon miss but in cleanin of a floor theres two not to say three kind of soap which is yaller an mottled an disinfectink  now jist before i took my pail into the passage i though it would be preaps jest as well if i was to come up ere an ask you what sort of soap you was wishful that i should use on them boards the yaller soap miss  there was nothing in the speech to have caused the paroxysm of fury that drove the redhaired girl into the middle of the room almost shoutingdo you suppose i care what you use any kind will doany kind  the woman fled and the redhaired girl looked at her own reflection in the glass for an instant and covered her face with her hands it was as though she had shouted some shameless secret aloud    chapter vii       roses red and roses white      plucked i for my loves delight       she would none of all my posies      bade me gather her blue roses       half the world i wandered through      seeking where such flowers grew      half the world unto my quest      answered but with laugh and jest       it may be beyond the grave      she shall find what she would have       mine was but an idle quest      roses white and red are bestblue roses  the sea had not changed its waters were low on the mudbanks and the marazion bellbuoy clanked and swung in the tideway on the white beachsand dried stumps of seapoppy shivered and chattered  i dont see the old breakwater said maisie under her breath  lets be thankful that we have as much as we have i dont believe theyve mounted a single new gun on the fort since we were here come and look  they came to the glacis of fort keeling and sat down in a nook sheltered from the wind under the tarred throat of a fortypounder cannon  now if ammoma were only here said maisie  for a long time both were silent then dick took maisies hand and called her by her name  she shook her head and looked out to sea  maisie darling doesnt it make any difference  no between clenched teeth idid tell you if it did but it doesnt oh dick please be sensible  dont you think that it ever will  no im sure it wont  why  maisie rested her chin on her hand and still regarding the sea spoke hurriedlyi know what you want perfectly well but i cant give it to you dick it isnt my fault indeed it isnt if i felt that i could care for any onebut i dont feel that i care i simply dont understand what the feeling means  is that true dear  youve been very good to me dickie and the only way i can pay you back is by speaking the truth i darent tell a fib i despise myself quit enough as it is  what in the world for  becausebecause i take everything that you give me and i give you nothing in return its mean and selfish of me and whenever i think of it it worries me  understand once for all then that i can manage my own affairs and if i choose to do anything you arent to blame you havent a single thing to reproach yourself with darling  yes i have and talking only makes it worse  then dont talk about it  how can i help myself if you find me alone for a minute you are always talking about it and when you arent you look it you dont know how i despise myself sometimes  great goodness said dick nearly jumping to his feet speak the truth now maisie if you never speak it again do idoes this worrying bore you  no it does not  youd tell me if it did  i should let you know i think  thank you the other thing is fatal but you must learn to forgive a man when hes in love hes always a nuisance you must have known that  maisie did not consider the last question worth answering and dick was forced to repeat it  there were other men of course they always worried just when i was in the middle of my work and wanted me to listen to them  did you listen  at first and they couldnt understand why i didnt care and they used to praise my pictures and i thought they meant it i used to be proud of the praise and tell kami andi shall never forgetonce kami laughed at me  you dont like being laughed at maisie do you  i hate it i never laugh at other people unlessunless they do bad work  dick tell me honestly what you think of my pictures generallyof everything of mine that youve seen  honest honest and honest over quoted dick from a catchword of long ago tell me what kami always says  maisie hesitated hehe says that there is feeling in them  how dare you tell me a fib like that remember i was under kami for two years i know exactly what he says  it isnt a fib  its worse its a halftruth kami says when he puts his head on one sidesoil y a du sentiment mais il ny a pas de parti pris he rolled the r threateningly as kami used to do  yes that is what he says and im beginning to think that he is right  certainly he is dick admitted that two people in the world could do and say no wrong kami was the man  and now you say the same thing its so disheartening  im sorry but you asked me to speak the truth besides i love you too much to pretend about your work its strong its patient sometimesnot alwaysand sometimes theres power in it but theres no special reason why it should be done at all at least thats how it strikes me  theres no special reason why anything in the world should ever be done you know that as well as i do i only want success  youre going the wrong way to get it then hasnt kami ever told you so  dont quote kami to me i want to know what you think my works bad to begin with  i didnt say that and i dont think it  its amateurish then  that it most certainly is not youre a workwoman darling to your bootheels and i respect you for that  you dont laugh at me behind my back  no dear you see you are more to me than any one else put this cloak thing round you or youll get chilled  maisie wrapped herself in the soft marten skins turning the gray kangaroo fur to the outside  this is delicious she said rubbing her chin thoughtfully along the fur  well why am i wrong in trying to get a little success  just because you try dont you understand darling good work has nothing to do withdoesnt belong tothe person who does it its put into him or her from outside  but how does that affect  wait a minute all we can do is to learn how to do our work to be masters of our materials instead of servants and never to be afraid of anything  i understand that  everything else comes from outside ourselves very good if we sit down quietly to work out notions that are sent to us we may or we may not do something that isnt bad a great deal depends on being master of the bricks and mortar of the trade but the instant we begin to think about success and the effect of our workto play with one eye on the gallerywe lose power and touch and everything else at least thats how i have found it instead of being quiet and giving every power you possess to your work youre fretting over something which you can neither help no hinder by a minute see  its so easy for you to talk in that way people like what you do dont you ever think about the gallery  much too often but im always punished for it by loss of power its as simple as the rule of three if we make light of our work by using it for our own ends our work will make light of us and as were the weaker we shall suffer  i dont treat my work lightly you know that its everything to me  of course but whether you realise it or not you give two strokes for yourself to one for your work it isnt your fault darling i do exactly the same thing and know that im doing it most of the french schools and all the schools here drive the students to work for their own credit and for the sake of their pride i was told that all the world was interested in my work and everybody at kamis talked turpentine and i honestly believed that the world needed elevating and influencing and all manner of impertinences by my brushes by jove i actually believed that when my little head was bursting with a notion that i couldnt handle because i hadnt sufficient knowledge of my craft i used to run about wondering at my own magnificence and getting ready to astonish the world  but surely one can do that sometimes  very seldom with malice aforethought darling and when its done its such a tiny thing and the worlds so big and all but a millionth part of it doesnt care maisie come with me and ill show you something of the size of the world one can no more avoid working than eatingthat goes on by itselfbut try to see what you are working for i know such little heavens that i could take you toislands tucked away under the line  you sight them after weeks of crashing through water as black as black marble because its so deep and you sit in the forechains day after day and see the sun rise almost afraid because the seas so lonely  who is afraidyou or the sun  the sun of course and there are noises under the sea and sounds overhead in a clear sky then you find your island alive with hot moist orchids that make mouths at you and can do everything except talk  theres a waterfall in it three hundred feet high just like a sliver of green jade laced with silver and millions of wild bees live up in the rocks and you can hear the fat cocoanuts falling from the palms and you order an ivorywhite servant to sling you a long yellow hammock with tassels on it like ripe maize and you put up your feet and hear the bees hum and the water fall till you go to sleep  can one work there  certainly one must do something always you hang your canvas up in a palm tree and let the parrots criticise when the scuffle you heave a ripe custardapple at them and it bursts in a lather of cream there are hundreds of places come and see them  i dont quite like that place it sounds lazy tell me another  what do you think of a big red dead city built of red sandstone with raw green aloes growing between the stones lying out neglected on honeycoloured sands there are forty dead kings there maisie each in a gorgeous tomb finer than all the others you look at the palaces and streets and shops and tanks and think that men must live there till you find a wee gray squirrel rubbing its nose all alone in the marketplace and a jewelled peacock struts out of a carved doorway and spreads its tail against a marble screen as fine pierced as pointlace then a monkeya little black monkeywalks through the main square to get a drink from a tank forty feet deep he slides down the creepers to the waters edge and a friend holds him by the tail in case he should fall in  is that all true  i have been there and seen then evening comes and the lights change till its just as though you stood in the heart of a kingopal a little before sundown as punctually as clockwork a big bristly wild boar with all his family following trots through the city gate churning the foam on his tusks you climb on the shoulder of a blind black stone god and watch that pig choose himself a palace for the night and stump in wagging his tail then the nightwind gets up and the sands move and you hear the desert outside the city singing now i lay me down to sleep and everything is dark till the moon rises maisie darling come with me and see what the world is really like its very lovely and its very horriblebut i wont let you see anything horridand it doesnt care your life or mine for pictures or anything else except doing its own work and making love come and ill show you how to brew sangaree and sling a hammock andoh thousands of things and youll see for yourself what colour means and well find out together what love means and then maybe we shall be allowed to do some good work come away  why said maisie  how can you do anything until you have seen everything or as much as you can and besides darling i love you come along with me you have no business here you dont belong to this place youre half a gipsyyour face tells that and ieven the smell of open water makes me restless come across the sea and be happy  he had risen to his feet and stood in the shadow of the gun looking down at the girl the very short winter afternoon had worn away and before they knew the winter moon was walking the untroubled sea long ruled lines of silver showed where a ripple of the rising tide was turning over the mudbanks the wind had dropped and in the intense stillness they could hear a donkey cropping the frosty grass many yards away a faint beating like that of a muffled drum came out of the moonhaze  whats that said maisie quickly it sounds like a heart beating  where is it  dick was so angry at this sudden wrench to his pleadings that he could not trust himself to speak and in this silence caught the sound maisie from her seat under the gun watched him with a certain amount of fear  she wished so much that he would be sensible and cease to worry her with oversea emotion that she both could and could not understand she was not prepared however for the change in his face as he listened  its a steamer he saida twinscrew steamer by the beat i cant make her out but she must be standing very close inshore ah as the red of a rocket streaked the haze shes standing in to signal before she clears the channel  is it a wreck said maisie to whom these words were as greek  dicks eyes were turned to the sea wreck what nonsense shes only reporting herself red rocket forwardtheres a green light aft now and two red rockets from the bridge  what does that mean  its the signal of the cross keys line running to australia i wonder which steamer it is the note of his voice had changed he seemed to be talking to himself and maisie did not approve of it the moonlight broke the haze for a moment touching the black sides of a long steamer working down channel four masts and three funnelsshes in deep draught too that must be the barralong or the bhutia no the bhutia has a clopper bow its the barralong to australia shell lift the southern cross in a weeklucky old tuboh lucky old tub  he stared intently and moved up the slope of the fort to get a better view but the mist on the sea thickened again and the beating of the screws grew fainter maisie called to him a little angrily and he returned still keeping his eyes to seaward have you ever seen the southern cross blazing right over your head he asked its superb  no she said shortly and i dont want to if you think its so lovely why dont you go and see it yourself  she raised her face from the soft blackness of the marten skins about her throat and her eyes shone like diamonds the moonlight on the gray kangaroo fur turned it to frosted silver of the coldest  by jove maisie you look like a little heathen idol tucked up there the eyes showed that they did not appreciate the compliment im sorry he continued the southern cross isnt worth looking at unless someone helps you to see that steamers out of hearing  dick she said quietly suppose i were to come to you nowbe quiet a minutejust as i am and caring for you just as much as i do  not as a brother though you said you didntin the park  i never had a brother suppose i said take me to those places and in time perhaps i might really care for you what would you do  send you straight back to where you came from in a cab no i wouldnt id let you walk but you couldnt do it dear and i wouldnt run the risk youre worth waiting for till you can come without reservation  do you honestly believe that  i have a hazy sort of idea that i do has it never struck you in that light  yees i feel so wicked about it  wickeder than usual  you dont know all i think its almost too awful to tell  never mind you promised to tell me the truthat least  its so ungrateful of me butbut though i know you care for me and i like to have you with me idid even sacrifice you if that would bring me what i want  my poor little darling i know that state of mind it doesnt lead to good work  you arent angry remember i do despise myself  im not exactly flatteredi had guessed as much beforebut im not angry im sorry for you surely you ought to have left a littleness like that behind you years ago  youve no right to patronise me i only want what i have worked for so long it came to you without any trouble andand i dont think its fair  what can i do id give ten years of my life to get you what you want  but i cant help you even i cant help  a murmur of dissent from maisie he went onand i know by what you have just said that youre on the wrong road to success it isnt got at by sacrificing other peopleive had that much knocked into me you must sacrifice yourself and live under orders and never think for yourself and never have real satisfaction in your work except just at the beginning when youre reaching out after a notion  how can you believe all that  theres no question of belief or disbelief thats the law and you take it or refuse it as you please i try to obey but i cant and then my work turns bad on my hands under any circumstances remember fourfifths of everybodys work must be bad but the remnant is worth the trouble for its own sake  isnt it nice to get credit even for bad work  its much too nice but may i tell you something it isnt a pretty tale but youre so like a man that i forget when im talking to you  tell me  once when i was out in the soudan i went over some ground that we had been fighting on for three days there were twelve hundred dead and we hadnt time to bury them  how ghastly  i had been at work on a big doublesheet sketch and i was wondering what people would think of it at home the sight of that field taught me a good deal it looked just like a bed of horrible toadstools in all colours andid never seen men in bulk go back to their beginnings before so i began to understand that men and women were only material to work with and that what they said or did was of no consequence see strictly speaking you might just as well put your ear down to the palette to catch what your colours are saying  dick thats disgraceful  wait a minute i said strictly speaking unfortunately everybody must be either a man or a woman  im glad you allow that much  in your case i dont you arent a woman but ordinary people maisie must behave and work as such thats what makes me so savage he hurled a pebble towards the sea as he spoke i know that it is outside my business to care what people say i can see that it spoils my output if i listen to em and yet confound it allanother pebble flew seawardi cant help purring when im rubbed the right way even when i can see on a mans forehead that he is lying his way through a clump of pretty speeches those lies make me happy and play the mischief with my hand  and when he doesnt say pretty things  then belovedestdick grinnedi forget that i am the steward of these gifts and i want to make that man love and appreciate my work with a thick stick its too humiliating altogether but i suppose even if one were an angel and painted humans altogether from outside one would lose in touch what one gained in grip  maisie laughed at the idea of dick as an angel  but you seem to think she said that everything nice spoils your hand  i dont think its the lawjust the same as it was at mrs jennetts  everything that is nice does spoil your hand im glad you see so clearly  i dont like the view  nor i buthave got orders what can do are you strong enough to face it alone  i suppose i must  let me help darling we can hold each other very tight and try to walk straight we shall blunder horribly but it will be better than stumbling apart maisie cant you see reason  i dont think we should get on together we should be two of a trade so we should never agree  how i should like to meet the man who made that proverb he lived in a cave and ate raw bear i fancy id make him chew his own arrowheads  well  i should be only half married to you i should worry and fuss about my work as i do now four days out of the seven im not fit to speak to  you talk as if no one else in the world had ever used a brush dyou suppose that i dont know the feeling of worry and bother and cantgetatness youre lucky if you only have it four days out of the seven what difference would that make  a great dealif you had it too  yes but i could respect it another man might not he might laugh at you but theres no use talking about it if you can think in that way you cant care for meyet  the tide had nearly covered the mudbanks and twenty little ripples broke on the beach before maisie chose to speak  dick she said slowly i believe very much that you are better than i am  this doesnt seem to bear on the argumentbut in what way  i dont quite know but in what you said about work and things and then youre so patient yes youre better than i am  dick considered rapidly the murkiness of an average mans life there was nothing in the review to fill him with a sense of virtue he lifted the hem of the cloak to his lips  why said maisie making as though she had not noticed can you see things that i cant i dont believe what you believe but youre right i believe  if ive seen anything god knows i couldnt have seen it but for you and i know that i couldnt have said it except to you you seemed to make everything clear for a minute but i dont practice what i preach you would help me there are only us two in the world for all purposes andand you like to have me with you  of course i do i wonder if you can realise how utterly lonely i am  darling i think i can  two years ago when i first took the little house i used to walk up and down the backgarden trying to cry i never can cry can you  its some time since i tried what was the trouble overwork  i dont know but i used to dream that i had broken down and had no money and was starving in london i thought about it all day and it frightened meoh how it frightened me  i know that fear its the most terrible of all it wakes me up in the night sometimes you oughtnt to know anything about it  how do you know  never mind is your three hundred a year safe  its in consols  very well if any one comes to you and recommends a better investmenteven if i should come to youdont you listen never shift the money for a minute and never lend a penny of iteven to the redhaired girl  dont scold me so im not likely to be foolish  the earth is full of men whod sell their souls for three hundred a year and women come and talk and borrow a fivepound note here and a tenpound note there and a woman has no conscience in a money debt  stick to your money maisie for theres nothing more ghastly in the world than poverty in london its scared me by jove it put the fear into me and one oughtnt to be afraid of anything  to each man is appointed his particular dreadthe terror that if he does not fight against it must cow him even to the loss of his manhood dicks experience of the sordid misery of want had entered into the deeps of him and lest he might find virtue too easy that memory stood behind him tempting to shame when dealers came to buy his wares as the nilghai quaked against his will at the still green water of a lake or a milldam as torpenhow flinched before any white arm that could cut or stab and loathed himself for flinching dick feared the poverty he had once tasted half in jest his burden was heavier than the burdens of his companions  maisie watched the face working in the moonlight  youve plenty of pennies now she said soothingly  i shall never have enough he began with vicious emphasis then laughing i shall always be threepence short in my accounts  why threepence  i carried a mans bag once from liverpool street station to blackfriars bridge it was a sixpenny jobyou neednt laugh indeed it wasand i wanted the money desperately he only gave me threepence and he hadnt even the decency to pay in silver whatever money i make i shall never get that odd threepence out of the world  this was not language befitting the man who had preached of the sanctity of work it jarred on maisie who preferred her payment in applause which since all men desire it must be of he right she hunted for her little purse and gravely took out a threepenny bit  there it is she said ill pay you dickie and dont worry any more it isnt worth while are you paid  i am said the very human apostle of fair craft taking the coin im paid a thousand times and well close that account it shall live on my watchchain and youre an angel maisie  im very cramped and im feeling a little cold good gracious the cloak is all white and so is your moustache i never knew it was so chilly  a light frost lay white on the shoulder of dicks ulster he too had forgotten the state of the weather they laughed together and with that laugh ended all serious discourse  they ran inland across the waste to warm themselves then turned to look at the glory of the full tide under the moonlight and the intense black shadows of the furze bushes it was an additional joy to dick that maisie could see colour even as he saw itcould see the blue in the white of the mist the violet that is in gray palings and all things else as they arenot of one hue but a thousand and the moonlight came into maisies soul so that she usually reserved chattered of herself and of the things she took interest inof kami wisest of teachers and of the girls in the studioof the poles who will kill themselves with overwork if they are not checked of the french who talk at great length of much more than they will ever accomplish of the slovenly english who toil hopelessly and cannot understand that inclination does not imply power of the americans whose rasping voices in the hush of a hot afternoon strain tensedrawn nerves to breakingpoint and whose suppers lead to indigestion of tempestuous russians neither to hold nor to bind who tell the girls ghoststories till the girls shriek of stolid germans who come to learn one thing and having mastered that much stolidly go away and copy pictures for evermore dick listened enraptured because it was maisie who spoke he knew the old life  it hasnt changed much he said do they still steal colours at lunchtime  not steal attract is the word of course they do im goodi only attract ultramarine but there are students whod attract flakewhite  ive done it myself you cant help it when the palettes are hung up  every colour is common property once it runs downeven though you do start it with a drop of oil it teaches people not to waste their tubes  i should like to attract some of your colours dick perhaps i might catch your success with them  i mustnt say a bad word but i should like to what in the world which youve just missed a lovely chance of seeing does success or want of success or a threestoried success matter compared with no i wont open that question again its time to go back to town  im sorry dick but  youre much more interested in that than you are in me  i dont know i dont think i am  what will you give me if i tell you a sure shortcut to everything you wantthe trouble and the fuss and the tangle and all the rest will you promise to obey me  of course  in the first place you must never forget a meal because you happen to be at work you forgot your lunch twice last week said dick at a venture for he knew with whom he was dealing  no noonly once really  thats bad enough and you mustnt take a cup of tea and a biscuit in place of a regular dinner because dinner happens to be a trouble  youre making fun of me  i never was more in earnest in my life oh my love my love hasnt it dawned on you yet what you are to me heres the whole earth in a conspiracy to give you a chill or run over you or drench you to the skin or cheat you out of your money or let you die of overwork and underfeeding and i havent the mere right to look after you why i dont even know if you have sense enough to put on warm things when the weathers cold  dick youre the most awful boy to talk toreally how do you suppose i managed when you were away  i wasnt here and i didnt know but now im back id give everything i have for the right of telling you to come in out of the rain  your success too  this time it cost dick a severe struggle to refrain from bad words  as mrs jennett used to say youre a trial maisie youve been cooped up in the schools too long and you think every one is looking at you  there arent twelve hundred people in the world who understand pictures the others pretend and dont care remember ive seen twelve hundred men dead in toadstoolbeds its only the voice of the tiniest little fraction of people that makes success the real world doesnt care a tinkersdoesnt care a bit for aught you or i know every man in the world may be arguing with a maisie of his own  poor maisie  poor dick i think do you believe while hes fighting for whats dearer than his life he wants to look at a picture and even if he did and if all the world did and a thousand million people rose up and shouted hymns to my honour and glory would that make up to me for the knowledge that you were out shopping in the edgware road on a rainy day without an umbrella now well go to the station  but you said on the beach persisted maisie with a certain fear  dick groaned aloud yes i know what i said my work is everything i have or am or hope to be to me and i believe ive learnt the law that governs it but ive some lingering sense of fun leftthough youve nearly knocked it out of me i can just see that it isnt everything to all the world do what i say and not what i do  maisie was careful not to reopen debatable matters and they returned to london joyously the terminus stopped dick in the midst of an eloquent harangue on the beauties of exercise he would buy maisie a horsesuch a horse as never yet bowed head to bitwould stable it with a companion some twenty miles from london and maisie solely for her healths sake should ride with him twice or thrice a week  thats absurd said she it wouldnt be proper  now who in all london tonight would have sufficient interest or audacity to call us two to account for anything we chose to do  maisie looked at the lamps the fog and the hideous turmoil dick was right but horseflesh did not make for art as she understood it  youre very nice sometimes but youre very foolish more times im not going to let you give me horses or take you out of your way tonight ill go home by myself only i want you to promise me something you wont think any more about that extra threepence will you remember youve been paid and i wont allow you to be spiteful and do bad work for a little thing like that you can be so big that you mustnt be tiny  this was turning the tables with a vengeance there remained only to put maisie into her hansom  goodbye she said simply youll come on sunday it has been a beautiful day dick why cant it be like this always  because loves like linework you must go forward or backward you cant stand still by the way go on with your linework goodnight and for myfor my sake take care of yourself  he turned to walk home meditating the day had brought him nothing that he hoped for butsurely this was worth many daysit had brought him nearer to maisie the end was only a question of time now and the prize well worth the waiting by instinct once more he turned to the river  and she understood at once he said looking at the water she found out my pet besetting sin on the spot and paid it off my god how she understood and she said i was better than she was better than she was he laughed at the absurdity of the notion i wonder if girls guess at onehalf a mans life they cant orthey wouldnt marry us he took her gift out of his pocket and considered it in the light of a miracle and a pledge of the comprehension that one day would lead to perfect happiness meantime maisie was alone in london with none to save her from danger and the packed wilderness was very full of danger  dick made his prayer to fate disjointedly after the manner of the heathen as he threw the piece of silver into the river if any evil were to befal let him bear the burden and let maisie go unscathed since the threepenny piece was dearest to him of all his possessions it was a small coin in itself but maisie had given it and the thames held it and surely the fates would be bribed for this once  the drowning of the coin seemed to cut him free from thought of maisie for the moment he took himself off the bridge and went whistling to his chambers with a strong yearning for some mantalk and tobacco after his first experience of an entire day spent in the society of a woman there was a stronger desire at his heart when there rose before him an unsolicited vision of the barralong dipping deep and sailing free for the southern cross    chapter viii       and these two as i have told you      were the friends of hiawatha      chibiabos the musician      and the very strong man kwasind       hiawatha  torpenhow was paging the last sheets of some manuscript while the nilghai who had come for chess and remained to talk tactics was reading through the first part commenting scornfully the while  its picturesque enough and its sketchy said he but as a serious consideration of affairs in eastern europe its not worth much  its off my hands at any rate thirtyseven thirtyeight thirtynine slips altogether arent there that should make between eleven and twelve pages of valuable misinformation heigho torpenhow shuffled the writing together and hummed       young lambs to sell young lambs to sell      if id as much money as i could tell      i never would cry young lambs to sell  dick entered selfconscious and a little defiant but in the best of tempers with all the world  back at last said torpenhow  more or less what have you been doing  work dickie you behave as though the bank of england were behind you heres sunday monday and tuesday gone and you havent done a line its scandalous  the notions come and go my childrenthey come and go like our baccy he answered filling his pipe moreover he stooped to thrust a spill into the grate apollo does not always stretch his oh confound your clumsy jests nilghai  this is not the place to preach the theory of direct inspiration said the nilghai returning torpenhows large and workmanlike bellows to their nail on the wall we believe in cobblers wax lawhere you sit down  if you werent so big and fat said dick looking round for a weapon id  no skylarking in my rooms you two smashed half my furniture last time you threw the cushions about you might have the decency to say how dyou do to binkie look at him  binkie had jumped down from the sofa and was fawning round dicks knee and scratching at his boots  dear man said dick snatching him up and kissing him on the black patch above his right eye did ums was binks did that ugly nilghai turn you off the sofa bite him mr binkie he pitched him on the nilghais stomach as the big man lay at ease and binkie pretended to destroy the nilghai inch by inch till a sofa cushion extinguished him and panting he stuck out his tongue at the company  the binkieboy went for a walk this morning before you were up torp  i saw him making love to the butcher at the corner when the shutters were being taken downjust as if he hadnt enough to eat in his own proper house said dick  binks is that a true bill said torpenhow severely the little dog retreated under the sofa cushion and showed by the fat white back of him that he really had no further interest in the discussion  strikes me that another disreputable dog went for a walk too said the nilghai what made you get up so early torp said you might be buying a horse  he knows it would need three of us for a serious business like that no i felt lonesome and unhappy so i went out to look at the sea and watch the pretty ships go by  where did you go  somewhere on the channel progly or snigly or some wateringplace was its name ive forgotten but it was only two hours run from london and the ships went by  did you see anything you knew  only the barralong outwards to australia and an odessa grainboat loaded down by the head it was a thick day but the sea smelt good  wherefore put on ones best trousers to see the barralong said torpenhow pointing  because ive nothing except these things and my painting duds besides i wanted to do honour to the sea  did she make you feel restless asked the nilghai keenly  crazy dont speak of it im sorry i went  torpenhow and the nilghai exchanged a look as dick stooping busied himself among the formers boots and trees  these will do he said at last i cant say i think much of your taste in slippers but the fits the thing he slipped his feet into a pair of socklike sambhurskin foot coverings found a long chair and lay at length  theyre my own pet pair torpenhow said i was just going to put them on myself  all your reprehensible selfishness just because you see me happy for a minute you want to worry me and stir me up find another pair  good for you that dick cant wear your clothes torp you two live communistically said the nilghai  dick never has anything that i can wear hes only useful to sponge upon  confound you have you been rummaging round among my clothes then said dick i put a sovereign in the tobaccojar yesterday how do you expect a man to keep his accounts properly if you  here the nilghai began to laugh and torpenhow joined him  hid a sovereign yesterday youre no sort of financier you lent me a fiver about a month back do you remember torpenhow said  yes of course  do you remember that i paid it you ten days later and you put it at the bottom of the tobacco  by jove did i i thought it was in one of my colourboxes  you thought about a week ago i went into your studio to get some baccy and found it  what did you do with it  took the nilghai to a theatre and fed him  you couldnt feed the nilghai under twice the moneynot though you gave him army beef well i suppose i should have found it out sooner or later what is there to laugh at  youre a most amazing cuckoo in many directions said the nilghai still chuckling over the thought of the dinner never mind we had both been working very hard and it was your unearned increment we spent and as youre only a loafer it didnt matter  thats pleasantfrom the man who is bursting with my meat too ill get that dinner back one of these days suppose we go to a theatre now  put our boots onand dressand wash the nilghai spoke very lazily  i withdraw the motion  suppose just for a changeas a startling variety you knowwe that is to say we get our charcoal and our canvas and go on with our work  torpenhow spoke pointedly but dick only wriggled his toes inside the soft leather moccasins  what a oneideaed clucker that is if i had any unfinished figures on hand i havent any model if i had my model i havent any spray and i never leave charcoal unfixed overnight and if i had my spray and twenty photographs of backgrounds i couldnt do anything tonight i dont feel that way  binkiedog hes a lazy hog isnt he said the nilghai  very good i will do some work said dick rising swiftly ill fetch the nungapunga book and well add another picture to the nilghai saga  arent you worrying him a little too much asked the nilghai when dick had left the room  perhaps but i know what he can turn out if he likes it makes me savage to hear him praised for past work when i know what he ought to do you and i are arranged for  by kismet and our own powers mores the pity i have dreamed of a good deal  so have i but we know our limitations now im dashed if i know what dicks may be when he gives himself to his work thats what makes me so keen about him  and when alls said and done you will be put asidequite rightlyfor a female girl  i wonder where do you think he has been today  to the sea didnt you see the look in his eyes when he talked about her hes as restless as a swallow in autumn  yes but did he go alone  i dont know and i dont care but he has the beginnings of the gofever upon him he wants to upstakes and move out theres no mistaking the signs whatever he may have said before he has the call upon him now  it might be his salvation torpenhow said  perhapsif you care to take the responsibility of being a saviour  dick returned with the big clasped sketchbook that the nilghai knew well and did not love too much in it dick had drawn all manner of moving incidents experienced by himself or related to him by the others of all the four corners of the earth but the wider range of the nilghais body and life attracted him most when truth failed he fell back on fiction of the wildest and represented incidents in the nilghais career that were unseemlyhis marriages with many african princesses his shameless betrayal for arab wives of an army corps to the mahdi his tattooment by skilled operators in burmah his interview and his fears with the yellow headsman in the bloodstained executionground of canton and finally the passings of his spirit into the bodies of whales elephants and toucans torpenhow from time to time had added rhymed descriptions and the whole was a curious piece of art because dick decided having regard to the name of the book which being interpreted means naked that it would be wrong to draw the nilghai with any clothes on under any circumstances consequently the last sketch representing that muchenduring man calling on the war office to press his claims to the egyptian medal was hardly delicate he settled himself comfortably on torpenhows table and turned over the pages  what a fortune you would have been to blake nilghai he said theres a succulent pinkness about some of these sketches thats more than lifelike the nilghai surrounded while bathing by the mahdiehthat was founded on fact eh  it was very nearly my last bath you irreverent dauber has binkie come into the saga yet  no the binkieboy hasnt done anything except eat and kill cats lets see here you are as a stainedglass saint in a church deuced decorative lines about your anatomy you ought to be grateful for being handed down to posterity in this way fifty years hence youll exist in rare and curious facsimiles at ten guineas each what shall i try this time the domestic life of the nilghai  hasnt got any  the undomestic life of the nilghai then of course massmeeting of his wives in trafalgar square thats it they came from the ends of the earth to attend nilghais wedding to an english bride this shall be an epic its a sweet material to work with  its a scandalous waste of time said torpenhow  dont worry it keeps ones hand inspecially when you begin without the pencil he set to work rapidly thats nelsons column presently the nilghai will appear shinning up it  give him some clothes this time  certainlya veil and an orangewreath because hes been married  gad thats clever enough said torpenhow over his shoulder as dick brought out of the paper with three twirls of the brush a very fat back and labouring shoulder pressed against stone  just imagine dick continued if we could publish a few of these dear little things every time the nilghai subsidises a man who can write to give the public an honest opinion of my pictures  well youll admit i always tell you when i have done anything of that kind i know i cant hammer you as you ought to be hammered so i give the job to another young maclagan for instance  nooone halfminute old man stick your hand out against the dark of the wallpaperyou only burble and call me names that left shoulders out of drawing i must literally throw a veil over that wheres my penknife well what about maclagan  i only gave him his ridingorders toto lambast you on general principles for not producing work that will last  whereupon that young fooldick threw back his head and shut one eye as he shifted the page under his handbeing left alone with an inkpot and what he conceived were his own notions went and spilt them both over me in the papers you might have engaged a grown man for the business nilghai how do you think the bridal veil looks now torp  how the deuce do three dabs and two scratches make the stuff stand away from the body as it does said torpenhow to whom dicks methods were always new  it just depends on where you put em if maclagan had know that much about his business he might have done better  why dont you put the damned dabs into something that will stay then insisted the nilghai who had really taken considerable trouble in hiring for dicks benefit the pen of a young gentleman who devoted most of his waking hours to an anxious consideration of the aims and ends of art which he wrote was one and indivisible  wait a minute till i see how i am going to manage my procession of wives you seem to have married extensively and i must rough em in with the pencilmedes parthians edomites now setting aside the weakness and the wickedness andand the fatheadedness of deliberately trying to do work that will live as they call it im content with the knowledge that ive done my best up to date and i shant do anything like it again for some hours at leastprobably years most probably never  what any stuff you have in stock your best work said torpenhow  anything youve sold said the nilghai  oh no it isnt here and it isnt sold better than that it cant be sold and i dont think any one knows where it is im sure i dont and yet more and more wives on the north side of the square observe the virtuous horror of the lions  you may as well explain said torpenhow and dick lifted his head from the paper  the sea reminded me of it he said slowly i wish it hadnt it weighs some few thousand tonsunless you cut it out with a cold chisel  dont be an idiot you cant pose with us here said the nilghai  theres no pose in the matter at all its a fact i was loafing from lima to auckland in a big old condemned passengership turned into a cargoboat and owned by a secondhad italian firm she was a crazy basket we were cut down to fifteen ton of coal a day and we thought ourselves lucky when we kicked seven knots an hour out of her then we used to stop and let the bearings cool down and wonder whether the crack in the shaft was spreading  were you a steward or a stoker in those days  i was flush for the time being so i was a passenger or else i should have been a steward i think said dick with perfect gravity returning to the procession of angry wives i was the only other passenger from lima and the ship was half empty and full of rats and cockroaches and scorpions  but what has this to do with the picture  wait a minute she had been in the china passenger trade and her lower decks had bunks for two thousand pigtails those were all taken down and she was empty up to her nose and the lights came through the port holesmost annoying lights to work in till you got used to them i hadnt anything to do for weeks the ships charts were in pieces and our skipper darent run south for fear of catching a storm so he did his best to knock all the society islands out of the water one by one and i went into the lower deck and did my picture on the port side as far forward in her as i could go there was some brown paint and some green paint that they used for the boats and some black paint for ironwork and that was all i had  the passengers must have thought you mad  there was only one and it was a woman but it gave me the notion of my picture  what was she like said torpenhow  she was a sort of negroidjewesscuban with morals to match she couldnt read or write and she didnt want to but she used to come down and watch me paint and the skipper didnt like it because he was paying her passage and had to be on the bridge occasionally  i see that must have been cheerful  it was the best time i ever had to begin with we didnt know whether we should go up or go down any minute when there was a sea on and when it was calm it was paradise and the woman used to mix the paints and talk broken english and the skipper used to steal down every few minutes to the lower deck because he said he was afraid of fire so you see we could never tell when we might be caught and i had a splendid notion to work out in only three keys of colour  what was the notion  two lines in poe  neither the angles in heaven above nor the demons down under the sea can ever dissever my soul from the soul of the beautiful annabel lee  it came out of the seaall by itself i drew that fight fought out in green water over the naked choking soul and the woman served as the model for the devils and the angels bothseadevils and seaangels and the soul half drowned between them it doesnt sound much but when there was a good light on the lower deck it looked very fine and creepy it was seven by fourteen feet all done in shifting light for shifting light  did the woman inspire you much said torpenhow  she and the sea between themimmensely there was a heap of bad drawing in that picture i remember i went out of my way to foreshorten for sheer delight of doing it and i foreshortened damnably but for all that its the best thing ive ever done and now i suppose the ships broken up or gone down whew what a time that was  what happened after all  it all ended they were loading her with wool when i left the ship but even the stevedores kept the picture clear to the last the eyes of the demons scared them i honestly believe  and the woman  she was scared too when it was finished she used to cross herself before she went down to look at it just three colours and no chance of getting any more and the sea outside and unlimited lovemaking inside and the fear of death atop of everything else o lord he had ceased to look at the sketch but was staring straight in front of him across the room  why dont you try something of the same kind now said the nilghai  because those things come not by fasting and prayer when i find a cargoboat and a jewesscuban and another notion and the same old life i may  you wont find them here said the nilghai  no i shall not dick shut the sketchbook with a bang this rooms as hot as an oven open the window some one  he leaned into the darkness watching the greater darkness of london below him the chambers stood much higher than the other houses commanding a hundred chimneyscrooked cowls that looked like sitting cats as they swung round and other uncouth brick and zinc mysteries supported by iron stanchions and clamped by 8pieces northward the lights of piccadilly circus and leicester square threw a coppercoloured glare above the black roofs and southward by all the orderly lights of the thames a train rolled out across one of the railway bridges and its thunder drowned for a minute the dull roar of the streets the nilghai looked at his watch and said shortly thats the paris nightmail you can book from here to st petersburg if you choose  dick crammed head and shoulders out of the window and looked across the river torpenhow came to his side while the nilghai passed over quietly to the piano and opened it binkie making himself as large as possible spread out upon the sofa with the air of one who is not to be lightly disturbed  well said the nilghai to the two pairs of shoulders have you never seen this place before  a steamtug on the river hooted as she towed her barges to wharf then the boom of the traffic came into the room torpenhow nudged dick  good place to bank inbad place to bunk in dickie isnt it  dicks chin was in his hand as he answered in the words of a general not without fame still looking out on the darknessmy god what a city to loot  binkie found the night air tickling his whiskers and sneezed plaintively  we shall give the binkiedog a cold said torpenhow come in and they withdrew their heads youll be buried in kensal green dick one of these days if it isnt closed by the time you want to go thereburied within two feet of some one else his wife and his family  allah forbid i shall get away before that time comes give a man room to stretch his legs mr binkie dick flung himself down on the sofa and tweaked binkies velvet ears yawning heavily the while  youll find that wardrobecase very much out of tune torpenhow said to the nilghai its never touched except by you  a piece of gross extravagance dick grunted the nilghai only comes when im out  thats because youre always out howl nilghai and let him hear  the life of the nilghai is fraud and slaughter his writings are watered dickens and water but the voice of the nilghai raised on high makes even the mahdieh glad to die  dick quoted from torpenhows letterpress in the nungapunga book  how do they call moose in canada nilghai  the man laughed singing was his one polite accomplishment as many presstents in faroff lands had known  what shall i sing said he turning in the chair  moll roe in the morning said torpenhow at a venture  no said dick sharply and the nilghai opened his eyes the old chanty whereof he among a very few possessed all the words was not a pretty one but dick had heard it many times before without wincing without prelude he launched into that stately tune that calls together and troubles the hearts of the gipsies of the sea  farewell and adieu to you spanish ladies farewell and adieu to you ladies of spain  dick turned uneasily on the sofa for he could hear the bows of the barralong crashing into the green seas on her way to the southern cross  then came the chorus  well rant and well roar like true british sailors well rant and well roar across the salt seas until we take soundings in the channel of old england from ushant to scilly tis fortyfive leagues  thirtyfivethirtyfive said dick petulantly dont tamper with holy writ go on nilghai  the first land we made it was called the deadman and they sang to the end very vigourously  that would be a better song if her head were turned the other wayto the ushant light for instance said the nilghai  flinging his arms about like a mad windmill said torpenhow give us something else nilghai youre in fine foghorn form tonight  give us the ganges pilot you sang that in the square the night before elmaghrib by the way i wonder how many of the chorus are alive tonight said dick  torpenhow considered for a minute by jove i believe only you and i  raynor vicery and deenesall dead vincent caught smallpox in cairo carried it here and died of it yes only you and i and the nilghai  umph and yet the men here whove done their work in a wellwarmed studio all their lives with a policeman at each corner say that i charge too much for my pictures  they are buying your work not your insurance policies dear child said the nilghai  i gambled with one to get at the other dont preach go on with the pilot where in the world did you get that song  on a tombstone said the nilghai on a tombstone in a distant land i made it an accompaniment with heaps of base chords  oh vanity begin and the nilghai began  i have slipped my cable messmates im drifting down with the tide i have my sailing orders while yet an anchor ride  and never on fair june morning have i put out to sea with clearer conscience or better hope or a heart more light and free  shoulder to shoulder joe my boy into the crowd like a wedge strike with the hangers messmates but do not cut with the edge  cries charnock scatter the faggots double that brahmin in two the tall pale widow for me joe the little brown girl for you  young joe youre nearing sixty why is your hide so dark katie has soft fair blue eyes who blackened yourswhy hark  they were all singing now dick with the roar of the wind of the open sea about his ears as the deep bass voice let itself go       the morning gun      ho steady the arquebuses to me      i ha sounded the dutch high admirals heart      as my lead doth sound the sea  sounding sounding the ganges floating down with the tide moore me close to charnock next to my nutbrown bride  my blessing to kate at fairlightholwell my thanks to you steady we steer for heaven through sanddrifts cold and blue  now what is there in that nonsense to make a man restless said dick hauling binkie from his feet to his chest  it depends on the man said torpenhow  the man who has been down to look at the sea said the nilghai  i didnt know she was going to upset me in this fashion  thats what men say when they go to say goodbye to a woman its more easy though to get rid of three women than a piece of ones life and surroundings  but a woman can be began dick unguardedly  a piece of ones life continued torpenhow no she cant his face darkened for a moment she says she wants to sympathise with you and help you in your work and everything else that clearly a man must do for himself then she sends round five notes a day to ask why the dickens you havent been wasting your time with her  dont generalise said the nilghai by the time you arrive at five notes a day you must have gone through a good deal and behaved accordingly  shouldnt begin these things my son  i shouldnt have gone down to the sea said dick just a little anxious to change the conversation and you shouldnt have sung  the sea isnt sending you five notes a day said the nilghai  no but im fatally compromised shes an enduring old hag and im sorry i ever met her why wasnt i born and bred and dead in a threepair back  hear him blaspheming his first love why in the world shouldnt you listen to her said torpenhow  before dick could reply the nilghai lifted up his voice with a shout that shook the windows in the men of the sea that begins as all know the sea is a wicked old woman and after rading through eight lines whose imagery is truthful ends in a refrain slow as the clacking of a capstan when the boat comes unwillingly up to the bars where the men sweat and tramp in the shingle       ye that bore us o restore us      she is kinder than ye      for the call is on our heartstrings      said the men of the sea  the nilghai sang that verse twice with simple cunning intending that dick should hear but dick was waiting for the farewell of the men to their wives       ye that love us can ye move us      she is dearer than ye      and your sleep will be the sweeter      said the men of the sea  the rough words beat like the blows of the waves on the bows of the rickety boat from lima in the days when dick was mixing paints making love drawing devils and angels in the half dark and wondering whether the next minute would put the italian captains knife between his shoulderblades and the gofever which is more real than many doctors diseases waked and raged urging him who loved maisie beyond anything in the world to go away and taste the old hot unregenerate life againto scuffle swear gamble and love light loves with his fellows to take ship and know the sea once more and by her beget pictures to talk to binat among the sands of port said while yellow tina mixed the drinks to hear the crackle of musketry and see the smoke roll outward thin and thicken again till the shining black faces came through and in that hell every man was strictly responsible for his own head and his own alone and struck with an unfettered arm it was impossible utterly impossible but       oh our fathers in the churchyard      she is older than ye      and our graves will be the greener      said the men of the sea  what is there to hinder said torpenhow in the long hush that followed the song  you said a little time since that you wouldnt come for a walk round the world torp  that was months ago and i only objected to your making money for travelling expenses youve shot your bolt here and it has gone home go away and do some work and see some things  get some of the fat off you youre disgracefully out of condition said the nilghai making a plunge from the chair and grasping a handful of dick generally over the right ribs soft as puttypure tallow born of overfeeding train it off dickie  were all equally gross nilghai next time you have to take the field youll sit down wink your eyes gasp and die in a fit  never mind you go away on a ship go to lima again or to brazil  theres always trouble in south america  do you suppose i want to be told where to go great heavens the only difficulty is to know where im to stop but i shall stay here as i told you before  then youll be buried in kensal green and turn into adipocere with the others said torpenhow are you thinking of commissions in hand pay forfeit and go youve money enough to travel as a king if you please  youve the grisliest notions of amusement torp i think i see myself shipping first class on a sixthousandton hotel and asking the third engineer what makes the engines go round and whether it isnt very warm in the stokehold ho ho i should ship as a loafer if ever i shipped at all which im not going to do i shall compromise and go for a small trip to begin with  thats something at any rate where will you go said torpenhow it would do you all the good in the world old man  the nilghai saw the twinkle in dicks eye and refrained from speech  i shall go in the first place to rathrays stable where i shall hire one horse and take him very carefully as far as richmond hill then i shall walk him back again in case he should accidentally burst into a lather and make rathray angry i shall do that tomorrow for the sake of air and exercise  bah dick had barely time to throw up his arm and ward off the cushion that the disgusted torpenhow heaved at his head  air and exercise indeed said the nilghai sitting down heavily on dick  lets give him a little of both get the bellows torp  at this point the conference broke up in disorder because dick would not open his mouth till the nilghai held his nose fast and there was some trouble in forcing the nozzle of the bellows between his teeth and even when it was there he weakly tried to puff against the force of the blast and his cheeks blew up with a great explosion and the enemy becoming helpless with laughter he so beat them over the head with a soft sofa cushion that that became unsewn and distributed its feathers and binkie interfering in torpenhows interests was bundled into the halfempty bag and advised to scratch his way out which he did after a while travelling rapidly up and down the floor in the shape of an agitated green haggis and when he came out looking for satisfaction the three pillars of his world were picking feathers out of their hair  a prophet has no honour in his own country said dick ruefully dusting his knees this filthy fluff will never brush off my legs  it was all for your own good said the nilghai nothing like air and exercise  all for your good said torpenhow not in the least with reference to past clowning it would let you focus things at their proper worth and prevent your becoming slack in this hothouse of a town indeed it would old man i shouldnt have spoken if i hadnt thought so only you make a joke of everything  before god i do no such thing said dick quickly and earnestly you dont know me if you think that  i dont think it said the nilghai  how can fellows like ourselves who know what life and death really mean dare to make a joke of anything i know we pretend it to save ourselves from breaking down or going to the other extreme cant i see old man how youre always anxious about me and try to advise me to make my work better do you suppose i dont think about that myself but you cant help meyou cant help menot even you i must play my own hand alone in my own way  hear hear from the nilghai  whats the one thing in the nilghai saga that ive never drawn in the nungapunga book dick continued to torpenhow who was a little astonished at the outburst  now there was one blank page in the book given over to the sketch that dick had not drawn of the crowning exploit in the nilghais life when that man being young and forgetting that his body and bones belonged to the paper that employed him had ridden over sunburned slippery grass in the rear of bredows brigade on the day that the troopers flung themselves at cauroberts artillery and for aught they knew twenty battalions in front to save the battered 24th german infantry to give time to decide the fate of vionville and to learn ere their remnant came back to flavigay that cavalry can attack and crumple and break unshaken infantry whenever he was inclined to think over a life that might have been better an income that might have been larger and a soul that might have been considerably cleaner the nilghai would comfort himself with the thought i rode with bredows brigade at vionville and take heart for any lesser battle the next day might bring  i know he said very gravely i was always glad that you left it out  i left it out because nilghai taught me what the germany army learned then and what schmidt taught their cavalry i dont know german  what is it take care of the time and the dressing will take care of itself i must ride my own line to my own beat old man  tempe ist richtung youve learned your lesson well said the nilghai  he must go alone he speaks truth torp  maybe im as wrong as i can behideously wrong i must find that out for myself as i have to think things out for myself but i darent turn my head to dress by the next man it hurts me a great deal more than you know not to be able to go but i cannot thats all i must do my own work and live my own life in my own way because im responsible for both  only dont think i frivol about it torp i have my own matches and sulphur and ill make my own hell thanks  there was an uncomfortable pause then torpenhow said blandly what did the governor of north carolina say to the governor of south carolina  excellent notion it is a long time between drinks there are the makings of a very fine prig in you dick said the nilghai  ive liberated my mind estimable binkie with the feathers in his mouth dick picked up the still indignant one and shook him tenderly  youre tied up in a sack and made to run about blind binkiewee without any reason and it has hurt your little feelings never mind sic volo sic jubeo stet pro ratione voluntas and dont sneeze in my eye because i talk latin goodnight  he went out of the room  thats distinctly one for you said the nilghai i told you it was hopeless to meddle with him hes not pleased  hed swear at me if he werent i cant make it out he has the gofever upon him and he wont go i only hope that he maynt have to go some day when he doesnt want to said torpenhow        in his own room dick was settling a question with himselfand the question was whether all the world and all that was therein and a burning desire to exploit both was worth one threepenny piece thrown into the thames  it came of seeing the sea and im a cur to think about it he decided  after all the honeymoon will be that tourwith reservations only only i didnt realise that the sea was so strong i didnt feel it so much when i was with maisie these damnable songs did it hes beginning again  but it was only herricks nightpiece to julia that the nilghai sang and before it was ended dick reappeared on the threshold not altogether clothed indeed but in his right mind thirsty and at peace  the mood had come and gone with the rising and the falling of the tide by fort keeling    chapter ix       if i have taken the common clay      and wrought it cunningly      in the shape of a god that was digged a clod      the greater honour to me       if thou hast taken the common clay      and thy hands be not free      from the taint of the soil thou hast made thy spoil      the greater shame to theethe two potters  he did no work of any kind for the rest of the week then came another sunday he dreaded and longed for the day always but since the redhaired girl had sketched him there was rather more dread than desire in his mind  he found that maisie had entirely neglected his suggestions about linework she had gone off at score filed with some absurd notion for a fancy head it cost dick something to command his temper  whats the good of suggesting anything he said pointedly  ah but this will be a picturea real picture and i know that kami will let me send it to the salon you dont mind do you  i suppose not but you wont have time for the salon  maisie hesitated a little she even felt uncomfortable  were going over to france a month sooner because of it i shall get the idea sketched out here and work it up at kamis  dicks heart stood still and he came very near to being disgusted with his queen who could do no wrong just when i thought i had made some headway she goes off chasing butterflies its too maddening  there was no possibility of arguing for the redhaired girl was in the studio dick could only look unutterable reproach  im sorry he said and i think you make a mistake but whats the idea of your new picture  i took it from a book  thats bad to begin with books arent the places for pictures and  its this said the redhaired girl behind him i was reading it to maisie the other day from the city of dreadful night dyou know the book  a little i am sorry i spoke there are pictures in it what has taken her fancy  the description of the melancolia       her folded wings as of a mighty eagle      but all too impotent to lift the regal      robustness of her earthborn strength and pride  and here again maisie get the tea dear       the forehead charged with baleful thoughts and dreams      the household bunch of keys the housewifes gown      voluminous indented and yet rigid      as though a shell of burnished metal frigid      her feet thickshod to tread all weakness down  there was no attempt to conceal the scorn of the lazy voice dick winced  but that has been done already by an obscure artist by the name of durer said he how does the poem run  three centuries and threescore years ago with phantasies of his peculiar thought  you might as well try to rewrite hamlet it will be a waste of time  no it wont said maisie putting down the teacups with a clatter to reassure herself and i mean to do it cant you see what a beautiful thing it would make  how in perdition can one do work when one hasnt had the proper training any fool can get a notion it needs training to drive the thing throughtraining and conviction not rushing after the first fancy dick spoke between his teeth  you dont understand said maisie i think i can do it  again the voice of the girl behind him  baffled and beaten back she works on still weary and sick of soul she works the more       sustained by her indomitable will      the hands shall fashion and the brain shall pore      and all her sorrow shall be turned to labour  i fancy maisie means to embody herself in the picture  sitting on a throne of rejected pictures no i shant dear the notion in itself has fascinated meof course you dont care for fancy heads dick  i dont think you could do them you like blood and bones  thats a direct challenge if you can do a melancolia that isnt merely a sorrowful female head i can do a better one and i will too what dyou know about melacolias dick firmly believed that he was even then tasting threequarters of all the sorrow in the world  she was a woman said maisie and she suffered a great dealtill she could suffer no more then she began to laugh at it all and then i painted her and sent her to the salon  the redhaired girl rose up and left the room laughing  dick looked at maisie humbly and hopelessly  never mind about the picture he said are you really going back to kamis for a month before your time  i must if i want to get the picture done  and thats all you want  of course dont be stupid dick  you havent the power you have only the ideasthe ideas and the little cheap impulses how you could have kept at your work for ten years steadily is a mystery to me so you are really goinga month before you need  i must do my work  your workbah no i didnt mean that its all right dear of course you must do your work andi think ill say goodbye for this week  wont you even stay for tea no thank you have i your leave to go dear theres nothing more you particularly want me to do and the linework doesnt matter  i wish you could stay and then we could talk over my picture if only one single pictures a success it draws attention to all the others i know some of my work is good if only people could see and you neednt have been so rude about it  im sorry well talk the melancolia over some one of the other sundays  there are four moreyes one two three fourbefore you go goodbye maisie  maisie stood by the studio window thinking till the redhaired girl returned a little white at the corners of her lips  dicks gone off said maisie just when i wanted to talk about the picture isnt it selfish of him  her companion opened her lips as if to speak shut them again and went on reading the city of dreadful night  dick was in the park walking round and round a tree that he had chosen as his confidante for many sundays past he was swearing audibly and when he found that the infirmities of the english tongue hemmed in his rage he sought consolation in arabic which is expressly designed for the use of the afflicted he was not pleased with the reward of his patient service nor was he pleased with himself and it was long before he arrived at the proposition that the queen could do no wrong  its a losing game he said im worth nothing when a whim of hers is in question but in a losing game at port said we used to double the stakes and go on she do a melancolia she hasnt the power or the insight or the training only the desire shes cursed with the curse of reuben she wont do linework because it means real work and yet shes stronger than i am ill make her understand that i can beat her on her own melancolia even then she wouldnt care she says i can only do blood and bones i dont believe she has blood in her veins all the same i lover her and i must go on loving her and if i can humble her inordinate vanity i will ill do a melancolia that shall be something like a melancoliathe melancolia that transcends all wit ill do it at once conbless her  he discovered that the notion would not come to order and that he could not free his mind for an hour from the thought of maisies departure he took very small interest in her rough studies for the melancolia when she showed them next week the sundays were racing past and the time was at hand when all the church bells in london could not ring maisie back to him once or twice he said something to binkie about hermaphroditic futilities but the little dog received so many confidences both from torpenhow and dick that he did not trouble his tulipears to listen  dick was permitted to see the girls off they were going by the dover nightboat and they hoped to return in august it was then february and dick felt that he was being hardly used maisie was so busy stripping the small house across the park and packing her canvases that she had not time for thought dick went down to dover and wasted a day there fretting over a wonderful possibility would maisie at the very last allow him one small kiss he reflected that he might capture her by the strong arm as he had seem women captured in the southern soudan and lead her away but maisie would never be led she would turn her gray eyes upon him and say dick how selfish you are then his courage would fail him it would be better after all to beg for that kiss  maisie looked more than usually kissable as she stepped from the nightmail on to the windy pier in a gray waterproof and a little gray cloth travellingcap the redhaired girl was not so lovely her green eyes were hollow and her lips were dry dick saw the trunks aboard and went to maisies side in the darkness under the bridge the mailbags were thundering into the forehold and the redhaired girl was watching them  youll have a rough passage tonight said dick its blowing outside i suppose i may come over and see you if im good  you mustnt i shall be busy at least if i want you ill send for you but i shall write from vitrysurmarne i shall have heaps of things to consult you about oh dick you have been so good to meso good to me  thank you for that dear it hasnt made any difference has it  i cant tell a fib it hasntin that way but dont think im not grateful  damn the gratitude said dick huskily to the paddlebox  whats the use of worrying you know i should ruin your life and youd ruin mine as things are now you remember what you said when you were so angry that day in the park one of us has to be broken  cant you wait till that day comes  no love i want you unbrokenall to myself  maisie shook her head my poor dick what can i say  dont say anything give me a kiss only one kiss maisie ill swear i wont take any more you might as well and then i can be sure youre grateful  maisie put her cheek forward and dick took his reward in the darkness  it was only one kiss but since there was no timelimit specified it was a long one maisie wrenched herself free angrily and dick stood abashed and tingling from head to toe  goodbye darling i didnt mean to scare you im sorry onlykeep well and do good workspecially the melancolia im going to do one too remember me to kami and be careful what you drink country drinkingwater is bad everywhere but its worse in france write to me if you want anything and goodbye say goodbye to the whateveryoucallum girl andcant i have another kiss no youre quite right goodbye  a should told him that it was not seemly to charge of the mailbag incline he reached the pier as the steamer began to move off and he followed her with his heart  and theres nothingnothing in the wide worldto keep us apart except her obstinacy these calais nightboats are much too small ill get torp to write to the papers about it shes beginning to pitch already  maisie stood where dick had left her till she heard a little gasping cough at her elbow the redhaired girls eyes were alight with cold flame  he kissed you she said how could you let him when he wasnt anything to you how dared you to take a kiss from him oh maisie lets go to the ladies cabin im sickdeadly sick  we arent into open water yet go down dear and ill stay here i dont like the smell of the engines poor dick he deserved oneonly one  but i didnt think hed frighten me so  dick returned to town next day just in time for lunch for which he had telegraphed to his disgust there were only empty plates in the studio  he lifted up his voice like the bears in the fairytale and torpenhow entered looking guilty  hsh said he dont make such a noise i took it come into my rooms and ill show you why  dick paused amazed at the threshold for on torpenhows sofa lay a girl asleep and breathing heavily the little cheap sailorhat the blueandwhite dress fitter for june than for february dabbled with mud at the skirts the jacket trimmed with imitation astrakhan and ripped at the shoulderseams the oneandelevenpenny umbrella and above all the disgraceful condition of the kidtopped boots declared all things  oh i say old man this is too bad you mustnt bring this sort up here  they steal things from the rooms  it looks bad i admit but i was coming in after lunch and she staggered into the hall i thought she was drunk at first but it was collapse i couldnt leave her as she was so i brought her up here and gave her your lunch she was fainting from want of food she went fast asleep the minute she had finished  i know something of that complaint shes been living on sausages i suppose torp you should have handed her over to a policeman for presuming to faint in a respectable house poor little wretch look at the face there isnt an ounce of immorality in it only follyslack fatuous feeble futile folly its a typical head dyou notice how the skull begins to show through the flesh padding on the face and cheekbone  what a coldblooded barbarian it is dont hit a woman when shes down cant we do anything she was simply dropping with starvation  she almost fell into my arms and when she got to the food she ate like a wild beast it was horrible  i can give her money which she would probably spend in drinks is she going to sleep for ever  the girl opened her eyes and glared at the men between terror and effrontery  feeling better said torpenhow  yes thank you there arent many gentlemen that are as kind as you are thank you  when did you leave service said dick who had been watching the scarred and chapped hands  how did you know i was in service i was general servant i didnt like it  and how do you like being your own mistress  do i look as if i liked it  i suppose not one moment would you be good enough to turn your face to the window  the girl obeyed and dick watched her face keenlyso keenly that she made as if to hide behind torpenhow  the eyes have it said dick walking up and down they are superb eyes for my business and after all every head depends on the eyes this has been sent from heaven to make up forwhat was taken away now the weekly strains off my shoulders i can get to work in earnest  evidently sent from heaven yes raise your chin a little please  gently old man gently youre scaring somebody out of her wits said torpenhow who could see the girl trembling  dont let him hit me oh please dont let him hit me ive been hit cruel today because i spoke to a man dont let him look at me like that hes reglar wicked that one dont let him look at me like that neither oh i feel as if i hadnt nothing on when he looks at me like that  the overstrained nerves in the frail body gave way and the girl wept like a little child and began to scream dick threw open the window and torpenhow flung the door back  there you are said dick soothingly my friend here can call for a policeman and you can run through that door nobody is going to hurt you  the girl sobbed convulsively for a few minutes and then tried to laugh  nothing in the world to hurt you now listen to me for a minute im what they call an artist by profession you know what artists do  they draw the things in red and black ink on the popshop labels  i dare say i havent risen to popshop labels yet those are done by the academicians i want to draw your head  what for  because its pretty that is why you will come to the room across the landing three times a week at eleven in the morning and ill give you three quid a week just for sitting still and being drawn and theres a quid on account  for nothing oh my the girl turned the sovereign in her hand and with more foolish tears aint neither o you two gentlemen afraid of my bilking you  no only ugly girls do that try and remember this place and by the way whats your name  im bessicbessie its no use giving the rest bessie brokestonebroke if you like whats your names but thereno one ever gives the real ones  dick consulted torpenhow with his eyes  my names heldar and my friends called torpenhow and you must be sure to come here where do you live  souththewaterone roomfive and sixpence a week arent you making fun of me about that three quid  youll see later on and bessie next time you come remember you neednt wear that paint its bad for the skin and i have all the colours youll be likely to need  bessie withdrew scrubbing her cheek with a ragged pockethandkerchief the two men looked at each other  youre a man said torpenhow  im afraid ive been a fool it isnt our business to run about the earth reforming bessie brokes and a woman of any kind has no right on this landing  perhaps she wont come back  she will if she thinks she can get food and warmth here i know she will worse luck but remember old man she isnt a woman shes my model and be careful  the idea shes a dissolute little scarecrowa guttersnippet and nothing more  so you think wait till she has been fed a little and freed from fear that fair type recovers itself very quickly you wont know her in a week or two when that abject fear has died out of her eyes shell be too happy and smiling for my purposes  but surely youre not taking her out of charityto please me  i am not in the habit of playing with hot coals to please anybody she has been sent from heaven as i may have remarked before to help me with my melancolia  never heard a word about the lady before  whats the use of having a friend if you must sling your notions at him in words you ought to know what im thinking about youve heard me grunt lately  even so but grunts mean anything in your language from bad baccy to wicked dealers and i dont think ive been much in your confidence for some time  it was a high and soulful grunt you ought to have understood that it meant the melancolia dick walked torpenhow up and down the room keeping silence then he smote him in the ribs now dont you see it bessies abject futility and the terror in her eyes welded on to one or two details in the way of sorrow that have come under my experience lately likewise some orange and blacktwo keys of each but i cant explain on an empty stomach  it sounds mad enough youd better stick to your soldiers dick instead of maundering about heads and eyes and experiences  think so dick began to dance on his heels singing  theyre as proud as a turkey when they hold the ready cash you ought to ear the way they laugh an joke they are tricky an theyre funny when theyve got the ready moneyow but see em when theyre all stonebroke  then he sat down to pour out his heart to maisie in a foursheet letter of counsel and encouragement and registered an oath that he would get to work with an undivided heart as soon as bessie should reappear  the girl kept her appointment unpainted and unadorned afraid and overbold by turns when she found that she was merely expected to sit still she grew calmer and criticised the appointments of the studio with freedom and some point she liked the warmth and the comfort and the release from fear of physical pain dick made two or three studies of her head in monochrome but the actual notion of the melancolia would not arrive  what a mess you keep your things in said bessie some days later when she felt herself thoroughly at home i spose your clothes are just as bad  gentlemen never think what buttons and tape are made for  i buy things to wear and wear em till they go to pieces i dont know what torpenhow does  bessie made diligent inquiry in the latters room and unearthed a bale of disreputable socks some of these ill mend now she said and some ill take home dyou know i sit all day long at home doing nothing just like a lady and no more noticing them other girls in the house than if they was so many flies i dont have any unnecessary words but i put em down quick i can tell you when they talk to me no its quite nice these days i lock my door and they can only call me names through the keyhole and i sit inside just like a lady mending socks mr torpenhow wears his socks out both ends at once  three quid a week from me and the delights of my society no socks mended nothing from torp except a nod on the landing now and again and all his socks mended bessie is very much a woman thought dick and he looked at her between halfshut eyes food and rest had transformed the girl as dick knew they would  what are you looking at me like that for she said quickly dont you look reglar bad when you look that way you dont think much o me do you  that depends on how you behave  bessie behaved beautifully only it was difficult at the end of a sitting to bid her go out into the gray streets she very much preferred the studio and a big chair by the stove with some socks in her lap as an excuse for delay then torpenhow would come in and bessie would be moved to tell strange and wonderful stories of her past and still stranger ones of her present improved circumstances she would make them tea as though she had a right to make it and once or twice on these occasions dick caught torpenhows eyes fixed on the trim little figure and because bessie flittings about the room made dick ardently long for maisie he realised whither torpenhows thoughts were tending and bessie was exceedingly careful of the condition of torpenhows linen she spoke very little to him but sometimes they talked together on the landing  i was a great fool dick said to himself i know what red firelight looks like when a mans tramping through a strange town and ours is a lonely selfish sort of life at the best i wonder maisie doesnt feel that sometimes but i cant order bessie away thats the worst of beginning things one never knows where they stop  one evening after a sitting prolonged to the last limit of the light dick was roused from a nap by a broken voice in torpenhows room he jumped to his feet now what ought i to do it looks foolish to go inoh bless you binkie the little terrier thrust torpenhows door open with his nose and came out to take possession of dicks chair the door swung wide unheeded and dick across the landing could see bessie in the halflight making her little supplication to torpenhow she was kneeling by his side and her hands were clasped across his knee  i knowi know she said thickly tisnt right o me to do this but i cant help it and you were so kindso kind and you never took any notice o me and ive mended all your things so carefullyi did oh please tisnt as if i was asking you to marry me i wouldnt think of it  but youcouldnt you take and live with me till miss right comes along im only miss wrong i know but id work my hands to the bare bone for you and im not ugly to look at say you will  dick hardly recognised torpenhows voice in replybut look here its no use im liable to be ordered off anywhere at a minutes notice if a war breaks out at a minutes noticedear  what does that matter until you go then until you go tisnt much im asking andyou dont know how good i can cook she had put an arm round his neck and was drawing his head down  untiligo then  torp said dick across the landing he could hardly steady his voice  come here a minute old man im in troubleheaven send hell listen to me there was something very like an oath from bessies lips she was afraid of dick and disappeared down the staircase in panic but it seemed an age before torpenhow entered the studio he went to the mantelpiece buried his head on his arms and groaned like a wounded bull  what the devil right have you to interfere he said at last  whos interfering with which your own sense told you long ago you couldnt be such a fool it was a tough rack st anthony but youre all right now  i oughtnt to have seen her moving about these rooms as if they belonged to her thats what upset me it gives a lonely man a sort of hankering doesnt it said torpenhow piteously  now you talk sense it does but since you arent in a condition to discuss the disadvantages of double housekeeping do you know what youre going to do  i dont i wish i did  youre going away for a season on a brilliant tour to regain tone youre going to brighton or scarborough or prawle point to see the ships go by and youre going at once isnt it odd ill take care of binkie but out you go immediately never resist the devil he holds the bank fly from him pack your things and go  i believe youre right where shall i go  and you call yourself a special correspondent pack first and inquire afterwards  an hour later torpenhow was despatched into the night for a hansom  youll probably think of some place to go to while youre moving said dick on to euston to begin with andoh yesget drunk tonight  he returned to the studio and lighted more candles for he found the room very dark  oh you jezebel you futile little jezebel wont you hate me tomorrowbinkie come here  binkie turned over on his back on the hearthrug and dick stirred him with a meditative foot  i said she was not immoral i was wrong she said she could cook that showed premeditated sin oh binkie if you are a man you will go to perdition but if you are a woman and say that you can cook you will go to a much worse place    chapter x       whats you that follows at my side      the foe that ye must fight my lord      that hirples swift as i can ride      the shadow of the night my lord      then wheel my horse against the foe      hes down and overpast my lord       ye war against the sunset glow      the darkness gathers fast my lord       the fight of heriots ford  this is a cheerful life said dick some days later torps away bessie hates me i cant get at the notion of the melancolia maisies letters are scrappy and i believe i have indigestion what give a man pains across the head and spots before his eyes binkie shall us take some liver pills  dick had just gone through a lively scene with bessie she had for the fiftieth time reproached him for sending torpenhow away she explained her enduring hatred for dick and made it clear to him that she only sat for the sake of his money and mr torpenhows ten times a better man than you she concluded  he is thats why he went away i should have stayed and made love to you  the girl sat with her chin on her hand scowling to me id like to catch you if i wasnt afraid o being hung id kill you thats what id do  dyou believe me  dick smiled wearily it is not pleasant to live in the company of a notion that will not work out a foxterrier that cannot talk and a woman who talks too much he would have answered but at that moment there unrolled itself from one corner of the studio a veil as it were of the flimsiest gauze he rubbed his eyes but the gray haze would not go  this is disgraceful indigestion binkie we will go to a medicineman we cant have our eyes interfered with for by these we get our bread also muttonchop bones for little dogs  the doctor was an affable local practitioner with white hair and he said nothing till dick began to describe the gray film in the studio  we all want a little patching and repairing from time to time he chirped like a ship my dear sirexactly like a ship sometimes the hull is out of order and we consult the surgeon sometimes the rigging and then i advise sometimes the engines and we go to the brainspecialist sometimes the lookout on the bridge is tired and then we see an oculist i should recommend you to see an oculist a little patching and repairing from time to time is all we want an oculist by all means  dick sought an oculistthe best in london he was certain that the local practitioner did not know anything about his trade and more certain that maisie would laugh at him if he were forced to wear spectacles  ive neglected the warnings of my lord the stomach too long hence these spots before the eyes binkie i can see as well as i ever could  as he entered the dark hall that led to the consultingroom a man cannoned against him dick saw the face as it hurried out into the street  thats the writertype he has the same modelling of the forehead as torp he looks very sick probably heard something he didnt like  even as he thought a great fear came upon dick a fear that made him hold his breath as he walked into the oculists waiting room with the heavy carved furniture the darkgreen paper and the soberhued prints on the wall he recognised a reproduction of one of his own sketches  many people were waiting their turn before him his eye was caught by a flaming redandgold christmascarol book little children came to that eyedoctor and they needed largetype amusement  thats idolatrous bad art he said drawing the book towards himself  from the anatomy of the angels it has been made in germany he opened in mechanically and there leaped to his eyes a verse printed in red ink       the next good joy that mary had      it was the joy of three      to see her good son jesus christ      making the blind to see      making the blind to see good lord      and happy we may be       praise father son and holy ghost      to all eternity  dick read and reread the verse till his turn came and the doctor was bending above him seated in an armchair the blaze of the gasmicroscope in his eyes made him wince the doctors hand touched the scar of the swordcut on dicks head and dick explained briefly how he had come by it when the flame was removed dick saw the doctors face and the fear came upon him again the doctor wrapped himself in a mist of words dick caught allusions to scar frontal bone optic nerve extreme caution and the avoidance of mental anxiety  verdict he said faintly my business is painting and i darent waste time what do you make of it  again the whirl of words but this time they conveyed a meaning  can you give me anything to drink  many sentences were pronounced in that darkened room and the prisoners often needed cheering dick found a glass of liqueur brandy in his hand  as far as i can gather he said coughing above the spirit you call it decay of the optic nerve or something and therefore hopeless what is my timelimit avoiding all strain and worry  perhaps one year  my god and if i dont take care of myself  i really could not say one cannot ascertain the exact amount of injury inflicted by the swordcut the scar is an old one andexposure to the strong light of the desert did you saywith excessive application to fine work i really could not say  i beg your pardon but it has come without any warning if you will let me ill sit here for a minute and then ill go you have been very good in telling me the truth without any warning without any warning  thanks  dick went into the street and was rapturously received by binkie  weve got it very badly little dog just as badly as we can get it well go to the park to think it out  they headed for a certain tree that dick knew well and they sat down to thin because his legs were trembling under him and there was cold fear at the pit of his stomach  how could it have come without any warning its as sudden as being shot its the living death binkie were to be shut up in the dark in one year if were careful and we shant see anybody and we shall never have anything we want not though we live to be a hundred binkie wagged his tail joyously binkie we must think lets see how it feels to be blind dick shut his eyes and flaming commas and catherinewheels floated inside the lids yet when he looked across the park the scope of his vision was not contracted he could see perfectly until a procession of slowwheeling fireworks defiled across his eyeballs  little dorglums we arent at all well lets go home if only torp were back now  but torpenhow was in the south of england inspecting dockyards in the company of the nilghai his letters were brief and full of mystery  dick had never asked anybody to help him in his joys or his sorrows he argued in the loneliness of his studio henceforward to be decorated with a film of gray gauze in one corner that if his fate were blindness all the torpenhows in the world could not save him i cant call him off his trip to sit down and sympathise with me i must pull through this business alone he said he was lying on the sofa eating his moustache and wondering what the darkness of the night would be like then came to his mind the memory of a quaint scene in the soudan a soldier had been nearly hacked in two by a broadbladed arab spear for one instant the man felt no pain looking down he saw that his lifeblood was going from him the stupid bewilderment on his face was so intensely comic that both dick and torpenhow still panting and unstrung from a fight for life had roared with laughter in which the man seemed as if he would join but as his lips parted in a sheepish grin the agony of death came upon him and he pitched grunting at their feet dick laughed again remembering the horror it seemed so exactly like his own case  but i have a little more time allowed me he said he paced up and down the room quietly at first but afterwards with the hurried feet of fear it was as though a black shadow stood at his elbow and urged him to go forward and there were only weaving circles and floating pindots before his eyes  we need to be calm binkie we must be calm he talked aloud for the sake of distraction this isnt nice at all what shall we do we must do something our time is short i shouldnt have believed that this morning but now things are different binkie where was moses when the light went out  binkie smiled from ear to ear as a wellbred terrier should but made no suggestion  were there but world enough and time this coyness binkie were not crime but at my back i always hear he wiped his forehead which was unpleasantly damp what can i do what can i do i havent any notions left and i cant think connectedly but i must do something or i shall go off my head  the hurried walk recommenced dick stopping every now and again to drag forth longneglected canvases and old notebooks for he turned to his work by instinct as a thing that could not fail you wont do and you wont do he said at each inspection no more soldiers i couldnt paint em sudden death comes home too nearly and this is battle and murder for me  the day was failing and dick thought for a moment that the twilight of the blind had come upon him unaware allah almighty he cried despairingly help me through the time of waiting and i wont whine when my punishment comes what can i do now before the light goes  there was no answer dick waited till he could regain some sort of control over himself his hands were shaking and he prided himself on their steadiness he could feel that his lips were quivering and the sweat was running down his face he was lashed by fear driven forward by the desire to get to work at once and accomplish something and maddened by the refusal of his brain to do more than repeat the news that he was about to go blind its a humiliating exhibition he thought and im glad torp isnt here to see the doctor said i was to avoid mental worry  come here and let me pet you binkie  the little dog yelped because dick nearly squeezed the bark out of him  then he heard the man speaking in the twilight and doglike understood that his trouble stood off from himallah is good binkie not quite so gentle as we could wish but well discuss that later i think i see my way to it now all those studies of bessies head were nonsense and they nearly brought your master into a scrape i hold the notion now as clear as crystalthe melancolia that transcends all wit there shall be maisie in that head because i shall never get maisie and bess of course because she knows all about melancolia though she doesnt know she knows and there shall be some drawing in it and it shall all end up with a laugh thats for myself shall she giggle or grin no she shall laugh right out of the canvas and every man and woman that ever had a sorrow of their own shallwhat is it the poem says       understand the speech and feel a stir      of fellowship in all disastrous fight  in all disastrous fight thats better than painting the thing merely to pique maisie i can do it now because i have it inside me binkie im going to hold you up by your tail youre an omen come here  binkie swung head downward for a moment without speaking  rather like holding a guineapig but youre a brave little dog and you dont yelp when youre hung up it is an omen  binkie went to his own chair and as often as he looked saw dick walking up and down rubbing his hands and chuckling that night dick wrote a letter to maisie full of the tenderest regard for her health but saying very little about his own and dreamed of the melancolia to be born not till morning did he remember that something might happen to him in the future  he fell to work whistling softly and was swallowed up in the clean clear joy of creation which does not come to man too often lest he should consider himself the equal of his god and so refuse to die at the appointed time he forgot maisie torpenhow and binkie at his feet but remembered to stir bessie who needed very little stirring into a tremendous rage that he might watch the smouldering lights in her eyes  he threw himself without reservation into his work and did not think of the doom that was to overtake him for he was possessed with his notion and the things of this world had no power upon him  youre pleased today said bessie  dick waved his mahlstick in mystic circles and went to the sideboard for a drink in the evening when the exaltation of the day had died down he went to the sideboard again and after some visits became convinced that the eyedoctor was a liar since he could still see everything very clearly  he was of opinion that he would even make a home for maisie and that whether she liked it or not she should be his wife the mood passed next morning but the sideboard and all upon it remained for his comfort  again he set to work and his eyes troubled him with spots and dashes and blurs till he had taken counsel with the sideboard and the melancolia both on the canvas and in his own mind appeared lovelier than ever there was a delightful sense of irresponsibility upon him such as they feel who walking among their fellowmen know that the deathsentence of disease is upon them and seeing that fear is but waste of the little time left are riotously happy the days passed without event  bessie arrived punctually always and though her voice seemed to dick to come from a distance her face was always very near the melancolia began to flame on the canvas in the likeness of a woman who had known all the sorrow in the world and was laughing at it it was true that the corners of the studio draped themselves in gray film and retired into the darkness that the spots in his eyes and the pains across his head were very troublesome and that maisies letters were hard to read and harder still to answer he could not tell her of his trouble and he could not laugh at her accounts of her own melancolia which was always going to be finished but the furious days of toil and the nights of wild dreams made amends for all and the sideboard was his best friend on earth  bessie was singularly dull she used to shriek with rage when dick stared at her between halfclosed eyes now she sulked or watched him with disgust saying very little  torpenhow had been absent for six weeks an incoherent note heralded his return news great news he wrote the nilghai knows and so does the keneu were all back on thursday get lunch and clean your accoutrements  dick showed bessie the letter and she abused him for that he had ever sent torpenhow away and ruined her life  well said dick brutally youre better as you are instead of making love to some drunken beast in the street he felt that he had rescued torpenhow from great temptation  i dont know if thats any worse than sitting to a drunken beast in a studio you havent been sober for three weeks youve been soaking the whole time and yet you pretend youre better than me  what dyou mean said dick  mean youll see when mr torpenhow comes back  it was not long to wait torpenhow met bessie on the staircase without a sign of feeling he had news that was more to him than many bessies and the keneu and the nilghai were trampling behind him calling for dick  drinking like a fish bessie whispered hes been at it for nearly a month she followed the men stealthily to hear judgment done  they came into the studio rejoicing to be welcomed over effusively by a drawn lined shrunken haggard wreckunshaven bluewhite about the nostrils stooping in the shoulders and peering under his eyebrows nervously the drink had been at work as steadily as dick  is this you said torpenhow  all thats left of me sit down binkies quite well and ive been doing some good work he reeled where he stood  youve done some of the worst work youve ever done in your life man alive youre  torpenhow turned to his companions appealingly and they left the room to find lunch elsewhere then he spoke but since the reproof of a friend is much too sacred and intimate a thing to be printed and since torpenhow used figures and metaphors which were unseemly and contempt untranslatable it will never be known what was actually said to dick who blinked and winked and picked at his hands after a time the culprit began to feel the need of a little selfrespect he was quite sure that he had not in any way departed from virtue and there were reasons too of which torpenhow knew nothing he would explain  he rose tried to straighten his shoulders and spoke to the face he could hardly see  you are right he said but i am right too after you went away i had some trouble with my eyes so i went to an oculist and he turned a gasogenei mean a gasengineinto my eye that was very long ago he said scar on the headswordcut and optic nerve make a note of that so i am going blind i have some work to do before i go blind and i suppose that i must do it i cannot see much now but i can see best when i am drunk i did not know i was drunk till i was told but i must go on with my work if you want to see it there it is he pointed to the all but finished melancolia and looked for applause  torpenhow said nothing and dick began to whimper feebly for joy at seeing torpenhow again for grief at misdeedsif indeed they were misdeedsthat made torpenhow remote and unsympathetic and for childish vanity hurt since torpenhow had not given a word of praise to his wonderful picture  bessie looked through the keyhole after a long pause and saw the two walking up and down as usual torpenhows hand on dicks shoulder  hereat she said something so improper that it shocked even binkie who was dribbling patiently on the landing with the hope of seeing his master again    chapter xi       the lark will make her hymn to god      the partridge call her brood      while i forget the heath i trod      the fields wherein i stood       tis dule to know not night from morn      but deeper dule to know      i can but hear the hunters horn      that once i used to blow       the only son  it was the third day after torpenhows return and his heart was heavy  do you mean to tell me that you cant see to work without whiskey its generally the other way about  can a drunkard swear on his honour said dick  yes if he has been as god a man as you  then i give you my word of honour said dick speaking hurriedly through parched lips old man i can hardly see your face now youve kept me sober for two daysif i ever was drunkand ive done no work  dont keep me back any more i dont know when my eyes may give out  the spots and dots and the pains and things are crowding worse than ever i swear i can see all right when imwhen im moderately screwed as you say give me three more sittings from bessie and allthe stuff i want and the picture will be done i cant kill myself in three days it only means a touch of d t at the worst  if i give you three days more will you promise me to stop work andthe other thing whether the pictures finished or not  i cant you dont know what that picture means to me but surely you could get the nilghai to help you and knock me down and tie me up i shouldnt fight for the whiskey but i should for the work  go on then i give you three days but youre nearly breaking my heart  dick returned to his work toiling as one possessed and the yellow devil of whiskey stood by him and chased away the spots in his eyes the melancolia was nearly finished and was all or nearly all that he had hoped she would be dick jested with bessie who reminded him that he was a drunken beast but the reproof did not move him  you cant understand bess we are in sight of land now and soon we shall lie back and think about what weve done ill give you three months pay when the pictures finished and next time i have any more work in handbut that doesnt matter wont three months pay make you hate me less  no it wont i hate you and ill go on hating you mr torpenhow wont speak to me any more hes always looking at maps  bessie did not say that she had again laid siege to torpenhow or that at the end of our passionate pleading he had picked her up given her a kiss and put her outside the door with the recommendation not to be a little fool he spent most of his time in the company of the nilghai and their talk was of war in the near future the hiring of transports and secret preparations among the dockyards he did not wish to see dick till the picture was finished  hes doing firstclass work he said to the nilghai and its quite out of his regular line but for the matter of that sos his infernal soaking  never mind leave him alone when he has come to his senses again well carry him off from this place and let him breathe clean air poor dick i dont envy you torp when his eyes fail  yes it will be a case of god help the man whos chained to our davie the worst is that we dont know when it will happen and i believe the uncertainty and the waiting have sent dick to the whiskey more than anything else  how the arab who cut his head open would grin if he knew  hes at perfect liberty to grin if he can hes dead thats poor consolation now  in the afternoon of the third day torpenhow heard dick calling for him  all finished he shouted ive done it come in isnt she a beauty isnt she a darling ive been down to hell to get her but isnt she worth it  torpenhow looked at the head of a woman who laugheda fulllipped holloweyed woman who laughed from out of the canvas as dick had intended she would  who taught you how to do it said torpenhow the touch and notion have nothing to do with your regular work what a face it is what eyes and what insolence unconsciously he threw back his head and laughed with her shes seen the game played outi dont think she had a good time of itand now she doesnt care isnt that the idea  exactly  where did you get the mouth and chin from they dont belong to bess  theyresome one elses but isnt it good isnt it thundering good wasnt it worth the whiskey i did it alone i did it and its the best i can do he drew his breath sharply and whispered just god what could i not do ten years hence if i can do this nowby the way what do you think of it bess  the girl was biting her lips she loathed torpenhow because he had taken no notice of her  i think its just the horridest beastliest thing i ever saw she answered and turned away  more than you will be of that way of thinking young womandick theres a sort of murderous viperine suggestion in the poise of the head that i dont understand said torpenhow  thats trickwork said dick chuckling with delight at being completely understood i couldnt resist one little bit of sheer swagger its a french trick and you wouldnt understand but its got at by slewing round the head a trifle and a tiny tiny foreshortening of one side of the face from the angle of the chin to the top of the left ear that and deepening the shadow under the lobe of the ear it was flagrant trickwork but having the notion fixed i felt entitled to play with itoh you beauty  amen she is a beauty i can feel it  so will every man who has any sorrow of his own said dick slapping his thigh he shall see his trouble there and by the lord harry just when hes feeling properly sorry for himself he shall throw back his head and laughas she is laughing ive put the life of my heart and the light of my eyes into her and i dont care what comes im tiredawfully tired i think ill get to sleep take away the whiskey it has served its turn and give bessie thirtysix quid and three over for luck cover the picture  he dropped asleep in the long chair hid face white and haggard almost before he had finished the sentence bessie tried to take torpenhows hand arent you never going to speak to me any more she said but torpenhow was looking at dick  what a stock of vanity the man has ill take him in hand tomorrow and make much of him he deserves iteh what was that bess  nothing ill put things tidy here a little and then ill go you couldnt give the that three months pay now could you he said you were to  torpenhow gave her a check and went to his own rooms bessie faithfully tidied up the studio set the door ajar for flight emptied half a bottle of turpentine on a duster and began to scrub the face of the melancolia viciously the paint did not smudge quickly enough she took a paletteknife and scraped following each stroke with the wet duster in five minutes the picture was a formless scarred muddle of colours she threw the paintstained duster into the studio stove stuck out her tongue at the sleeper and whispered bilked as she turned to run down the staircase she would never see torpenhow any more but she had at least done harm to the man who had come between her and her desire and who used to make fun of her cashing the check was the very cream of the jest to bessie then the little privateer sailed across the thames to be swallowed up in the gray wilderness of souththewater  dick slept till late in the evening when torpenhow dragged him off to bed his eyes were as bright as his voice was hoarse lets have another look at the picture he said insistently as a child  yougotobed said torpenhow you arent at all well though you maynt know it youre as jumpy as a cat  i reform tomorrow goodnight  as he repassed through the studio torpenhow lifted the cloth above the picture and almost betrayed himself by outcries wiped outscraped out and turped out hes on the verge of jumps as it is thats bessthe little fiend only a woman could have done thatwith the ink not dry on the check too dick will be raving mad tomorrow it was all my fault for trying to help gutterdevils oh my poor dick the lord is hitting you very hard  dick could not sleep that night partly for pure joy and partly because the wellknown catherinewheels inside his eyes had given place to crackling volcanoes of manycoloured fire spout away he said aloud  ive done my work and now you can do what you please he lay still staring at the ceiling the longpentup delirium of drink in his veins his brain on fire with racing thoughts that would not stay to be considered and his hands crisped and dry he had just discovered that he was painting the face of the melancolia on a revolving dome ribbed with millions of lights and that all his wondrous thoughts stood embodied hundreds of feet below his tiny swinging plank shouting together in his honour when something cracked inside his temples like an overstrained bowstring the glittering dome broke inward and he was alone in the thick night  ill go to sleep the rooms very dark lets light a lamp and see how the melancolia looks there ought to have been a moon  it was then that torpenhow heard his name called by a voice that he did not knowin the rattling accents of deadly fear  hes looked at the picture was his first thought as he hurried into the bedroom and found dick sitting up and beating the air with his hands  torp torp where are you for pitys sake come to me  whats the matter  dick clutched at his shoulder matter ive been lying here for hours in the dark and you never heard me torp old man dont go away im all in the dark in the dark i tell you  torpenhow held the candle within a foot of dicks eyes but there was no light in those eyes he lit the gas and dick heard the flame catch the grip of his fingers on torpenhows shoulder made torpenhow wince  dont leave me you wouldnt leave me alone now would you i cant see dyou understand its blackquite blackand i feel as if i was falling through it all  steady does it torpenhow put his arm round dick and began to rock him gently to and fro  thats good now dont talk if i keep very quiet for a while this darkness will lift it seems just on the point of breaking hsh dick knit his brows and stared desperately in front of him the night air was chilling torpenhows toes  can you stay like that a minute he said ill get my dressinggown and some slippers  dick clutched the bedhead with both hands and waited for the darkness to clear away what a time youve been he cried when torpenhow returned its as black as ever what are you banging about in the doorway  long chairhorseblanketpillow going to sleep by you lie down now youll be better in the morning  i shant the voice rose to a wail my god im blind im blind and the darkness will never go away he made as if to leap from the bed but torpenhows arms were round him and torpenhows chin was on his shoulder and his breath was squeezed out of him he could only gasp blind and wriggle feebly  steady dickie steady said the deep voice in his ear and the grip tightened bite on the bullet old man and dont let them think youre afraid the grip could draw no closer both men were breathing heavily  dick threw his head from side to side and groaned  let me go he panted youre cracking my ribs wewe mustnt let them think were afraid must weall the powers of darkness and that lot  lie down its all over now  yes said dick obediently but would you mind letting me hold your hand i feel as if i wanted something to hold on to one drops through the dark so  torpenhow thrust out a large and hairy paw from the long chair dick clutched it tightly and in half an hour had fallen asleep torpenhow withdrew his hand and stooping over dick kissed him lightly on the forehead as men do sometimes kiss a wounded comrade in the hour of death to ease his departure  in the gray dawn torpenhow heard dick talking to himself he was adrift on the shoreless tides of delirium speaking very quicklyits a pitya great pity but its helped and it must be eaten master george sufficient unto the day is the blindness thereof and further putting aside all melancolias and false humours it is of obvious notorietysuch as mine wasthat the queen can do no wrong torp doesnt know that ill tell him when were a little farther into the desert  what a bungle those boatmen are making of the steamerropes theyll have that fourinch hawser chafed through in a minute i told you sothere she goes white foam on green water and the steamer slewing round how good that looks ill sketch it no i cant im afflicted with ophthalmia that was one of the ten plagues of egypt and it extends up the nile in the shape of cataract ha thats a joke torp laugh you graven image and stand clear of the hawser itll knock you into the water and make your dress all dirty maisie dear  oh said torpenhow this happened before that night on the river  shell be sure to say its my fault if you get muddy and youre quite near enough to the breakwater maisie thats not fair ah i knew youd miss  low and to the left dear but youve no conviction dont be angry darling id cut my hand off if it would give you anything more than obstinacy my right hand if it would serve  now we mustnt listen heres an island shouting across seas of misunderstanding with a vengeance but its shouting truth i fancy said torpenhow  the babble continued it all bore upon maisie sometimes dick lectured at length on his craft then he cursed himself for his folly in being enslaved he pleaded to maisie for a kissonly one kissbefore she went away and called to her to come back from vitrysurmarne if she would but through all his ravings he bade heaven and earth witness that the queen could do no wrong  torpenhow listened attentively and learned every detail of dicks life that had been hidden from him for three days dick raved through the past and then a natural sleep what a strain he has been running under poor chap said torpenhow dick of all men handing himself over like a dog and i was lecturing him on arrogance i ought to have known that it was no use to judge a man but i did it what a demon that girl must be dicks given her his lifeconfound himand shes given him one kiss apparently  torp said dick from the bed go out for a walk youve been here too long ill get up hi this is annoying i cant dress myself oh its too absurd  torpenhow helped him into his clothes and led him to the big chair in the studio he sat quietly waiting under strained nerves for the darkness to lift it did not lift that day nor the next dick adventured on a voyage round the walls he hit his shins against the stove and this suggested to him that it would be better to crawl on all fours one hand in front of him torpenhow found him on the floor  im trying to get the geography of my new possessions said he dyou remember that nigger you gouged in the square pity you didnt keep the odd eye it would have been useful any letters for me give me all the ones in fat gray envelopes with a sort of crown thing outside theyre of no importance  torpenhow gave him a letter with a black m on the envelope flap dick put it into his pocket there was nothing in it that torpenhow might not have read but it belonged to himself and to maisie who would never belong to him  when she finds that i dont write shell stop writing its better so i couldnt be any use to her now dick argued and the tempter suggested that he should make known his condition every nerve in him revolted i have fallen low enough already im not going to beg for pity besides it would be cruel to her he strove to put maisie out of his thoughts but the blind have many opportunities for thinking and as the tides of his strength came back to him in the long employless days of dead darkness dicks soul was troubled to the core another letter and another came from maisie then there was silence and dick sat by the window the pulse of summer in the air and pictured her being won by another man stronger than himself his imagination the keener for the dark background it worked against spared him no single detail that might send him raging up and down the studio to stumble over the stove that seemed to be in four places at once worst of all tobacco would not taste in the darkness the arrogance of the man had disappeared and in its place were settled despair that torpenhow knew and blind passion that dick confided to his pillow at night the intervals between the paroxysms were filled with intolerable waiting and the weight of intolerable darkness  come out into the park said torpenhow you havent stirred out since the beginning of things  whats the use theres no movement in the dark and besideshe paused irresolutely at the head of the stairssomething will run over me  not if im with you proceed gingerly  the roar of the streets filled dick with nervous terror and he clung to torpenhows arm fancy having to feel for a gutter with your foot he said petulantly as he turned into the park lets curse god and die  sentries are forbidden to pay unauthorised compliments by jove there are the guards  dicks figure straightened lets get near em lets go in and look lets get on the grass and run i can smell the trees  mind the low railing thats all right torpenhow kicked out a tuft of grass with his heel smell that he said isnt it good dick sniffed luxuriously now pick up your feet and run they approached as near to the regiment as was possible the clank of bayonets being unfixed made dicks nostrils quiver  lets get nearer theyre in column arent they  yes how did you know  felt it oh my menmy beautiful men he edged forward as though he could see i could draw those chaps once wholl draw em now  theyll move off in a minute dont jump when the band begins  huh im not a new charger its the silences that hurt nearer torpnearer oh my god what wouldnt i give to see em for a minuteone halfminute  he could hear the armed life almost within reach of him could hear the slings tighten across the bandsmans chest as he heaved the big drum from the ground  sticks crossed above his head whispered torpenhow  i know i know who should know if i dont hsh  the drumsticks fell with a boom and the men swung forward to the crash of the band dick felt the wind of the massed movement in his face heard the maddening tramp of feet and the friction of the pouches on the belts the big drum pounded out the tune it was a musichall refrain that made a perfect quickstep       he must be a man of decent height      he must be a man of weight      he must come home on a saturday night      in a thoroughly sober state      he must know how to love me      and he must know how to kiss      and if hes enough to keep us both      i cant refuse him bliss  whats the matter said torpenhow as he saw dicks head fall when the last of the regiment had departed  nothing i feel a little bit out of the runningthats all torp take me back why did you bring me out    chapter xii       there were three friends that buried the fourth      the mould in his mouth and the dust in his eyes      and they went south and east and north      the strong man fights but the sick man dies       there were three friends that spoke of the dead      the strong man fights but the sick man dies      and would he were with us now they said      the sun in our face and the wind in our eyes       ballad  the nilghai was angry with torpenhow dick had been sent to bedblind men are ever under the orders of those who can seeand since he had returned from the park had fluently sworn at torpenhow because he was alive and all the world because it was alive and could see while he dick was dead in the death of the blind who at the best are only burdens upon their associates torpenhow had said something about a mrs gummidge and dick had retired in a black fury to handle and rehandle three unopened letters from maisie  the nilghai fat burly and aggressive was in torpenhows rooms  behind him sat the keneu the great war eagle and between them lay a large map embellished with blackandwhiteheaded pins  i was wrong about the balkans said the nilghai but im not wrong about this business the whole of our work in the southern soudan must be done over again the public doesnt care of course but the government does and they are making their arrangements quietly you know that as well as i do  i remember how the people cursed us when our troops withdrew from omdurman it was bound to crop up sooner or later but i cant go said torpenhow he pointed through the open door it was a hot night can you blame me  the keneu purred above his pipe like a large and very happy catdont blame you in the least its uncommonly good of you and all the rest of it but every maneven you torpmust consider his work i know it sounds brutal but dicks out of the racedowngastados expended finished done for he has a little money of his own he wont starve and you cant pull out of your slide for his sake think of your own reputation  dicks was five times bigger than mine and yours put together  that was because he signed his name to everything he did its all ended now you must hold yourself in readiness to move out you can command your own prices and you do better work than any three of us  dont tell me how tempting it is ill stay here to look after dick for a while hes as cheerful as a bear with a sore head but i think he likes to have me near him  the nilghai said something uncomplimentary about softheaded fools who throw away their careers for other fools torpenhow flushed angrily the constant strain of attendance on dick had worn his nerves thin  there remains a third fate said the keneu thoughtfully consider this and be not larger fools than necessary dick isor rather wasan ablebodied man of moderate attractions and a certain amount of audacity  oho said the nilghai who remembered an affair at cairo i begin to seetorp im sorry  torpenhow nodded forgiveness you were more sorry when he cut you out thoughgo on keneu  ive often thought when ive seen men die out in the desert that if the news could be sent through the world and the means of transport were quick enough there would be one woman at least at each mans bedside  there would be some mighty quaint revelations let us be grateful things are as they are said the nilghai  let us rather reverently consider whether torps threecornered ministrations are exactly what dick needs just nowwhat do you think yourself torp  i know they arent but what can i do  lay the matter before the board we are all dicks friends here youve been most in his life  but i picked it up when he was off his head  the greater chance of its being true i thought we should arrive who is she  then torpenhow told a tale in plain words as a special correspondent who knows how to make a verbal precis should tell it the men listened without interruption  is it possible that a man can come back across the years to his calflove said the keneu is it possible  i give the facts he says nothing about it now but he sits fumbling three letters from her when he thinks im not looking what am i to do  speak to him said the nilghai  oh yes write to heri dont know her full name rememberand ask her to accept him out of pity i believe you once told dick you were sorry for him nilghai you remember what happened eh go into the bedroom and suggest full confession and an appeal to this maisie girl whoever she is i honestly believe hed try to kill you and the blindness has made him rather muscular  torpenhows course is perfectly clear said the keneu he will go to vitrysurmarne which is on the beziereslandes railwaysingle track from tourgas the prussians shelled it out in 70 because there was a poplar on the top of a hill eighteen hundred yards from the church spire theres a squadron of cavalry quartered thereor ought to be where this studio torp spoke about may be i cannot tell that is torps business i have given him his route he will dispassionately explain the situation to the girl and she will come back to dickthe more especially because to use dicks words there is nothing but her damned obstinacy to keep them apart  and they have four hundred and twenty pounds a year between em  dick never lost his head for figures even in his delirium you havent the shadow of an excuse for not going said the nilghai  torpenhow looked very uncomfortable but its absurd and impossible i cant drag her back by the hair  our businessthe business for which we draw our moneyis to do absurd and impossible thingsgenerally with no reason whatever except to amuse the public here we have a reason the rest doesnt matter i shall share these rooms with the nilghai till torpenhow returns there will be a batch of unbridled specials coming to town in a little while and these will serve as their headquarters another reason for sending torpenhow away thus providence helps those who help others andhere the keneu dropped his measured speechwe cant have you tied by the leg to dick when the trouble begins its your only chance of getting away and dick will be grateful  he willworse luck i can but go and try i cant conceive a woman in her senses refusing dick  talk that out with the girl i have seen you wheedle an angry mahdieh woman into giving you dates this wont be a tithe as difficult you had better not be here tomorrow afternoon because the nilghai and i will be in possession it is an order obey  dick said torpenhow next morning can i do anything for you  no leave me alone how often must i remind you that im blind  nothing i could go for to fetch for to carry for to bring  no take those infernal creaking boots of yours away  poor chap said torpenhow to himself i must have been sitting on his nerves lately he wants a lighter step then aloud very well since youre so independent im going off for four or five days say goodbye at least the housekeeper will look after you and keneu has my rooms  dicks face fell you wont be longer than a week at the outside i know im touched in the temper but i cant get on without you  cant you youll have to do without me in a little time and youll be glad im gone  dick felt his way back to the big chair and wondered what these things might mean he did not wish to be tended by the housekeeper and yet torpenhows constant tenderness jarred on him he did not exactly know what he wanted the darkness would not lift and maisies unopened letters felt worn and old from much handling he could never read them for himself as long as life endured but maisie might have sent him some fresh ones to play with the nilghai entered with a gifta piece of red modellingwax he fancied that dick might find interest in using his hands dick poked and patted the stuff for a few minutes and is it like anything in the world he said drearily take it away i may get the touch of the blind in fifty years do you know where torpenhow has gone  the nilghai knew nothing were staying in his rooms till he comes back can we do anything for you  id like to be left alone please dont think im ungrateful but im best alone  the nilghai chuckled and dick resumed his drowsy brooding and sullen rebellion against fate he had long since ceased to think about the work he had done in the old days and the desire to do more work had departed from him he was exceedingly sorry for himself and the completeness of his tender grief soothed him but his soul and his body cried for maisiemaisie who would understand his mind pointed out that maisie having her own work to do would not care his experience had taught him that when money was exhausted women went away and that when a man was knocked out of the race the others trampled on him then at the least said dick in reply she could use me as i used binatfor some sort of a study i wouldnt ask more than to be near her again even though i knew that another man was making love to her ugh what a dog i am  a voice on the staircase began to sing joyfully  when we gogogo away from here our creditors will weep and they will wail our absence much regretting when they find that theyve been getting out of england by next tuesdays indian mail  following the trampling of feet slamming of torpenhows door and the sound of voices in strenuous debate some one squeaked and see you good fellows i have found a new waterbottlefirsclass patenteh how you say open himself inside out  dick sprang to his feet he knew the voice well thats cassavetti come back from the continent now i know why torp went away theres a row somewhere andim out of it  the nilghai commanded silence in vain thats for my sake dick said bitterly the birds are getting ready to fly and they wouldnt tell me i can hear mortensutherland and mackaye half the war correspondents in london are thereand im out of it  he stumbled across the landing and plunged into torpenhows room he could feel that it was full of men wheres the trouble said he in the balkans at last why didnt some one tell me  we thought you wouldnt be interested said the nilghai shamefacedly  its in the soudan as usual  you lucky dogs let me sit here while you talk i shant be a skeleton at the feastcassavetti where are you your english is as bad as ever  dick was led into a chair he heard the rustle of the maps and the talk swept forward carrying him with it everybody spoke at once discussing press censorships railwayroutes transport watersupply the capacities of generalsthese in language that would have horrified a trusting publicrangint asserting denouncing and laughing at the top of their voices there was the glorious certainty of war in the soudan at any moment the nilghai said so and it was well to be in readiness the keneu had telegraphed to cairo for horses cassavetti had stolen a perfectly inaccurate list of troops that would be ordered forward and was reading it out amid profane interruptions and the keneu introduced to dick some man unknown who would be employed as war artist by the central southern syndicate its his first outing said the keneu give him some tipsabout riding camels  oh those camels groaned cassavetti i shall learn to ride him again and now i am so much all soft listen you good fellows i know your military arrangement very well there will go the royal argalshire sutherlanders so it was read to me upon best authority  a roar of laughter interrupted him  sit down said the nilghai the lists arent even made out in the war office  will there be any force at suakin aid a voice  then the outcries redoubled and grew mixed thus how many egyptian troops will they usegod help the fellaheentheres a railway in plumstead marshes doing duty as a fivescourtwe shall have the suakinberber line built at lastcanadian voyageurs are too careful give me a halfdrunk krooman in a whaleboatwho commands the desert columnno they never blew up the big rock

connect with the african companies in the souththeres guineaworm in most of the wells on that route then the nilghai despairing of peace bellowed like a foghorn and beat upon the table with both hands  but what becomes of torpenhow said dick in the silence that followed  torps in abeyance just now hes off lovemaking somewhere i suppose said the nilghai  he said he was going to stay at home said the keneu  is he said dick with an oath he wont im not much good now but if you and the nilghai hold him down ill engage to trample on him till he sees reason hell stay behind indeed hes the best of you all therell be some tough work by omdurman we shall come there to stay this time  but i forgot i wish i were going with you  so do we all dickie said the keneu  and i most of all said the new artist of the central southern syndicate  could you tell me  ill give you one piece of advice dick answered moving towards the door if you happen to be cut over the head in a scrimmage dont guard  tell the man to go on cutting youll find it cheapest in the end thanks for letting me look in  theres grit in dick said the nilghai an hour later when the room was emptied of all save the keneu  it was the sacred call of the wartrumpet did you notice how he answered to it poor fellow lets look at him said the keneu  the excitement of the talk had died away dick was sitting by the studio table with his head on his arms when the men came in he did not change his position  it hurts he moaned god forgive me but it hurts cruelly and yet yknow the world has a knack of spinning round all by itself shall i see torp before he goes  oh yes youll see him said the nilghai    chapter xiii       the sun went down an hour ago      i wonder if i face towards home      if i lost my way in the light of day      how shall i find it now night is come       old song  maisie come to bed  its so hot i cant sleep dont worry  maisie put her elbows on the windowsill and looked at the moonlight on the straight poplarflanked road summer had come upon vitrysurmarne and parched it to the bone the grass was dryburnt in the meadows the clay by the bank of the river was caked to brick the roadside flowers were long since dead and the roses in the garden hung withered on their stalks the heat in the little low bedroom under the eaves was almost intolerable the very moonlight on the wall of kamis studio across the road seemed to make the night hotter and the shadow of the big bellhandle by the closed gate cast a bar of inky black that caught maisies eye and annoyed her  horrid thing it should be all white she murmured and the gate isnt in the middle of the wall either i never noticed that before  maisie was hard to please at that hour first the heat of the past few weeks had worn her down secondly her work and particularly the study of a female head intended to represent the melancolia and not finished in time for the salon was unsatisfactory thirdly kami had said as much two days before fourthlybut so completely fourthly that it was hardly worth thinking aboutdick her property had not written to her for more than six weeks she was angry with the heat with kami and with her work but she was exceedingly angry with dick  she had written to him three timeseach time proposing a fresh treatment of her melancolia dick had taken no notice of these communications she had resolved to write no more when she returned to england in the autumnfor her prides sake she could not return earliershe would speak to him she missed the sunday afternoon conferences more than she cared to admit all that kami said was continuez mademoiselle continuez toujours and he had been repeating the wearisome counsel through the hot summer exactly like a cicadaan old gray cicada in a black alpaca coat white trousers and a huge felt hat  but dick had tramped masterfully up and down her little studio north of the cool green london park and had said things ten times worse than continuez before he snatched the brush out of her hand and showed her where the error lay his last letter maisie remembered contained some trivial advice about not sketching in the sun or drinking water at wayside farmhouses and he had said that not once but three timesas if he did not know that maisie could take care of herself  but what was he doing that he could not trouble to write a murmur of voices in the road made her lean from the window a cavalryman of the little garrison in the town was talking to kamis cook the moonlight glittered on the scabbard of his sabre which he was holding in his hand lest it should clank inopportunely the cooks cap cast deep shadows on her face which was close to the conscripts he slid his arm round her waist and there followed the sound of a kiss  faugh said maisie stepping back  whats that said the redhaired girl who was tossing uneasily outside her bed  only a conscript kissing the cook said maisie  theyve gone away now she leaned out of the window again and put a shawl over her nightgown to guard against chills there was a very small nightbreeze abroad and a sunbaked rose below nodded its head as one who knew unutterable secrets was it possible that dick should turn his thoughts from her work and his own and descend to the degradation of suzanne and the conscript he could not the rose nodded its head and one leaf therewith it looked like a naughty little devil scratching its ear  dick could not because thought maisie he is mindminemine he said he was im sure i dont care what he does it will only spoil his work if he does and it will spoil mine too  the rose continued to nod it the futile way peculiar to flowers there was no earthly reason why dick should not disport himself as he chose except that he was called by providence which was maisie to assist maisie in her work and her work was the preparation of pictures that went sometimes to english provincial exhibitions as the notices in the scrapbook proved and that were invariably rejected by the salon when kami was plagued into allowing her to send them up her work in the future it seemed would be the preparation of pictures on exactly similar lines which would be rejected in exactly the same waythe redhaired girl threshed distressfully across the sheets its too hot to sleep she moaned and the interruption jarred  exactly the same way then she would divide her years between the little studio in england and kamis big studio at vitrysurmarne no she would go to another master who should force her into the success that was her right if patient toil and desperate endeavour gave one a right to anything dick had told her that he had worked ten years to understand his craft she had worked ten years and ten years were nothing dick had said that ten years were nothingbut that was in regard to herself only he had saidthis very man who could not find time to writethat he would wait ten years for her and that she was bound to come back to him sooner or later he had said this in the absurd letter about sunstroke and diphtheria and then he had stopped writing he was wandering up and down moonlit streets kissing cooks she would like to lecture him nownot in her nightgown of course but properly dressed severely and from a height yet if he was kissing other girls he certainly would not care whether she lecture him or not he would laugh at her very good  she would go back to her studio and prepare pictures that went etc etc  the millwheel of thought swung round slowly that no section of it might be slurred over and the redhaired girl tossed and turned behind her  maisie put her chin in her hands and decided that there could be no doubt whatever of the villainy of dick to justify herself she began unwomanly to weigh the evidence there was a boy and he had said he loved her and he kissed herkissed her on the cheekby a yellow seapoppy that nodded its head exactly like the maddening dry rose in the garden then there was an interval and men had told her that they loved herjust when she was busiest with her work then the boy came back and at their very second meeting had told her that he loved her then he had but there was no end to the things he had done he had given her his time and his powers he had spoken to her of art housekeeping technique teacups the abuse of pickles as a stimulantthat was rudesable hairbrusheshe had given her the best in her stockshe used them daily he had given her advice that she profited by and now and againa look such a look the look of a beaten hound waiting for the word to crawl to his mistresss feet in return she had given him nothing whatever excepthere she brushed her mouth against the openwork sleeve f her nightgownthe privilege of kissing her once and on the mouth too disgraceful was that not enough and more than enough and if it was not had he not cancelled the debt by not writing andprobably kissing other girls maisie youll catch a chill do go and lie down said the wearied voice of her companion i cant sleep a wink with you at the window  maisie shrugged her shoulders and did not answer she was reflecting on the meannesses of dick and on other meannesses with which he had nothing to do the moonlight would not let her sleep it lay on the skylight of the studio across the road in cold silver she stared at it intently and her thoughts began to slide one into the other the shadow of the big bellhandle in the wall grew short lengthened again and faded out as the moon went down behind the pasture and a hare came limping home across the road then the dawnwind washed through the upland grasses and brought coolness with it and the cattle lowed by the droughtshrunk river maisies head fell forward on the windowsill and the tangle of black hair covered her arms  maisie wake up youll catch a chill  yes dear yes dear she staggered to her bed like a wearied child and as she buried her face in the pillows she muttered i thinki think  but he ought to have written  day brought the routine of the studio the smell of paint and turpentine and the monotone wisdom of kami who was a leaden artist but a golden teacher if the pupil were only in sympathy with him maisie was not in sympathy that day and she waited impatiently for the end of the work  she knew when it was coming for kami would gather his black alpaca coat into a bunch behind him and with faded flue eyes that saw neither pupils nor canvas look back into the past to recall the history of one binat you have all done not so badly he would say but you shall remember that it is not enough to have the method and the art and the power nor even that which is touch but you shall have also the conviction that nails the work to the wall of the so many i taughthere the students would begin to unfix drawingpins or get their tubes togetherthe very so many that i have taught the best was binat all that comes of the study and the work and the knowledge was to him even when he came after he left me he should have done all that could be done with the colour the form and the knowledge only he had not the conviction so today i hear no more of binatthe best of my pupilsand that is long ago so today too you will be glad to hear no more of me continuez mesdemoiselles and above all with conviction  he went into the garden to smoke and mourn over the lost binat as the pupils dispersed to their several cottages or loitered in the studio to make plans for the cool of the afternoon  maisie looked at her very unhappy melancolia restrained a desire to grimace before it and was hurrying across the road to write a letter to dick when she was aware of a large man on a white troophorse how torpenhow had managed in the course of twenty hours to find his way to the hearts of the cavalry officers in quarters at vitrysurmarne to discuss with them the certainty of a glorious revenge for france to reduce the colonel to tears of pure affability and to borrow the best horse in the squadron for the journey to kamis studio is a mystery that only special correspondents can unravel  i beg your pardon said he it seems an absurd question to ask but the fact is that i dont know her by any other name is there any young lady here that is called maisie  i am maisie was the answer from the depths of a great sunhat  i ought to introduce myself he said as the horse capered in the blinding white dust my name is torpenhow dick heldar is my best friend andandthe fact is that he has gone blind  blind said maisie stupidly he cant be blind  he has been stoneblind for nearly two months  maisie lifted up her face and it was pearly white no no not blind i wont have him blind  would you care to see for yourself said torpenhow  nowat once  oh no the paris train doesnt go through this place till tonight there will be ample time  did mr heldar send you to me  certainly not dick wouldnt do that sort of thing hes sitting in his studio turning over some letters that he cant read because hes blind  there was a sound of choking from the sunhat maisie bowed her head and went into the cottage where the redhaired girl was on a sofa complaining of a headache  dicks blind said maisie taking her breath quickly as she steadied herself against a chairback my dicks blind  what the girl was on the sofa no longer  a man has come from england to tell me he hasnt written to me for six weeks  are you going to him  i must think  think i should go back to london and see him and i should kiss his eyes and kiss them and kiss them until they got well again if you dont go i shall oh what am i talking about you wicked little idiot go to him at once go  torpenhows neck was blistering but he preserved a smile of infinite patience as maisies appeared bareheaded in the sunshine  i am coming said she her eyes on the ground  you will be at vitry station then at seven this evening this was an order delivered by one who was used to being obeyed maisie said nothing but she felt grateful that there was no chance of disputing with this big man who took everything for granted and managed a squealing horse with one hand she returned to the redhaired girl who was weeping bitterly and between tears kissesvery few of thosementhol packing and an interview with kami the sultry afternoon wore away  thought might come afterwards her present duty was to go to dickdick who owned the wondrous friend and sat in the dark playing with her unopened letters  but what will you do she said to her companion  i oh i shall stay here andfinish your melancolia she said smiling pitifully write to me afterwards  that night there ran a legend through vitrysurmarne of a mad englishman doubtless suffering from sunstroke who had drunk all the officers of the garrison under the table had borrowed a horse from the lines and had then and there eloped after the english custom with one of those more mad english girls who drew pictures down there under the care of that good monsieur kami  they are very droll said suzanne to the conscript in the moonlight by the studio wall she walked always with those big eyes that saw nothing and yet she kisses me on both cheeks as though she were my sister and gives meseeten francs  the conscript levied a contribution on both gifts for he prided himself on being a good soldier  torpenhow spoke very little to maisie during the journey to calais but he was careful to attend to all her wants to get her a compartment entirely to herself and to leave her alone he was amazed of the ease with which the matter had been accomplished  the safest thing would be to let her think things out by dicks showingwhen he was off his headshe must have ordered him about very thoroughly wonder how she likes being under orders  maisie never told she sat in the empty compartment often with her eyes shut that she might realise the sensation of blindness it was an order that she should return to london swiftly and she found herself at last almost beginning to enjoy the situation this was better than looking after luggage and a redhaired friend who never took any interest in her surroundings but there appeared to be a feeling in the air that she maisieof all peoplewas in disgrace therefore she justified her conduct to herself with great success till torpenhow came up to her on the steamer and without preface began to tell the story of dicks blindness suppressing a few details but dwelling at length on the miseries of delirium he stopped before he reached the end as though he had lost interest in the subject and went forward to smoke maisie was furious with him and with herself  she was hurried on from dover to london almost before she could ask for breakfast andshe was past any feeling of indignation nowwas bidden curtly to wait in a hall at the foot of some leadcovered stairs while torpenhow went up to make inquiries again the knowledge that she was being treated like a naughty little girl made her pale cheeks flame it was all dicks fault for being so stupid as to go blind  torpenhow led her up to a shut door which he opened very softly dick was sitting by the window with his chin on his chest there were three envelopes in his hand and he turned them over and over the big man who gave orders was no longer by her side and the studio door snapped behind her  dick thrust the letters into his pocket as he heard the sound hullo topr is that you ive been so lonely  his voice had taken the peculiar flatness of the blind maisie pressed herself up into a corner of the room her heart was beating furiously and she put one hand on her breast to keep it quiet dick was staring directly at her and she realised for the first time that he was blind  shutting her eyes in a railway carriage to open them when she pleased was childs play this man was blind though his eyes were wide open  torp is that you they said you were coming dick looked puzzled and a little irritated at the silence  no its only me was the answer in a strained little whisper maisie could hardly move her lips  hm said dick composedly without moving this is a new phenomenon darkness im getting used to but i object to hearing voices  was he mad then as well as blind that he talked to himself maisies heart beat more wildly and she breathed in gasps dick rose and began to feel his way across the room touching each table and chair as he passed once he caught his foot on a rug and swore dropping on his knees to feel what the obstruction might be maisie remembered him walking in the park as though all the earth belonged to him tramping up and down her studio two months ago and flying up the gangway of the channel steamer the beating of her heart was making her sick and dick was coming nearer guided by the sound of her breathing she put out a hand mechanically to ward him off or to draw him to herself she did not know which it touched his chest and he stepped back as though he had been shot  its maisie said he with a dry sob what are you doing here  i camei cameto see you please  dicks lips closed firmly  wont you sit down then you see ive had some bother with my eyes and  i know i know why didnt you tell me  i couldnt write  you might have told mr torpenhow  what has he to do with my affairs  hehe brought me from vitrysurmarne he thought i ought to see you  why what has happened can i do anything for you no i cant i forgot  oh dick im so sorry ive come to tell you and let me take you back to your chair  dont im not a child you only do that out of pity i never meant to tell you anything about it im no good now im down and done for let me alone  he groped back to his chair his chest labouring as he sat down  maisie watched him and the fear went out of her heart to be followed by a very bitter shame he had spoken a truth that had been hidden from the girl through every step of the impetuous flight to london for he was indeed down and done formasterful no longer but rather a little abject neither an artist stronger than she nor a man to be looked up toonly some blind one that sat in a chair and seemed on the point of crying she was immensely and unfeignedly sorry for himmore sorry than she had ever been for any one in her life but not sorry enough to deny his words  so she stood still and felt ashamed and a little hurt because she had honestly intended that her journey should end triumphantly and now she was only filled with pity most startlingly distinct from love  well said dick his face steadily turned away i never meant to worry you any more whats the matter  he was conscious that maisie was catching her breath but was as unprepared as herself for the torrent of emotion that followed she had dropped into a chair and was sobbing with her face hidden in her hands  i canti cant she cried desperately indeed i cant it isnt my fault  im so sorry oh dickie im so sorry  dicks shoulders straightened again for the words lashed like a whip  still the sobbing continued it is not good to realise that you have failed in the hour of trial or flinched before the mere possibility of making sacrifices  i do despise myselfindeed i do but i cant oh dickie you wouldnt ask mewould you wailed maisie  she looked up for a minute and by chance it happened that dicks eyes fell on hers the unshaven face was very white and set and the lips were trying to force themselves into a smile but it was the wornout eyes that maisie feared her dick had gone blind and left in his place some one that she could hardly recognise till he spoke  who is asking you to do anything maisie i told you how it would be  whats the use of worrying for pitys sake dont cry like that it isnt worth it  you dont know how i hate myself oh dick help mehelp me the passion of tears had grown beyond her control and was beginning to alarm the man he stumbled forward and put his arm round her and her head fell on his shoulder  hush dear hush dont cry youre quite right and youve nothing to reproach yourself withyou never had youre only a little upset by the journey and i dont suppose youve had any breakfast what a brute torp was to bring you over  i wanted to come i did indeed she protested  very well and now youve come and seen and imimmensely grateful  when youre better you shall go away and get something to eat what sort of a passage did you have coming over  maisie was crying more subduedly for the first time in her life glad that she had something to lean against dick patted her on the shoulder tenderly but clumsily for he was not quite sure where her shoulder might be  she drew herself out of his arms at last and waited trembling and most unhappy he had felt his way to the window to put the width of the room between them and to quiet a little the tumult in his heart  are you better now he said  yes butdont you hate me  i hate you my god i  isntisnt there anything i could do for you then ill stay here in england to do it if you like perhaps i could come and see you sometimes  i think not dear it would be kindest not to see me any more please i dont want to seem rude butdont you thinkperhaps you had almost better go now  he was conscious that he could not bear himself as a man if the strain continued much longer  i dont deserve anything else ill go dick oh im so miserable  nonsense youve nothing to worry about id tell you if you had wait a moment dear ive got something to give you first i meant it for you ever since this little trouble began its my melancolia she was a beauty when i last saw her you can keep her for me and if ever youre poor you can sell her shes worth a few hundreds at any state of the market he groped among his canvases shes framed in black is this a black frame that i have my hand on there she is what do you think of her  he turned a scarred formless muddle of paint towards maisie and the eyes strained as though they would catch her wonder and surprise one thing and one thing only could she do for him  well  the voice was fuller and more rounded because the man knew he was speaking of his best work maisie looked at the blur and a lunatic desire to laugh caught her by the throat but for dicks sakewhatever this mad blankness might meanshe must make no sign her voice choked with hardheld tears as she answered still gazing at the wreckoh dick it is good  he heard the little hysterical gulp and took it for tribute wont you have it then ill send it over to your house if you will  i oh yesthank you ha ha if she did not fly at once the laughter that was worse than tears would kill her she turned and ran choking and blinded down the staircases that were empty of life to take refuge in a cab and go to her house across the parks there she sat down in the dismantled drawingroom and thought of dick in his blindness useless till the end of life and of herself in her own eyes behind the sorrow the shame and the humiliation lay fear of the cold wrath of the redhaired girl when maisie should return maisie had never feared her companion before not until she found herself saying well he never asked me did she realise her scorn of herself  and that is the end of maisie        for dick was reserved more searching torment he could not realise at first that maisie whom he had ordered to go had left him without a word of farewell he was savagely angry against torpenhow who had brought upon him this humiliation and troubled his miserable peace then his dark hour came and he was alone with himself and his desires to get what help he could from the darkness the queen could do no wrong but in following the right so far as it served her work she had wounded her one subject more than his own brain would let him know  its all i had and ive lost it he said as soon as the misery permitted clear thinking and torp will think that he has been so infernally clever that i shant have the heart to tell him i must think this out quietly  hullo said torpenhow entering the studio after dick had enjoyed two hours of thought im back are you feeling any better  torp i dont know what to say come here dick coughed huskily wondering indeed what he should say and how to say it temperately  whats the need for saying anything get up and tramp torpenhow was perfectly satisfied  they walked up and down as of custom torpenhows hand on dicks shoulder and dick buried in his own thoughts  how in the world did you find it all out said dick at last  you shouldnt go off your head if you want to keep secrets dickie it was absolutely impertinent on my part but if youd seen me rocketing about on a halftrained french troophorse under a blazing sun youd have laughed there will be a charivari in my rooms tonight seven other devils  i knowthe row in the southern soudan i surprised their councils the other day and it made me unhappy have you fixed your flint to go who dyou work for  havent signed any contracts yet i wanted to see how your business would turn out  would you have stayed with me then ifthings had gone wrong he put his question cautiously  dont ask me too much im only a man  youve tried to be an angel very successfully  oh yees well do you attend the function tonight we shall be half screwed before the morning all the men believe the wars a certainty  i dont think i will old man if its all the same to you ill stay quiet here  and meditate i dont blame you you observe a good time if ever a man did  that night there was a tumult on the stairs the correspondents poured in from theatre dinner and musichall to torpenhows room that they might discuss their plan of campaign in the event of military operations becoming a certainty torpenhow the keneu and the nilghai had bidden all the men they had worked with to the orgy and mr beeton the housekeeper declared that never before in his checkered experience had he seen quite such a fancy lot of gentlemen they waked the chambers with shoutings and song and the elder men were quite as bad as the younger for the chances of war were in front of them and all knew what those meant  sitting in his own room a little perplexed by the noise across the landing dick suddenly began to laugh to himself  when one comes to think of it the situation is intensely comic maisies quite rightpoor little thing i didnt know she could cry like that before but now i know what torp thinks im sure hed be quite fool enough to stay at home and try to console meif he knew besides it isnt nice to own that youve been thrown over like a broken chair i must carry this business through aloneas usual if there isnt a war and torp finds out i shall look foolish thats all if there is a way i mustnt interfere with another mans chances business is business and i want to be alonei want to be alone what a row theyre making  somebody hammered at the studio door  come out and frolic dickie said the nilghai  i should like to but i cant im not feeling frolicsome  then ill tell the boys and theyll drag you like a badger  please not old man on my word id sooner be left alone just now  very good can we send anything in to you fizz for instance  cassavetti is beginning to sing songs of the sunny south already  for one minute dick considered the proposition seriously  no thanks ive a headache already  virtuous child thats the effect of emotion on the young all my congratulations dick i also was concerned in the conspiracy for your welfare  go to the deviloh send binkie in here  the little dog entered on elastic feet riotous from having been made much of all the evening he had helped to sing the choruses but scarcely inside the studio he realised that this was no place for tailwagging and settled himself on dicks lap till it was bedtime then he went to bed with dick who counted every hour as it struck and rose in the morning with a painfully clear head to receive torpenhows more formal congratulations and a particular account of the last nights revels  you arent looking very happy for a newly accepted man said torpenhow  never mind thatits my own affair and im all right do you really go  yes with the old central southern as usual they wired and i accepted on better terms than before  when do you start  the day after tomorrowfor brindisi  thank god dick spoke from the bottom of his heart  well thats not a pretty way of saying youre glad to get rid of me but men in your condition are allowed to be selfish  i didnt mean that will you get a hundred pounds cashed for me before you leave  thats a slender amount for housekeeping isnt it  oh its only formarriage expenses  torpenhow brought him the money counted it out in fives and tens and carefully put it away in the writing table  now i suppose i shall have to listen to his ravings about his girl until i go heaven send us patience with a man in love he said to himself  but never a word did dick say of maisie or marriage he hung in the doorway of torpenhows room when the latter was packing and asked innumerable questions about the coming campaign till torpenhow began to feel annoyed  youre a secretive animal dickie and you consume your own smoke dont you he said on the last evening  ii suppose so by the way how long do you think this war will last  days weeks or months one can never tell it may go on for years  i wish i were going  good heavens youre the most unaccountable creature hasnt it occurred to you that youre going to be marriedthanks to me  of course yes im going to be marriedso i am going to be married  im awfully grateful to you havent i told you that  you might be going to be hanged by the look of you said torpenhow  and the next day torpenhow bade him goodbye and left him to the loneliness he had so much desired    chapter xiv       yet at the last ere our spearmen had found him      yet at the last ere a swordthrust could save      yet at the last with his masters around him      he of the faith spoke as master to slave      yet at the last tho the kafirs had maimed him      broken by bondage and wrecked by the reiver      yet at the last tho the darkness had claimed him      he called upon allah and died a believer       kizzilbashi  beg your pardon mr heldar butbut isnt nothin going to happen said mr beeton  no dick had just waked to another morning of blank despair and his temper was of the shortest  taint my regular business o course sir and what i say is mind your own business and let other people mind theirs but just before mr  torpenhow went away he give me to understand like that you might be moving into a house of your own so to speaka sort of house with rooms upstairs and downstairs where youd be better attended to though i try to act just by all our tenants dont i  ah that must have been a madhouse i shant trouble you to take me there yet get me my breakfast please and leave me alone  i hope i havent done anything wrong sir but you know i hope that as far as a man can i tries to do the proper thing by all the gentlemen in chambersand more particular those whose lot is hardsuch as you for instance mr heldar you likes softroe bloater dont you softroe bloaters is scarcer than hardroe but what i says is never mind a little extra trouble so long as you give satisfaction to the tenants  mr beeton withdrew and left dick to himself torpenhow had been long away there was no more rioting in the chambers and dick had settled down to his new life which he was weak enough to consider nothing better than death  it is hard to live alone in the dark confusing the day and night dropping to sleep through sheer weariness at midday and rising restless in the chill of the dawn at first dick on his awakenings would grope along the corridors of the chambers till he heard some one snore then he would know that the day had not yet come and return wearily to his bedroom  later he learned not to stir till there was a noise and movement in the house and mr beeton advised him to get up once dressedand dressing now that torpenhow was away was a lengthy business because collars ties and the like hid themselves in far corners of the room and search meant headbeating against chairs and trunksonce dressed there was nothing whatever to do except to sit still and brood till the three daily meals came centuries separated breakfast from lunch and lunch from dinner and though a man prayed for hundreds of years that his mind might be taken from him god would never hear rather the mind was quickened and the revolving thoughts ground against each other as millstones grind when there is no corn between and yet the brain would not wear out and give him rest it continued to think at length with imagery and all manner of reminiscences it recalled maisie and past success reckless travels by land and sea the glory of doing work and feeling that it was good and suggested all that might have happened had the eyes only been faithful to their duty when thinking ceased through sheer weariness there poured into dicks soul tide on tide of overwhelming purposeless feardread of starvation always terror lest the unseen ceiling should crush down upon him fear of fire in the chambers and a louses death in red flame and agonies of fiercer horror that had nothing to do with any fear of death then dick bowed his head and clutching the arms of his chair fought with his sweating self till the tinkle of plates told him that something to eat was being set before him  mr beeton would bring the meal when he had time to spare and dick learned to hang upon his speech which dealt with badly fitted gasplugs wastepipes out of repair little tricks for driving picturenails into walls and the sins of the charwoman or the housemaids in the lack of better things the small gossip of a servant hall becomes immensely interesting and the screwing of a washer on a tap an event to be talked over for days  once or twice a week too mr beeton would take dick out with him when he went marketing in the morning to haggle with tradesmen over fish lampwicks mustard tapioca and so forth while dick rested his weight first on one foot and then on the other and played aimlessly with the tins and stringball on the counter then they would perhaps meet one of mr beetons friends and dick standing aside a little would hold his peace till mr beeton was willing to go on again  the life did not increase his selfrespect he abandoned shaving as a dangerous exercise and being shaved in a barbers shop meant exposure of his infirmity he could not see that his clothes were properly brushed and since he had never taken any care of his personal appearance he became every known variety of sloven a blind man cannot deal with cleanliness till he has been some months used to the darkness if he demand attendance and grow angry at the want of it he must assert himself and stand upright then the meanest menial can see that he is blind and therefore of no consequence a wise man will keep his eyes on the floor and sit still for amusement he may pick coal lump by lump out of the scuttle with the tongs and pile it in a little heap in the fender keeping count of the lumps which must all be put back again one by one and very carefully he may set himself sums if he cares to work them out he may talk to himself or to the cat if she chooses to visit him and if his trade has been that of an artist he may sketch in the air with his forefinger but that is too much like drawing a pig with the eyes shut he may go to his bookshelves and count his books ranging them in order of their size or to his wardrobe and count his shirts laying them in piles of two or three on the bed as they suffer from frayed cuffs or lost buttons  even this entertainment wearies after a time and all the times are very very long  dick was allowed to sort a toolchest where mr beeton kept hammers taps and nuts lengths of gaspipes oilbottles and string  if i dont have everything just where i know where to look for it why then i cant find anything when i do want it youve no idea sir the amount of little things that these chambers uses up said mr beeton  fumbling at the handle of the door as he went out its hard on you sir i do think its hard on you aint you going to do anything sir  ill pay my rent and messing isnt that enough  i wasnt doubting for a moment that you couldnt pay your way sir but i ave often said to my wife its ard on im because it isnt as if he was an old man nor yet a middleaged one but quite a young gentleman thats where it comes so ard  i suppose so said dick absently this particular nerve through long battering had ceased to feelmuch  i was thinking continued mr beeton still making as if to go that you might like to hear my boy alf read you the papers sometimes of an evening he do read beautiful seeing hes only nine  i should be very grateful said dick only let me make it worth his while  we wasnt thinking of that sir but of course its in your own ands but only to ear alf sing a boys best friend is is mother ah  ill hear him sing that too let him come this evening with the newspapers  alf was not a nice child being puffed up with many schoolboard certificates for good conduct and inordinately proud of his singing mr  beeton remained beaming while the child wailed his way through a song of some eight eightline verses in the usual whine of a young cockney and after compliments left him to read dick the foreign telegrams ten minutes later alf returned to his parents rather pale and scared  e said e couldnt stand it no more he explained  he never said you read badly alf mrs beeton spoke  no e said i read beautiful said e never eard any one read like that but e said e couldnt abide the stuff in the papers  praps hes lost some money in the stocks were you readin him about stocks alf  no it was all about fightin out there where the soldiers is gonea great long piece with all the lines close together and very hard words in it e give me arf a crown because i read so well and e says the next time theres anything e wants read ell send for me  thats good hearing but i do think for all the halfcrownput it into the kickingdonkey moneybox alf and let me see you do ithe might have kept you longer why he couldnt have begun to understand how beautiful you read  hes best left to hisselfgentlemen always are when theyre downhearted said mr beeton  alfs rigorously limited powers of comprehending torpenhows special correspondence had waked the devil of unrest in dick he could hear through the boys nasal chant the camels grunting in the squares behind the soldiers outside suakin could hear the men swearing and chaffing across the cooking pots and could smell the acrid woodsmoke as it drifted over camp before the wind of the desert  that night he prayed to god that his mind might be taken from him offering for proof that he was worthy of this favour the fact that he had not shot himself long ago that prayer was not answered and indeed dick knew in his heart of hearts that only a lingering sense of humour and no special virtue had kept him alive suicide he had persuaded himself would be a ludicrous insult to the gravity of the situation as well as a weakkneed confession of fear  just for the fun of the thing he said to the cat who had taken binkies place in his establishment i should like to know how long this is going to last i can live for a year on the hundred pounds torp cashed for me i must have two or three thousand at least in the banktwenty or thirty years more provided for that is to say then i fall back on my hundred and twenty a year which will be more by that time lets consider  twentyfivethirtyfivea mans in his prime then they sayfortyfivea middleaged man just entering politicsfiftyfivedied at the comparatively early age of fiftyfive according to the newspapers bah how these christians funk death sixtyfivewere only getting on in years seventyfive is just possible though great hell cat o fifty years more of solitary confinement in the dark youll die and beeton will die and torp will die and maieverybody else will die but i shall be alive and kicking with nothing to do im very sorry for myself i should like some one else to be sorry for me evidently im not going ma before i die but the pains just as bad as ever some day when youre vivisected cat o theyll tie you down on a little table and cut you openbut dont be afraid theyll take precious good care that you dont die youll live and youll be very sorry then that you werent sorry for me perhaps torp will come back or i wish i could go to torp and the nilghai even though i were in their way  pussy left the room before the speech was ended and alf as he entered found dick addressing the empty hearthrug  theres a letter for you sir he said perhaps youd like me to read it  lend it to me for a minute and ill tell you  the outstretched hand shook just a little and the voice was not oversteady it was within the limits of human possibility thatthat was no letter from maisie he knew the heft of three closed envelopes only too well it was a foolish hope that the girl should write to him for he did not realise that there is a wrong which admits of no reparation though the evildoer may with tears and the hearts best love strive to mend all it is best to forget that wrong whether it be caused or endured since it is as remediless as bad work once put forward  read it then said dick and alf began intoning according to the rules of the board schooli could have given you love i could have given you loyalty such as you never dreamed of do you suppose i cared what you were but you chose to whistle everything down the wind for nothing my only excuse for you is that you are so young thats all he said returning the paper to be dropped into the fire  what was in the letter asked mrs beeton when alf returned  i dont know i think it was a circular or a tract about not whistlin at everything when youre young  i must have stepped on something when i was alive and walking about and it has bounced up and hit me god help it whatever it isunless it was all a joke but i dont know any one whod take the trouble to play a joke on me love and loyalty for nothing it sounds tempting enough  i wonder whether i have lost anything really  dick considered for a long time but could not remember when or how he had put himself in the way of winning these trifles at a womans hands  still the letter as touching on matters that he preferred not to think about stung him into a fit of frenzy that lasted for a day and night when his heart was so full of despair that it would hold no more body and soul together seemed to be dropping without check through the darkness  then came fear of darkness and desperate attempts to reach the light again but there was no light to be reached when that agony had left him sweating and breathless the downward flight would recommence till the gathering torture of it spurred him into another fight as hopeless as the first followed some few minutes of sleep in which he dreamed that he saw then the procession of events would repeat itself till he was utterly worn out and the brain took up its everlasting consideration of maisie and mighthavebeens  at the end of everything mr beeton came to his room and volunteered to take him out not marketing this time but well go into the parks if you like  be damned if i do quoth dick keep to the streets and walk up and down i like to hear the people round me  this was not altogether true the blind in the first stages of their infirmity dislike those who can move with a free stride and unlifted armsbut dick had no earthly desire to go to the parks once and only once since maisie had shut her door he had gone there under alfs charge alf forgot him and fished for minnows in the serpentine with some companions after half an hours waiting dick almost weeping with rage and wrath caught a passerby who introduced him to a friendly policeman who led him to a fourwheeler opposite the albert hall he never told mr beeton of alfs forgetfulness but this was not the manner in which he was used to walk the parks aforetime  what streets would you like to walk down then said mr beeton sympathetically his own ideas of a riotous holiday meant picnicking on the grass of green park with his family and half a dozen paper bags full of food  keep to the river said dick and they kept to the river and the rush of it was in his ears till they came to blackfriars bridge and struck thence on to the waterloo road mr beeton explaining the beauties of the scenery as he went on  and walking on the other side of the pavement said he unless im much mistaken is the young woman that used to come to your rooms to be drawed i never forgets a face and i never remembers a name except paying tenants o course  stop her said dick its bessie broke tell her id like to speak to her again quick man  mr beeton crossed the road under the noses of the omnibuses and arrested bessie then on her way northward she recognised him as the man in authority who used to glare at her when she passed up dicks staircase and her first impulse was to run  wasnt you mr heldars model said mr beeton planting himself in front of her you was hes on the other side of the road and hed like to see you  why said bessie faintly she rememberedindeed had never for long forgottenan affair connected with a newly finished picture  because he has asked me to do so and because hes most particular blind  drunk  no orspital blind he cant see thats him over there  dick was leaning against the parapet of the bridge as mr beeton pointed him outa stubbearded bowed creature wearing a dirty magentacoloured neckcloth outside an unbrushed coat there was nothing to fear from such an one even if he chased her bessie thought he could not follow far she crossed over and dicks face lighted up it was long since a woman of any kind had taken the trouble to speak to him  i hope youre well mr heldar said bessie a little puzzled mr beeton stood by with the air of an ambassador and breathed responsibly  im very well indeed and by jove im glad to seehear you i mean bess you never thought it worth while to turn up and see us again after you got your money i dont know why you should are you going anywhere in particular just now  i was going for a walk said bessie  not the old business dick spoke under his breath  lor no i paid my premiumbessie was very proud of that wordfor a barmaid sleeping in and im at the bar now quite respectable indeed i am  mr beeton had no special reason to believe in the loftiness of human nature therefore he dissolved himself like a mist and returned to his gasplugs without a word of apology bessie watched the flight with a certain uneasiness but so long as dick appeared to be ignorant of the harm that had been done to him  its hard work pulling the beerhandles she went on and theyve got one of them pennyintheslot cashmachines so if you get wrong by a penny at the end of the daybut then i dont believe the machinery is right do you  ive only seen it work mr beeton  hes gone  im afraid i must ask you to help me home then ill make it worth your while you see the sightless eyes turned towards her and bessie saw  it isnt taking you out of your way he said hesitatingly i can ask a policeman if it is  not at all i come on at seven and im off at four thats easy hours  good godbut im on all the time i wish i had some work to do too  lets go home bess  he turned and cannoned into a man on the sidewalk recoiling with an oath bessie took his arm and said nothingas she had said nothing when he had ordered her to turn her face a little more to the light they walked for some time in silence the girl steering him deftly through the crowd  and whereswheres mr torpenhow she inquired at last  he has gone away to the desert  wheres that  dick pointed to the right eastout of the mouth of the river said he  then west then south and then east again all along the underside of europe then south again god knows how far the explanation did not enlighten bessie in the least but she held her tongue and looked to dicks patch till they came to the chambers  well have tea and muffins he said joyously i cant tell you bessie how glad i am to find you again what made you go away so suddenly  i didnt think youd want me any more she said emboldened by his ignorance  i didnt as a matter of factbut afterwardsat any rate im glad youve come you know the stairs  so bessie led him home to his own placethere was no one to hinderand shut the door of the studio  what a mess was her first word all these things havent been looked after for months and months  no only weeks bess you cant expect them to care  i dont know what you expect them to do they ought to know what youve paid them for the dusts just awful its all over the easel  i dont use it much now  all over the pictures and the floor and all over your coat id like to speak to them housemaids  ring for tea then dick felt his way to the one chair he used by custom  bessie saw the action and as far as in her lay was touched but there remained always a keen sense of newfound superiority and it was in her voice when she spoke  how long have you been like this she said wrathfully as though the blindness were some fault of the housemaids  how  as you are  the day after you went away with the check almost as soon as my picture was finished i hardly saw her alive  then theyve been cheating you ever since thats all i know their nice little ways  a woman may love one man and despise another but on general feminine principles she will do her best to save the man she despises from being defrauded her loved one can look to himself but the other man being obviously an idiot needs protection  i dont think mr beeton cheats much said dick bessie was flouncing up and down the room and he was conscious of a keen sense of enjoyment as he heard the swish of her skirts and the light step between  tea and muffins she said shortly when the ring at the bell was answered two teaspoonfuls and one over for the pot i dont want the old teapot that was here when i used to come it dont draw get another  the housemaid went away scandalised and dick chuckled then he began to cough as bessie banged up and down the studio disturbing the dust  what are you trying to do  put things straight this is like unfurnished lodgings how could you let it go so  how could i help it dust away  she dusted furiously and in the midst of all the pother entered mrs  beeton her husband on his return had explained the situation winding up with the peculiarly felicitous proverb do unto others as you would be done by she had descended to put into her place the person who demanded muffins and an uncracked teapot as though she had a right to both  muffins ready yet said bess still dusting she was no longer a drab of the streets but a young lady who thanks to dicks check had paid her premium and was entitled to pull beerhandles with the best being neatly dressed in black she did not hesitate to face mrs beeton and there passed between the two women certain regards that dick would have appreciated the situation adjusted itself by eye bessie had won and mrs beeton returned to cook muffins and make scathing remarks about models hussies trollops and the like to her husband  theres nothing to be got of interfering with him liza he said alf you go along into the street to play when he isnt crossed hes as kindly as kind but when hes crossed hes the devil and all we took too many little things out of his rooms since he was blind to be that particular about what he does they aint no objects to a blind man of course but if it was to come into court wed get the sack yes i did introduce him to that girl because im a feelin man myself  much too feelin mrs beeton slapped the muffins into the dish and thought of comely housemaids long since dismissed on suspicion  i aint ashamed of it and it isnt for us to judge him hard so long as he pays quiet and regular as he do i know how to manage young gentlemen you know how to cook for them and what i says is let each stick to his own business and then there wont be any trouble take them muffins down liza and be sure you have no words with that young woman his lot is cruel hard and if hes crossed he do swear worse than any one ive ever served  thats a little better said bessie sitting down to the tea you neednt wait thank you mrs beeton  i had no intention of doing such i do assure you  bessie made no answer whatever this she knew was the way in which real ladies routed their foes and when one is a barmaid at a firstclass publichouse one may become a real lady at ten minutes notice  her eyes fell on dick opposite her and she was both shocked and displeased there were droppings of food all down the front of his coat the mouth under the ragged illgrown beard drooped sullenly the forehead was lined and contracted and on the lean temples the hair was a dusty indeterminate colour that might or might not have been called gray the utter misery and selfabandonment of the man appealed to her and at the bottom of her heart lay the wicked feeling that he was humbled and brought low who had once humbled her  oh it is good to hear you moving about said dick rubbing his hands  tell us all about your bar successes bessie and the way you live now  never mind that im quite respectable as youd see by looking at me  you dont seem to live too well what made you go blind that sudden why isnt there any one to look after you  dick was too thankful for the sound of her voice to resent the tone of it  i was cut across the head a long time ago and that ruined my eyes i dont suppose anybody thinks it worth while to look after me any more  why should theyand mr beeton really does everything i want  dont you know any gentlemen and ladies then while you waswell  a few but i dont care to have them looking at me  i suppose thats why youve growed a beard take it off it dont become you  good gracious child do you imagine that i think of what becomes of me these days  you ought get that taken off before i come here again i suppose i can come cant i  id be only too grateful if you did i dont think i treated you very well in the old days i used to make you angry  very angry you did  im sorry for it then come and see me when you can and as often as you can god knows there isnt a soul in the world to take that trouble except you and mr beeton  a lot of trouble hes taking and she too this with a toss of the head  theyve let you do anyhow and they havent done anything for you ive only to look and see that much ill come and ill be glad to come but you must go and be shaved and you must get some other clothesthose ones arent fit to be seen  i have heaps somewhere he said helplessly  i know you have tell mr beeton to give you a new suit and ill brush it and keep it clean you may be as blind as a barndoor mr heldar but it doesnt excuse you looking like a sweep  do i look like a sweep then  oh im sorry for you im that sorry for you she cried impulsively and took dicks hands mechanically he lowered his head as if to kissshe was the only woman who had taken pity on him and he was not too proud for a little pity now she stood up to go  nothing o that kind till you look more like a gentleman its quite easy when you get shaved and some clothes  he could hear her drawing on her gloves and rose to say goodbye she passed behind him kissed him audaciously on the back of the neck and ran away as swiftly as on the day when she had destroyed the melancolia  to think of me kissing mr heldar she said to herself after all hes done to me and all well im sorry for him and if he was shaved he wouldnt be so bad to look at but oh them beetons how shameful theyve treated him i know beetons wearing his shirt on his back today just as well as if id aired it tomorrow ill see i wonder if he has much of his own it might be worth more than the bari wouldnt have to do any workand just as respectable as if no one knew  dick was not grateful to bessie for her parting gift he was acutely conscious of it in the nape of his neck throughout the night but it seemed among very many other things to enforce the wisdom of getting shaved  he was shaved accordingly in the morning and felt the better for it a fresh suit of clothes white linen and the knowledge that some one in the world said that she took an interest in his personal appearance made him carry himself almost upright for the brain was relieved for a while from thinking of maisie who under other circumstances might have given that kiss and a million others  let us consider said he after lunch the girl cant care and its a tossup whether she comes again or not but if money can buy her to look after me she shall be bought nobody else in the world would take the trouble and i can make it worth her while shes a child of the gutter holding brevet rank as a barmaid so she shall have everything she wants if shell only come and talk and look after me he rubbed his newly shorn chin and began to perplex himself with the thought of her not coming i suppose i did look rather a sweep he went on i had no reason to look otherwise i knew things dropped on my clothes but it didnt matter it would be cruel if she didnt come she must maisie came once and that was enough for her she was quite right she had something to work for this creature has only beerhandles to pull unless she has deluded some young man into keeping company with her  fancy being cheated for the sake of a counterjumper were falling pretty low  something cried aloud within himthis will hurt more than anything that has gone before it will recall and remind and suggest and tantalise and in the end drive you mad  i know it i know it dick cried clenching his hands despairingly but good heavens is a poor blind beggar never to get anything out of his life except three meals a day and a greasy waistcoat i wish shed come  early in the afternoon time she came because there was no young man in her life just then and she thought of material advantages which would allow her to be idle for the rest of her days  i shouldnt have known you she said approvingly you look as you used to looka gentleman that was proud of himself  dont you think i deserve another kiss then said dick flushing a little  maybebut you wont get it yet sit down and lets see what i can do for you im certain sure mr beeton cheats you now that you cant go through the housekeeping books every month isnt that true  youd better come and housekeep for me then bessie  couldnt do it in these chambersyou know that as well as i do  i know but we might go somewhere else if you thought it worth your while  id try to look after you anyhow but i shouldnt care to have to work for both of us this was tentative  dick laughed  do you remember where i used to keep my bankbook said he torp took it to be balanced just before he went away look and see  it was generally under the tobaccojar ah  well  oh four thousand two hundred and ten pounds nine shillings and a penny oh my  you can have the penny thats not bad for one years work is that and a hundred and twenty pounds a year good enough  the idleness and the pretty clothes were almost within her reach now but she must by being housewifely show that she deserved them  yes but youd have to move and if we took an inventory i think wed find that mr beeton has been prigging little things out of the rooms here and there they dont look as full as they used  never mind well let him have them the only thing im particularly anxious to take away is that picture i used you forwhen you used to swear at me well pull out of this place bess and get away as far as ever we can  oh yes she said uneasily  i dont know where i can go to get away from myself but ill try and you shall have all the pretty frocks that you care for youll like that  give me that kiss now bess ye gods its good to put ones arm round a womans waist again  then came the fulfilment of the prophecy within the brain if his arm were thus round maisies waist and a kiss had just been given and taken between themwhy then he pressed the girl more closely to himself because the pain whipped him she was wondering how to explain a little accident to the melancolia at any rate if this man really desired the solace of her companyand certainly he would relapse into his original slough if she withdrew ithe would not be more than just a little vexed  it would be delightful at least to see what would happen and by her teachings it was good for a man to stand in certain awe of his companion  she laughed nervously and slipped out of his reach  i shouldnt worrit about that picture if i was you she began in the hope of turning his attention  its at the back of all my canvases somewhere find it bess you know it as well as i do  i knowbut  but what youve wit enough to manage the sale of it to a dealer  women haggle much better than men it might be a matter of eight or nine hundred pounds toto us i simply didnt like to think about it for a long time it was mixed up with my life sobut well cover up our tracks and get rid of everything eh make a fresh start from the beginning bess  then she began to repent very much indeed because she knew the value of money still it was probable that the blind man was overestimating the value of his work gentlemen she knew were absurdly particular about their things she giggled as a nervous housemaid giggles when she tries to explain the breakage of a pipe  im very sorry but you remember i wasi was angry with you before mr torpenhow went away  you were very angry child and on my word i think you had some right to be  then ibut arent you sure mr torpenhow didnt tell you  tell me what good gracious what are you making such a fuss about when you might just as well be giving me another kiss  he was beginning to learn not for the first time in his experience that kissing is a cumulative poison the more you get of it the more you want  bessie gave the kiss promptly whispering as she did so i was so angry i rubbed out that picture with the turpentine you arent angry are you  what say that again the mans hand had closed on her wrist  i rubbed it out with turps and the knife faltered bessie i thought youd only have to do it over again you did do it over again didnt you oh let go of my wrist youre hurting me  isnt there anything left of the thing  nnothing that looks like anything im sorryi didnt know youd take on about it i only meant to do it in fun you arent going to hit me  hit you no lets think  he did not relax his hold upon her wrist but stood staring at the carpet  then he shook his head as a young steer shakes it when the lash of the stockwhip cross his nose warns him back to the path on to the shambles that he would escape for weeks he had forced himself not to think of the melancolia because she was a part of his dead life with bessies return and certain new prospects that had developed themselves the melancolialovelier in his imagination than she had ever been on canvasreappeared by her aid he might have procured mor money wherewith to amuse bess and to forget maisie as well as another taste of an almost forgotten success now thanks to a vicious little housemaids folly there was nothing to look fornot even the hope that he might some day take an abiding interest in the housemaid worst of all he had been made to appear ridiculous in maisies eyes a woman will forgive the man who has ruined her lifes work so long as he gives her love a man may forgive those who ruin the love of his life but he will never forgive the destruction of his work  tcktcktck said dick between his teeth and then laughed softly its an omen bessie anda good many things considered it serves me right for doing what i have done by jove that accounts for maisies running away she must have thought me perfectly madsmall blame to her the whole picture ruined isnt it so what made you do it  because i was that angry im not angry nowim awful sorry  i wonderit doesnt matter anyhow im to blame for making the mistake  what mistake  something you wouldnt understand dear great heavens to think that a little piece of dirt like you could throw me out of stride dick was talking to himself as bessie tried to shake off his grip on her wrist  i aint a piece of dirt and you shouldnt call me so i did it cause i hated you and im only sorry now cause yourecause youre  exactlybecause im blind theres noting like tact in little things  bessie began to sob she did not like being shackled against her will she was afraid of the blind face and the look upon it and was sorry too that her great revenge had only made dick laugh  dont cry he said and took her into his arms you only did what you thought right  ii aint a little piece of dirt and if you say that ill never come to you again  you dont know what youve done to me im not angryindeed im not  be quiet for a minute  bessie remained in his arms shrinking dicks first thought was connected with maisie and it hurt him as whitehot iron hurts an open sore  not for nothing is a man permitted to ally himself to the wrong woman  the first pangthe first sense of things lost is but the prelude to the play for the very just providence who delights in causing pain has decreed that the agony shall return and that in the midst of keenest pleasure  they know this pain equally who have forsaken or been forsaken by the love of their life and in their new wives arms are compelled to realise it  it is better to remain alone and suffer only the misery of being alone so long as it is possible to find distraction in daily work when that resource goes the man is to be pitied and left alone  these things and some others dick considered while he was holding bessie to his heart  though you maynt know it he said raising his head the lord is a just and a terrible god bess with a very strong sense of humour it serves me righthow it serves me right torp could understand it if he were here he must have suffered something at your hands child but only for a minute or so i saved him set that to my credit some one  let me go said bess her face darkening let me go  all in good time did you ever attend sunday school  never let me go i tell you youre making fun of me  indeed im not im making fun of myself thus he saved others himself he cannot save it isnt exactly a schoolboard text he released her wrist but since he was between her and the door she could not escape what an enormous amount of mischief one little woman can do  im sorry im awful sorry about the picture  im not im grateful to you for spoiling it what were we talking about before you mentioned the thing  about getting awayand money me and you going away  of course we will get awaythat is to say i will  and me  you shall have fifty whole pounds for spoiling a picture  then you wont  im afraid not dear think of fifty pounds for pretty things all to yourself  you said you couldnt do anything without me  that was true a little while ago im better now thank you get me my hat  spose i dont  beeton will and youll lose fifty pounds thats all get it  bessie cursed under her breath she had pitied the man sincerely had kissed him with almost equal sincerity for he was not unhandsome it pleased her to be in a way and for a time his protector and above all there were four thousand pounds to be handled by some one now through a slip of the tongue and a little feminine desire to give a little not too much pain she had lost the money the blessed idleness and the pretty things the companionship and the chance of looking outwardly as respectable as a real lady  now fill me a pipe tobacco doesnt taste but it doesnt matter and ill think things out whats the day of the week bess  tuesday  then thursdays mailday what a foolwhat a blind fool i have been  twentytwo pounds covers my passage home again allow ten for additional expenses we

hundred and eighty pounds added to three hundred a year means gilded luxury for a single woman bess well go to the bank  richer by two hundred and ten pounds stored in his moneybelt dick caused bessie now thoroughly bewildered to hurry from the bank to the p and o offices where he explained things tersely  port said single first cabin as close to the baggagehatch as possible  what ships going  the colgong said the clerk  shes a wet little hooker is it tilbury and a tender or galleons and the docks  galleons twelveforty thursday  thanks change please i cant see very wellwill you count it into my hand  if they all took their passages like that instead of talking about their trunks life would be worth something said the clerk to his neighbour who was trying to explain to a harassed mother of many that condensed milk is just as good for babes at sea as daily dairy being nineteen and unmarried he spoke with conviction  we are now quoth dick as they returned to the studio patting the place where his moneybelt covered ticket and money beyond the reach of man or devil or womanwhich is much more important ive had three little affairs to carry through before thursday but i neednt ask you to help bess come here on thursday morning at nine well breakfast and you shall take me down to galleons station  what are you going to do  going away of course what should i stay for  but you cant look after yourself  i can do anything i didnt realise it before but i can ive done a great deal already resolution shall be treated to one kiss if bessie doesnt object strangely enough bessie objected and dick laughed i suppose youre right well come at nine the day after tomorrow and youll get your money  shall i sure  i dont bilk and you wont know whether i do or not unless you come  oh but its long and long to wait goodbye bessiesend beeton here as you go out  the housekeeper came  what are all the fittings of my rooms worth said dick imperiously  tisnt for me to say sir some things is very pretty and some is wore out dreadful  im insured for two hundred and seventy  insurance policies is no criterion though i dont say  oh damn your longwindedness youve made your pickings out of me and the other tenants why you talked of retiring and buying a publichouse the other day give a straight answer to a straight question  fifty said mr beeton without a moments hesitation  double it or ill break up half my sticks and burn the rest  he felt his way to a bookstand that supported a pile of sketchbooks and wrenched out one of the mahogany pillars  thats sinful sir said the housekeeper alarmed  its my own one hundred or  one hundred it is itll cost me three and six to get that there pilaster mended  i thought so what an out and out swindler you must have been to spring that price at once  i hope ive done nothing to dissatisfy any of the tenants least of all you sir  never mind that get me the money tomorrow and see that all my clothes are packed in the little brown bullocktrunk im going  but the quarters notice  ill pay forfeit look after the packing and leave me alone  mr beeton discussed this new departure with his wife who decided that bessie was at the bottom of it all her husband took a more charitable view  its very suddenbut then he was always sudden in his ways listen to him now  there was a sound of chanting from dicks room       well never come back any more boys      well never come back no more      well go to the deuce on any excuse      and never come back no more       oh say were afloat or ashore boys      oh say were afloat or ashore      but well never come back any more boys      well never come back no more  mr beeton mr beeton where the deuce is my pistol  quick hes going to shoot himselfavin gone mad said mrs beeton  mr beeton addressed dick soothingly but it was some time before the latter threshing up and down his bedroom could realise the intention of the promises to find everything tomorrow sir  oh you coppernosed old foolyou impotent academician he shouted at last do you suppose i want to shoot myself take the pistol in your silly shaking hand then if you touch it it will go off because its loaded  its among my campaignkit somewherein the parcel at the bottom of the trunk  long ago dick had carefully possessed himself of a fortypound weight fieldequipment constructed by the knowledge of his own experience it was this putaway treasure that he was trying to find and rehandle mr  beeton whipped the revolver out of its place on the top of the package and dick drove his hand among the khaki coat and breeches the blue cloth legbands and the heavy flannel shirts doubled over a pair of swanneck spurs under these and the waterbottle lay a sketchbook and a pigskin case of stationery  these we dont want you can have them mr beeton everything else ill keep pack em on the top righthand side of my trunk when youve done that come into the studio with your wife i want you both wait a minute get me a pen and a sheet of notepaper  it is not an easy thing to write when you cannot see and dick had particular reasons for wishing that his work should be clear so he began following his right hand with his left the badness of this writing is because i am blind and cannot see my pen hmpheven a lawyer cant mistake that it must be signed i suppose but it neednt be witnessed now an inch lowerwhy did i never learn to use a typewriterthis is the last will and testament of me richard heldar i am in sound bodily and mental health and there is no previous will to revokethats all right damn the pen whereabouts on the paper was ii leave everything that i possess in the world including four thousand pounds and two thousand seven hundred and twenty eight pounds held for meoh i cant get this straight he tore off half the sheet and began again with the caution about the handwriting then i leave all the money i possess in the world tohere followed maisies name and the names of the two banks that held the money  it maynt be quite regular but no one has a shadow of a right to dispute it and ive given maisies address come in mr beeton this is my signature i want you and your wife to witness it thanks tomorrow you must take me to the landlord and ill pay forfeit for leaving without notice and ill lodge this paper with him in case anything happens while im away now were going to light up the studio stove stay with me and give me my papers as i want em  no one knows until he has tried how fine a blaze a years accumulation of bills letters and dockets can make dick stuffed into the stove every document in the studiosaving only three unopened letters destroyed sketchbooks rough notebooks new and halffinished canvases alike  what a lot of rubbish a tenant gets about him if he stays long enough in one place to be sure said mr beeton at last  he does is there anything more left dick felt round the walls  not a thing and the stoves nigh redhot  excellent and youve lost about a thousand pounds worth of sketches  ho ho quite a thousand pounds worth if i can remember what i used to be  yes sir politely mr beeton was quite sure that dick had gone mad otherwise he would have never parted with his excellent furniture for a song the canvas things took up storage room and were much better out of the way  there remained only to leave the little will in safe hands that could not be accomplished to tomorrow dick groped about the floor picking up the last pieces of paper assured himself again and again that there remained no written word or sign of his past life in drawer or desk and sat down before the stove till the fire died out and the contracting iron cracked in the silence of the night    chapter xv       with a heart of furious fancies      whereof i am commander      with a burning spear and a horse of air      to the wilderness i wander       with a knight of ghosts and shadows      i summoned am to tourney      ten leagues beyond the wide worlds end      methinks it is no journey       tom a bedlams song  goodbye bess i promised you fifty heres a hundredall that i got for my furniture from beeton that will keep you in pretty frocks for some time youve been a good little girl all things considered but youve given me and torpenhow a fair amount of trouble  give mr torpenhow my love if you see him wont you  of course i will dear now take me up the gangplank and into the cabin once aboard the lugger and the maid isand i am free i mean  wholl look after you on this ship  the headsteward if theres any use in money the doctor when we come to port said if i know anything of p and o doctors after that the lord will provide as he used to do  bess found dick his cabin in the wild turmoil of a ship full of leavetakers and weeping relatives then he kissed her and laid himself down in his bunk until the decks should be clear he who had taken so long to move about his own darkened rooms well understood the geography of a ship and the necessity of seeing to his own comforts was as wine to him  before the screw began to thrash the ship along the docks he had been introduced to the headsteward had royally tipped him secured a good place at table opened out his baggage and settled himself down with joy in the cabin it was scarcely necessary to feel his way as he moved about for he knew everything so well then god was very kind a deep sleep of weariness came upon him just as he would have thought of maisie and he slept till the steamer had cleared the mouth of the thames and was lifting to the pulse of the channel  the rattle of the engines the reek of oil and paint and a very familiar sound in the next cabin roused him to his new inheritance  oh its good to be alive again he yawned stretched himself vigorously and went on deck to be told that they were almost abreast of the lights of brighton this is no more open water than trafalgal square is a common the free levels begin at ushant but none the less dick could feel the healing of the sea at work upon him already a boisterous little crossswell swung the steamer disrespectfully by the nose and one wave breaking far aft spattered the quarterdeck and the pile of new deckchairs he heard the foam fall with the clash of broken glass was stung in the face by a cupful and sniffing luxuriously felt his way to the smokingroom by the wheel there a strong b reeze found him blew his cap off and left him bareheaded in the doorway and the smokingroom steward understanding that he was a voyager of experience said that the weather would be stiff in the chops off the channel and more than half a gale in the bay these things fell as they were foretold and dick enjoyed himself to the utmost it is allowable and even necessary at sea to lay firm hold upon tables stanchions and ropes in moving from place to place on land the man who feels with his hands is patently blind at sea even a blind man who is not seasick can jest with the doctor over the weakness of his fellows dick told the doctor many talesand these are coin of more value than silver if properly handledsmoked with him till unholy hours of the night and so won his shortlived regard that he promised dick a few hours of his time when they came to port said  and the sea roared or was still as the winds blew and the engines sang their song day and night and the sun grew stronger day by day and tom the lascar barber shaved dick of a morning under the opened hatchgrating where the cool winds blew and the awnings were spread and the passengers made merry and at last they came to port said  take me said dick to the doctor to madame binatsif you know where that is  whew said the doctor i do theres not much to choose between em but i suppose youre aware that thats one of the worst houses in the place theyll rob you to begin with and knife you later  not they take me there and i can look after myself  so he was brought to madame binats and filled his nostrils with the wellremembered smell of the east that runs without a change from the canal head to hongkong and his mouth with the villainous lingua franca of the levant the heat smote him between the shoulderblades with the buffet of an old friend his feet slipped on the sand and his coatsleeve was warm as newbaked bread when he lifted it to his nose  madame binat smiled with the smile that knows no astonishment when dick entered the drinkingshop which was one source of her gains but for a little accident of complete darkness he could hardly realise that he had ever quitted the old life that hummed in his ears somebody opened a bottle of peculiarly strong schiedam the smell reminded dick of monsieur binat who by the way had spoken of art and degradation  binat was dead madame said as much when the doctor departed scandalised so far as a ships doctor can be at the warmth of dicks reception dick was delighted at it they remember me here after a year they have forgotten me across the water by this time madame i want a long talk with you when youre at liberty it is good to be back again  in the evening she set an irontopped cafetable out on the sands and dick and she sat by it while the house behind them filled with riot merriment oaths and threats the stars came out and the lights of the shipping in the harbour twinkled by the head of the canal  yes the war is good for trade my friend but what dost thou do here we have not forgotten thee  i was over there in england and i went blind  but there was the glory first we heard of it here even herei and binat and thou hast used the head of yellow tinashe is still aliveso often and so well that tina laughed when the papers arrived by the mailboats it was always something that we here could recognise in the paintings and then there was always the glory and the money for thee  i am not poori shall pay you well  not to me thou hast paid for everything under her breath mon dieu to be blind and so young what horror  dick could not see her face with the pity on it or his own with the discoloured hair at the temples he did not feel the need of pity he was too anxious to get to the front once more and explained his desire  and where the canal is full of the english ships sometimes they fire as they used to do when the war was hereten years ago beyond cairo there is fighting but how canst thou go there without a correspondents passport and in the desert there is always fighting but that is impossible also said she  i must go to suakin he knew thanks to alfs readings that torpenhow was at work with the column that was protecting the construction of the suakinberber line p and o steamers do not touch at that port and besides madame binat knew everybody whose help or advice was worth anything they were not respectable folk but they could cause things to be accomplished which is much more important when there is work toward  but at suakin they are always fighting that desert breeds men alwaysand always more men and they are so bold why to suakin  my friend is there  thy friend chtt thy friend is death then  madame binat dropped a fat arm on the tabletop filled dicks glass anew and looked at him closely under the stars there was no need that he should bow his head in assent and sayno he is a man butif it should arrive blamest thou  i blame she laughed shrilly who am i that i should blame any oneexcept those who try to cheat me over their consommations but it is very terrible  i must go to suakin think for me a great deal has changed within the year and the men i knew are not here the egyptian lighthouse steamer goes down the canal to suakinand the postboatsbut even then  do not think any longer i know and it is for me to think thou shalt gothou shalt go and see thy friend be wise sit here until the house is a little quieti must attend to my guestsand afterwards go to bed thou shalt go in truth thou shalt go  tomorrow  as soon as may be she was talking as though he were a child  he sat at the table listening to the voices in the harbour and the streets and wondering how soon the end would come till madame binat carried him off to bed and ordered him to sleep the house shouted and sang and danced and revelled madame binat moving through it with one eye on the liquor payments and the girls and the other on dicks interests to this latter end she smiled upon scowling and furtive turkish officers of fellaheen regiments and more than kind to camel agents of no nationality whatever  in the early morning being then appropriately dressed in a flaming red silk balldress with a front of tarnished gold embroidery and a necklace of plateglass diamonds she made chocolate and carried it in to dick  it is only i and i am of discreet age eh drink and eat the roll too thus in france mothers bring their sons when those behave wisely the morning chocolate she sat down on the side of the bed whisperingit is all arranged thou wilt go by the lighthouse boat that is a bribe of ten pounds english the captain is never paid by the government the boat comes to suakin in four days there will go with thee george a greek muleteer another bribe of ten pounds i will pay they must not know of thy money george will go with thee as far as he goes with his mules then he comes back to me for his wellbeloved is here and if i do not receive a telegram from suakin saying that thou art well the girl answers for george  thank you he reached out sleepily for the cup you are much too kind madame  if there were anything that i might do i would say stay here and be wise but i do not think that would be best for thee she looked at her liquorstained dress with a sad smile nay thou shalt go in truth thou shalt go it is best so my boy it is best so  she stooped and kissed dick between the eyes that is for goodmorning she said going away when thou art dressed we will speak to george and make everything ready but first we must open the little trunk give me the keys  the amount of kissing lately has been simply scandalous i shall expect torp to kiss me next he is more likely to swear at me for getting in his way though well it wont last longohe madame help me to my toilette of the guillotine there will be no chance of dressing properly out yonder  he was rummaging among his new campaignkit and rowelling his hands with the spurs there are two says of wearing welloiled anklejacks spotless blue bands khaki coat and breeches and a perfectly pipeclayed helmet the right way is the way of the untired man master of himself setting out upon an expedition well pleased  everything must be very correct dick explained it will become dirty afterwards but now it is good to feel well dressed is everything as it should be  he patted the revolver neatly hidden under the fulness of the blouse on the right hip and fingered his collar  i can do no more madame said between laughing and crying look at thyselfbut i forgot  i am very content he stroked the creaseless spirals of his leggings  now let us go and see the captain and george and the lighthouse boat  be quick madame  but thou canst not be seen by the harbour walking with me in the daylight figure to yourself if some english ladies  there are no english ladies and if there are i have forgotten them  take me there  in spite of this burning impatience it was nearly evening ere the lighthouse boat began to move madame had said a great deal both to george and the captain touching the arrangements that were to be made for dicks benefit very few men who had the honour of her acquaintance cared to disregard madames advice that sort of contempt might end in being knifed by a stranger in a gambling hell upon surprisingly short provocation  for six daystwo of them were wasted in the crowded canalthe little steamer worked her way to suakin where she was to pick up the superintendent of the lighthouse and dick made it his business to propitiate george who was distracted with fears for the safety of his lightoflove and half inclined to make dick responsible for his own discomfort when they arrived george took him under his wing and together they entered the redhot seaport encumbered with the material and wastage of the suakinberger line from locomotives in disconsolate fragments to mounds of chairs and potsleepers  if you keep with me said george nobody will ask for passports or what you do they are all very busy  yes but i should like to hear some of the englishmen talk they might remember me i was known here a long time agowhen i was some one indeed  a long time ago is a very long time ago here the graveyards are full  now listen this new railway runs out so far as tanaielhassanthat is seven miles then there is a camp they say that beyond tanaielhassan the english troops go forward and everything that they require will be brought to them by this line  ah base camp i see thats a better business than fighting fuzzies in the open  for this reason even the mules to up in the irontrain  iron what  it is all covered with iron because it is still being shot at  an armoured train better and better go on faithful george  and i go up with my mules tonight only those who particularly require to go to the camp go out with the train they begin to shoot not far from the city  the dearsthey always used to dick snuffed the smell of parched dust heated iron and flaking paint with delight certainly the old life was welcoming him back most generously  when i have got my mules together i go up tonight but you must first send a telegram of port said declaring that i have done you no harm  madame has you well in hand would you stick a knife into me if you had the chance  i have no chance said the greek she is there with that woman  i see its a bad thing to be divided between love of woman and the chance of loot i sympathise with you george  they went to the telegraphoffice unquestioned for all the world was desperately busy and had scarcely time to turn its head and suakin was the last place under sky that would be chosen for holidayground on their return the voice of an english subaltern asked dick what he was doing the blue goggles were over his eyes and he walked with his hand on georges elbow as he repliedegyptian governmentmules my orders are to give them over to the a  c g at tanaielhassan any occasion to show my papers  oh certainly not i beg your pardon id no right to ask but not seeing your face before i  i go out in the train tonight i suppose said dick boldly there will be no difficulty in loading up the mules will there  you can see the horseplatforms from here you must have them loaded up early the young man went away wondering what sort of brokendown waif this might be who talked like a gentleman and consorted with greek muleteers dick felt unhappy to outface an english officer is no small thing but the bluff loses relish when one plays it from the utter dark and stumbles up and down rough ways thinking and eternally thinking of what might have been if things had fallen out otherwise and all had been as it was not  george shared his meal with dick and went off to the mulelines his charge sat alone in a shed with his face in his hands before his tightshut eyes danced the face of maisie laughing with parted lips there was a great bustle and clamour about him he grew afraid and almost called for george  i say have you got your mules ready it was the voice of the subaltern over his shoulder  my mans looking after them thethe fact is ive a touch of ophthalmia and cant see very well  by jove thats bad you ought to lie up in hospital for a while ive had a turn of it myself its as bad as being blind  so i find it when does this armoured train go  at six oclock it takes an hour to cover the seven miles  are the fuzzies on the rampageeh  about three nights a week fact is im in acting command of the nighttrain it generally runs back empty to tanai for the night  big camp at tanai i suppose  pretty big it has to feed our desertcolumn somehow  is that far off  between thirty and forty milesin an infernal thirsty country  is the country quiet between tanai and our men  more or less i shouldnt care to cross it alone or with a subalterns command for the matter of that but the scouts get through it in some extraordinary fashion  they always did  have you been here before then  i was through most of the trouble when it first broke out  in the service and cashiered was the subalterns first thought so he refrained from putting any questions  theres you man coming up with the mules it seems rather queer  that i should be muleleading said dick  i didnt mean to say so but it is forgive meits beastly impertinence i know but you speak like a man who has been at a public school theres no mistaking the tone  i am a public school man  i thought so i say i dont want to hurt your feelings but youre a little down on your luck arent you i saw you sitting with your head in your hands and thats why i spoke  thanks i am about as thoroughly and completely broke as a man need be  supposei mean im a public school man myself couldnt i perhapstake it as a loan yknow and  youre much too good but on my honour ive as much money as i want   i tell you what you could do for me though and put me under an everlasting obligation let me come into the bogie truck of the train  there is a foretruck isnt there  yes how dyou know  ive been in an armoured train before only let me seehear some of the fun i mean and ill be grateful i go at my own risk as a noncombatant  the young man thought for a minute all right he said were supposed to be an empty train and theres no one to blow me up at the other end  george and a horde of yelling amateur assistants had loaded up the mules and the narrowgauge armoured train plated with threeeighths inch boilerplate till it looked like one long coffin stood ready to start  two bogie trucks running before the locomotive were completely covered in with plating except that the leading one was pierced in front for the muzzle of a machinegun and the second at either side for lateral fire  the trucks together made one long ironvaulted chamber in which a score of artillerymen were rioting  whitechapellast train ah i see yer kissin in the first class there somebody shouted just as dick was clamouring into the forward truck  lordy eres a real live passenger for the kew tanai acton and ealin train echo sir speshul edition star sirshall i get you a footwarmer said another  thanks ill pay my footing said dick and relations of the most amiable were established ere silence came with the arrival of the subaltern and the train jolted out over the rough track  this is an immense improvement on shooting the unimpressionable fuzzy in the open said dick from his place in the corner  oh but hes still unimpressed there he goes said the subaltern as a bullet struck the outside of the truck we always have at least one demonstration against the nighttrain generally they attack the reartruck where my junior commands he gets all the fun of the fair  not tonight though listen said dick a flight of heavyhanded bullets was succeeded by yelling and shouts the children of the desert valued their nightly amusement and the train was an excellent mark  is it worth giving them half a hopper full the subaltern asked of the engine which was driven by a lieutenant of sappers  i should think so this is my section of the line theyll be playing old harry with my permanent way if we dont stop em  right o  hrrmph said the machine gun through all its five noses as the subaltern drew the lever home the empty cartridges clashed on the floor and the smoke blew back through the truck there was indiscriminate firing at the rear of the train and return fire from the darkness without and unlimited howling dick stretched himself on the floor wild with delight at the sounds and the smells  god is very goodi never thought id hear this again give em hell men oh give em hell he cried  the train stopped for some obstruction on the line ahead and a party went out to reconnoitre but came back cursing for spades the children of the desert had piled sand and gravel on the rails and twenty minutes were lost in clearing it away then the slow progress recommenced to be varied with more shots more shoutings the steady clack and kick of the machine guns and a final difficulty with a halflifted rail ere the train came under the protection of the roaring camp at tanaielhassan  now you see why it takes an hour and a half to fetch her through said the subaltern unshipping the cartridgehopper above his pet gun  it was a lark though i only wish it had lasted twice as long how superb it must have looked from outside said dick sighing regretfully  it palls after the first few nights by the way when youve settled about your mules come and see what we can find to eat in my tent im bennil of the gunnersin the artillery linesand mind you dont fall over my tentropes in the dark  but it was all dark to dick he could only smell the camels the haybales the cooking the smoky fires and the tanned canvas of the tents as he stood where he had dropped from the train shouting for george there was a sound of lighthearted kicking on the iron skin of the rear trucks with squealing and grunting george was unloading the mules  the engine was blowing off steam nearly in dicks ear a cold wind of the desert danced between his legs he was hungry and felt tired and dirtyso dirty that he tried to brush his coat with his hands that was a hopeless job he thrust his hands into his pockets and began to count over the many times that he had waited in strange or remote places for trains or camels mules or horses to carry him to his business in those days he could seefew men more clearlyand the spectacle of an armed camp at dinner under the stare was an ever fresh pleasure to the eye there was colour light and motion without which no man has much pleasure in living this night there remained for him only one more journey through the darkness that never lifts to tell a man how far he has travelled then he would grip torpenhows hand againtorpenhow who was alive and strong and lived in the midst of the action that had once made the reputation of a man called dick heldar not in the least to be confused with the blind bewildered vagabond who seemed to answer to the same name yes he would find torpenhow and come as near to the old life as might be afterwards he would forget everything bessie who had wrecked the melancolia and so nearly wrecked his life beeton who lived in a strange unreal city full of tintacks and gasplugs and matters that no men needed that irrational being who had offered him love and loyalty for nothing but had not signed her name and most of all maisie who from her own point of view was undeniably right in all she did but oh at this distance so tantalisingly fair  georges hand on his arm pulled him back to the situation  and what now said george  oh yes of course what now take me to the camelmen take me to where the scouts sit when they come in from the desert they sit by their camels and the camels eat grain out of a black blanket held up at the corners and the men eat by their side just like camels take me there  the camp was rough and rutty and dick stumbled many times over the stumps of scrub the scouts were sitting by their beasts as dick knew they would the light of the dungfires flickered on their bearded faces and the camels bubbled and mumbled beside them at rest it was no part of dicks policy to go into the desert with a convoy of supplies that would lead to impertinent questions and since a blind noncombatant is not needed at the front he would probably be forced to return to suakin  he must go up alone and go immediately  now for one last bluffthe biggest of all he said peace be with you brethren the watchful george steered him to the circle of the nearest fire the heads of the camelsheiks bowed gravely and the camels scenting a european looked sideways curiously like brooding hens half ready to get to their feet  a beast and a driver to go to the fighting line tonight said dick  a mulaid said a voice scornfully naming the best baggagebreed that he knew  a bisharin returned dick with perfect gravity a bisharin without saddlegalls therefore no charge of thine shockhead  two or three minutes passed thenwe be kneehaltered for the night there is no going out from the camp  not for money  hm ah english money  another depressing interval of silence  how much  twentyfive pounds english paid into the hand of the driver at my journeys end and as much more into the hand of the camelsheik here to be paid when the driver returns  this was royal payment and the sheik who knew that he would get his commission on this deposit stirred in dicks behalf  for scarcely one nights journeyfifty pounds land and wells and good trees and wives to make a man content for the rest of his days who speaks said dick  i said a voice i will gobut there is no going from the camp  fool i know that a camel can break his kneehalter and the sentries do not fire if one goes in chase twentyfive pounds and another twentyfive pounds but the beast must be a good bisharin i will take no baggagecamel  then the bargaining began and at the end of half an hour the first deposit was paid over to the sheik who talked in low tones to the driver  dick heard the latter say a little way out only any baggagebeast will serve am i a fool to waste my cattle for a blind man  and though i cannot seedick lifted his voice a littleyet i carry that which has six eyes and the driver will sit before me if we do not reach the english troops in the dawn he will be dead  but where in gods name are the troops  unless thou knowest let another man ride dost thou know remember it will be life or death to thee  i know said the driver sullenly stand back from my beast i am going to slip him  not so swiftly george hold the camels head a moment i want to feel his cheek the hands wandered over the hide till they found the branded halfcircle that is the mark of the biharin the lightbuilt ridingcamel  that is well cut this one loose remember no blessing of god comes on those who try to cheat the blind  the men chuckled by the fires at the cameldrivers discomfiture he had intended to substitute a slow saddlegalled baggagecolt  stand back one shouted lashing the biharin under the belly with a quirt dick obeyed as soon as he felt the nosestring tighten in his handand a cry went up illaha aho he is loose  with a roar and a grunt the biharin rose to his feet and plunged forward toward the desert his driver following with shouts and lamentation  george caught dicks arm and hurried him stumbling and tripping past a disgusted sentry who was used to stampeding camels  whats the row now he cried  every stitch of my kit on that blasted dromedary dick answered after the manner of a common soldier  go on and take care your throats not cut out sideyou and your dromedarys  the outcries ceased when the camel had disappeared behind a hillock and his driver had called him back and made him kneel down  mount first said dick then climbing into the second seat and gently screwing the pistol muzzle into the small of his companions back go on in gods name and swiftly goodbye george remember me to madame and have a good time with your girl get forward child of the pit  a few minutes later he was shut up in a great silence hardly broken by the creaking of the saddle and the soft pad of the tireless feet dick adjusted himself comfortably to the rock and pitch of the pace girthed his belt tighter and felt the darkness slide past for an hour he was conscious only of the sense of rapid progress  a good camel he said at last  he was never underfed he is my own and clean bred the driver replied  go on  his head dropped on his chest and he tried to think but the tenor of his thoughts was broken because he was very sleepy in the half doze in seemed that he was learning a punishment hymn at mrs jennetts he had committed some crime as bad as sabbathbreaking and she had locked him up in his bedroom but he could never repeat more than the first two lines of the hymn  when israel of the lord believed out of the land of bondage came  he said them over and over thousands of times the driver turned in the saddle to see if there were any chance of capturing the revolver and ending the ride dick roused struck him over the head with the butt and stormed himself wide awake somebody hidden in a clump of camelthorn shouted as the camel toiled up rising ground a shot was fired and the silence shut down again bringing the desire to sleep dick could think no longer he was too tired and stiff and cramped to do more than nod uneasily from time to time waking with a start and punching the driver with the pistol  is there a moon he asked drowsily  she is near her setting  i wish that i could see her halt the camel at least let me hear the desert talk  the man obeyed out of the utter stillness came one breath of wind it rattled the dead leaves of a shrub some distance away and ceased a handful of dry earth detached itself from the edge of a rail trench and crumbled softly to the bottom  go on the night is very cold  those who have watched till the morning know how the last hour before the light lengthens itself into many eternities it seemed to dick that he had never since the beginning of original darkness done anything at all save jolt through the air once in a thousand years he would finger the nailheads on the saddlefront and count them all carefully centuries later he would shift his revolver from his right hand to his left and allow the eased arm to drop down at his side from the safe distance of london he was watching himself thus employedwatching critically yet whenever he put out his hand to the canvas that he might paint the tawny yellow desert under the glare of the sinking moon the black shadow of a camel and the two bowed figures atop that hand held a revolver and the arm was numbed from wrist to collarbone moreover he was in the dark and could see no canvas of any kind whatever  the driver grunted and dick was conscious of a change in the air  i smell the dawn he whispered  it is here and yonder are the troops have i done well  the camel stretched out its neck and roared as there came down wind the pungent reek of camels in the square  go on we must get there swiftly go on  they are moving in their camp there is so much dust that i cannot see what they do  am i in better case go forward  they could hear the hum of voices ahead the howling and the bubbling of the beasts and the hoarse cries of the soldiers girthing up for the day  two or three shots were fired  is that at us surely they can see that i am english dick spoke angrily  nay it is from the desert the driver answered cowering in his saddle  go forward my child well it is that the dawn did not uncover us an hour ago  the camel headed straight for the column and the shots behind multiplied the children of the desert had arranged that most uncomfortable of surprises a dawn attack for the english troops and were getting their distance by snapshots at the only moving object without the square  what luck what stupendous and imperial luck said dick its just before the battle mother oh god has been most good to me  onlythe agony of the thought made him screw up his eyes for an instantmaisie  allahu we are in said the man as he drove into the rearguard and the camel knelt  who the deuce are you despatches or what whats the strength of the enemy behind that ridge how did you get through asked a dozen voices for all answer dick took a long breath unbuckled his belt and shouted from the saddle at the top of a wearied and dusty voice torpenhow ohe torp cooee torpenhow  a bearded man raking in the ashes of a fire for a light to his pipe moved very swiftly towards that cry as the rearguard facing about began to fire at the puffs of smoke from the hillocks around gradually the scattered white cloudlets drew out into the long lines of banked white that hung heavily in the stillness of the dawn before they turned over wavelike and glided into the valleys the soldiers in the square were coughing and swearing as their own smoke obstructed their view and they edged forward to get beyond it a wounded camel leaped to its feet and roared aloud the cry ending in a bubbling grunt some one had cut its throat to prevent confusion then came the thick sob of a man receiving his deathwound from a bullet then a yell of agony and redoubled firing  there was no time to ask any questions  get down man get down behind the camel  no put me i pray in the forefront of the battle dick turned his face to torpenhow and raised his hand to set his helmet straight but miscalculating the distance knocked it off torpenhow saw that his hair was gray on the temples and that his face was the face of an old man  come down you damned fool dickie come off  and dick came obediently but as a tree falls pitching sideways from the bisharins saddle at torpenhows feet his luck had held to the last even to the crowning mercy of a kindly bullet through his head  torpenhow knelt under the lee of the camel with dicks body in his arms
