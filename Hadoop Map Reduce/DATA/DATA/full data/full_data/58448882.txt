missed              woe betide thee nag  this is the story of the great war that rikkitikkitavi fought singlehanded through the bathrooms of the big bungalow in segowlee cantonment darzee the tailorbird helped him and chuchundra the muskrat who never comes out into the middle of the floor but always creeps round by the wall gave him advice but rikkitikki did the real fighting  he was a mongoose rather like a little cat in his fur and his tail but quite like a weasel in his head and habits his eyes and the end of his restless nose were pink he could scratch himself anywhere he pleased with any leg front or back that he chose to use he could fluff up his tail till it looked like a bottlebrush and his warcry as he scuttled through the long grass was rikktikktikkitikkitchk  one day a high summer flood washed him out of the burrow where he lived with his father and mother and carried him kicking and clucking down a roadside ditch he found a little wisp of grass floating there and clung to it till he lost his senses when he revived he was lying in the hot sun on the middle of a garden path very draggled indeed and a small boy was saying heres a dead mongoose lets have a funeral  no said his mother lets take him in and dry him perhaps he isnt really dead  they took him into the house and a big man picked him up between his finger and thumb and said he was not dead but half choked so they wrapped him in cottonwool and warmed him and he opened his eyes and sneezed  now said the big man he was an englishman who had just moved into the bungalow dont frighten him and well see what hell do  it is the hardest thing in the world to frighten a mongoose because he is eaten up from nose to tail with curiosity the motto of all the mongoose family is run and find out and rikkitikki was a true mongoose he looked at the cottonwool decided that it was not good to eat ran all round the table sat up and put his fur in order scratched himself and jumped on the small boys shoulder  dont be frightened teddy said his father thats his way of making friends  ouch hes tickling under my chin said teddy  rikkitikki looked down between the boys collar and neck snuffed at his ear and climbed down to the floor where he sat rubbing his nose  good gracious said teddys mother and thats a wild creature i suppose hes so tame because weve been kind to him  all mongooses are like that said her husband if teddy doesnt pick him up by the tail or try to put him in a cage  hell run in and out of the house all day long lets give him something to eat  they gave him a little piece of raw meat rikki tikki liked it immensely and when it was finished he went out into the verandah and sat in the sunshine and fluffed up his fur to make it dry to the roots then he felt better  there are more things to find out about in this house he said to himself than all my family could find out in all their lives i shall certainly stay and find out  he spent all that day roaming over the house he nearly drowned himself in the bath tubs put his nose into the ink on a writingtable and burnt it on the end of the big mans cigar for he climbed up in the big mans lap to see how writing was done at nightfall he ran into teddys nursery to watch how the kerosenelamps were lighted and when teddy went to bed rikkitikki climbed up too but he was a restless companion because he had to get up and attend to every noise all through the night and find out what made it teddys mother and father came in the last thing to look at their boy and rikkitikki was awake on the pillow i dont like that said teddys mother he may bite the child hell do no such thing said the father teddys safer with that little beast than if he had a bloodhound to watch him if a snake came into the nursery now  but teddys mother wouldnt think of anything so awful  early in the morning rikkitikki came to early breakfastin the verandah riding on teddys shoulder and they gave him banana and some boiled egg and he sat on all their laps one after the other because every wellbroughtup mongoose always hopes to be a housemongoose some day and have rooms to run about in and rikkitikkis mother she used to live in the generals house at segowlee had carefully told rikki what to do if ever he came across white men  then rikkitikki went out into the garden to see what was to be seen it was a large garden only half cultivated with bushes as big as summerhouses of marshal niel roses lime and orange trees clumps of bamboos and thickets of high grass rikkitikki licked his lips this is a splendid huntingground he said and his tail grew bottlebrushy at the thought of it and he scuttled up and down the garden snuffing here and there till he heard very sorrowful voices in a thornbush  it was darzee the tailorbird and his wife they had made a beautiful nest by pulling two big leaves together and stitching them up the edges with fibres and had filled the hollow with cotton and downy fluff the nest swayed to and fro as they sat on the rim and cried  what is the matter asked rikkitikki  we are very miserable said darzee one of our babies fell out of the nest yesterday and nag ate him  hm said rikkitikki that is very sadbut i am a stranger here who is nag  darzee and his wife only cowered down in the nest without answering for from the thick grass at the foot of the bush there came a low hissa horrid cold sound that made rikkitikki jump back two clear feet then inch by inch out of the grass rose up the head and spread hood of nag the big black cobra and he was five feet long from tongue to tail when he had lifted onethird of himself clear of the ground he stayed balancing to and fro exactly as a dandeliontuft balances in the wind and he looked at rikkitikki with the wicked snakes eyes that never change their expression whatever the snake may be thinking of  who is nag said he i am nag the great god brahm put his mark upon all our people when the first cobra spread his hood to keep the sun off brahm as he slept look and be afraid  he spread out his hood more than ever and rikkitikki saw the spectaclemark on the back of it that looks exactly like the eye part of a hookandeye fastening he was afraid for the minute but it is impossible for a mongoose to stay frightened for any length of time and though rikkitikki had never met a live cobra before his mother had fed him on dead ones and he knew that all a grown mongooses business in life was to fight and eat snakes nag knew that too and at the bottom of his cold heart he was afraid  well said rikkitikki and his tail began to fluff up again marks or no marks do you think it is right for you to eat fledglings out of a nest  nag was thinking to himself and watching the least little movement in the grass behind rikkitikki he knew that mongooses in the garden meant death sooner or later for him and his family but he wanted to get rikkitikki off his guard so he dropped his head a little and put it on one side  let us talk he said you eat eggs why should not i eat birds  behind you look behind you sang darzee  rikkitikki knew better than to waste time in staring he jumped up in the air as high as he could go and just under him whizzed by the head of nagaina nags wicked wife she had crept up behind him as he was talking to make an end of him and he heard her savage hiss as the stroke missed he came down almost across her back and if he had been an old mongoose he would have known that then was the time to break her back with one bite but he was afraid of the terrible lashing returnstroke of the cobra he bit indeed but did not bite long enough and he jumped clear of the whisking tail leaving nagaina torn and angry  wicked wicked darzee said nag lashing up as high as he could reach toward the nest in the thornbush but darzee had built it out of reach of snakes and it only swayed to and fro  rikkitikki felt his eyes growing red and hot when a mongooses eyes grow red he is angry and he sat back on his tail and hind legs like a little kangaroo and looked all round him and chattered with rage but nag and nagaina had disappeared into the grass when a snake misses its stroke it never says anything or gives any sign of what it means to do next rikkitikki did not care to follow them for he did not feel sure that he could manage two snakes at once so he trotted off to the gravel path near the house and sat down to think it was a serious matter for him  if you read the old books of natural history you will find they say that when the mongoose fights the snake and happens to get bitten he runs off and eats some herb that cures him that is not true the victory is only a matter of quickness of eye and quickness of footsnakes blow against mongooses jumpand as no eye can follow the motion of a snakes head when it strikes that makes things much more wonderful than any magic herb rikkitikki knew he was a young mongoose and it made him all the more pleased to think that he had managed to escape a blow from behind it gave him confidence in himself and when teddy came running down the path rikkitikki was ready to be petted  but just as teddy was stooping something flinched a little in the dust and a tiny voice said be careful i am death it was karait the dusty brown snakeling that lies for choice on the dusty earth and his bite is as dangerous as the cobras but he is so small that nobody thinks of him and so he does the more harm to people  rikkitikkis eyes grew red again and he danced up to karait with the peculiar rocking swaying motion that he had inherited from his family it looks very funny but it is so perfectly balanced a gait that you can fly off from it at any angle you please and in dealing with snakes this is an advantage if rikkitikki had only known he was doing a much more dangerous thing than fighting nag for karait is so small and can turn so quickly that unless rikki bit him close to the back of the head he would get the returnstroke in his eye or lip but rikki did not know his eyes were all red and he rocked back and forth looking for a good place to hold karait struck out rikki jumped sideways and tried to run in but the wicked little dusty gray head lashed within a fraction of his shoulder and he had to jump over the body and the head followed his heels close  teddy shouted to the house oh look here our mongoose is killing a snake and rikkitikki heard a scream from teddys mother his father ran out with a stick but by the time he came up karait had lunged out once too far and rikkitikki had sprung jumped on the snakes back dropped his head far between his forelegs bitten as high up the back as he could get hold and rolled away that bite paralysed karait and rikkitikki was just going to eat him up from the tail after the custom of his family at dinner when he remembered that a full meal makes a slow mongoose and if he wanted all his strength and quickness ready he must keep himself thin  he went away for a dustbath under the castoroil bushes while teddys father beat the dead karait what is the use of that thought rikkitikki i have settled it all and then teddys mother picked him up from the dust and hugged him crying that he had saved teddy from death and teddys father said that he was a providence and teddy looked on with big scared eyes rikkitikki was rather amused at all the fuss which of course he did not understand teddys mother might just as well have petted teddy for playing in the dust rikki was thoroughly enjoying himself  that night at dinner walking to and fro among the wineglasses on the table he could have stuffed himself three times over with nice things but he remembered nag and nagaina and though it was very pleasant to be patted and petted by teddys mother and to sit on teddys shoulder his eyes would get red from time to time and he would go off into his long war cry of rikktikktikkitikkitchk  teddy carried him off to bed and insisted on rikkitikki sleeping under his chin rikkitikki was too well bred to bite or scratch but as soon as teddy was asleep he went off for his nightly walk round the house and in the dark he ran up against chuchundra the muskrat creeping round by the wall chuchundra is a brokenhearted little beast he whimpers and cheeps all the night trying to make up his mind to run into the middle of the room but he never gets there  dont kill me said chuchundra almost weeping rikkitikki dont kill me  do you  think a snakekiller kills muskrats said rikkitikki scornfully  those who kill snakes get killed by snakes said chuchundra more sorrowfully than ever and how am i to be sure that nag wont mistake me for you some dark night  theres not the least danger said rikkitikki but nag is in the garden and i know you dont go there  my cousin chua the rat told me said chuchundra and then he stopped  told you what  hsh nag is everywhere rikkitikki you should have talked to chua in the garden  i didntso you must tell me quick chuchundra or ill bite you  chuchundra sat down and cried till the tears rolled off his whiskers i am a very poor man he sobbed i never had spirit enough to run out into the middle of the room hsh i mustnt tell you anything cant you hear rikkitikki  rikkitikki listened the house was as still as still but he thought he could just catch the faintest scratchscratch in the worlda noise as faint as that of a wasp walking on a windowpanethe dry scratch of a snakes scales on brickwork  thats nag or nagaina he said to himself and hes crawling into the bathroom sluice youre right chuchundra i should have talked to chua  he stole off to teddys bathroom but there was nothing there and then to teddys mothers bathroom at the bottom of the smooth plaster wall there was a brick pulled out to make a sluice for the bathwater and as rikkitikki stole in by the masonry curb where the bath is put he heard nag and nagaina whispering together outside in the moonlight  when the house is emptied of people said nagaina to her husband he will have to go away and then the garden will be our own again go in quietly and remember that the big man who killed karait is the first one to bite then come out and tell me and we will hunt for rikkitikki together  but are you sure that there is anything to be gained by killing the people said nag  everything when there were no people in the bungalow did we have any mongoose in the garden so long as the bungalow is empty we are king and queen of the garden and remember that as soon as our eggs in the melonbed hatch as they may tomorrow our children will need room and quiet  i had not thought of that said nag i will go but there is no need that we should hunt for rikkitikki afterward i will kill the big man and his wife and the child if i can and come away quietly then the bungalow will be empty and rikkitikki will go  rikkitikki tingled all over with rage and hatred at this and then nags head came through the sluice and his five feet of cold body followed it angry as he was rikkitikki was very frightened as he saw the size of the big cobra nag coiled himself up raised his head and looked into the bathroom in the dark and rikki could see his eyes glitter  now if i kill him here nagaina will know and if i fight him on the open floor the odds are in his favour what am i to do said rikkitikkitavi  nag waved to and fro and then rikkitikki heard him drinking from the biggest waterjar that was used to fill the bath that is good said the snake now when karait was killed the big man had a stick he may have that stick still but when he comes in to bathe in the morning he will not have a stick i shall wait here till he comes nagainado you hear mei shall wait here in the cool till daytime  there was no answer from outside so rikkitikki knew nagaina had gone away nag coiled himself down coil by coil round the bulge at the bottom of the waterjar and rikkitikki stayed still as death after an hour he began to move muscle by muscle toward the jar nag was asleep and rikkitikki looked at his big back wondering which would be the best place for a good hold if i dont break his back at the first jump said rikki he can still fight and if he fightso rikki he looked at the thickness of the neck below the hood but that was too much for him and a bite near the tail would only make nag savage  it must be the head he said at last the head above the hood and when i am once there i must not let go  then he jumped the head was lying a little clear of the waterjar under the curve of it and as his teeth met rikki braced his back against the bulge of the red earthenrare to hold down the head this gave him just one seconds purchase and he made the most of it then he was battered to and fro as a rat is shaken by a dogto and fro on the floor up and down and round in great circles at his eyes were red and he held on as the body cartwhipped over the floor upsetting the tin dipper and the soapdish and the fleshbrush and banged against the tin side of the bath as he held he closed his jaws tighter and tighter for he made sure he would be banged to death and for the honour of his family preferred to be found with his teeth locked he was dizzy aching and felt shaken to pieces when something went off like a thunderclap just behind him a hot wind knocked him senseless and red fire singed his fur the man had been wakened by the noise and had fired both barrels of a shotgun into nag just behind the hood  rikkitikki held on with his eyes shut for now he was quite sure he was dead but the head did not move and the big man picked him up and said its the mongoose again alice the little chap has saved our lives now then teddys mother came in with a very white face and saw what was left of nag and rikkitikki dragged himself teddys bedroom and spent half the rest of the night shaking  himself tenderly to find out whether he really broken into forty pieces as he fancied  when morning came he was very stiff but well pleased with his doings now i have nagaina to settle with and she will be worse than five nags and theres no knowing when the eggs she spoke of will hatch goodness i must go and see darzee he said  without waiting for breakfast rikkitikki ran to the thornbush where darzee was singing a song of triumph at the top of his voice the news of nags death was all over the garden for the sweeper had thrown the body on the rubbishheap  oh you stupid tuft of feathers said rikkitikki angrily is this the time to sing  nag is deadis deadis dead sang darzee the valiant rikkitikki caught him by the head and held fast the big man brought the bangstick and nag fell in two pieces he will never eat my babies again  all thats true enough but wheres nagaina said rikkitikki looking carefully round him  nagaina came to the bathroom sluice and called for nag darzee went on and nag came out on the end of a stickthe sweeper picked him up on the end of a stick and threw him upon the rubbishheap let us sing about the great the redeyed rikkitikki and darzee filled his throat and sang  if i could get up to your nest id roll all your babies out said rikkitikki you dont know when to do the right thing at the right time youre safe enough in your nest there but its war for me down here stop singing a minute darzee  for the great the beautiful rikkitikkis sake i will stop said darzee what is it o killer of the terrible nag  where is nagaina for the third time  on the rubbishheap by the stables mourning for nag great is rikkitikki with the white teeth  bother my white teeth have you ever heard where she keeps her eggs  in the melonbed on the end nearest the wall where the sun strikes nearly all day she hid them three weeks ago  and you never thought it worth while to tell me the end nearest the wall you said  rikkitikki you are not going to eat her eggs  not eat exactly no darzee if you have a grain of sense you will fly off to the stables and pretend that your wing is broken and let nagaina chase you away to this bush i must get to the melonbed and if i went there now shed see me  darzee was a featherbrained little fellow who could never hold more than one idea at a time in his head and just because he knew that nagainas children were born in eggs like his own he didnt think at first that it was fair to kill them but his wife was a sensible bird and she knew that cobras eggs meant young cobras later on so she flew off from the nest and left darzee to keep the babies warm and continue his song about the death of nag darzee was very like a man in some ways  she fluttered in front of nagaina by the rubbishheap and cried out oh my wing is broken the boy in the house threw a stone at me and broke it then she fluttered more desperately than ever  nagaina lifted up her head and hissed you warned rikkitikki when i would have killed him indeed and truly youve chosen a bad place to be lame in and she moved toward darzees wife slipping along over the dust  the boy broke it with a stone shrieked darzees wife  well it may be some consolation to you when youre dead to know that i shall settle accounts with the boy my husband lies on the rubbishheap this morning but before night the boy in the house will lie very still what is the use of running away i am sure to catch you little fool look at me  darzees wife knew better than to do that for a bird who looks at a snakes eyes gets so frightened that she cannot move darzees wife fluttered on piping sorrowfully and never leaving the ground and nagaina quickened her pace  rikkitikki heard them going up the path from the stables and he raced for the end of the melonpatch near the wall there in the warm litter about the melons very cunningly hidden he found twentyfive eggs about the size of a bantams eggs but with whitish skin instead of shell  i was not a day too soon he said for he could see the baby cobras curled up inside the skin and he knew that the minute they were hatched they could each kill a man or a mongoose he bit off the tops of the eggs as fast as he could taking care to crush the young cobras and turned over the litter from time to time to see whether he had missed any at last there were only three eggs left and rikkitikki began to chuckle to himself when he heard darzees wife screaming  rikkitikki i led nagaina toward the house and she has gone into the verandah andoh come quicklyshe means killing  rikkitikki smashed two eggs and tumbled backward down the melonbed with the third egg in his mouth and scuttled to the verandah as hard as he could put foot to the ground teddy and his mother and father were there at early breakfast but rikkitikki saw that they were not eating anything they sat stonestill and their faces were white nagaina was coiled up on the matting by teddys chair within easy striking distance of teddys bare leg and she was swaying to and fro singing a song of triumph  son of the big man that killed nag she hissed stay still i am not ready yet wait a little keep very still all you three if you move i strike and if you do not move i strike oh foolish people who killed my nag  teddys eyes were fixed on his father and all his father could do was to whisper sit still teddy you mustnt move teddy keep still  then rikkitikki came up and cried turn round nagaina turn and fight  all in good time said she without moving her eyes i will settle my account with you presently look at your friends rikkitikki they are still and white they are afraid they dare not move and if you come a step nearer i strike  look at your eggs said rikkitikki in the melonbed near the wall go and look nagaina  the big snake turned half round and saw the egg on the verandah ahh give it to me she said  rikkitikki put his paws one on each side of the egg and his eyes were bloodred what price for a snakes egg for a young cobra for a young kingcobra for the lastthe very last of the brood the ants are eating all the others down by the melonbed  nagaina spun clear round forgetting everything for the sake of the one egg and rikkitikki saw teddys father shoot out a big hand catch teddy by the shoulder and drag him across the little table with the teacups safe and out of reach of nagaina  tricked tricked tricked rikktcktck chuckled rikkitikki the boy is safe and it was iii that caught nag by the hood last night in the bathroom then he began to jump up and down all four feet together his head close to the floor he threw me to and fro but he could not shake me off he was dead before the big man blew him in two i did it rikkitikkitcktck come then nagaina come and fight with me you shall not be a widow long  nagaina saw that she had lost her chance of killing teddy and the egg lay between rikkitikkis paws give me the egg rikkitikki give me the last of my eggs and i will go away and never come back she said lowering her hood  yes you will go away and you will never come back for you will go to the rubbishheap with nag fight widow the big man has gone for his gun fight  rikkitikki was bounding all round nagaina keeping just out of reach of her stroke his little eyes like hot coals nagaina gathered herself together and flung out at him rikkitikki jumped up and backward again and again and again she struck and each time her head came with a whack on the matting of the verandah and she gathered herself together like a watchspring then rikkitikki danced in a circle to get behind her and nagaina spun round to keep her head to his head so that the rustle of her tail on the matting sounded like dry leaves blown along by the wind  he had forgotten the egg it still lay on the verandah and nagaina came nearer and nearer to it till at last while rikkitikki was drawing breath she caught it in her mouth turned to the verandah steps and flew like an arrow down the path with rikkitikki behind her when the cobra runs for her life she goes like a whiplash flicked across a horses neck  rikkitikki knew that he must catch her or all the trouble would begin again she headed straight for the long grass by the thornbush and as he was running rikkitikki heard darzee still singing his foolish little song of triumph but darzees wife was wiser she flew off her nest as nagaina came along and flapped her wings about nagainas head if darzee had helped they might have turned her but nagaina only lowered her hood and went on still the instants delay brought rikkitikki up to her and as she plunged into the rathole where she and nag used to live his little white teeth were clenched on her tail and he went down with herand very few mongooses however wise and old they may be care to follow a cobra into its hole it was dark in the hole and rikkitikki never knew when it might open out and give nagaina room to turn and strike at him he held on savagely and struck out his feet to act as brakes on the dark slope of the hot moist earth  then the grass by the mouth of the hole stopped waving and darzee said it is all over with rikkitikki we must sing his deathsong valiant rikkitikki is dead for nagaina will surely kill him underground  so he sang a very mournful song that he made up on the spur of the minute and just as he got to the most touching part the grass quivered again and rikkitikki covered with dirt dragged himself out of the hole leg by leg licking his whiskers darzee stopped with a little shout rikkitikki shook some of the dust out of his fur and sneezed it is all over he said the widow will never come out again and the red ants that live between the grass stems heard him and began to troop down one after another to see if he had spoken the truth  rikkitikki curled himself up in the grass and slept where he wasslept and slept till it was late in the afternoon for he had done a hard days work  now he said when he awoke i will go back to the house tell the coppersmith darzee and he will tell the garden that nagaina is dead  the coppersmith is a bird who makes a noise exactly like the beating of a little hammer on a copper pot and the reason he is always making it is because he is the towncrier to every indian garden and tells all the news to everybody who cares to listen as rikkitikki went up the path he heard his attention notes like a tiny dinnergong and then the steady dingdonglock nag is deaddong nagaina is dead dingdongtock that set all the birds in the garden singing and the frogs croaking for nag and nagaina used to eat frogs as well as little birds  when rikki got to the house teddy and teddys mother she looked very white still for she had been fainting and teddys father came out and almost cried over him and that night he ate all that was given him till he could i eat no more and went to bed on teddys shoulder where teddys mother saw him when she came to look late at night  he saved our lives and teddys life she said to her husband just think he saved all our lives  rikkitikki woke up with a jump for all the mongooses are light sleepers  oh its you said he what are you bothering for all the cobras are dead and if they werent im here  rikkitikki had a right to be proud of himself but he did not grow too proud and he kept that garden as a mongoose should keep it with tooth and jump and spring and bite till never a cobra dared show its head inside the walls     darzees chaunt   sung in honour of rikkitikkitavi          singer and tailor am i           doubled the joys that i know

chairrests it was a hot dark breathless evening heavy with the smell of the newlywatered mall the flowers in the club gardens were dead and black on their stalks the little lotuspond was a circle of caked mud and the tamarisktrees were white with the dust of days most of the men were at the bandstand in the public gardensfrom the club verandah you could hear the native police band hammering stale waltzesor on the pologround or in the highwalled fivescourt hotter than a dutch oven half a dozen grooms squatted at the heads of their ponies waited their masters return from time to time a man would ride at a footpace into the club compound and listlessly loaf over to the whitewashed barracks beside the main building these were supposed to be chambers men lived in them meeting the same faces night after night at dinner and drawing out their officework till the latest possible hour that they might escape that doleful company  what are you going to do said martyn with a yawn lets have a

go under the operation of the famine code ek dum theyve put jimmy hawkins in charge  good business said scott with the first sign of interest he had shown when in doubt hire a punjabi i worked under jimmy when i first came out and he belonged to the punjab he has more bundobust than most men  jimmys a jubilee knight now said martyn he was a good chap even though he is a thriceborn civilian and went to the benighted presidency what unholy names these madras districts rejoice inall ungas or rungas or pillays or polliums  a dogcart drove up and a man entered mopping his head he was editor of the one daily paper at the capital of a province of twentyfive million natives and a few hundred white men and as his staff was limited to himself and one assistant his office hours ran variously from ten to twenty a day  hi raines youre supposed to know everything said martyn stopping him hows this madras scarcity going to turn out  no one knows as yet theres a message as long as your arm coming in on the telephone ive left my cub to fill it out madras has owned she cant manage it alone and jimmy seems to have a free hand in getting all the men he needs arbuthnots warned to hold himself in readiness  badger arbuthnot  the peshawur chap yes and the pi wires that ellis and clay have been moved from the northwest already and theyve taken half a dozen bombay men too its pukka famine by the looks of it  theyre nearer the scene of action than we are but if it comes to indenting on the punjab this early theres more in this than meets the eye said martyn  here today and gone tomorrow didnt come to stay for ever said scott dropping one of marryats novels and rising to his feet martyn your sisters waiting for you  a rough gray horse was backing and shifting at the edge of the verandah where the light of a kerosenelamp fell on a brown calico habit and a white face under a gray felt hat  right o said martyn im ready better come and dine with us if youve nothing to do scott william is there any dinner in the house  ill go home first and see was the riders answer you can drive him overat eight remember  scott moved leisurely to his room and changed into the eveningdress of the season and the country spotless white linen from head to foot with a broad silk cummerbund dinner at the martyns was a decided improvement on the goatmutton twineytough fowl and tinned entrees of the club but it was a great pity martyn could not afford to send his sister to the hills for the hot weather as an acting district superintendent of police martyn drew the magnificent pay of six hundred depreciated silver rupees a month and his little fourroomed bungalow said just as much there were the usual blueandwhite striped jailmade rugs on the uneven floor the usual glass studded amritsar phulkaris draped to nails driven into the flaking whitewash of the walls the usual halfdozen chairs that did not match picked up at sales of dead mens effects and the usual streaks of black grease where the leather punkathong ran through the wall it was as though everything had been unpacked the night before to be repacked next morning not a door in the house was true on its hinges the little windows fifteen feet up were darkened with waspnests and lizards hunted flies between the beams of the woodceiled roof but all this was part of scotts life thus did people live who had such an income and in a land where each mans pay age and position are printed in a book that all may read it is hardly worth while to play at pretences in word or deed scott counted eight years service in the irrigation department and drew eight hundred rupees a month on the understanding that if he served the state faithfully for another twentytwo years he could retire on a pension of some four hundred rupees a month his working life which had been spent chiefly under canvas or in temporary shelters where a man could sleep eat and write letters was bound up with the opening and guarding of irrigation canals the handling of two or three thousand workmen of all castes and creeds and the payment of vast sums of coined silver he had finished that spring not without credit the last section of the great mosuhl canal andmuch against his will for he hated office workhad been sent in to serve during the hot weather on the accounts and supply side of the department with sole charge of the sweltering suboffice at the capital of the province martyn knew this william his sister knew it and everybody knew it  scott knew too as well as the rest of the world that miss martyn had come out to india four years before to keep house for her brother who as everyone again knew had borrowed the money to pay for her passage and that she ought as all the world said to have married long ago instead of this she had refused some half a dozen subalterns a civilian twenty years her senior one major and a man in the indian medical department this too was common property she had stayed down three hot weathers as the saying is because her brother was in debt and could not afford the expense of her keep at even a cheap hillstation therefore her face was white as bone and in the centre of her forehead was a big silvery scar about the size of a shillingthe mark of a delhi sore which is the same as a bagdad date this comes from drinking bad water and slowly eats into the flesh till it is ripe enough to be burned out with acids  none the less william had enjoyed herself hugely in her four years twice she had been nearly drowned while fording a river on horseback once she had been run away with on a camel had witnessed a midnight attack of thieves on her brothers camp had seen justice administered with long sticks in the open under trees could speak urdu and even rough punjabi with a fluency that was envied by her seniors had altogether fallen out of the habit of writing to her aunts in england or cutting the pages of the english magazines had been through a very bad cholera year seeing sights unfit to be told and had wound up her experiences by six weeks of typhoid fever during which her head had been shaved and hoped to keep her twentythird birthday that september it is conceivable that her aunts would not have approved of a girl who never set foot on the ground if a horse were within hail who rode to dances with a shawl thrown over her skirt who wore her hair cropped and curling all over her head who answered indifferently to the name of william or bill whose speech was heavy with the flowers of the vernacular who could act in amateur theatricals play on the banjo rule eight servants and two horses their accounts and their diseases and look men slowly and deliberately between the eyesyea after they had proposed to her and been rejected  i like men who do things she had confided to a man in the educational department who was teaching the sons of cloth merchants and dyers the beauty of wordsworths excursion in annotated crambooks and when he grew poetical william explained that she didnt understand poetry very much it made her head ache and another broken heart took refuge at the club but it was all williams fault she delighted in hearing men talk of their own work and that is the most fatal way of bringing a man to your feet  scott had known her more or less for some three years meeting her as a rule under canvas when his camp and her brothers joined for a day on the edge of the indian desert he had danced with her several times at the big christmas gatherings when as many as five hundred white people came into the station and he had always a great respect for her housekeeping and her dinners  she looked more like a boy than ever when after their meal she sat one foot tucked under her on the leather campsofa rolling cigarettes for her brother her low forehead puckered beneath the dark curls as she twiddled the papers she stuck out her rounded chin when the tobacco stayed in place and with a gesture as true as a schoolboys throwing a stone tossed the finished article across the room to martyn who caught it with one hand and continued his talk with scott it was all shopcanals and the policing of canals the sins of villagers who stole more water than they had paid for and the grosser sin of native constables who connived at the thefts of the transplanting bodily of villages to newlyirrigated ground and of the coming fight with the desert in the south when the provincial funds should warrant the opening of the longsurveyed luni protective canal system and scott spoke openly of his great desire to be put on one particular section of the work where he knew the land and the people and martyn sighed for a billet in the himalayan foothills and spoke his mind of his superiors and william rolled cigarettes and said nothing but smiled gravely on her brother because he was happy  at ten scotts horse came to the door and the evening was ended  the lights of the two low bungalows in which the daily paper was printed showed bright across the road it was too early to try to find sleep and scott drifted over to the editor raines stripped to the waist like a sailor at a gun lay in a long chair waiting for night telegrams he had a theory that if a man did not stay by his work all day and most of the night he laid himself open to fever so he ate and slept among his files  can you do it he said drowsily i didnt mean to bring you over  about what ive been dining at the martyns  the famine of course martyns  warned for it too theyre taking men where they can find em i sent a note to you at the club just now asking if you could do us a letter once a week from the southbetween two and three columns say nothing sensational of course but just plain facts about who is doing what and so forth our regular ratesten rupees a column  sorry but its out of my line scott answered staring absently at the map of india on the wall its rough on martynvery wonder what hell do with his sister wonder what the deuce theyll do with me ive no famine experience this is the first ive heard of it am i ordered  oh yes heres the wire theyll put you on reliefworks raines went on with a horde of madrassis dying like flies one native apothecary and half a pint of choleramixture among the ten thousand of you it comes of your being idle for the moment every man who isnt doing two mens work seems to have been called upon hawkins evidently believes in punjabis its going to be quite as bad as anything they have had in the last ten years  its all in the days work worse luck i suppose i shall get my orders officially some time to morrow im glad i happened to drop in better go and pack my kit now who relieves me heredo you know  raines turned over a sheaf of telegrams mceuan said he from murree  scott chuckled he thought he was going to be cool all summer hell be very sick about this well no good talking night  two hours later scott with a clear conscience laid himself down to rest on a string cot in a bare room two worn bullocktrunks a leather waterbottle a tin icebox and his pet saddle sewed up in sacking were piled at the door and the club secretarys receipt for last months bill was under his pillow his orders came next morning and with them an unofficial telegram from sir james hawkins who did not forget good men bidding him report himself with all speed at some unpronounceable place fifteen hundred miles to the south for the famine was sore in the land and white men were needed  a pink and fattish youth arrived in the redhot noonday whimpering a little at fate and famines which never allowed any one three months peace he was scotts successoranother cog in the machinery moved forward behind his fellow whose services as the official announcement ran were placed at the disposal of the madras government for famine duty until further orders scott handed over the funds in his charge showed him the coolest corner in the office warned him against excess of zeal and as twilight fell departed from the club in a hired carriage with his faithful body servant faiz ullah and a mound of disordered baggage atop to catch the southern mail at the loopholed and bastioned railwaystation the heat from the thick brick walls struck him across the face as if it had been a hot towel and he reflected that there were at least five nights and four days of travel before him faiz ullah used to the chances of service plunged into the crowd on the stone platform while scott a black cheroot between his teeth waited till his compartment should be set away a dozen native policemen with their rifles and bundles shouldered into the press of punjabi farmers sikh craftsmen and greasylocked afreedee pedlars escorting with all pomp martyns uniform case waterbottles icebox and beddingroll they saw faiz ullahs lifted hand and steered for it  my sahib and your sahib said faiz ullah to martyns man will travel together thou and i o brother will thus secure the servants places close by and because of our masters authority none will dare to disturb us  when faiz ullah reported all things ready scott settled down coatless and bootless on the broad leathercovered bunk the heat under the ironarched roof of the station might have been anything over a hundred degrees at the last moment martyn entered hot and dripping  dont swear said scott lazily its too late to change your carriage and well divide the ice  what are you doing here said the policeman  lent to the madras government same as you by jove its a bender of a night are you taking any of your men down  a dozen suppose ill have to superintend relief distributions didnt know you were under orders too  i didnt till after i left you last night raines had the news first my orders came this morning mceuan relieved me at four and i got off at once shouldnt wonder if it wouldnt be a good thingthis famineif we come through it alive  jimmy ought to put you and me to work together said martyn and then after a pause my sisters here  good business said scott heartily going to get off at umballa i suppose and go up to simla wholl she stay with there  noo thats just the trouble of it shes going down with me  scott sat bolt upright under the oil lamp as the train jolted past tarntaran station what you dont mean you couldnt afford  oh id have scraped up the money somehow  you might have come to me to begin with said scott stiffly we arent altogether strangers  well you neednt be stuffy about it i might butyou dont know my sister ive been explaining and exhorting and entreating and commanding and all the rest of it all daylost my temper since seven this morning and havent got it back yetbut she wouldnt hear of any compromise a womans entitled to travel with her husband if she wants to and william says shes on the same footing you see weve been together all our lives more or less since my people died it isnt as if she were an ordinary sister  all the sisters ive ever heard of would have stayed where they were well off  shes as clever as a man confound her martyn went on she broke up the bungalow over my head while i was talking at her settled the whole subchiz outfit in three hoursservants horses and all i didnt get my orders till nine  jimmy hawkins wont be pleased said scott a famines no place for a woman  mrs jimi mean lady jims in camp with him at any rate she says she will look after my sister william wired down to her on her own responsibility asking if she could come and knocked the ground from under me by showing me her answer  scott laughed aloud if she can do that she can take care of herself and mrs jim wont let her run into any mischief there arent many women sisters or wives who would walk into a famine with their eyes open it isnt as if she didnt know what these things mean she was through the jaloo cholera last year  the train stopped at amritsar and scott went back to the ladies compartment immediately behind their carriage william a cloth ridingcap on her curls nodded affably  come in and have some tea she said best thing in the world for heatapoplexy  do i look as if i were going to have heatapoplexy  never can tell said william wisely its always best to be ready  she had arranged her belongings with the knowledge of an old campaigner a feltcovered waterbottle hung in the draught of one of the shuttered windows a teaset of russian china packed in a wadded basket stood ready on the seat and a travelling spiritlamp was clamped against the woodwork above it  william served them generously in large cups hot tea which saves the veins of the neck from swelling inopportunely on a hot night it was characteristic of the girl that her plan of action once settled she asked for no comments on it life with men who had a great deal of work to do and very little time to do it in had taught her the wisdom of effacing as well as of fending for herself she did not by word or deed suggest that she would be useful comforting or beautiful in their travels but continued about her business serenely put the cups back without clatter when tea was ended and made cigarettes for her guests  this time last night said scott we didnt expecterthis kind of thing did we  ive learned to expect anything said william you know in our service we live at the end of the telegraph but of course this ought to be a good thing for us all departmentallyif we live  it knocks us out of the running in our own province scott replied with equal gravity i hoped to be put on the luni protective works this cold weather but theres no saying how long the famine may keep us  hardly beyond october i should think said martyn it will be ended one way or the other then  and weve nearly a week of this said william shant we be dusty when its over  for a night and a day they knew their surroundings and for a night and a day skirting the edge of the great indian desert on a narrowgauge line they remembered how in the days of their apprenticeship they had come by that road from bombay then the languages in which the names of the stations were written changed and they launched south into a foreign land where the very smells were new many long and heavilyladen grain trains were in front of them and they could feel the hand of jimmy hawkins from far off they waited in extemporised sidings blocked by processions of empty trucks returning to the north and were coupled on to slow crawling trains and dropped at midnight heaven knew where but it was furiously hot and they walked to and fro among sacks and dogs howled  then they came to an india more strange to them than to the untravelled englishmanthe flat red india of palmtree palmyrapalm and rice the india of the picturebooks of little henry and his bearerall dead and dry in the baking heat they had left the incessant passengertraffic of the north and west far and far behind them here the people crawled to the side of the train holding their little ones  in  their  arms and a loaded truck would be left behind men and women clustering round and above it like ants by spilled honey once in the twilight they saw on a dusty plain a regiment of little brown men each bearing a body over his shoulder and when the train stopped to leave yet another truck they perceived that the burdens were not corpses but only foodless folk picked up beside their dead oxen by a corps of irregular troops now they met more white men here one and there two whose tents stood close to the line and who came armed with written authorities and angry words to cut off a truck they were too busy to do more than nod at scott and martyn and stare curiously at william who could do nothing except make tea and watch how her men staved off the rush of wailing walking skeletons putting them down three at a time in heaps with their own hands uncoupling the marked trucks or taking receipts from the hollowedeyed weary white men who spoke another argot than theirs  they ran out of ice out of sodawater and out of tea for they were six days and seven nights on the road and it seemed to them like seven times seven years  at last in a dry hot dawn in a land of death lit by long red fires of railway sleepers where they were burning the dead they came to their destination and were met by jim hawkins the head of the famine unshaven unwashed but cheery and entirely in command of affairs  martyn he decreed then and there was to live on trains till further orders was to go back with empty trucks filling them with starving people as he found them and dropping them at a faminecamp on the edge of the eight districts he would pick up supplies and return and his constables would guard the loaded graincars also picking up people and would drop them at a camp a hundred miles south scotthawkins was very glad to see scott againwould that same hour take charge of a convoy of bullockcarts and would go south feeding as he went to yet another faminecamp far from the rail where he would leave his starvingthere would be no lack of starving on the routeand wait for orders by telegraph generally scott was in all small things to do what he thought best  william bit her under lip there was no one in the wide world like her one brother but martyns orders gave him no discretion she came out masked with dust from head to foot a horseshoe wrinkle on her forehead put here by much thinking during the past week but as selfpossessed as ever mrs jimwho should have been lady jim but that no one remembered to call her arighttook possession of her with a little gasp  oh im so glad youre here she almost sobbed you oughtnt to of course but therethere isnt another woman in the place and we must help each other you know and weve all the wretched people and the little babies they are selling  ive seen some said william  isnt it ghastly ive bought twenty theyre in our camp but wont you have something to eat first weve more than ten people can do here and ive got a horse for you oh im so glad youve come youre a punjabi too you know  steady lizzie said hawkins over his shoulder well look after you miss martyn sorry i cant ask you to breakfast martyn youll have to eat as you go leave two of your men to help scott these poor devils cant stand up to load carts saunders this to the enginedriver half asleep in the cab back down and get those empties away youve line clear to anundrapillay theyll give you orders north of that scott load up your carts from that bpp truck and be off as soon as you can the eurasian in the pink shirt is your interpreter and guide youll find an apothecary of sorts tied to the yoke of the second wagon hes been trying to bolt youll have to look after him lizzie drive miss martyn to camp and tell them to send the red horse down here for me  scott with faiz ullah and two policemen was already busy on the carts backing them up to the truck and unbolting the sideboards quietly while the others pitched in the bags of millet and wheat hawkins watched him for as long as it took to fill one cart  thats a good man he said if all goes well i shall work himhard this was jim hawkinss notion of the highest compliment one human being could pay another  an hour later scott was under way the apothecary threatening him with the penalties of the law for that he a member of the subordinate medical department had been coerced and bound against his will and all laws governing the liberty of the subject the pinkshirted eurasian begging leave to see his mother who happened to be dying some three miles away only verree verree short leave of absence and will presently return sar the two constables armed with staves bringing up the rear and faiz ullah a mohammedans contempt for all hindoos and foreigners in every line of his face explaining to the drivers that though scott sahib was a man to be feared on all fours he faiz ullah was authority itself  the procession creaked past hawkinss campthree stained tents under a clump of dead trees behind them the famineshed where a crowd of hopeless ones tossed their arms around the cookingkettles  wish to heaven william had kept out of it said scott to himself after a glance well have cholera sure as a gun when the rains come  but william seemed to have taken kindly to the operations of the famine code which when famine is declared supersede the workings of the ordinary law scott saw her the centre of a mob of weeping women in a calico ridinghabit and a bluegray felt hat with a gold puggaree  i want fifty rupees please i forgot to ask jack before he went away can you lend it me its for condensed milk for the babies said she  scott took the money from his belt and handed it over without a word for goodness sake take care of yourself he said  oh i shall be all right we ought to get the milk in two days by the way the orders are i was to tell you that youre to take one of sir jims horses theres a gray cabuli here that i thought would be just your style so ive said youd take him was that right  thats awfully good of you we cant either of us talk much about style im afraid  scott was in a weatherstained drill shootingkit very white at the seams and a little frayed at the wrists william regarded him thoughtfully from his pith helmet to his greased ankleboots you look very nice i think are you sure youve everything youll needquinine chlorodyne and so on  think so said scott patting three or four of his shooting pockets as the horse was led up and he mounted and rode alongside his convoy  goodbye he cried  goodbye and good luck said william im awfully obliged for the money she turned on a spurred heel and disappeared into the tent while the carts pushed on past the faminesheds past the roaring lines of the thick fat fires down to the baked gehenna of the south     william the conqueror  part ii         so let us melt and make no noise          no tearfloods nor sightempests move        twere profanation of our joys          to tell the laity our love                         a valediction  it was punishing work even though he travelled by night and camped by day but within the limits of his vision there was no man whom scott could call master he was as free as jimmy hawkinsfreer in fact for the government held the head of the famine tied neatly to a telegraphwire and if jimmy had ever regarded telegrams seriously the deathrate of that famine would have been much higher than it was  at the end of a few days crawling scott learned something of the size of the india which he served and it astonished him his carts as you know were loaded with wheat millet and barley good foodgrains needing only a little grinding but the people to whom he brought the lifegiving stuffs were rice eaters they knew how to hull rice in their mortars but they knew nothing of the heavy stone querns of the north and less of the material that the white man convoyed so laboriously they clamoured for riceunhusked paddy such as they were accustomed toand when they found that there was none broke away weeping from the sides of the cart what was the use of these strange hard grains that choked their throats they would die and then and there were many of them kept their word others took their allowance and bartered enough millet to feed a man through a week for a few handfuls of rotten rice saved by some less unfortunate a few put their shares into the ricemortars pounded it and made a paste with foul water but they were very few scott understood dimly that many people in the india of the south ate rice as a rule but he had spent his service in a grain province had seldom seen rice in the blade or the ear and least of all would have believed that in time of deadly need men would die at arms length of plenty sooner than touch food they did not know in vain the interpreters interpreted in vain his two policemen showed by vigorous pantomime what should be done the starving crept away to their bark and weeds grubs leaves and clay and left the open sacks untouched but sometimes the women laid their phantoms of children at scotts feet looking back as they staggered away  faiz ullah opined it was the will of god that these foreigners should die and therefore it remained only to give orders to burn the dead none the less there was no reason why the sahib should lack his comforts and faiz ullah a campaigner of experience had picked up a few lean goats and had added them to the procession that they might give milk for the morning meal he was feeding them on the good grain that these imbeciles rejected yes said faiz ullah if the sahib thought fit a little milk might be given to some of the babies but as the sahib well knew babies were cheap and for his own part faiz ullah held that there was no government order as to babies scott spoke forcefully to faiz ullah and the two policemen and bade them capture goats where they could find them this they most joyfully did for it was a recreation and many ownerless goats were driven in once fed the poor brutes were willing enough to follow the carts and a few days good foodfood such as human beings died for lack ofset them in milk again  but i am no goatherd said faiz ullah it is against my izzat my honour  when we cross the bias river again we will talk of izzat scott replied till that day thou and the policemen shall be sweepers to the camp if i give the order  thus then it is done grunted faiz ullah if the sahib will have it so and he showed how a goat should be milked while scott stood over him  now we will feed them said scott thrice a day we will feed them and he bowed his back to the milking and took a horrible cramp  when you have to keep connection unbroken between a restless mother of kids and a baby who is at the point of death you suffer in all your system but the babies were fed morning noon and evening scott would solemnly lift them out one by one from their nest of gunnybags under the carttilts there were always many who could do no more than breathe and the milk was dropped into their toothless mouths drop by drop with due pauses when they choked each morning too the goats were fed and since they would struggle without a leader and since the natives were hirelings scott was forced to give up riding and pace slowly at the head of his flocks accommodating his step to their weaknesses all this was sufficiently absurd and he felt the absurdity keenly but at least he was saving life and when the women saw that their children did not die they made shift to eat a little of the strange foods and crawled after the carts blessing the master of the goats  give the women something to live for said scott to himself as he sneezed in the dust of a hundred little feet and theyll hang on somehow but this beats williams condensed milk trick all to pieces i shall never live it down though  he reached his destination very slowly found that a riceship had come in from burmah and that stores of paddy were available found also an overworked englishman in charge of the shed and loading the carts set back to cover the ground he had already passed he left some of the children and half his goats at the famineshed for this he was not thanked by the englishman who had already more stray babies than he knew what to do with scotts back was suppled to stooping now and he went on with his wayside ministrations in addition to distributing the paddy more babies and more goats were added unto him but now some of the babies wore rags and beads round their wrists or necks that said the interpreter as though scott did not know signifies that their mothers hope in eventual contingency to resume them offeecially  the sooner the better said scott but at the same time he marked with the pride of ownership how this or that little ramasawmy was putting on flesh like a bantam as the paddy carts were emptied he headed for hawkinss camp by the railway timing his arrival to fit in with the dinnerhour for it was long since he had eaten at a cloth he had no desire to make any dramatic entry but an accident of the sunset ordered it that when he had taken off his helmet to get the evening breeze the low light should fall across his forehead and he could not see what was before him while one waiting at the tent door beheld with new eyes a young man beautiful as paris a god in a halo of golden dust walking slowly at the head of his flocks while at his knee ran small naked cupids but she laughedwilliam in a slatecoloured blouse laughed consumedly till scott putting the best face he could upon the matter halted his armies and bade her admire the kindergarten it was an unseemly sight but the proprieties had been left ages ago with the teaparty at amritsar station fifteen hundred miles to the northward  they are coming on nicely said william weve only fiveandtwenty here now the women are beginning to take them away again  are you in charge of the babies then  yesmrs jim and i we didnt think of goats though weve been trying condensed milk and water  any losses  more than i care to think of said william with a shudder and you  scott said nothing there had been many little burials along his routemany mothers who had wept when they did not find again the children they had trusted to the care of the government  then hawkins came out carrying a razor at which scott looked hungrily for he had a beard that he did not love and when they sat down to dinner in the tent he told his tale in few words as it might have been an official report mrs jim snuffled from time to time and jim bowed his head judicially but williams gray eyes were on the cleanshaven face and it was to her that scott seemed to speak  good for the pauper province said william her chin in her hand as she leaned forward among the wineglasses her cheeks had fallen in and the scar on her forehead was more prominent than ever but the wellturned neck rose roundly as a column from the ruffle of the blouse which was the accepted eveningdress in camp  it was awfully absurd at times said scott you see i didnt know much about milking or babies theyll chaff my head off if the tale goes north  let em said william haughtily weve all done cooliework since we came i know jack has this was to hawkinss address and the big man smiled blandly  your brothers a highly efficient officer william said he and ive done him the honour of treating him as he deserves remember i write the confidential reports  then you must say that williams worth her weight in gold said mrs jim i dont know what we should have done without her she has been everything to us she dropped her hand upon williams which was rough with much handling of reins and william patted it softly jim beamed on the company things were going well with his world three of his more grossly incompetent men had died and their places had been filled by their betters every day brought the rains nearer they had put out the famine in five of the eight districts and after all the deathrate had not been too heavythings considered he looked scott over carefully as an ogre looks over a man and rejoiced in his thews and ironhard condition  hes just the least bit in the world tucked up said jim to himself but he can do two mens work yet then he was aware that mrs jim was telegraphing to him and according to the domestic code the message ran a clear case look at them  he looked and listened all that william was saying was what can you expect of a country where they call a bhistee a watercarrier a tunnicutch and all that scott answered was i shall be precious glad to get back to the club save me a dance at the christmas ball wont you  its a far cry from here to the lawrence hall said jim better turn in early scott its paddycarts tomorrow youll begin loading at five  arent you going to give mr scott one days rest  wish i could lizzie fraid i cant as long as he can stand up we must use him  well ive had one europe evening at least  by jove id nearly forgotten what do i do about those babies of mine  leave them here said williamwe are in charge of thatand as many goats as you can spare i must learn how to milk now  if you care to get up early enough tomorrow ill show you i have to milk you see and by the way half of em have beads and things round their necks you must be careful not to take em off in case the mothers turn up  you forget ive had some experience here  i hope to goodness you wont overdo scotts voice was unguarded  ill take care of her said mrs jim telegraphing hundredword messages as she carried william off while jim gave scott his orders for the coming campaign it was very latenearly nine oclock  jim youre a brute said his wife that night and the head of the famine chuckled  not a bit of it dear i remember doing the first jandiala settlement for the sake of a girl in a crinoline and she was slender lizzie ive never done as good a piece of work since hell work like a demon  but you might have given him one day  and let things come to a head now no dear its their happiest time  i dont believe either of the dears know whats the matter with them isnt it beautiful isnt it lovely  getting up at three to learn to milk bless her heart ye gods why must we grow old and fat  shes a darling she has done more work under me  under you the day after she came she was in charge and you were her subordinate and youve stayed there ever since she manages you almost as well as you manage me  she doesnt and thats why i love her shes as direct as a manas her brother  her brothers weaker than she is hes always coming to me for orders but hes honest and a glutton for work i confess im rather fond of william and if i had a daughter  the talk ended there far away in the derajat was a childs grave more than twenty years old and neither jim nor his wife spoke of it any more  all the same youre responsible jim added after a moments silence  bless em said mrs jim sleepily  before the stars paled scott who slept in an empty cart waked and went about his work in silence it seemed at that hour unkind to rouse faiz ullah and the interpreter his head being close to the ground he did not hear william till she stood over him in the dingy old ridinghabit her eyes still heavy with sleep a cup of tea and a piece of toast in her hands there was a baby on the ground squirming on a piece of blanket and a sixyearold child peered over scotts shoulder  hai you little rip said scott how the deuce do you expect to get your rations if you arent quiet  a cool white hand steadied the brat who forthwith choked as the milk gurgled into his mouth  mornin said the milker youve no notion how these little fellows can wriggle  oh yes i have she whispered because the world was asleep only i feed them with a spoon or a rag yours are fatter than mine and youve been doing this day after day twice a day the voice was almost lost  yes it was absurd now you try he said giving place to the girl look out a goats not a cow  the goat protested against the amateur and there was a scuffle in which scott snatched up the baby then it was all to do over again and william laughed softly and merrily she managed however to feed two babies and a third  dont the little beggars take it well said scott i trained em  they were very busy and interested when lo it was broad daylight and before they knew the camp was awake and they kneeled among the goats surprised by the day both flushed to the temples yet all the round world rolling up out of the darkness might have heard and seen all that had passed between them  oh said william unsteadily snatching up the tea and toast i had this made for you its stonecold now i thought you mightnt have anything ready so early better not drink it itsits stonecold  thats awfully kind of you its just right its awfully good of you really ill leave my kids and goats with you and mrs jim and of course any one in camp can show you about the milking  of course said william and she grew pinker and pinker and statelier and more stately as she strode back to her tent fanning herself vigorously with the saucer  there were shrill lamentations through the camp when the elder children saw their nurse move off without them faiz ullah unbent so far as to jest with the policemen and scott turned purple with shame because hawkins already in the saddle roared  a child escaped from the care of mrs jim and running like a rabbit clung to scotts boot william pursuing with long easy strides  i will not goi will not go shrieked the child twining his feet round scotts ankle they will kill me here i do not know these people  i say said scott in broken tamil i say she will do you no harm go with her and be well fed  come said william panting with a wrathful glance at scott who stood helpless and as it were hamstrung  go back said scott quickly to william ill send the little chap over in a minute  the tone of authority had its effect but in a way scott did not exactly intend the boy loosened his grasp and said with gravity i did not know the woman was thine i will go then he cried to his companions a mob of three four and fiveyearolds waiting on the success of his venture ere they stampeded go back and eat it is our mans woman she will obey his orders  jim collapsed where he sat faiz ullah and the two policemen grinned and scotts orders to the cartmen flew like hail  that is the custom of the sahibs when truth is told in their presence said faiz ullah the time comes that i must seek new service young wives especially such as speak our language and have knowledge of the ways of the police make great trouble for honest butlers in the matter of weekly accounts  what william thought of it all she did not say but when her brother ten days later came to camp for orders and heard of scotts performances he said laughing well that settles it hell be bakri scott to the end of his days bakri in the northern vernacular means a goat what a lark id have given a months pay to have seen him nursing famine babies i fed some with conjee ricewater but that was all right  its perfectly disgusting said his sister with blazing eyes a man does something likelike thatand all you other men think of is to give him an absurd nickname and then you laugh and think its funny  ah said mrs jim sympathetically  well you cant talk william you christened little miss demby the buttonquail last cold weather you know you did indias the land of nicknames  thats different william replied she was only a girl and she hadnt done anything except walk like a quail and she does but it isnt fair to make fun of a man  scott wont care said martyn you cant get a rise out of old scotty ive been trying for eight years and youve only known him for three how does he look  he looks very well said william and went away with a flushed cheek bakri scott indeed then she laughed to herself for she knew the country of her service but it will be bakri all the same and she repeated it under her breath several times slowly whispering it into favour  when he returned to his duties on the railway martyn spread the name far and wide among his associates so that scott met it as he led his paddycarts to war the natives believed it to be some english title of honour and the cartdrivers used it in all simplicity till faiz ullah who did not approve of foreign japes broke their heads there was very little time for milking now except at the big camps where jim had extended scotts idea and was feeding large flocks on the useless northern grains enough paddy had come into the eight districts to hold the people safe if it were only distributed quickly and for that purpose no one was better than the big canal officer who never lost his temper never gave an unnecessary order and never questioned an order given scott pressed on saving his cattle washing their galled necks daily so that no time should be lost on the road reported himself with his rice at the minor faminesheds unloaded and went back light by forced nightmarch to the next distributing centre to find hawkinss unvarying telegram do it again and he did it again and again and yet again while jim hawkins fifty miles away marked off on a big map the tracks of his wheels gridironing the stricken lands others did wellhawkins reported at the end that they all did wellbut scott was the most excellent for he kept good coined rupees by him and paid for his own cartrepairs on the spot and ran to meet all sorts of unconsidered extras trusting to be recouped later theoretically the government should have paid for every shoe and linchpin for every hand employed in the loading but government vouchers cash themselves slowly and intelligent and efficient clerks write at great length contesting unauthorised expenditures of eight annas the man who wishes to make his work a success must draw on his own bankaccount of money or other things as he goes  i told you hed work said jimmy to his wife at the end of six weeks hes been in sole charge of a couple of thousand men up north on the mosuhl canal for a year and he gives one less trouble than young martyn with his ten constables and im morally certainonly government doesnt recognise moral obligationsthat hes spent about half his pay to grease his wheels look at this lizzie for one weeks work forty miles in two days with twelve carts two days halt building a famineshed for young rogers rogers ought to have built it himself the idiot then forty miles back again loading six carts on the way and distributing all sunday then in the evening he pitches in a twentypage demiofficial to me saying that the people where he is might be advantageously employed on reliefwork and suggesting that he put em to work on some brokendown old reservoir hes discovered so as to have a good watersupply when the rains come he thinks he can caulk the dam in a fortnight look at his marginal sketchesarent they clear and good i knew he was pukka but i didnt know he was as pukka as this  i must show these to william said mrs jim the childs wearing herself out among the babies  not more than you are dear well another two months ought to see us out of the wood im sorry its not in my power to recommend you for a vc  william sat late in her tent that night reading through page after page of the square handwriting patting the sketches of proposed repairs to the reservoir and wrinkling her eyebrows over the columns of figures of estimated watersupply  and he finds time to do all this she cried to herself and  well i also was present ive saved one or two babies  she dreamed for the twentieth time of the god in the golden dust and woke refreshed to feed loathsome black children scores of them wastrels picked up by the wayside their bones almost breaking their skin terrible and covered with sores  scott was not allowed to leave his cart work but his letter was duly forwarded to the government and he had the consolation not rare in india of knowing that another man was reaping where he had sown that also was discipline profitable to the soul  hes much too good to waste on canals said jimmy any one can oversee coolies you neednt be angry william he canbut i need my pearl among bullockdrivers and ive transferred him to the khanda district where hell have it all to do over again he should be marching now  hes not a coolie said william furiously he ought to be doing his regulation work  hes the best man in his service and thats saying a good deal but if you must use razors to cut grindstones why i prefer the best cutlery  isnt it almost time we saw him again said mrs jim im sure the poor boy hasnt had a respectable meal for a month he probably sits on a cart and eats sardines with his fingers  all in good time dear duty before decencywasnt it mr chucks said that  no it was midshipman easy william laughed i sometimes wonder how it will feel to dance or listen to a band again or sit under a roof i cant believe that i ever wore a ballfrock in my life  one minute said mrs jim who was thinking if he goes to khanda he passes within five miles of us of course hell ride in  oh no he wont said william  how do you know dear  itll take him off his work he wont have time  hell make it said mrs jim with a twinkle  it depends on his own judgment theres absolutely no reason why he shouldnt if he thinks fit said jim  he wont see fit william replied without sorrow or emotion it wouldnt be him if he did  one certainly gets to know people rather well in times like these said jim drily but williams face was serene as ever and even as she prophesied scott did not appear  the rains fell at last late but heavily and the dry gashed earth was red mud and servants killed snakes in the camp where every one was weatherbound for a fortnightall except hawkins who took horse and splashed about in the wet rejoicing now the government decreed that seedgrain should be distributed to the people as well as advances of money for the purchase of new oxen and the white men were doubly worked for this new duty while william skipped from brick to brick laid down on the trampled mud and dosed her charges with warming medicines that made them rub their little round stomachs and the milchgoats throve on the rank grass there was never a word from scott in the khanda district away to the southeast except the regular telegraphic report to hawkins the rude country roads had disappeared his drivers were half mutinous one of martyns loaned policemen had died of cholera and scott was taking thirty grains of quinine a day to fight the fever that comes if one works hard in heavy rain but those were things he did not consider necessary to report he was as usual working from a base of supplies on a railway line to cover a circle of fifteen miles radius and since full loads were impossible he took  quarterloads and toiled four times as hard by consequence for he did not choose to risk an epidemic which might have grown uncontrollable by assembling villagers in thousands at the reliefsheds it was cheaper to take government bullocks work them to death and leave them to the crows in the wayside sloughs  that was the time when eight years of clean living and hard condition told though a mans head were ringing like a bell from the cinchona and the earth swayed under his feet when he stood and under his bed when he slept if hawkins had seen fit to make him a bullockdriver that he thought was entirely hawkinss own affair there were men in the north who would know what he had done men of thirty years service in his own department who would say that it was not half bad and above immeasurably above all men of all grades there was william in the thick of the fight who would approve because she understood he had so trained his mind that it would hold fast to the mechanical routine of the day though his own voice sounded strange in his own ears and his hands when he wrote grew large as pillows or small as peas at the end of his wrists that steadfastness bore his body to the telegraphoffice at the railwaystation and dictated a telegram to hawkins saying that the khanda district was in his judgment now safe and he waited further orders  the madrassee telegraphclerk did not approve of a large gaunt man falling over him in a dead faint not so much because of the weight as because of the names and blows that faiz ullah dealt him when he found the body rolled under a bench then faiz ullah took blankets and quilts and coverlets where he found them and lay down under them at his masters side and bound his arms with a tentrope and filled him with a horrible stew of herbs and set the policeman to fight him when he wished to escape from the intolerable heat of his coverings and shut the door of the telegraphoffice to keep out the curious for two nights and one day and when a light engine came down the line and hawkins kicked in the door scott hailed him weakly but in a natural voice and faiz ullah stood back and took all the credit  for two nights heavenborn he was pagal said faiz ullah look at my nose and consider the eye of the policeman he beat us with his bound hands but we sat upon him heavenborn and though his words were tez we sweated him heavenborn never has been such a sweat he is weaker now than a child but the fever has gone out of him by the grace of god there remains only my nose and the eye of the constabeel sahib shall i ask for my dismissal because my sahib has beaten me and faiz ullah laid his long thin hand carefully on scotts chest to be sure that the fever was all gone ere he went out to open tinned soups and discourage such as laughed at his swelled nose  the districts all right scott whispered it doesnt make any difference you got my wire i shall be fit in a week cant understand how it happened i shall be fit in a few days  youre coming into camp with us said hawkins  but look herebut  its all over except the shouting we shant need you punjabis any more on my honour we shant martyn goes back in a few weeks arbuthnots returned already ellis and clay are putting the last touches to a new feederline the governments built as reliefwork mortens deadhe was a bengal man though you wouldnt know him pon my word you and willmiss martynseem to have come through it as well as anybody  oh how is she the voice went up and down as he spoke  she was in great form when i left her the roman catholic missions are adopting the unclaimed babies to turn them into little priests the basil mission is taking some and the mothers are taking the rest you should hear the little beggars howl when theyre sent away from william shes pulled down a bit but so are we all now when do you suppose youll be able to move  i cant come into camp in this state i wont he replied pettishly  well you are rather a sight but from what i gathered there it seemed to me theyd be glad to see you under any conditions ill look over your work here if you like for a couple of days and you can pull yourself together while faiz ullah feeds you up  scott could walk dizzily by the time hawkinss inspection vas ended and he flushed all over when jim said of his work in the district that it was not half bad and volunteered further that he had considered scott his righthand man through the famine and would feel it his duty to say as much officially  so they came back by rail to the old camp but there were no crowds near it the long fires in the trenches were dead and black and the faminesheds stood almost empty  you see said jim there isnt much more for us to do better ride up and see the wife theyve pitched a tent for you dinners at seven ill see you then  riding at a footpace faiz ullah by his stirrup scott came to william in the browncalico ridinghabit sitting at the diningtent door her hands in her lap white as ashes thin and worn with no lustre in her hair there did not seem to be any mrs jim on the horizon and all that william could say was my word how pulled down you look  ive had a touch of fever you dont look very well yourself  oh im fit enough weve stamped it out i suppose you know  scott nodded we shall all be returned in a few weeks hawkins told me  before christmas mrs jim says shant you be glad to go back i can smell the woodsmoke already william sniffed we shall be in time for all the christmas doings i dont suppose even the punjab government would be base enough to transfer jack till the new year  it seems hundreds of years agothe punjab and all thatdoesnt it are you glad you came  now its all over yes it has been ghastly here you know we had to sit still and do nothing and sir jim was away so much  do nothing how did you get on with the milking  i managed it somehowafter you taught me  then the talk stopped with an almost audible jar still no mrs jim  that reminds me i owe you fifty rupees for the condensed milk i thought perhaps youd be coming here when you were transferred to the khanda district and i could pay you then but you didnt  i passed within five miles of the camp it was in the middle of a march you see and the carts were breaking down every few minutes and i couldnt get em over the ground till ten oclock that night but i wanted to come awfully you knew i did didnt you  ibelieveidid said william facing him with level eyes she was no longer white  did you understand  why you didnt ride in of course i did  why  because you couldnt of course i knew that  did you care  if you had come inbut i knew you wouldntbut if you had i should have cared a great deal you know i should  thank god i didnt oh but i wanted to i couldnt trust myself to ride in front of the carts because i kept edging em over here dont you know  i knew you wouldnt said william contentedly heres your fifty  scott bent forward and kissed the hand that held the greasy notes its fellow patted him awkwardly but very tenderly on the head  and you knew too didnt you said william in a new voice  no on my honour i didnt i hadnt thethe cheek to expect anything of the kind except i say were you out riding anywhere the day i passed by to khanda  william nodded and smiled after the manner of an angel surprised in a good deed  then it was just a speck i saw of your habit in the  palmgrove on the southern cartroad i saw your helmet when you came up from the nullah by the templejust enough to be sure that you were all right dyou care  this time scott did not kiss her hand for they were in the dusk of the diningtent and because williams knees were trembling under her she had to sit down in the nearest chair where she wept long and happily her head on her arms and when scott imagined that it would be well to comfort her she needed nothing of the kind she ran to her own tent and scott went out into the world and smiled upon it largely and idiotically but when faiz ullah brought him a drink he found it necessary to support one hand with the other or the good whisky and soda would have been spilled abroad there are fevers and fevers  but it was worsemuch worsethe strained eyeshirking talk at dinner till the servants had withdrawn and worst of all when mrs jim who had been on the edge of weeping from the soup down kissed scott and william and they drank one whole bottle of champagne hot because there was no ice and scott and william sat outside the tent in the starlight till mrs jim drove them in for fear of more fever  apropos of these things and some others william said being engaged is abominable because you see one has no official position we must be thankful that weve lots of things to do  things to do said jim when that was reported to him theyre neither of them any good any more i cant get five hours work a day out of scott hes in the clouds half the time  oh but theyre so beautiful to watch jimmy it will break my heart when they go cant you do anything for him  ive given the government the impressionat least i hope i havethat he personally conducted the entire famine but all he wants is to get on to the luni canal works and williams just as bad have you ever heard em talking of barrage and aprons and wastewater its their style of spooning i suppose  mrs jim smiled tenderly ah thats in the intervalsbless em  and so love ran about the camp unrebuked in broad daylight while men picked up the pieces and put them neatly away of the famine in the eight districts                                       morning brought the penetrating chill of the northern december the layers of woodsmoke the dusty gray blue of the tamarisks the domes of ruined tombs and all the smell of the white northern plains as the mailtrain ran on to the milelong sutlej bridge william wrapped in a poshteensilkembroidered sheepskin jacket trimmed with rough astrakhanlooked out with moist eyes and nostrils that dilated joyously the south of pagodas and palmtrees the overpopulated hindu south was done with here was the land she knew and loved and before her lay the good life she understood among folk of her own caste and mind  they were picking them up at almost every station nowmen and women coming in for the christmas week with racquets with bundles of polosticks with dear and bruised cricketbats with foxterriers and saddles the greater part of them wore jackets like williams for the northern cold is as little to be trifled with as the northern heat and william was among them and of them her hands deep in her pockets her collar turned up over her ears stamping her feet on the platforms as she walked up and down to get warm visiting from carriage to carriage and everywhere being congratulated scott was with the bachelors at the far end of the train where they chaffed him mercilessly about feeding babies and milking goats but from time to time he would stroll up to williams window and murmur good enough isnt it and william would answer with sighs of pure delight good enough indeed the large open names of the home towns were good to listen to umballa ludianah phillour jullundur they rang like the coming marriagebells in her ears and william felt deeply and truly sorry for all strangers and outsidersvisitors tourists and those freshcaught for the service of the country  it was a glorious return and when the bachelors gave the christmas ball william was unofficially you might say the chief and honoured guest among the stewards who could make things very pleasant for their friends she and scott danced nearly all the dances together and sat out the rest in the big dark gallery overlooking the superb teak floor where the uniforms blazed and the spurs clinked and the new frocks and four hundred dancers went round and round till the draped flags on the pillars flapped and bellied to the whirl of it  about midnight half a dozen men who did not care for dancing came over from the club to play waits andthat was a surprise the stewards had arrangedbefore any one knew what had happened the band stopped and hidden voices broke into good king wenceslaus and william in the gallery hummed and beat time with her foot          mark my footsteps well my page           tread thou in them boldly         thou shalt feel the winters rage           freeze thy blood less coldly  oh i hope they are going to give us another isnt it pretty coming out of the dark in that way looklook down theres mrs gregory wiping her eyes  its like home rather said scott i remember  hsh listendearand it began again          when shepherds watched their flocks by night  ahh said william drawing closer to scott          all seated on the ground         the angel of the lord came down         and glory shone around         fear not said he for mighty dread         had seized their troubled mind         glad tidings of great joy i bring         to you and all mankind  this time it was william that wiped her eyes     wee willie winkie  an  officer and a gentleman  his full name was percival william williams but he picked up the other name in a nurserybook and that was the end of the christened titles his mothers ayah called him williebaba but as he never paid the faintest attention to anything that the ayah said her wisdom did not help matters  his father was the colonel of the 195th and as soon as wee willie winkie was old enough to understand what military discipline meant colonel williams put him under it there was no other way of managing the child when he was good for a week he drew goodconduct pay and when he was bad he was deprived of his goodconduct stripe generally he was bad for india offers many chances of going wrong to little sixyearolds  children resent familiarity from strangers and wee willie winkie was a very particular child once he accepted an acquaintance he was graciously pleased to thaw he accepted brandis a subaltern of the 195th on sight brandis was having tea at the colonels and wee willie winkie entered strong in the possession of a goodconduct badge won for not chasing the hens round the compound he regarded brandis with gravity for at least ten minutes and then delivered himself of his opinion  i like you said he slowly getting off his chair and coming over to brandis i like you i shall call you coppy because of your hair do you mind being called coppy it is because of ve hair you know  here was one of the most embarrassing of wee willie winkies peculiarities he would look at a stranger for some time and then without warning or explanation would give him a name and the name stuck no regimental penalties could break wee willie winkie of this habit he lost his goodconduct badge for christening the commissioners wife pobs but nothing that the colonel could do made the station forego the nickname and mrs collen remained pobs till the end of her stay so brandis was christened coppy and rose therefore in the estimation of the regiment  if wee willie winkie took an interest in any one the fortunate man was envied alike by the mess and the rank and file and in their envy lay no suspicion of selfinterest the colonels son was idolised on his own merits entirely yet wee willie winkie was not lovely his face was permanently freckled as his legs were permanently scratched and in spite of his mothers almost tearful remonstrances he had insisted upon having his long yellow locks cut short in the military fashion i want my hair like sergeant tummils said wee willie winkie and his father abetting the sacrifice was accomplished  three weeks after the bestowal of his youthful affections on lieutenant brandishenceforward to be called coppy for the sake of brevitywee willie winkie was destined to behold strange things and far beyond his comprehension  coppy returned his liking with interest coppy had let him wear for five rapturous minutes his own big swordjust as tall as wee willie winkie coppy had promised him a terrier puppy and coppy had permitted him to witness the miraculous operation of shaving nay morecoppy had said that even he wee willie winkie would rise in time to the ownership of a box of shiny knives a silver soapbox and a silverhandled sputterbrush as wee willie winkie called it decidedly there was no one except his father who could give or take away goodconduct badges at pleasure half so wise strong and valiant as coppy with the afghan and egyptian medals on his breast why then should coppy be guilty of the unmanly weakness of kissingvehemently kissinga big girl miss allardyce to wit in the course of a morning ride wee willie winkie had seen coppy so doing and like the gentleman he was had promptly wheeled round and cantered back to his groom lest the groom should also see  under ordinary circumstances he would have spoken to his father but he felt instinctively that this was a matter on which coppy ought first to be consulted  coppy shouted wee willie winkie reining up outside that subalterns bungalow early one morningi want to see you coppy  come in young un returned coppy who was at early breakfast in the midst of his dogs what mischief have you been getting into now  wee willie winkie had done nothing notoriously bad for three days and so stood on a pinnacle of virtue  ive been doing nothing bad said he curling himself into a long chair with a studious affectation of the colonels languor after a hot parade he buried his freckled nose in a teacup and with eyes staring roundly over the rim asked i say coppy is it pwoper to kiss big girls  by jove youre beginning early who do you want to kiss  no one my muvvers always kissing me if i dont stop her if it isnt pwoper how was you kissing major allardyces big girl last morning by ve canal  coppys brow wrinkled he and miss allardyce had with great craft managed to keep their engagement secret for a fortnight there were urgent and imperative reasons why major allardyce should not know how matters stood for at least another month and this small marplot had discovered a great deal too much  i saw you said wee willie winkie calmly but ve sais didnt see i said hut jao  oh you had that much sense you young rip groaned poor coppy half amused and half angry and how many people may you have told about it  only me myself you didnt tell when i twied to wide ve buffalo ven my pony was lame and i fought you wouldnt like  winkie said coppy enthusiastically shaking the small hand youre the best of good fellows look here you cant understand all these things one of these dayshang it how can i make you see itim going to marry miss allardyce and then shell be mrs coppy as you say if your young mind is so scandalised at the idea of kissing big girls go and tell your father  what will happen said wee willie winkie who firmly believed that his father was omnipotent  i shall get into trouble said coppy playing his trump card with an appealing look at the holder of the ace  ven i wont said wee willie winkie briefly but my faver says its unmanly to be always kissing and i didnt fink youd do vat coppy  im not always kissing old chap its only now and then and when youre bigger youll do it too your father meant its not good for little boys  ah said wee willie winkie now fully enlightened its like ve sputterbrush  exactly said coppy gravely  but i dont fink ill ever want to kiss big girls nor no one cept my muvver and i must vat you know  there was a long pause broken by wee willie winkie  are you fond of vis big girl coppy  awfully said coppy  fonder van you are of bell or ve butchaor me  its in a different way said coppy you see one of these days miss allardyce will belong to me but youll grow up and command the regiment andall sorts of things its quite different you see  very well said wee willie winkie rising if youre fond of ve big girl i wont tell any one i must go now  coppy rose and escorted his small guest to the door addingyoure the best of little fellows winkie i tell you what in thirty days from now you can tell if you liketell any one you like  thus the secret of the brandisallardyce engagement was dependent on a little childs word coppy who knew wee willie winkies idea of truth was at ease for he felt that he would not break promises wee willie winkie betrayed a special and unusual interest in miss allardyce and slowly revolving round that embarrassed young lady was used to regard her gravely with unwinking eye he was trying to discover why coppy should have kissed her she was not half so nice as his own mother on the other hand she was coppys property and would in time belong to him therefore it behoved him to treat her with as much respect as coppys big sword or shiny pistol  the idea that he shared a great secret in common with coppy kept wee willie winkie unusually virtuous for three weeks then the old adam broke out and he made what he called a campfire at the bottom of the garden how could he have foreseen that the flying sparks would have lighted the colonels little hayrick and consumed a weeks store for the horses sudden and swift was the punishmentdeprivation of the goodconduct badge and most sorrowful of all two days confinement to barracksthe house and verandacoupled with the withdrawal of the light of his fathers countenance  he took the sentence like the man he strove to be drew himself up with a quivering underlip saluted and once clear of the room ran to weep bitterly in his nurserycalled by him my quarters coppy came in the afternoon and attempted to console the culprit  im under awwest said wee willie winkie mournfully and i didnt ought to speak to you  very early the next morning he climbed on to the roof of the housethat was not forbiddenand beheld miss allardyce going for a ride  where are you going cried wee willie winkie  across the river she answered and trotted forward  now the cantonment in which the 195th lay was bounded on the north by a riverdry in the winter from his earliest years wee willie winkie had been forbidden to go across the river and had noted that even coppythe almost almighty coppyhad never set foot beyond it wee willie winkie had once been read to out of a big blue book the history of the princess and the goblinsa most wonderful tale of a land where the goblins were always warring with the children of men until they were defeated by one curdie ever since that date it seemed to him that the bare black and purple hills across the river were inhabited by goblins and in truth every one had said that there lived the bad men even in his own house the lower halves of the windows were covered with green paper on account of the bad men who might if allowed clear view fire into peaceful drawingrooms and comfortable bedrooms certainly beyond the river which was the end of all the earth lived the bad men and here was major allardyces big girl coppys property preparing to venture into their borders what would coppy say if anything happened to her if the goblins ran off with her as they did with curdies princess she must at all hazards be turned back  the house was still wee willie winkie reflected for a moment on the very terrible wrath of his father and thenbroke his arrest it was a crime unspeakable the low sun threw his shadow very large and very black on the trim gardenpaths as he went down to the stables and ordered his pony it seemed to him in the hush of the dawn that all the big world had been bidden to stand still and look at wee willie winkie guilty of mutiny the drowsy sais gave him his mount and since the one great sin made all others insignificant wee willie winkie said that he was going to ride over to coppy sahib and went out at a footpace stepping on the soft mould of the flowerborders  the devastating track of the ponys feet was the last misdeed that cut him off from all sympathy of humanity he turned into the road leaned forward and rode as fast as the pony could put foot to the ground in the direction of the river  but the liveliest of twelvetwo ponies can do little against the long canter of a waler miss allardyce was far ahead had passed through the crops beyond the policeposts when all the guards were asleep and her mount was scattering the pebbles of the riverbed as wee willie winkie left the cantonment and british india behind him bowed forward and still flogging wee willie winkie shot into afghan territory and could just see miss allardyce a black speck flickering across the stony plain the reason of her wandering was simple enough coppy in a tone of toohastilyassumed authority had told her overnight that she must not ride out by the river and she had gone to prove her own spirit and teach coppy a lesson  almost at the foot of the inhospitable hills wee willie winkie saw the waler blunder and come down heavily miss allardyce struggled clear but her ankle had been severely twisted and she could not stand having fully shown her spirit she wept and was surprised by the apparition of a white wideeyed child in khaki on a nearly spent pony  are you badly badly hurted shouted wee willie winkie as soon as he was within range you didnt ought to be here  i dont know said miss allardyce ruefully ignoring the reproof good gracious child what are you doing here  you said you was going acwoss ve wiver panted wee willie winkie throwing himself off his pony and nobodynot even coppymust go acwoss ve wiver and i came after you ever so hard but you wouldnt stop and now youve hurted yourself and coppy will be angwy wiv me andive bwoken my awwest ive bwoken my awwest  the future colonel of the 195th sat down and sobbed in spite of the pain in her ankle the girl was moved  have you ridden all the way from cantonments little man what for  you belonged to coppy coppy told me so wailed wee willie winkie disconsolately i saw him kissing you and he said he was fonder of you van bell or ve butcha or me and so i came you must get up and come back you didnt ought to be here vis is a bad place and ive bwoken my awwest  i cant move winkie said miss allardyce with a groan ive hurt my foot what shall i do  she showed a readiness to weep anew which steadied wee willie winkie who had been brought up to believe that tears were the depth of unmanliness still when one is as great a sinner as wee willie winkie even a man may be permitted to break down  winkie said miss allardyce when youve rested a little ride back and tell them to send out something to carry me back in it hurts fearfully  the child sat still for a little time and miss allardyce closed her eyes the pain was nearly making her faint she was roused by wee willie winkie tying up the reins on his ponys neck and setting it free with a vicious cut of his whip that made it whicker the little animal headed towards the cantonments  oh winkie what are you doing  hush said wee willie winkie veres a man comingone ofve bad men i must stay wiv you my faver says a man must always look after a girl jack will go home and ven veyll come and look for us vats why i let him go  not one man but two or three had appeared from behind the rocks of the hills and the heart of wee willie winkie sank within him for just in this manner were the goblins wont to steal out and vex curdies soul thus had they played in curdies gardenhe had seen the pictureand thus had they frightened the princesss nurse he heard them talking to each other and recognised with joy the bastard pushto that he had picked up from one of his fathers grooms lately dismissed people who spoke that tongue could not be the bad men they were only natives after all  they came up to the boulders on which miss allardyces horse had blundered  then rose from the rock wee willie winkie child of the dominant race aged six and threequarters and said briefly and emphatically jao the pony had crossed the riverbed  the men laughed and laughter from natives was the one thing wee willie winkie could not tolerate he asked them what they wanted and why they did not depart other men with most evil faces and crookedstocked guns crept out of the shadows of the hills till soon wee willie winkie was face to face with an audience some twenty strong miss allardyce screamed  who are you said one of the men  i am the colonel sahibs son and my order is that you go at once you black men are frightening the miss sahib  one of you must run into cantonments and take the news that the miss sahib has hurt herself and that the colonels son is here with her  put our feet into the trap was the laughing reply  hear this boys speech  say that i sent youi the colonels son they will give you money  what is the use of this talk take up the child and the girl and we can at least ask for the ransom ours are the villages on the heights said a voice in the background  these were the bad menworse than goblinsand it needed all wee willie winkies training to prevent him from bursting into tears but he felt that to cry before a native excepting only his mothers ayah would be an infamy greater than any mutiny moreover he as future colonel of the 195th had that grim regiment at his back  are you going to carry us away said wee willie winkie very blanched and uncomfortable  yes my little sahib bahadur said the tallest of the men and eat you afterwards  that is childs talk said wee willie winkie men do not eat men  a yell of laughter interrupted him but he went on firmlyand if you do carry us away i tell you that all my regiment will come up in a day and kill you all without leaving one who will take my message to the colonel sahib  speech in any vernacularand wee willie winkie had a colloquial acquaintance with threewas easy to the boy who could not yet manage his rs and ths aright  another man joined the conference crying o foolish men what this babe says is true he is the hearts heart of those white troops for the sake of peace let them go both for if he be taken the regiment will break loose and gut the valley our villages are in the valley and we shall not escape that regiment are devils they broke khoda yars breastbone with kicks when he tried to take the rifles and if we touch this child they will fire and rape and plunder for a month till nothing remains better to send a man back to take the message and get a reward i say that this child is their god and that they will spare none of us nor our women if we harm him  it was din mahommed the dismissed groom of the colonel who made the diversion and an angry and heated discussion followed wee willie winkie standing over miss allardyce waited the upshot surely his wegiment his own wegiment would not desert him if they knew of his extremity                                the riderless pony brought the news to the 195th though there had been consternation in the colonels household for an hour before the little beast came in through the paradeground in front of the main barracks where the men were settling down to play spoilfive till the afternoon devlin the coloursergeant of e company glanced at the empty saddle and tumbled through the barrackrooms kicking up each room corporal as he passed up ye beggars theres something happened to the colonels son he shouted  he couldnt fall off selp me e couldnt fall off blubbered a drummerboy go an hunt acrost the river hes over there if hes anywhere an maybe those pathans have got im for the love o gawd dont look for im in the nullahs lets go over the river  theres sense in mott yet said devlin e company double out to the riversharp  so e company in its shirtsleeves mainly doubled for the dear life and in the rear toiled the perspiring sergeant adjuring it to double yet faster the cantonment was alive with the men of the 195th hunting for wee willie winkie and the colonel finally overtook e company far too exhausted to swear struggling in the pebbles of the riverbed  up the hill under which wee willie winkies bad men were discussing the wisdom of carrying off the child and the girl a lookout fired two shots  what have i said shouted din mahommed there is the warning the pulton are out already and are coming across the plain get away let us not be seen with the boy  the men waited for an instant and then as another shot was fired withdrew into the hills silently as they had appeared  the wegiment is coming said wee willie winkie confidently to miss allardyce and its all wight dont cwy  he needed the advice himself for ten minutes later when his father came up he was weeping bitterly with his head in miss allardyces lap  and the men of the 195th carried him home with shouts and rejoicings and coppy who had ridden a horse into a lather met him and to his intense disgust kissed him openly in the presence of the men  but there was balm for his dignity his father assured him that not only would the breaking of arrest be condoned but that the goodconduct badge would be restored as soon as his mother could sew it on his blousesleeve miss allardyce had told the colonel a story that made him proud of his son  she belonged to you coppy said wee willie winkie indicating miss allardyce with a grimy forefinger i knew she didnt ought to go acwoss ve wiver and i knew ve wegiment would come to me if i sent jack home  youre a hero winkie said coppya pukka hero  i dont know what vat means said wee willie winkie but you mustnt call me winkie any no more im percival willam willams  and in this manner did wee willie winkie enter into his manhood     a matter of fact            and if ye doubt the tale i tell           steer through the south pacific swell           go where the branching coral hives           unending strife of endless lives           where leagued about the wildered boat           the rainbow jellies fill and float           and lilting where the laver lingers           the starfish trips on all her fingers           where neath his myriad spines ashock           the seaegg ripples down the rock           an orange wonder dimly guessed           from darkness where the cuttles rest           moored oer the darker deeps that hide           the blind white seasnake and his bride           who drowsing nose the longlost ships           let down through darkness to their lips                                               the palms  once a priest always a priest once a mason always a mason but once a journalist always and for ever a journalist  there were three of us all newspaper men the only passengers on a little tramp steamer that ran where her owners told her to go she had once been in the bilbao iron ore business had been lent to the spanish government for service at manilla and was ending her days in the cape town coolietrade with occasional trips to madagascar and even as far as england we found her going to southampton in ballast and shipped in her because the fares were nominal there was keller of an american paper on his way back to the states from palace executions in madagascar there was a burly halfdutchman called zuyland who owned and edited a paper up country near johannesburg and there was myself who had solemnly put away all journalism vowing to forget that i had ever known the difference between an imprint and a stereo advertisement  ten minutes after keller spoke to me as the rathmines cleared cape town i had forgotten the aloofness i desired to feign and was in heated discussion on the immorality of expanding telegrams beyond a certain fixed point then zuyland came out of his cabin and we were all at home instantly because we were men of the same profession needing no introduction we annexed the boat formally broke open the passengers bathroom dooron the manilla lines the dons do not washcleaned out the orange peel and cigarends at the bottom of the bath hired a lascar to shave us throughout the voyage and then asked each others names  three ordinary men would have quarrelled through sheer boredom before they reached southampton we by virtue of our craft were anything but ordinary men a large percentage of the tales of the world the thirtynine that cannot be told to ladies and the one that can are common property coming of a common stock we told them all as a matter of form with all their local and specific variants which are surprising then came in the intervals of steady cardplay more personal histories of adventure and things seen and suffered panics among white folk when the blind terror ran from man to man on the brooklyn bridge and the people crushed each other to death they knew not why fires and faces that opened and shut their mouths horribly at redhot window frames wrecks in frost and snow reported from the sleetsheathed rescuetug at the risk of frostbite long rides after diamond thieves skirmishes on the veldt and in municipal committees with the boers glimpses of lazy tangled cape politics and the mulerule in the transvaal cardtales horsetales womantales by the score and the half hundred till the first mate who had seen more than us all put together but lacked words to clothe his tales with sat openmouthed far into the dawn  when the tales were done we picked up cards till a curious hand or a chance remark made one or other of us say that reminds me of a man whoor a business which and the anecdotes would continue while the rathmines kicked her way northward through the warm water  in the morning of one specially warm night we three were sitting immediately in front of the wheelhouse where an old swedish boatswain whom we called frithiof the dane was at the wheel pretending that he could not hear our stories once or twice frithiof spun the spokes curiously and keller lifted his head from a long chair to ask what is it cant you get any steerageway on her  there is a feel in the water said frithiof that i cannot understand i think that we run downhills or somethings she steers bad this morning  nobody seems to know the laws that govern the pulse of the big waters sometimes even a landsman can tell that the solid ocean is atilt and that the ship is working herself up a long unseen slope and sometimes the captain says when neither full steam nor fair wind justifies the length of a days run that the ship is sagging downhill but how these ups and downs come about has not yet been settled authoritatively  no it is a following sea said frithiof and with a following sea you shall not get good steerageway  the sea was as smooth as a duckpond except for a regular oily swell as i looked over the side to see where it might be following us from the sun rose in a perfectly clear sky and struck the water with its light so sharply that it seemed as though the sea should clang like a burnished gong the wake of the screw and the little white streak cut by the logline hanging over the stern were the only marks on the water as far as eye could reach  keller rolled out of his chair and went aft to get a pineapple from the ripening stock that was hung inside the after awning  frithiof the logline has got tired of swimming its coming home he drawled  what said frithiof his voice jumping several octaves  coming home keller repeated leaning over the stern i ran to his side and saw the logline which till then had been drawn tense over the stern railing slacken loop and come up off the port quarter frithiof called up the speaking tube to the bridge and the bridge answered yes nine knots then frithiof spoke again and the answer was what do you want of the skipper and frithiof bellowed call him up  by this time zuyland keller and myself had caught something of frithiofs excitement for any emotion on shipboard is most contagious the captain ran out of his cabin spoke to frithiof looked at the logline jumped on the bridge and in a minute we felt the steamer swing round as frithiof turned her  going back to cape town said keller  frithiof did not answer but tore away at the wheel then he beckoned us three to help and we held the wheel down till the rathmines answered it and we found ourselves looking into the white of our own wake with the still oily sea tearing past our bows though we were not going more than half steam ahead  the captain stretched out his arm from the bridge and shouted a minute later i would have given a great deal to have shouted too for onehalf of the sea seemed to shoulder itself above the other half and came on in the shape of a hill there was neither crest comb nor curlover to it nothing but black water with little waves chasing each other about the flanks i saw it stream past and on a level with the rathmines bowplates before the steamer hove up her bulk to rise and i argued that this would be the last of all earthly voyages for me then we lifted for ever and ever and ever till i heard keller saying in my ear the bowels of the deep good lord and the rathmines stood poised her screwracing and drumming on the slope of a hollow that stretched downwards for a good halfmile  we went down that hollow nose under for the most part and the air smelt wet and muddy like that of an emptied aquarium there was a second hill to climb i saw that much but the water came aboard and earned me aft till it jammed me against the wheelhouse door and before i could catch breath or clear my eyes again we were rolling to and fro in torn water with the scuppers pouring like eaves in a thunderstorm  there were three waves said keller and the stokeholds flooded  the firemen were on deck waiting apparently to be drowned the engineer came and dragged them below and the crew gasping began to work the clumsy board of trade pump that showed nothing serious and when i understood that the rathmines was really on the water and not beneath it i asked what had happened  the captain says it was a blowup under the seaa volcano said keller  it hasnt warmed anything i said i was feeling bitterly cold and cold was almost unknown in those waters i went below to change my clothes and when i came up everything was wiped out in clinging white fog  are there going to be any more surprises said keller to the captain  i dont know be thankful you are alive gentlemen thats a tidal wave thrown up by a volcano probably the bottom of the sea has been lifted a few feet somewhere or other i cant quite understand this cold spell our seathermometer says the surface water is 44° and it should be 68° at least  its abominable said keller shivering but hadnt you better attend to the foghorn it seems to me that i heard something  heard good heavens said the captain from the bridge i should think you did he pulled the string of our foghorn which was a weak one it sputtered and choked because the stokehold was full of water and the fires were half drowned and at last gave out a moan it was answered from the fog by one of the most appalling steam sirens i have ever heard keller turned as white as i did for the fog the cold fog was upon us and any man may be forgiven for fearing a death he cannot see  give her steam there said the captain to the engineroom steam for the whistle if we have to go dead slow  we bellowed again and the damp dripped off the awnings on to the deck as we listened for the reply it seemed to be astern this time but much nearer than before  the pembroke castle on us said keller and then viciously well thank god we shall sink her too  its a sidewheel steamer i whispered  cant you hear the paddles  this time we whistled and roared till the steam gave out and the answer nearly deafened us there was a sound of frantic threshing in the water apparently about fifty yards away and something shot past in the whiteness that looked as though it were gray and red  the pembroke castle bottom up said keller who being a journalist always sought for explanations thats the colours of a castle liner were in for a big thing  the sea is bewitched said frithiof from the wheelhouse there are two steamers  another siren sounded on our bow and the little steamer rolled in the wash of something that had passed unseen  were evidently in the middle of a fleet said keller quietly if one doesnt run us down the other will phew what in creation is that  i sniffed for there was a poisonous rank smell in the cold aira smell that i had smelt before  if i was on land i should say that it was an alligator it smells like musk i answered  not ten thousand alligators could make that smell said zuyland i have smelt them  bewitched bewitched said frithiof the sea she is turned upside down and we are walking along the bottom  again the rathmines rolled in the wash of some unseen ship and a silvergray wave broke over the bow leaving on the deck a sheet of sedimentthe gray broth that has its place in the fathomless deeps of the sea a sprinkling of the wave fell on my face and it was so cold that it stung as boiling water stings the dead and most untouched deep water of the sea had been heaved to the top by the submarine volcanothe chill still water that kills all life and smells of desolation and emptiness we did not need either the blinding fog or that indescribable smell of musk to make us unhappywe were shivering with cold and wretchedness where we stood  the hot air on the cold water makes this fog said the captain it ought to clear in a little time  whistle oh whistle and lets get out of it said keller  the captain whistled again and far and far astern the invisible twin steamsirens answered us their blasting shriek grew louder till at last it seemed to tear out of the fog just above our quarter and i cowered while the rathmines plunged bows under on a double swell that crossed  no more said frithiof it is not good any more let us get away in the name of god  now if a torpedoboat with a city of paris siren went mad and broke her moorings and hired a friend to help her its just conceivable that we might be carried as we are now otherwise this thing is  the last words died on kellers lips his eyes began to start from his head and his jaw fell some six or seven feet above the port bulwarks framed in fog and as utterly unsupported as the full moon hung a face it was not human and it certainly was not animal for it did not belong to this earth as known to man the mouth was open revealing a ridiculously tiny tongueas absurd as the tongue of an elephant there were tense wrinkles of white skin at the angles of the drawn lips white feelers like those of a barbel sprung from the lower jaw and there was no sign of teeth within the mouth but the horror of the face lay in the eyes for those were sightlesswhite in sockets as white as scraped bone and blind yet for all this the face wrinkled as the mask of a lion is drawn in assyrian sculpture was alive with rage and terror one long white feeler touched our bulwarks then the face disappeared with the swiftness of a blindworm popping into its burrow and the next thing that i remember is my own voice in my own ears saying gravely to the mainmast but the airbladder ought to have been forced out of its mouth you know  keller came up to me ashy white he put his hand into his pocket took a cigar bit it dropped it thrust his shaking thumb into his mouth and mumbled the giant gooseberry and the raining frogs gimme a lightgimme a light say gimme a light a little bead of blood dropped from his thumbjoint  i respected the motive though the manifestation was absurd stop youll bite your thumb off i said and keller laughed brokenly as he picked up his cigar only zuyland leaning over the port bulwarks seemed selfpossessed he declared later that he was very sick  weve seen it he said turning round that is it  what said keller chewing the unlighted cigar  as he spoke the fog was blown into shreds and we saw the sea gray with mud rolling on every side of us and empty of all life then in one spot it bubbled and became like the pot of ointment that the bible speaks of from that wideringed trouble the thing came upa gray and red thing with a necka thing that bellowed and writhed in pain frithiof drew in his breath and held it till the red letters of the ships name woven across his jersey straggled and opened out as though they had been type badly set then he said with a little cluck in his throat ah me it is blind hur illa that thing is blind and a murmur of pity went through us all for we could see that the thing on the water was blind and in pain something had gashed and cut the great sides cruelly and the blood was spurting out the gray ooze of the undermost sea lay in the monstrous wrinkles of the back and poured away in sluices the blind white head flung back and battered the wounds and the body in its torment rose clear of the red and gray waves till we saw a pair of quivering shoulders streaked with weed and rough with shells but as white in the clear spaces as the hairless maneless blind toothless head afterwards came a dot on the horizon and the sound of a shrill scream and it was as though a shuttle shot all across the sea in one breath and a second head and neck tore through the levels driving a whispering wall of water to right and left the two things metthe one untouched and the other in its deaththroemale and female we said the female coming to the male she circled round him bellowing and laid her neck across the curve of his great turtleback and he disappeared under water for an instant but flung up again grunting in agony while the blood ran once the entire head and neck shot clear of the water and stiffened and  i  heard  keller saying as though he was watching a street accident give him air for gods sake give him air then the deathstruggle began with crampings and twistings and jerkings of the white bulk to and fro till our little steamer rolled again and each gray wave coated her plates with the gray slime the sun was clear there  was  no  wind and  we  watched the whole crew stokers and all in wonder and pity but chiefly pity the thing was so helpless and save for his mate so alone no human eye should have beheld him it was monstrous and indecent to exhibit him there in trade waters between atlas degrees of latitude he had been spewed up mangled and dying from his rest on the seafloor where he might have lived till the judgment day and we saw the tides of his life go from him as an angry tide goes out across rocks in the teeth of a landward gale his mate lay rocking on the water a little distance off bellowing continually and the smell of musk came dawn upon the ship making us cough  at last the battle for life ended in a batter of coloured seas we saw the writhing neck fall like a flail the carcase turn sideways showing the glint of a white belly and the inset of a gigantic hind leg or flipper then all sank and sea boiled over it while the mate swam round and round darting her head in every direction though we might have feared that she would attack the steamer no power on earth could have drawn any one of us from our places that hour we watched holding our breaths the mate paused in her search we could hear the wash beating along her sides reared her neck as high as she could reach blind and lonely in all that loneliness of the sea and sent one desperate bellow booming across the swells as an oystershell skips across a pond then she made off to the westward the sun shining on the white head and the wake behind it till nothing was left to see but a little pin point of silver on the horizon we stood on our course again and the rathmines coated with the seasediment from bow to stern looked like a ship made gray with terror                                       we must pool our notes was the first coherent remark from keller were three trained journalistswe hold absolutely the biggest scoop on record start fair  i objected to this nothing is gained by collaboration in journalism when all deal with the same facts so we went to work each according to his own lights keller tripleheaded his account talked about our gallant captain and wound up with an allusion to american enterprise in that it was a citizen of dayton ohio that had seen the seaserpent this sort of thing would have discredited the creation much more a mere sea tale but as a specimen of the picturewriting of a halfcivilised people it was very interesting zuyland took a heavy column and a half giving approximate lengths and breadths and the whole list of the crew whom he had sworn on oath to testify to his facts there was nothing fantastic or flamboyant in zuyland i wrote threequarters of a leaded bourgeois column roughly speaking and refrained from putting any journalese into it for reasons that had begun to appear to me  keller was insolent with joy he was going to cable from southampton to the new york world mail his account to america on the same day paralyse london with his three columns of loosely knitted headlines and generally efface the earth youll see how i work a big scoop when i get it he said  is this your first visit to england i asked  yes said he you dont seem to appreciate the beauty of our scoop its pyramidalthe death of the seaserpent good heavens alive man its the biggest thing ever vouchsafed to a paper  curious to think that it will never appear in any paper isnt it i said  zuyland was near me and he nodded quickly  what do you mean said keller if youre enough of a britisher to throw this thing away i shant i thought you were a newspaperman  i am thats why i know dont be an ass keller remember im seven hundred years your senior and what your grandchildren may learn five hundred years hence i learned from my grandfathers about five hundred years ago you wont do it because you cant  this conversation was held in open sea where everything seems possible some hundred miles from southampton we passed the needles light at dawn and the lifting day showed the stucco villas on the green and the awful orderliness of englandline upon line wall upon wall solid stone dock and monolithic pier we waited an hour in the customs shed and there was ample time for the effect to soak in  now keller you face the music the havel goes out today mail by her and ill take you to the telegraphoffice i said  i heard keller gasp as the influence of the land closed about him cowing him as they say newmarket heath cows a young horse unused to open courses  i want to retouch my stuff suppose we wait till we get to london he said  zuyland by the way had torn up his account and thrown it  overboard that morning early his reasons were my reasons  in the train keller began to revise his copy and every time that he looked at the trim little fields the red villas and the embankments of the line the blue pencil plunged remorselessly through the slips he appeared to have dredged the dictionary for adjectives i could think of none that he had not used yet he was a perfectly sound pokerplayer and never showed more cards than were sufficient to take the pool  arent you going to leave him a single bellow i asked sympathetically remember everything goes in the states from a trouserbutton to a doubleeagle  thats just the curse of it said keller below his breath weve played em for suckers so often that when it comes to the golden truthid like to try this on a london paper you have first call there though  not in the least im not touching the thing in our papers i shall be happy to leave em all to you but surely youll cable it home  no not if i can make the scoop here and see the britishers sit up  you wont do it with three columns of slushy headline believe me they dont sit up as quickly as some people  im beginning to think that too does nothing make any difference in this country he said looking out of the window how old is that farmhouse  new it cant be more than two hundred years at the most  urn fields too  that hedge there must have been clipped for about eighty years  labour cheapeh  pretty much well i suppose youd like to try the times wouldnt you  no said keller looking at winchester cathedral might as well try to electrify a haystack and to think that the world would take three columns and ask for morewith illustrations too its sickening  but the times might i began  keller flung his paper across the carriage and it opened in its austere majesty of solid typeopened with the crackle of an encyclopædia  might you might work your way through the bowplates of a cruiser look at that first page  it strikes you that way does it i said then id recommend you to try a light and frivolous journal  with a thing like this of mineof ours its sacred history  i showed him a paper which i conceived would be after his own heart in that it was modelled on american lines  thats homey he said but its not the real thing now i should like one of these fat old times columns probably thered be a bishop in the office though  when we reached london keller disappeared in the direction of the strand what his experiences may have been i cannot tell but it seems that he invaded the office of an evening paper at 1145 am i told him english editors were most idle at that hour and mentioned my name as that of a witness to the truth of his story  i was nearly fired out he said furiously at lunch as soon as i mentioned you the old man said that i was to tell you that they didnt want any more of your practical jokes and that you knew the hours to call if you had anything to sell and that theyd see you condemned before they helped to puff one of your infernal yarns in advance say what record do you hold for truth in this country anyway  a beauty you ran up against it thats all why dont you leave the english papers alone and cable to new york everything goes over there  cant you see thats just why he repeated  i saw it a long time ago you dont intend to cable then  yes i do he answered in the overemphatic voice of one who does not know his own mind  that afternoon i walked him abroad and about over the streets that run between the pavements like channels of grooved and tongued lava over the bridges that are made of enduring stone through subways floored and sided with yardthick concrete between houses that are never rebuilt and by river steps hewn to the eye from the living rock a black fog chased us into westminster abbey and standing there in the darkness i could hear the wings of the dead centuries circling round the head of litchfield a keller journalist of dayton ohio usa whose mission it was to make the britishers sit up  he stumbled gasping into the thick gloom and the roar of the traffic came to his bewildered ears  lets go to the telegraphoffice and cable i said cant you hear the new york world crying for news of the great seaserpent blind white and smelling of musk stricken to death by a submarine volcano and assisted by his loving wife to die in midocean as visualised by an american citizen the breezy newsy brainy newspaper man of dayton ohio rah for the buckeye state step lively both gates szz boom aah keller was a princeton man and he seemed to need encouragement  youve got me on your own ground said he tugging at his overcoat pocket he pulled out his copy with the cable formsfor he had written out his telegramand put them all into my hand groaning i pass if i hadnt come to your cursed countryif id sent it off at southamptonif i ever get you west of the alleghannies if  never mind keller it isnt your fault its the fault of your country if you had been seven hundred years older youd have done what i am going to do  what are you going to do  tell it as a lie  fiction this with the fullblooded disgust of a journalist for the illegitimate branch of the profession  you can call it that if you like i shall call it a lie  and a lie it has become for truth is a naked lady and if by accident she is drawn up from the bottom of the sea it behoves a gentleman either to give her a print petticoat or to turn his face to the wall and vow that he did not see     mowglis brothers          now chil the kite brings home the night           that mang the bat sets free         the herds are shut in byre and hut           for loosed till dawn are we         this is the hour of pride and power           talon and tush and claw         oh hear the callgood hunting all           that keep the jungle law                       nightsong in the jungle  it was seven oclock of a very warm evening in the seeonee hills when father wolf woke up from his days rest scratched himself yawned and spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling in their tips mother wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her four tumbling squealing cubs and the moon shone into the mouth of the cave where they all lived augrh said father wolf it is time to hunt again and he was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined good luck go with you o chief of the wolves and good luck and strong white teeth go with the noble children that they may never forget the hungry in this world  it was the jackaltabaqui the dishlickerand the wolves of india despise tabaqui because he runs about making mischief and telling tales and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village rubbishheaps but they are afraid of him too because tabaqui more than any one else in the jungle is apt to go mad and then he forgets that he was ever afraid of any one and runs through the forest biting everything in his way even the tiger runs and hides when little tabaqui goes mad for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake a wild creature we call it hydrophobia but they call it dewaneethe madnessand run  enter then and look said father wolf stiffly but there is no food here  for a wolf no said tabaqui but for so mean a person as myself a dry bone is a good feast who are we the gidurlog the jackal people to pick and choose he scuttled to the back of the cave where he found the bone of a buck with some meat on it and sat cracking the end merrily  all thanks for this good meal he said licking his lips how beautiful are the noble children how large are their eyes and so young too indeed indeed i might have remembered that the children of kings are men from the beginning  now tabaqui knew as well as any one else that there is nothing so unlucky as to compliment children to their faces and it pleased him to see mother and father wolf look uncomfortable  tabaqui sat still rejoicing in the mischief that he had made and then he said spitefully  shere khan the big one has shifted his huntinggrounds he will hunt among these hills for the next moon so he has told me  shere khan was the tiger who lived near the waingunga river twenty miles away  he has no right father wolf began angrilyby the law of the jungle he has no right to change his quarters without due warning he will frighten every head of game within ten miles and ii have to kill for two these days  his mother did not call him lungri the lame one for nothing said mother wolf quietly he has been lame in one foot from his birth that is why he has only killed cattle now the villagers of the waingunga are angry with him and he has come here to make our villagers angry they will scour the jungle for him when he is far away and we and our children must run when the grass is set alight indeed we are very grateful to shere khan  shall i tell him of your gratitude said tabaqui  out snapped father wolf out and hunt with thy master thou hast done harm enough for one night  i go said tabaqui quietly ye can hear shere khan below in the thickets i might have saved myself the message  father wolf listened and below in the valley that ran down to a little river he heard the dry angry snarly singsong whine of a tiger who has caught nothing and does not care if all the jungle knows it  the fool said father wolf to begin a nights work with that noise does he think that our buck are like his fat waingunga bullocks  hsh it is neither bullock nor buck he hunts tonight said mother wolf it is man the whine had changed to a sort of humming purr that seemed to come from every quarter of the compass it was the noise that bewilders woodcutters and gipsies sleeping in the open and makes them run sometimes into the very mouth of the tiger  man said father wolf showing all his white teeth faugh are there not enough beetles and frogs in the tanks that he must eat man and on our ground too  the law of the jungle which never orders anything without a reason forbids every beast to eat man except when he is killing to show his children how to kill and then he must hunt outside the huntinggrounds of his pack or tribe the real reason for this is that mankilling means sooner or later the arrival of white men on elephants with guns and hundreds of brown men with gongs and rockets and torches then everybody in the jungle suffers the reason the beasts give among themselves is that man is the weakest and most defenceless of all living things and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him they say tooand it is truethat maneaters become mangy and lose their teeth  the purr grew louder and ended in the fullthroated aaarh of the tigers charge  then there was a howlan untigerish howlfrom shere khan  he has missed said mother wolf what is it  father wolf ran out a few paces and heard shere khan muttering and mumbling savagely as he tumbled about in the scrub  the fool has had no more sense than to jump at a woodcutters campfire and has burned his feet said father wolf with a grunt tabaqui is with him  something is coming up hill said mother wolf twitching one ear get ready  the bushes rustled a little in the thicket and father wolf dropped with his haunches under him ready for his leap then if you had been watching you would have seen the most wonderful thing in the worldthe wolf checked in mid spring he made his bound before he saw what it was he was jumping at and then he tried to stop himself the result was that he shot up straight into the air for four or five feet landing almost where he left ground  man he snapped a mans cub look  directly in front of him holding on by a low branch stood a naked brown baby who could just walkas soft and as dimpled a little atom as ever came to a wolfs cave at night he looked up into father wolfs face and laughed  is that a mans cub said mother wolf i have never seen one bring it here  a wolf accustomed to moving his own cubs can if necessary mouth an egg without breaking it and though father wolfs jaws closed right on the childs back not a tooth even scratched the skin as he laid it down among the cubs  how little how naked andhow bold said mother wolf softly the baby was pushing his way between the cubs to get close to the warm hide ahai he is taking his meal with the others and so this is a mans cub now was there ever a wolf that could boast of a mans cub among her children  i have heard now and again of such a thing but never in our pack or in my time said father wolf he is altogether without hair and i could kill him with a touch of my foot but see he looks up and is not afraid  the moonlight was blocked out of the mouth of the cave for shere khans great square head and shoulders were thrust into the entrance tabaqui behind him was squeaking my lord my lord it went in here  shere khan does us great honour said father wolf but his eyes were very angry what does shere khan need  my quarry a mans cub went this way said shere khan its parents have run off give it to me  shere khan had jumped at a woodcutters campfire as father wolf had said and was furious from the pain of his burned feet but father wolf knew that the mouth of the cave was too narrow for a tiger to come in by even where he was shere khans shoulders and fore paws were cramped for want of room as a mans would be if he tried to fight in a barrel  the wolves are a free people said father wolf they take orders from the head of the pack and not from any striped cattledealer the mans cub is oursto kill if we choose  ye choose and ye do not choose what talk is this of choosing by the bull that i killed am i to stand nosing into your dogs den for my fair dues it is i shere khan who speak  the tigers roar filled the cave with thunder mother wolf shook herself clear of the cubs and sprang forward her eyes like two green moons in the darkness facing the blazing eyes of shere khan  and it is i raksha the demon who answer the mans cub is mine lungrimine to me he shall not be killed he shall live to run with the pack and to hunt with the pack and in the end look you hunter of little naked cubsfrogeaterfishkillerhe shall hunt thee now get hence or by the sambhur that i killed i eat no starved cattle back thou goest to thy mother burned beast of the jungle lamer than ever thou earnest into the world go  father wolf looked on amazed he had almost forgotten the days when he had won mother wolf in fair fight from five other wolves when she ran in the pack and was not called the demon for compliments sake shere khan might have faced father wolf but he could not stand up against mother wolf for he knew that where he was she had all the advantage of the ground and would fight to the death so he backed out of the cavemouth growling and when he was clear he shouted  each dog barks in his own yard we will see what the pack will say to this fostering of mancubs the cub is mine and to my teeth he will come in the end o bushtailed thieves  mother wolf threw herself down panting among the cubs and father wolf said to her gravely  shere khan speaks this much truth the cub must be shown to the pack wilt thou still keep him mother  keep him she gasped he came naked by night alone and very hungry yet he was not afraid look he has pushed one of my babes to one side already and that lame butcher would have killed him and would have run off to the waingunga while the villagers here hunted through all our lairs in revenge keep him assuredly i will keep him lie still little frog o thou mowglifor mowgli the frog i will call theethe time will come when thou wilt hunt shere khan as he has hunted thee but what will our pack say said father wolf the law of the jungle lays down very clearly that any wolf may when he marries withdraw from the pack he belongs to but as soon as his cubs are old enough to stand on their feet he must bring them to the pack council which is generally held once a month at full moon in order that the other wolves may identify them after that inspection the cubs are free to run where they please and until they have killed their first buck no excuse is accepted if a grown wolf of the pack kills one of them the punishment is death where the murderer can be found and if you think for a minute you will see that this must be so father wolf waited till his cubs could run a little and then on the night of the pack meeting took them and mowgli and mother wolf to the council rocka hilltop covered with stones and boulders where a hundred wolves could hide akela the great gray lone wolf who led all the pack by strength and cunning lay out at full length on his rock and below him sat forty or more wolves of every size and colour from badgercoloured veterans who could handle a buck alone to young black threeyearolds who thought they could the lone wolf had led them for a year now he had fallen twice into a wolftrap in his youth and once he had been beaten and left for dead so he knew the manners and customs of men there was very little talking at the rock the cubs tumbled over each other in the centre of the circle where their mothers and fathers sat and now and again a senior wolf would go quietly up to a cub look at him carefully and return to his place on noiseless feet sometimes a mother would push her cub far out into the moonlight to be sure that he had not been overlooked akela from his rock would cry ye know the lawye know the law look well o wolves and the anxious mothers would take up the call looklook well o wolves  at lastand mother wolfs neckbristles lifted as the time camefather wolf pushed mowgli the frog as they called him into the centre where he sat laughing and playing with some pebbles that glistened in the moonlight  akela never raised his head from his paws but went on with the monotonous cry look well a muffled roar came up from behind the rocksthe voice of shere khan crying the cub is mine give him to me what have the free people to do with a mans cub akela never even twitched his ears all he said was look well o wolves what have the free people to do with the orders of any save the free people look well  there was a chorus of deep growls and a young wolf in his fourth year flung back shere khans question to akela what have the free people to do with a mans cub now the law of the jungle lays down that if there is any dispute as to the right of a cub to be accepted by the pack he must be spoken for by at least two members of the pack who are not his father and mother  who speaks for this cub said akela among the free people who speaks there was no answer and mother wolf got ready for what she knew would be her last fight if things came to fighting  then the only other creature who is allowed at the pack councilbaloo the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the law of the jungle old baloo who can come and go where he pleases because he eats only nuts and roots and honeyrose up on his hind quarters and grunted  the mans cubthe mans cub he said i speak for the mans cub there is no harm in a mans cub i have no gift of words but i speak the truth let him run with the pack and be entered with the others i myself will teach him  we need yet another said akela baloo has spoken and he is our teacher for the young cubs who speaks beside baloo  a black shadow dropped down into the circle it was bagheera the black panther inky black all over but with the panther markings showing up in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk everybody knew bagheera and nobody cared to cross his path for he was as cunning as tabaqui as bold as the wild buffalo and as reckless as the wounded elephant but he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree and a skin softer than down  o akela and ye the free people he purred i have no right in your assembly but the law of the jungle says that if there is a doubt which is not a killing matter in regard to a new cub the life of that cub may be bought at a price and the law does not say who may or may not pay that price am i right  good good said the young wolves who are always hungry listen to bagheera the cub can be bought for a price it is the law  knowing that i have no right to speak here i ask your leave  speak then cried twenty voices  to kill a naked cub is shame besides he may make better sport for you when he is grown baloo has spoken in his behalf now to baloos word i will add one bull and a fat one newly killed not half a mile from here if ye will accept the mans cub according to the law is it difficult  there was a clamour of scores of voices saying what matter he will die in the winter rains he will scorch in the sun what harm can a naked frog do us let him run with the pack where is the bull bagheera let him be accepted and then came akelas deep bay crying look welllook well o wolves  mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles and he did not notice when the wolves came and looked at him one by one at last they all went down the hill for the dead bull and only akela bagheera baloo and mowglis own wolves were left shere khan roared still in the night for he was very angry that mowgli had not been handed over to him  ay roar well said bagheera under his whiskers for the time comes when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune or i know nothing of man  it was well done said akela men and their cubs are very wise he may be a help in time  truly a help in time of need for none can hope to lead the pack for ever said bagheera  akela said nothing he was thinking of the time that comes to every leader of every pack when his strength goes from him and he gets feebler and feebler till at last he is killed by the wolves and a new leader comes upto be killed in his turn  take him away he said to father wolf and train him as befits one of the free people  and that is how mowgli was entered into the seeonee wolfpack for the price of a bull and on baloos good word                                       now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years and only guess at all the wonderful life mowgli led among the wolves because if it were written out it would fill ever so many books he grew up with the cubs though they of course were grown wolves almost before he was a child and father wolf taught him his business and the meaning of things in the jungle till every rustle in the grass every breath of the warm night air every note of the owls above his head every scratch of a bats claws as it roosted for a while in a tree and every splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant just as much to him as the work of his office means to a business man when he was not learning he sat out in the sun and slept and ate and went to sleep again when he felt dirty or hot he swam in the forest pools and when he wanted honey baloo told him that honey and nuts were just as pleasant to eat as raw meat he climbed up for it and that bagheera showed him how to do bagheera would lie out on a branch and call come along little brother and at first mowgli would cling like the sloth but afterward he would fling himself through the branches almost as boldly as the gray ape he took his place at the council rock too when the pack met and there he discovered that if he stared hard at any wolf the wolf would be forced to drop his eyes and so he used to stare for fun at other times he would pick the long thorns out of the pads of his friends for wolves suffer terribly from thorns and burs in their coats he would go down the hillside into the cultivated lands by night and look very curiously at the villagers in their huts but he had a mistrust of men because bagheera showed him a square box with a dropgate so cunningly hidden in the jungle that he nearly walked into it and told him that it was a trap he loved better than anything else to go with bagheera into the dark warm heart of the forest to sleep all through the drowsy day and at night see how bagheera did his killing bagheera killed right and left as he felt hungry and so did mowgliwith one exception as soon as he was old enough to understand things bagheera told him that he must never touch cattle because he had been bought into the pack at the price of a bulls life all the jungle is thine said bagheera and thou canst kill everything that thou art strong enough to kill but for the sake of the bull that bought thee thou must never kill or eat any cattle young or old that is the law of the jungle mowgli obeyed faithfully  and he grew and grew strong as a boy must grow who does not know that he is learning any lessons and who has nothing in the world to think of except things to eat  mother wolf told him once or twice that shere khan was not a creature to be trusted and that some day he must kill shere khan but though a young wolf would have remembered that advice every hour mowgli forgot it because he was only a boythough he would have called himself a wolf if he had been able to speak in any human tongue  shere khan was always crossing his path in the jungle for as akela grew older and feebler the lame tiger had come to be great friends with the younger wolves of the pack who followed him for scraps a thing akela would never have allowed if he had dared to push his authority to the proper bounds then shere khan would flatter them and wonder that such fine young hunters were content to be led by a dying wolf and a mans cub they tell me shere khan would say that at council ye dare not look him between the eyes and the young wolves would growl and bristle  bagheera who had eyes and ears everywhere knew something of this and once or twice he told mowgli in so many words that shere khan would kill him some day and mowgli would laugh and answer i have the pack and i have thee and baloo though he is so lazy might strike a blow or two for my sake why should i be afraid  it was one very warm day that a new notion came to bagheeraborn of something that he had heard perhaps sahi the porcupine had told him but he said to mowgli when they were deep in the jungle as the boy lay with his head on bagheeras beautiful black skin little brother how often have i told thee that shere khan is thy enemy  as many times as there are nuts on that palm said mowgli who naturally could not count what of it i am sleepy bagheera and shere khan is all long tail and loud talklike mor the peacock  but this is no time for sleeping baloo knows it i know it the pack know it and even the foolish foolish deer know tabaqui has told thee too  ho ho said mowgli tabaqui came to me not long ago with some rude talk that i was a naked mans cub and not fit to dig pignuts but i caught tabaqui by the tail and swung him twice against a palmtree to teach him better manners  that was foolishness for though tabaqui is a mischiefmaker he would have told thee of something that concerned thee closely open those eyes little brother shere khan dare not kill thee in the jungle but remember akela is very old and soon the day comes when he cannot kill his buck and then he will be leader no more many of the wolves that looked thee over when thou wast brought to the council first are old too and the young wolves believe as shere khan has taught them that a mancub has no place with the pack in a little time thou wilt be a man  and what is a man that he should not run with his brothers said mowgli i was born in the jungle i have obeyed the law of the jungle and there is no wolf of ours from whose paws i have not pulled a thorn surely they are my brothers  bagheera stretched himself at full length and half shut his eyes little brother said he feel under my jaw  mowgli put up his strong brown hand and just under bagheeras silky chin where the giant rolling muscles were all hid by the glossy hair he came upon a little bald spot  there is no one in the jungle that knows that i bagheera carry that markthe mark of the collar and yet little brother i was born among men and it was among men that my mother diedin the cages of the kings palace at oodeypore it was because of this that i paid the price for thee at the council when thou wast a little naked cub yes i too was born among men i had never seen the jungle they fed me behind bars from an iron pan till one night i felt that i was bagheerathe pantherand no mans plaything and i broke the silly lock with one blow of my paw and came away and because i had learned the ways of men i became more terrible in the jungle than shere khan is it not so  yes said mowgli all the jungle fear bagheeraall except mowgli  oh thou art a mans cub said the black panther very tenderly and even as i returned to my jungle so thou must go back to men at lastto the men who are thy brothersif thou art not killed in the council  but whybut why should any wish to kill me said mowgli  look at me said bagheera and mowgli looked at him steadily between the eyes the big panther turned his head away in half a minute  that is why he said shifting his paw on the leaves not even i can look thee between the eyes and i was born among men and i love thee little brother the others they hate thee because their eyes cannot meet thine because thou art wise because thou hast pulled out thorns from their feetbecause thou art a man  i did not know these things said mowgli sullenly and he frowned under his heavy black eyebrows  what is the law of the jungle strike first and then give tongue by thy very carelessness they know that thou art a man but be wise it is in my heart that when akela misses his next killand at each hunt it costs him more to pin the buckthe pack will turn against him and against thee they will hold a jungle council at the rock and thenand theni have it said bagheera leaping up go thou down quickly to the mens huts in the valley and take some of the red flower which they grow there so that when the time comes thou mayest have even a stronger friend than i or baloo or those of the pack that love thee get the red flower  by red flower bagheera meant fire only no creature in the jungle will call fire by its proper name every beast lives in deadly fear of it and invents a hundred ways of describing it  the red flower said mowgli that grows outside their huts in the twilight i will get some  there speaks the mans cub said bagheera proudly remember that it grows in little pots get one swiftly and keep it by thee for time of need  good said mowgli i go but art thou sure o my bagheerahe slipped his arm round the splendid neck and looked deep into the big eyes art thou sure that all this is shere khans doing  by the broken lock that freed me i am sure little brother  then by the bull that bought me i will pay shere khan full tale for this and it may be a little over said mowgli and he bounded away  that is a man that is all a man said bagheera to himself lying down again oh shere khan never was a blacker hunting than that froghunt of thine ten years ago  mowgli was far and far through the forest running hard and his heart was hot in him he came to the cave as the evening mist rose and drew breath and looked down the valley the cubs were out but mother wolf at the back of the cave knew by his breathing that something was troubling her frog  what is it son she said  some bats chatter of shere khan he called back i hunt among the ploughed fields tonight and he plunged downward through the bushes to the stream at the bottom of the valley there he checked for he heard the yell of the pack hunting heard the bellow of a hunted sambhur and the snort as the buck turned at bay then there were wicked bitter howls from the young wolves akela akela let the lone wolf show his strength room for the leader of the pack spring akela  the lone wolf must have sprung and missed his hold for mowgli heard the snap of his teeth and then a yelp as the sambhur knocked him over with his fore foot  he did not wait for anything more but dashed on and the yells grew fainter behind him as he ran into the croplands where the villagers lived  bagheera spoke truth he panted as he nestled down in some cattlefodder by the window of a hut tomorrow is one day both for akela and for me  then he pressed his face close to the window and watched the fire on the hearth he saw the husbandmans wife get up and feed it in the night with black lumps and when the morning came and the mists were all white and cold he saw the mans child pick up a wicker pot plastered inside with earth fill it with lumps of redhot charcoal put it under his blanket and go out to tend the cows in the byre  is that all said mowgli if a cub can do it there is nothing to fear so he strode round the corner and met the boy took the pot from his hand and disappeared into the mist while the boy howled with fear  they are very like me said mowgli blowing into the pot as he had seen the woman do this thing will die if i do not give it things to eat and he dropped twigs and dried bark on the red stuff halfway up the hill he met bagheera with the morning dew shining like moonstones on his coat  akela has missed said the panther they would have killed him last night but they needed thee also they were looking for thee on the hill  i was among the ploughed lands i am ready see mowgli held up the firepot  good now i have seen men thrust a dry branch into that stuff and presently the red flower blossomed at the end of it art thou not afraid  no why should i fear i remember nowif it is not a dreamhow before i was a wolf i lay beside the red flower and it was warm and pleasant  all that day mowgli sat in the cave tending his firepot and dipping dry branches into it to see how they looked he found a branch that satisfied him and in the evening when tabaqui came to the cave and told him rudely enough that he was wanted at the council rock he laughed till tabaqui ran away then mowgli went to the council still laughing  akela the lone wolf lay by the side of his rock as a sign that the leadership of the pack was open and shere khan with his following of scrapfed wolves walked to and fro openly being flattered bagheera lay close to mowgli and the firepot was between mowglis knees when they were all gathered together shere khan began to speaka thing he would never have dared to do when akela was in his prime  he has no right whispered bagheera say so he is a dogs son he will be frightened  mowgli sprang to his feet free people he cried does shere khan lead the pack what has a tiger to do with our leadership  seeing that the leadership is yet open and being asked to speak shere khan began  by whom said mowgli are we all jackals to fawn on this cattlebutcher the leadership of the pack is with the pack alone  there were yells of silence thou mans cub let him speak he has kept our law and at last the seniors of the pack thundered let the dead wolf speak when a leader of the pack has missed his kill he is called the dead wolf as long as he lives which is not long  akela raised his old head wearily  free people and ye too jackals of shere khan for twelve seasons i have led ye to and from the kill and in all that time not one has been trapped or maimed now i have missed my kill ye know how that plot was made ye know how ye brought me up to an untried buck to make my weakness known it was cleverly done your right is to kill me here on the council rock now therefore i ask who comes to make an end of the lone wolf for it is my right by the law of the jungle that ye come one by one  there was a long hush for no single wolf cared to fight akela to the death then shere khan roared bah what have we to do with this toothless fool he is doomed to die it is the mancub who has lived too long free people he was my meat from the first give him to me i am weary of this manwolf folly he has troubled the jungle for ten seasons give me the mancub or i will hunt here always and not give you one bone he is a man a mans child and from the marrow of my bones i hate him  then more than half the pack yelled  a man a man  what has a man to do with us let him go to his own place  and turn all the people of the villages against us clamoured shere khan no give him to me he is a man and none of us can look him between the eyes  akela lifted his head again and said he has eaten our food he has slept with us he has driven game for us he has broken no word of the law of the jungle  also i paid for him with a bull when he was accepted the worth of a bull is little but bagheeras honour is something that he will perhaps fight for said bagheera in his gentlest voice  a bull paid ten years ago the pack snarled what do we care for bones ten years old  or for a pledge said bagheera his white teeth bared under his lip well are ye called the free people  no mans cub can run with the people of the jungle howled shere khan give him to me  he is our brother in all but blood akela went on and ye would kill him here in truth i have lived too long some of ye are eaters of cattle and of others i have heard that under shere khans teaching ye go by dark night and snatch children from the villagers doorstep therefore i know ye to be cowards and it is to cowards i speak it is certain that i must die and my life is of no worth or i would offer that in the mancubs place but for the sake of the honour of the packa little matter that by being without a leader ye have forgotteni promise that if ye let the mancub go to his own place i will not when my time comes to die bare one tooth against ye i will die without fighting that will at least save the pack three lives more i cannot do but if ye will i can save ye the shame that comes of killing a brother against whom there is no faulta brother spoken for and bought into the pack according to the law of the jungle  he is a mana mana man snarled the pack and most of the wolves began to gather round shere khan whose tail was beginning to switch  now the business is in thy hands said bagheera to mowgli we can do no more except fight  mowgli stood uprightthe firepot in his hands then he stretched out his arms and yawned in the face of the council but he was furious with rage and sorrow for wolflike the wolves had never told him how they hated him listen you he cried there is no need for this dogs jabber ye have told me so often to night that i am a man and indeed i would have been a wolf with you to my lifes end that i feel your words are true so i do not call ye my brothers any more but sag dogs as a man should what ye will do and what ye will not do is not yours to say that matter is with me and that we may see the matter more plainly i the man have brought here a little of the red flower which ye dogs fear  he flung the firepot on the ground and some of the red coals lit a tuft of dried moss that flared up as all the council drew back in terror before the leaping flames  mowgli thrust his dead branch into the fire till the twigs lit and crackled and whirled it above his head among the cowering wolves  thou art the master said bagheera in an undertone save akela from the death he was ever thy friend  akela the grim old wolf who had never asked for mercy in his life gave one piteous look at mowgli as the boy stood all naked his long black hair tossing over his shoulders in the light of the blazing branch that made the shadows jump and quiver  good said mowgli staring round slowly i see that ye are dogs i go from you to my own peopleif they be ray own people the jungle is shut to me and i must forget your talk and your companionship but i will be more merciful than ye are because i was all but your brother in blood i promise that when i am a man among men i will not betray ye to men as ye have betrayed me he kicked the fire with his foot and the sparks flew up there shall be no war between any of us in the pack but here is a debt to pay before i go he strode forward to where shere khan sat blinking stupidly at the flames and caught him by the tuft on his chin bagheera followed in case of accidents up dog mowgli cried up when a man speaks or i will set that coat ablaze  shere khans ears lay flat back on his head and he shut his eyes for the blazing branch was very near  this cattlekiller said he would kill me in the council because he had not killed me when i was a cub thus and thus then do we beat dogs when we are men stir a whisker lungri and i ram the red flower down thy gullet he beat shere khan over the head with the branch and the tiger whimpered and whined in an agony of fear  pah singed junglecatgo now but remember when next i come to the council rock as a man should come it will be with shere khans hide on my head for the rest akela goes free to live as he pleases ye will not kill him because that is not my will nor do i think that ye will sit here any longer lolling out your tongues as though ye were somebodies instead of dogs whom i drive outthus go the fire was burning furiously at the end of the branch and mowgli struck right and left round the circle and the wolves ran howling with the sparks burning their fur at last there were only akela bagheera and perhaps ten wolves that had taken mowglis part then something began to hurt mowgli inside him as he had never been hurt in his life before and he caught his breath and sobbed and the tears ran down his face  what is it what is it he said i do not wish to leave the jungle and i do not know what this is am i dying bagheera  no little brother that is only tears such as men use said bagheera now i know thou art a man and a mans cub no longer the jungle is shut indeed to thee henceforward let them fall mowgli they are only tears so mowgli sat and cried as though his heart would break and he had never cried in all his life before  now he said i will go to men but first i must say farewell to my mother and he went to the cave where she lived with father wolf and he cried on her coat while the four cubs howled miserably  ye will not forget me said mowgli  never while we can follow a trail said the cubs come to the foot of the hill when thou art a man and we will talk to thee and we will come into the croplands to play with thee by night  come soon said father wolf oh wise little frog come again soon for we be old thy mother and i  come soon said mother wolf little naked son of mine for listen child of man i loved thee more than ever i loved my cubs  i will surely come said mowgli and when i come it will be to lay out shere khans hide upon the council rock do not forget me tell them in the jungle never to forget me  the dawn was beginning to break when mowgli went down the hillside alone to meet those mysterious things that are called men     the lost legion  when the indian mutiny broke out and a little time before the siege of delhi a regiment of native irregular horse was stationed at peshawur on the frontier of india that regiment caught what john lawrence called at the time the prevalent mania and would have thrown in its lot with the mutineers had it been allowed to do so the chance never came for as the regiment swept off down south it was headed up by a remnant of an english corps into the hills of afghanistan and there the newlyconquered tribesmen turned against it as wolves turn against buck it was hunted for the sake of its arms and accoutrements from hill to hill from ravine to ravine up and down the dried beds of rivers and round the shoulders of bluffs till it disappeared as  water  sinks in the sandthis officerless rebel regiment the only trace left of its existence today is a nominal roll drawn up in neat round hand and countersigned by an officer who  called himself  adjutant late  irregular cavalry the paper is yellow with years and dirt but on the back of it you can still read a pencil note by john lawrence to this effect see that the two native officers who remained loyal are not deprived of their estatesjl  of six hundred and fifty sabres only two stood strain and john lawrence in the midst of all the agony of the first months of the mutiny found time to think about their merits  that was more than thirty years ago and the tribesmen across the afghan border who helped to annihilate the regiment are now old men sometimes a graybeard speaks of his share in the massacre they came he will say across the border very proud calling upon us to rise and kill the english and go down to the sack of delhi but we who had just been conquered by the same english knew that they were over bold and that the government could account easily for those downcountry dogs this hindu stani regiment therefore we treated with fair words and kept standing in one place till the redcoats came after them very hot and angry then this regiment ran forward a little more into our hills to avoid the wrath of the english and we lay upon their flanks watching from the sides of the hills till we were well assured that their path was lost behind them then we came down for we desired their clothes and their bridles and their rifles and their bootsmore especially their boots that was a great killingdone slowly here the old man will rub his nose and shake his long snaky locks and lick his bearded lips and grin till the yellow toothstumps show yes we killed them because we needed their gear and we knew that their lives had been forfeited to god on account of their sinthe sin of treachery to the salt which they had eaten they rode up and down the valleys stumbling and rocking in their saddles and howling for mercy we drove them slowly like cattle till they were all assembled in one place the flat wide valley of sheor kôt many had died from want of water but there still were many left and they could not make any stand we went among them pulling them down with our hands two at a time and our boys killed them who were new to the sword my share of the plunder was such and suchso many guns and so many saddles the guns were good in those days now we steal the government rifles and despise smooth barrels yes beyond doubt we wiped that regiment from off the face of the earth and even the memory of the deed is now dying but men say  at this point the tale would stop abruptly and it was impossible to find out what men said across the border the afghans were always a secretive race and vastly preferred doing something wicked to saying anything at all they would be quiet and wellbehaved for months till one night without word or warning they would rush a policepost cut the throats of a constable or two dash through a village carry away three or four women and withdraw in the red glare of burning thatch driving the cattle and goats before them to their own desolate hills the indian government would become almost tearful on these occasions first it would say please be good and well forgive you the tribe concerned in the latest depredation would collectively put its thumb to its nose and answer rudely then the government would say hadnt you better pay up a little money for those few corpses you left behind you the other night here the tribe would temporise and lie and bully and some of the younger men merely to show contempt of authority would raid another policepost and fire into some frontier mud fort and if lucky kill a real english officer then the government would say observe if you really persist in this line of conduct you will be hurt if the tribe knew exactly what was going on in india it would apologise or be rude according as it learned whether the government was busy with other things or able to devote its full attention to their performances some of the tribes knew to one corpse how far to go others became excited lost their heads and told the government to come on with sorrow and tears and one eye on the british taxpayer at home who insisted on regarding these exercises as brutal wars of annexation the government would prepare an expensive little fieldbrigade and some guns and send all up into the hills to chase the wicked tribe out of the valleys where the corn grew into the hilltops where there was nothing to eat the tribe would turn out in full strength and enjoy the campaign for they knew that their women would never be touched that their wounded would be nursed not mutilated and that as soon as each mans bag of corn was spent they could surrender and palaver with the english general as though they had been a real enemy afterwards years afterwards they would pay the bloodmoney driblet by driblet to the government and tell their children how they had slain the redcoats by thousands the only drawback to this kind of picnicwar was the weakness of the redcoats for solemnly blowing up with powder their fortified towers and keeps this the tribes always considered mean  chief among the leaders of the smaller tribesthe little clans who knew to a penny the expense of moving white troops against themwas a priestbanditchief whom we will call the gulla kutta mullah his enthusiasm for border murder as an art was almost dignified he would cut down a mailrunner from pure wantonness or bombard a mud fort with rifle fire when he knew that our men needed to sleep in his leisure moments he would go on circuit among his neighbours and try to incite other tribes to devilry also he kept a kind of hotel for fellowoutlaws in his own village which lay in a valley called bersund any respectable murderer on that section of the frontier was sure to lie up at bersund for it was reckoned an exceedingly safe place the sole entry to it ran through a narrow gorge which could be converted into a deathtrap in five minutes it was surrounded by high hills reckoned inaccessible to all save born mountaineers and here the gulla kutta mullah lived in great state the head of a colony of mud and stone huts and in each mud hut hung some portion of a red uniform and the plunder of dead men the government particularly wished for his capture and once invited him formally to come out and be hanged on account of a few of the murders in which he had taken a direct part he replied  i am only twenty miles as the crow flies from your border come and fetch me  some day we will come said the government and hanged you will be  the gulla kutta mullah let the matter from his mind he knew that the patience of the government was as long as a summer day but he did not realise that its arm was as long as a winter night months afterwards when there was peace on the border and all india was quiet the indian government turned in its sleep and remembered the gulla kutta mullah at bersund with his thirteen outlaws the movement against him of one single regimentwhich the telegrams would have translated as warwould have been highly impolitic this was a time for silence and speed and above all absence of bloodshed  you must know that all along the northwest frontier of india there is spread a force of some thirty thousand foot and horse whose duty it is quietly and unostentatiously to shepherd the tribes in front of them they move up and down and down and up from one desolate little post to another they are ready to take the field at ten minutes notice they are always half in and half out of a difficulty somewhere along the monotonous line their lives are as hard as their own muscles and the papers never say anything about them it was from this force that the government picked its men  one night at a station where the mounted night patrol fire as they challenge and the wheat rolls in great blue green waves under our cold northern moon the officers were playing billiards in the mudwalled clubhouse when orders came to them that they were to go on parade at once for a nightdrill they grumbled and went to turn out their mena hundred english troops let us say two hundred goorkhas and about a hundred cavalry of the finest native cavalry in the world  when they were on the paradeground it was explained to them in whispers that they must set off at once across the hills to bersund the english troops were to post themselves round the hills at the side of the valley the goorkhas would command the gorge and the deathtrap and the cavalry would fetch a long march round and get to the back of the circle of hills whence if there were any difficulty they could charge down on the mullahs men but orders were very strict that there should be no fighting and no noise they were to return in the morning with every round of ammunition intact and the mullah and the thirteen outlaws bound in their midst if they were successful no one would know or care anything about their work but failure meant probably a small border war in which the gulla kutta mullah would pose as a popular leader against a big bullying power instead of a common border murderer  then there was silence broken only by the clicking of the compass needles and snapping of watchcases as the heads of columns compared bearings and made appointments for the rendezvous five minutes later the paradeground was empty the green coats of the goorkhas and the overcoats of the english troops had faded into the darkness and the cavalry were cantering away in the face of a blinding drizzle  what the goorkhas and the english did will be seen later on the heavy work lay with the horses for they had to go far and pick their way clear of habitations many of the troopers were natives of that part of the world ready and anxious to fight against their kin and some of the officers had made private and unofficial excursions into those hills before they crossed the border found a dried river bed cantered up that waited through a stony gorge risked crossing a low hill under cover of the darkness skirted another hill leaving their hoofmarks deep in some ploughed ground felt their way along another watercourse ran over the neck of a spur praying that no one would hear their horses grunting and so worked on in the rain and the darkness till they had left bersund and its crater of hills a little behind them and to the left and it was time to swing round the ascent commanding the back of bersund was steep and they halted to draw breath in a broad level valley below the height that is to say the men reined up but the horses blown as they were refused to halt there was unchristian language the worse for being delivered in a whisper and you heard the saddles squeaking in the darkness as the horses plunged  the subaltern at the rear of one troop turned in his saddle and said very softly  carter what the blessed heavens are you doing at the rear bring your men up man  there was no answer till a trooper replied  carter sahib is forwardnot there there is nothing behind us  there is said the subaltern the squadrons walking on its own tail  then the major in command moved down to the rear swearing softly and asking for the blood of lieutenant halleythe subaltern who had just spoken  look after your rearguard said the major some of your infernal thieves have got lost theyre at the head of the squadron and youre a several kinds of idiot  shall i tell off my men sir said the subaltern sulkily for he was feeling wet and cold  tell em off said the major whip em off by gad youre squandering them all over the place theres a troop behind you now  so i was thinking said the subaltern calmly i have all my men here sir better speak to carter  carter sahib sends salaam and wants to know why the regiment is stopping said a trooper to lieutenant halley  where under heaven is carter said the major  forward with his troop was the answer  are we walking in a ring then or are we the centre of a blessed brigade said the major  by this time there was silence all along the column the horses were still but through the drive of the fine rain men could hear the feet of many horses moving over stony ground  were being stalked said lieutenant halley  theyve no horses here besides theyd have fired before this said the major itsits villagers ponies  then our horses would have neighed and spoilt the attack long ago they must have been near us for half an hour said the subaltern  queer that we cant smell the horses said the major damping his finger and rubbing it on his nose as he sniffed up wind  well its a bad start said the subaltern shaking the wet from his overcoat what shall we do sir  get on said the major we shall catch it tonight  the column moved forward very gingerly for a few paces then there was an oath a shower of blue sparks as shod hooves crashed on small stones and a man rolled over with a jangle of accoutrements that would have waked the dead  now weve gone and done it said lieutenant halley all the hillside awake and all the hillside to climb in the face of musketryfire this comes of trying to do nighthawk work  the trembling trooper picked himself up and tried to explain that his horse had fallen over one of the little cairns that are built of loose stones on the spot where a man has been murdered there was no need for reasons the majors big australian charger blundered next and the column came to a halt in what seemed to be a very graveyard of little cairns all about two feet high the manoeuvres of the squadron are not reported men said that it felt like mounted quadrilles without training and without the music but at last the horses breaking rank and choosing their own way walked clear of the cairns till every man of the squadron reformed and drew rein a few yards up the slope of the hill then according to lieutenant halley there was another scene very like the one which has been described the major and carter insisted that all the men had not joined rank and that there were more of them in the rear clicking and blundering among the dead mens cairns lieutenant halley told off his own troopers again and resigned himself to wait later on he told me  i didnt much know and i didnt much care what was going on the row of that trooper falling ought to have scared half the country and i would take my oath that we were being stalked by a full regiment in the rear and they were making row enough to rouse all afghanistan i sat tight but nothing happened  the mysterious part of the nights work was the silence on the hillside everybody knew that the gulla kutta mullah had his outpost huts on the reverse side of the hill and everybody expected by the time that the major had sworn himself into a state of quiet that the watchmen there would open fire when nothing occurred they said that the gusts of the rain had deadened the sound of the horses and thanked providence at last the major satisfied himself a that he had left no one behind among the cairns and b that he was not being taken in the rear by a large and powerful body of cavalry the mens tempers were thoroughly spoiled the horses were lathered and unquiet and one and all prayed for the daylight  they set themselves to climb up the hill each man leading his mount carefully before they had covered the lower slopes or the breastplates had begun to tighten a thunderstorm came up behind rolling across the low hills and drowning any noise less than that of cannon the first flash of the lightning showed the bare ribs of the ascent the hillcrest standing steely blue against the black sky the little falling lines of the rain and a few yards to their left flank an afghan watchtower twostoried built of stone and entered by a ladder from the upper story the ladder was up and a man with a rifle was leaning from the window the darkness and the thunder rolled down in an instant and when the lull followed a voice from the watchtower cried who goes there  the cavalry were very quiet but each man gripped his carbine and stood beside his horse again the voice called who goes there and in a louder key o brothers give the alarm now every man in the cavalry would have died in his long boots sooner than have asked for quarter but it is a fact that the answer to the second call was a long wail of marf karo marf karo which means have mercy have mercy it came from the climbing regiment  the cavalry stood dumbfoundered till the big troopers had time to whisper one to another mir khan was that thy voice abdullah didst thou call lieutenant halley stood beside his charger and waited so long as no firing was going on he was content another flash of lightning showed the horses with heaving flanks and nodding heads the men white eyeballed glaring beside them and the stone watchtower to the left this time there was no head at the window and the rude ironclamped shutter that could turn a rifle bullet was closed  go on men said the major get up to the top at any rate the squadron toiled forward the horses wagging their tails and the men pulling at the bridles the stones rolling down the hillside and the sparks flying lieutenant halley declares that he never heard a squadron make so much noise in his life they scrambled up he said as though each horse had eight legs and a spare horse to follow him even then there was no sound from the watchtower and the men stopped exhausted on the ridge that overlooked the pit of darkness in which the village of bersund lay girths were loosed curbchains shifted and saddles adjusted and the men dropped down among the stones whatever might happen now they had the upper ground of any attack  the thunder ceased and with it the rain and the soft thick darkness of a winter night before the dawn covered them all except for the sound of falling water among the ravines below everything was still they heard the shutter of the watchtower below them thrown back with a clang and the voice of the watcher calling oh hafiz ullah  the echoes took up the call lalala and an answer came from the watchtower hidden round the curve of the hill what is it shahbaz khan  shahbaz khan replied in the highpitched voice of the mountaineer hast thou seen  the answer came back yes god deliver us from all evil spirits  there was a pause and then hafiz ullah i am alone come to me  shahbaz khan i am alone also but i dare not leave my post  that is a lie thou art afraid  a longer pause followed and then i am afraid be silent they are below us still pray to god and sleep  the troopers listened and wondered for they could not understand what save earth and stone could lie below the watchtowers  shahbaz khan began to call again they are below us i can see them for the pity of god come over to me hafiz ullah my father slew ten of them come over  hafiz ullah answered in a very loud voice mine was guiltless hear ye men of the night neither my father nor my blood had any part in that sin bear thou thy own punishment shahbaz khan  oh some one ought to stop those two chaps crowing away like cocks there said lieutenant halley shivering under his rock  he had hardly turned round to expose a new side of him to the rain before a bearded longlocked evilsmelling afghan rushed up the hill and tumbled into his arms halley sat upon him and thrust as much of a swordhilt as could be spared down the mans gullet if you cry out i kill you he said cheerfully  the man was beyond any expression of terror he lay and quaked grunting when halley took the swordhilt from between his teeth he was still inarticulate but clung to halleys arm feeling it from elbow to wrist  the rissala the dead rissala he gasped it is down there  no the rissala the very much alive rissala it is up here said halley unshipping his wateringbridle and fastening the mans hands why were you in the towers so foolish as to let us pass  the valley is full of the dead said the afghan it is better to fall into the hands of the english than the hands of the dead they march to and fro below there i saw them in the lightning  he recovered his composure after a little and whispering because halleys pistol was at his stomach said what is this there is no war between us now and the mullah will kill me for not seeing you pass  rest easy said halley we are coming to kill the mullah if god please his teeth have grown too long no harm will come to thee unless the daylight shows thee as a face which is desired by the gallows for crime done but what of the dead regiment  i only kill within my own border said the man immensely relieved the dead regiment is below the men must have passed through it on their journeyfour hundred dead on horses stumbling among their own graves among the little heapsdead men all whom we slew  whew said halley that accounts for my cursing carter and the major cursing me four hundred sabres eh no wonder we thought there were a few extra men in the troop kurruk shah he whispered to a grizzled native officer that lay within a few feet of him hast thou heard anything of a dead rissala in these hills  assuredly said kurruk shah with a grim chuckle otherwise why did i who have served the queen for sevenandtwenty years and killed many hilldogs shout aloud for quarter when the lightning revealed us to the watchtowers when i was a young man i saw the killing in the valley of sheorkot there at our feet and i know the tale that grew up therefrom but how can the ghosts of unbelievers prevail against us who are of the faith strap that dogs hands a little tighter sahib an afghan is like an eel  but a dead rissala said halley jerking his captives wrist that is foolish talk kurruk shah the dead are dead hold still sag the afghan wriggled  the dead are dead and for that reason they walk at night what need to talk we be men we have our eyes and ears thou canst both see and hear them down the hillside said kurruk shah composedly  halley stared and listened long and intently the valley was full of stifled noises as every valley must be at night but whether he saw or heard more than was natural halley alone knows and he does not choose to speak on the subject  at last and just before the dawn a green rocket shot up from the far side of the valley of bersund at the head of the gorge to show that the goorkhas were in position a red light from the infantry at left and right answered it and the cavalry burnt a white flare afghans in winter are late sleepers and it was not till full day that the gulla kutta mullahs men began to straggle from their huts rubbing their eyes they saw men in green and red and brown uniforms leaning on their arms neatly arranged all round the crater of the village of bersund in a cordon that not even a wolf could have broken they rubbed their eyes the more when a pinkfaced young man who was not even in the army but represented the political department tripped down the hillside with two orderlies rapped at the door of the gulla kutta mullahs house and told  him quietly to step out and be tied up for safe transport that same young man passed on through the huts tapping here one cateran and there another lightly with his cane and as each was pointed out so he was tied up staring hopelessly at the crowned heights around where the english soldiers looked down with incurious eyes only the mullah tried to carry it off with curses and high words till a soldier who was tying his hands said  none o your lip why didnt you come out when you was ordered instead o keepin us awake all night youre no better than my own barracksweeper you whiteeaded old polyanthus kim up  half an hour later the troops had gone away with the mullah and his thirteen friends the dazed villagers were looking ruefully at a pile of broken muskets and snapped swords and wondering how in the world they had come so to miscalculate the forbearance of the indian government  it was a very neat little affair neatly carried out and the men concerned were unofficially thanked for their services  yet it seems to me that much credit is also due to another regiment whose name did not appear in the brigade orders and whose very existence is in danger of being forgotten     namgay doola          there came to the beach a poor exile of erin         the dew on his wet robe hung heavy and chill         ere the steamer that brought him had passed out of hearin         he was alderman mike inthrojuicing a bill                                                  american song  once upon a time there was a king who lived on the road to thibet very many miles in the himalayas his kingdom was eleven thousand feet above the sea and exactly four miles square but most of the miles stood on end owing to the nature of the country his revenues were rather less than four hundred pounds yearly and they were expended in the maintenance of one elephant and a standing army of five men he was tributary to the indian government who allowed him certain sums for keeping a section of the himalayathibet road in repair he further increased his revenues by selling timber to the railway companies for he would cut the great deodar trees in his one forest and they fell thundering into the sutlej river and were swept down to the plains three hundred miles away and became railwayties now and again this king whose name does not matter would mount a ringstraked horse and ride scores of miles to simlatown to confer with the lieutenantgovernor on matters of state or to assure the viceroy that his sword was at the service of the queenempress then the viceroy would cause a ruffle of drums to be sounded and the ringstraked horse and the cavalry of the statetwo men in tattersand the herald who bore the silver stick before the king would trot back to their own place which lay between the tail of a heavenclimbing glacier and a dark birchforest  now from such a king always remembering that he possessed one veritable elephant and could count his descent for twelve hundred years i expected when it was my fate to wander through his dominions no more than mere license to live  the night had closed in rain and rolling clouds blotted out the lights of the villages in the valley forty miles away untouched by cloud or storm the white shoulder of donga pathe mountain of the council of the godsupheld the evening star the monkeys sang sorrowfully to each other as they hunted for dry roosts in the fernwreathed trees and the last puff of the daywind brought from the unseen villages the scent of damp woodsmoke hot cakes dripping undergrowth and rotting pinecones that is the true smell of the himalayas and if once it creeps into the blood of a man that man will at the last forgetting all else return to the hills to die the clouds closed and the smell went away  and there remained nothing in all the world except chilling white mist and the boom of the sutlej river racing through the valley below a fattailed sheep who did not want to die bleated piteously at my tent door he was scuffling with the prime minister and the directorgeneral of public education and he was a royal gift to me and my camp servants i expressed my thanks suitably and asked if i might have audience of the king the prime minister readjusted his turban which had fallen off in the struggle and assured me that the king would be very pleased to see me therefore i despatched  two bottles as a foretaste and when the sheep had entered upon another incarnation went to the kings palace through the wet he had sent his army to escort me but the army stayed to talk with my cook soldiers are very much alike all the world over  the palace was a fourroomed and whitewashed mud and timberhouse the finest in all the hills for a days journey the king was dressed in a purple velvet jacket white muslin trousers and a saffronyellow turban of price he gave me audience in a little carpeted room opening off the palace courtyard which was occupied by the elephant of state the great beast was sheeted and anchored from trunk to tail and the curve of his back stood out grandly against the mist  the prime minister and the directorgeneral of public education were present to introduce me but all the court had been dismissed lest the two bottles aforesaid should corrupt their morals the king cast a wreath of heavyscented flowers round my neck as i bowed and inquired how my honoured presence had the felicity to be i said that through seeing his auspicious countenance the mists of the night had turned into sunshine and that by reason of his beneficent sheep his good deeds would be remembered by the gods he said that since i had set my magnificent foot in his kingdom the crops would probably yield seventy per cent more than the average i said that the fame of the king had reached to the four corners of the earth and that the nations gnashed their teeth when they heard daily of the glories of his realm and the wisdom of his moonlike prime minister and lotuslike directorgeneral of public education  then we sat down on clean white cushions and i was at the kings right hand three minutes later he was telling me that the state of the maize crop was something disgraceful and that the railway companies would not pay him enough for his timber the talk shifted to and fro with the bottles and we discussed very many stately things and the king became confidential on the subject of government generally most of all he dwelt on the shortcomings of one of his subjects who from all i could gather had been paralysing the executive  in the old days said the king i could have ordered the elephant yonder to trample him to death now i must een send him seventy miles across the hills to be tried and his keep would be upon the state the elephant eats everything  what be the mans crimes rajah sahib said i  firstly he is an outlander and no man of mine own people secondly since of my favour i gave him land upon his first coming he refuses to pay revenue am i not the lord of the earth above and below entitled by right and custom to oneeighth of the crop yet this devil establishing himself refuses to pay a single tax and he brings a poisonous spawn of babes  cast him into jail i said  sahib the king answered shifting a little on the cushions once and only once in these forty years sickness came upon me so that i was not able to go abroad in that hour i made a vow to my god that i would never again cut man or woman from the light of the sun and the air of god for i perceived the nature of the punishment how can i break my vow were it only the lopping of a hand or a foot i should not delay but even that is impossible now that the english have rule one or another of my peoplehe looked obliquely at the directorgeneral of public educationwould at once write a letter to the viceroy and perhaps i should be deprived of my ruffle of drums  he unscrewed the mouthpiece of his silver waterpipe fitted a plain amber mouthpiece and passed his pipe to me not content with refusing revenue he continued this outlander refuses also the begar this was the corvée or forced labour on the roads and stirs my people up to the like treason yet he is when he wills an expert logsnatcher there is none better or bolder among my people to clear a block of the river when the logs stick fast  but he worships strange gods said the prime minister deferentially  for that i have no concern said the king who was as tolerant as akbar in matters of belief to each man his own god and the fire or mother earth for us all at last it is the rebellion that offends me  the king has an army i suggested has not the king burned the mans house and left him naked to the night dews  nay a hut is a hut and it holds the life of a man but once i sent my army against him when his excuses became wearisome of their heads he brake three across the top with a stick the other two men ran away also the guns would not shoot  i had seen the equipment of the infantry onethird of it was an old muzzleloading fowlingpiece with a ragged rusthole where the nipples should have been onethird a wirebound matchlock with a wormeaten stock and onethird a fourbore flint duckgun without a flint  but it is to be remembered said the king reaching out for the bottle that he is a very expert logsnatcher and a man of a merry face what shall i do to him sahib  this was interesting the timid hillfolk would as soon have refused taxes to their king as revenues to their gods  if it be the kings permission i said i will not strike my tents till the third day and i will see this man the mercy of the king is godlike and rebellion is like unto the sin of witchcraft moreover both the bottles and another be empty  you have my leave to go said the king  next morning a crier went through the state proclaiming that there was a logjam on the river and that it behoved all loyal subjects to remove it the people poured down from their villages to the moist warm valley of poppyfields and the king and i went with them hundreds of dressed deodarlogs had caught on a snag of rock and the river was bringing down more logs every minute to complete the blockade the water snarled and wrenched and worried at the timber and the population of the state began prodding the nearest logs with a pole in the hope of starting a general movement then there went up a shout of namgay doola namgay doola and a large redhaired villager hurried up stripping off his clothes as he ran  that is he that is the rebel said the king now will the dam be cleared  but why has he red hair i asked since red hair among hillfolks is as common as blue or green  he is an outlander said the king well done oh well done  namgay doola had scrambled out on the jam and was clawing out the butt of a log with a rude sort of boathook it slid forward slowly as an alligator moves three or four others followed it and the green water spouted through the gaps they had made then the villagers howled and shouted and scrambled across the logs pulling and pushing the obstinate timber and the red head of namgay doola was chief among them all the logs swayed and chafed and groaned as fresh consignments from upstream battered the now weakening dam all gave way at last in a smother of foam racing logs bobbing black heads and confusion indescribable the river tossed everything before it i saw the red head go down with the last remnants of the jam and disappear between the great grinding treetrunks it rose close to the bank and blowing like a grampus namgay doola wrung the water out of his eyes and made obeisance to the king i had time to observe him closely the virulent redness of his shock head and beard was most startling and in the thicket of hair wrinkled above high cheek bones shone two very merry blue eyes he was indeed an outlander but yet a thibetan in language habit and attire he spoke the lepcha dialect with an indescribable softening of the gutturals it was not so much a lisp as an accent  whence comest thou i asked  from thibet he pointed across the hills and grinned that grin went straight to my heart mechanically i held out my hand and namgay doola shook it no pure thibetan would have understood the meaning of the gesture he went away to look for his clothes and as he climbed back to his village i heard a joyous yell that seemed unaccountably familiar it was the whooping of namgay doola  you see now said the king why i would not kill him he is a bold man among my logs but and he shook his head like a schoolmaster i know that before long there will be complaints of him in the court let us return to the palace and do justice it was that kings custom to judge his subjects every day between eleven and three oclock i saw him decide equitably in weighty matters of trespass slander and a little wifestealing then his brow clouded and he summoned me  again it is namgay doola he said despairingly not content with refusing revenue on his own part he has bound half his village by an oath to the like treason never before has such a thing befallen me nor are my taxes heavy  o king said i if it be the kings will let this matter stand over till the morning only the gods can do right swiftly and it may be that yonder villager has lied  nay for i know the nature of namgay doola but since a guest asks let the matter remain wilt thou speak harshly to this redheaded outlander he may listen to thee  i made an attempt that very evening but for the life of me i could not keep my countenance namgay doola grinned persuasively and began to tell me about a big brown bear in a poppyfield by the river would i care to shoot it i spoke austerely on the sin of conspiracy and the certainty of punishment namgay doolas face clouded for a moment shortly afterwards he withdrew from my tent and i heard him singing to himself softly among the pines the words were unintelligible to me but the tune like his liquid insinuating speech seemed the ghost of something strangely familiar            dir hané mardiyemen dir           to weeree ala gee  sang namgay doola again and again and i racked my brain for that lost tune it was not till after dinner that i discovered some one had cut a square foot of velvet from the centre of my best cameracloth this made me so angry that i wandered down the valley in the hope of meeting the big brown bear i could hear him grunting like a discontented pig in the poppyfield and i waited shoulder deep in the dewdripping indian corn to catch him after his meal the moon was at full and drew out the rich scent of the tasselled crop then i heard the anguished bellow of a himalayan cow one of the little black crummies no bigger than newfoundland dogs two shadows that looked like a bear and her cub hurried past me i was in act to fire when i saw that they had each a brilliant red head the lesser animal was trailing some rope behind it that left a dark track on the path they passed within six feet of me and the shadow of the moonlight lay velvetblack on their faces velvetblack was exactly the word for by all the powers of moonlight they were masked in the velvet of my camera cloth i marvelled and went to bed next morning the kingdom was in uproar namgay doola men said had gone forth in the night and with a sharp knife had cut off the tail of a cow belonging to the rabbitfaced villager who had betrayed him it was sacrilege unspeakable against the holy cow the state desired his blood but he had retreated into his hut barricaded the doors and windows with big stones and defied the world  the king and i and the populace approached the hut cautiously there was no hope of capturing the man without loss of life for from a hole in the wall projected the muzzle of an extremely wellcaredfor gunthe only gun in the state that could shoot namgay doola had narrowly missed a villager just before we came up the standing army stood it could do no more for when it advanced pieces of sharp shale flew from the windows to these were added from time to time showers of scalding water we saw red heads bobbing up and down in the hut the family of namgay doola were aiding their sire and bloodcurdling yells of defiance were the only answers to our prayers  never said the king puffing has such a thing befallen my state next year i will certainly buy a little cannon he looked at me imploringly  is there any priest in the kingdom to whom he will listen said i for a light was beginning to break upon me  he worships his own god said the prime minister we can starve him out  let the white man approach said namgay doola from within all others i will kill send me the white man  a rabbitfaced villager with a blushrose stuck behind his ear advanced trembling he had been in the conspiracy but had told everything and hoped for the kings favour   the door was thrown open and i entered the smoky interior of a thibetan hut crammed with children and every child had flaming red hair a raw cows tail lay on the floor and by its side two pieces of black velvetmy black velvetrudely hacked into the semblance of masks  and what is this shame namgay doola said i  he grinned more winningly than ever there is no shame said he i did but cut off the tail of that mans cow he betrayed me i was minded to shoot him sahib but not to death indeed not to death only in the legs  and why at all since it is the custom to pay revenue to the king why at all  by the god of my father i cannot tell said namgay doola  and who was thy father  the same that had this gun he showed me his weapona tower musket bearing date 1832 and the stamp of the honourable east india company  and thy fathers name said i  timlay doola said he at the first i being then a little child it is in my mind that he wore a red coat  of that i have no doubt but repeat the name of thy father thrice or four times  he obeyed and i understood whence the puzzling accent in his speech came thimla dhula said he excitedly to this hour i worship his god  may i see that god  in a little whileat twilight time  rememberest thou aught of thy fathers speech  it is long ago but there is one word which he said often thus shun then i and my brethren stood upon our feet our hands to our sides thus  even so and what was thy mother  a woman of the hills we be lepchas of darjeeling but me they call an outlander because my hair is as thou seest  the thibetan woman his wife touched him on the arm gently the long parley outside the fort had lasted far into the day it was now close upon twilightthe hour of the angelus very solemnly the redheaded brats rose from the floor and formed a semicircle namgay doola laid his gun against the wall lighted a little oil lamp and set it before a recess in the wall pulling aside a curtain of dirty cloth he revealed a worn brass crucifix leaning against the helmetbadge of a long forgotten east india regiment thus did my father he said crossing himself clumsily the wife and children followed suit then all together they struck up the wailing chant that i heard on the hillside          dir hané mardiyemen dir         to weeree ala gee  i was puzzled no longer again and again they crooned as if their hearts would break their version of the chorus of the wearing of the green          theyre hanging men and women too         for the wearing of the green  a diabolical inspiration came to me one of the brats a boy about eight years old was watching me as he sang i pulled out a rupee held the coin between finger and thumb and lookedonly lookedat the gun against the wall a grin of brilliant and perfect comprehension overspread the face of the child never for an instant stopping the song he held out his hand for the money and then slid the gun to my hand i might have shot namgay doola as he chanted but i was satisfied the bloodinstinct of the race held true namgay doola drew the curtain across the recess angelus was over  thus my father sang there was much more but i have forgotten and i do not know the purport of these words but it may be that the god will understand i am not of this people and i will not pay revenue  and why  again that soulcompelling grin what occupation would be to me between crop and crop it is better than scaring bears but these people do not understand he picked the masks from the floor and looked in my face as simply as a child  by what road didst thou attain knowledge to make these devilries i said pointing  i cannot tell i am but a lepcha of darjeeling and yet the stuff  which thou hast stolen  nay surely did i steal i desired it so the stuffthe stuffwhat else should i have done with the stuff he twisted the velvet between his fingers  but the sin of maiming the cowconsider that  that is true but oh sahib that man betrayed me and i had no thoughtbut the heifers tail waved in the moonlight and i had my knife what else should i have done the tail came off ere i was aware sahib thou knowest more than i  that is true said i stay within the door i go to speak to the king  the population of the state were ranged on the hillsides i went forth and spoke to the king  oh king said i touching this man there be two courses open to thy wisdom thou canst either hang him from a tree he and his brood till there remains no hair that is red within the land  nay said the king why should i hurt the little children  they had poured out of the hut door and were making plump obeisance to everybody nanigay doola waited with his gun across his arm  or thou canst discarding the impiety of the cowmaiming raise him to honour in thy army he comes of a race that will not pay revenue a red flame is in his blood which comes out at the top of his head in that glowing hair make him chief of the army give him honour as may befall and full allowance of work but look to it o king that neither he nor his hold a foot of earth from thee henceforward feed him with words and favour and also liquor from certain bottles that thou knowest of and he will be a bulwark of defence but deny him even a tuft of grass for his own this is the nature that god has given him moreover he has brethren  the state groaned unanimously  but if his brethren come they will surely fight with each other till they die or else the one will always give information concerning the other shall he be of thy army o king choose  the king bowed his head and i said come forth namgay doola and command the kings army thy name shall no more be namgay in the mouths of men but patsay doola for as thou hast said i know  then namgay doola new christened patsay doola son of timlay doola which is tim doolan gone very wrong indeed clasped the kings feet cuffed the standing army and hurried in an agony of contrition from temple to temple making offerings for the sin of cattle maiming  and the king was so pleased with my perspicacity that he offered to sell me a village for twenty pounds sterling but i buy no villages in the himalayas so long as one red head flares between the tail of the heavenclimbing glacier and the dark birchforest  i know that breed     a germdestroyer          pleasant it is for the little tin gods           when great jove nods         but little tin gods make their little mistakes         in missing the hour when great jove wakes  as a general rule it is inexpedient to meddle with questions of state in a land where men are highly paid to work them out for you this tale is a justifiable exception  once in every five years as you know we indent for a new viceroy and each viceroy imports with the rest of his baggage a private secretary who may or may not be the real viceroy just as fate ordains fate looks after the indian empire because it is so big and so helpless  there was a viceroy once who brought out with him a turbulent private secretarya hard man with a soft manner and a morbid passion for work this secretary was called wonderjohn fennil wonder the viceroy possessed no namenothing but a string of counties and twothirds of the alphabet after them he said in confidence that he was the electroplated figurehead of a golden administration and he watched in a dreamy amused way wonders attempts to draw matters which were entirely outside his province into his own hands when we are all cherubims together said his excellency once my dear good friend wonder will head the conspiracy for plucking out gabriels tail feathers or stealing peters keys then i shall report him  but though the viceroy did nothing to check wonders officiousness other people said unpleasant things may be the members of council began it but finally all simla agreed that there was too much wonder and too little viceroy in that rule wonder was always quoting his excellency it was his excellency this his excellency that in the opinion of his excellency and so on the viceroy smiled but he did not heed he said that so long as his old men squabbled with his dear good wonder they might be induced to leave the immemorial east in peace  no wise man has a policy said the viceroy a policy is the blackmail levied on the fool by the unforeseen i am not the former and i do not believe in the latter  i do not quite see what this means unless it refers to an insurance policy perhaps it was the viceroys way of saying lie low  that season came up to simla one of these crazy people with only a single idea these are the men who make things move but they are not nice to talk to this mans name was mellish and he had lived for fifteen years on land of his own in lower bengal studying cholera he held that cholera was a germ that propagated itself as it flew through a muggy atmosphere and stuck in the branches of trees like a woolflake the germ could be rendered sterile he said by mellishs own invincible fumigatorya heavy violetblack powder the result of fifteen years scientific investigation sir  inventors seem very much alike as a caste they talk loudly especially about conspiracies of monopolists they beat upon the table with their fists and they secrete fragments of their inventions about their persons  mellish said that there was a medical ring at simla headed by the surgeongeneral who was in league apparently with all the hospital assistants in the empire  i forget exactly how he proved it but it had something to do with skulking up to the hills and what mellish wanted was the independent evidence of the viceroysteward of our most gracious majesty the queen sir so mellish went up to simla with eightyfour pounds of fumigatory in his trunk to speak to the viceroy and to show him the merits of the invention  but it is easier to see a viceroy than to talk to him unless you chance to be as important as mellishe of madras he was a sixthousandrupee man so great that his daughters never married they contracted alliances he himself was not paid he received emoluments and his journeys about the country were tours of observation his business was to stir up the people in madras with a long poleas you stir up tench in a pondand the people had to come up out of their comfortable old ways and gaspthis is enlightenment and progress isnt it fine then they give mellishe statues and jasmine garlands in the hope of getting rid of him  mellishe came up to simla to confer with the viceroy that was one of his perquisites the viceroy knew nothing of mellishe except that he was one of those middleclass deities who seem necessary to the spiritual comfort of this paradise of the middleclasses and that in all probability he had suggested designed founded and endowed all the public institutions in madras which proves that his excellency though dreamy had experience of the ways of sixthousandrupee men  mellishes name was e mellishe and mellishs was es mellish and they were both staying at the same hotel and the fate that looks after the indian empire ordained that wonder should blunder and drop the final e that the chaprassi should help him and that the note which ran    dear mr mellishcan you set aside your other engagements and   lunch with us at two tomorrow his excellency has an hour at your   disposal then  should be given to mellish with the fumigatory he nearly wept with pride and delight and at the appointed hour cantered to peterhoff a big paperbag full of the fumigatory in his coattail pockets he had his chance and he meant to make the most of it mellishe of madras had been so portentously solemn about his conference that wonder had arranged for a private tiffinno adcs no wonder no one but the viceroy who said plaintively that he feared being left alone with unmuzzled autocrats like the great mellishe of madras  but his guest did not bore the viceroy on the contrary he amused him mellish was nervously anxious to go straight to his fumigatory and talked at random until tiffin was over and his excellency asked him to smoke the viceroy was pleased with mellish because he did not talk shop  as soon as the cheroots were lit mellish spoke like a man beginning with his choleratheory reviewing his fifteen years scientific labours the machinations of the simla ring and the excellence of his fumigatory while the viceroy watched him between halfshut eyes and thoughtevidently this is the wrong tiger but it is an original animal mellishs hair was standing on end with excitement and he stammered he began groping in his coattails and before the viceroy knew what was about to happen he had tipped a bagful of his powder into the big silver ashtray  jjjudge for yourself sir said mellish y excellency shall judge for yourself absolutely infallible on my honour  he plunged the lighted end of his cigar into the powder which began to smoke like a volcano and send up fat greasy wreaths of coppercoloured smoke in five seconds the room was filled with a most pungent and sickening stencha reek that took fierce hold of the trap of your windpipe and shut it the powder hissed and fizzed and sent out blue and green sparks and the smoke rose till you could neither see nor breathe nor gasp mellish however was used to it  nitrate of strontia he shouted baryta bonemeal etcetera thousand cubic feet smoke per cubic inch not a germ could livenot a germ y excellency  but his excellency had fled and was coughing at the foot of the stairs while all peterhoff hummed like a hive red lancers came in and the head chaprassi who speaks english came in and macebearers came in and ladies ran downstairs screaming fire for the smoke was drifting through the house and oozing out of the windows and bellying along the verandahs and wreathing and writhing across the gardens no one could enter the room where mellish was lecturing on his fumigatory till that unspeakable powder had burned itself out  then an aidedecamp who desired the vc rushed through the rolling clouds and hauled mellish into the hall the viceroy was prostrate with laughter and could only waggle his hands feebly at mellish who was shaking a fresh bagful of powder at him  glorious glorious sobbed his excellency not a germ as you justly observe could exist i can swear it a magnificent success  then he laughed till the tears came and wonder who had caught the real mellishe snorting on the mall entered and was deeply shocked at the scene but the viceroy was delighted because he saw that wonder would presently depart mellish with the fumigatory was also pleased for he felt that he had smashed the simla medical ring  few men could tell a story like his excellency when he took the trouble and his account of my dear good wonders friend with the powder went the round of simla and flippant folk made wonder unhappy by their remarks  but his excellency told the tale once too oftenfor wonder as he meant to do it was at a seepee picnic wonder was sitting just behind the viceroy  and i really thought for a moment wound up his excellency that my dear good wonder had hired an assassin to clear his way to the throne  every one laughed but there was a delicate subtinkle in the viceroys tone which wonder understood he found that his health was giving way and the viceroy allowed him to go and presented him with a flaming character for use at home among big people  my fault entirely said his excellency in after seasons with a twinkle in his eye my inconsistency must always have been distasteful to such a masterly man     tigertiger          what of the hunting hunter bold           brother the watch was long and cold         what of the quarry ye went to kill           brother he crops in the jungle still         where is the power that made your pride           brother it ebbs from my flank and side         where is the haste that ye hurry by           brother i go to my lair to die  when mowgli left the wolfs cave after the fight with the pack at the council rock he went down to the ploughed lands where the villagers lived but he would not stop there because it was too near to the jungle and he knew that he had made at least one bad enemy at the council so he hurried on keeping to the rough road that ran down the valley and followed it at a steady jogtrot for nearly twenty miles till he came to a country that he did not know the valley opened out into a great plain dotted over with rocks and cut up by ravines at one end stood a little village and at the other the thick jungle came down in a sweep to the grazinggrounds and stopped there as though it had been cut off with a hoe all over the plain cattle and buffaloes were grazing and when the little boys in charge of the herds saw mowgli they shouted and ran away and the yellow pariah dogs that hang about every indian village barked mowgli walked on for he was feeling hungry and when he came to the village gate he saw the big thornbush that was drawn up before the gate at twilight pushed to one side  umph he said for he had come across more than one such barricade in his night rambles after things to eat so men are afraid of the people of the jungle here also he sat down by the gate and when a man came out he stood up opened his mouth and pointed down it to show that he wanted food the man stared and ran back up the one street of the village shouting for the priest who was a big fat man dressed in white with a red and yellow mark on his forehead the priest came to the gate and with him at least a hundred people who stared and talked and shouted and pointed at mowgli  they have no manners these men folk said mowgli to himself only the gray ape would behave as they do so he threw back his long hair and frowned at the crowd  what is there to be afraid of said the priest look at the marks on his arms and legs they are the bites of wolves he is but a wolfchild run away from the jungle  of course in playing together the cubs had often nipped mowgli harder than they intended and there were white scars all over his arms and legs but he would have been the last person in the world to call these bites for he knew what real biting meant  arré arré said two or three women together to be bitten by wolves poor child he is a handsome boy he has eyes like red fire by my honour messua he is not unlike thy boy that was taken by the tiger  let me look said a woman with heavy copper rings on her wrists and ankles and she peered at mowgli under the palm of her hand indeed he is not he is thinner but he has the very look of my boy  the priest was a clever man and he knew that messua was wife to the richest villager in the place so he looked up at the sky for a minute and said solemnly what the jungle has taken the jungle has restored take the boy into thy house my sister and forget not to honour the priest who sees so far into the lives of men  by the bull that bought me said mowgli to himself but all this talking is like another looking over by the pack well if i am a man a man i must be  the crowd parted as the woman beckoned mowgli to her hut where there was a red lacquered bedstead a great earthen grainchest with funny raised patterns on it half a dozen copper cookingpots an image of a hindu god in a little alcove and on the wall a real lookingglass such as they sell at the country fairs for eight cents  she gave him a long drink of milk and some bread and then she laid her hand on his head and looked into his eyes for she thought perhaps that he might be her real son come back from the jungle where the tiger had taken him so she said nathoo o nathoo mowgli did not show that he knew the name dost thou not remember the day when i gave thee thy new shoes she touched his foot and it was almost as hard as horn no she said sorrowfully those feet have never worn shoes but thou art very like my nathoo and thou shalt be my son  mowgli was uneasy because he had never been under a roof before but as he looked at the thatch he saw that he could tear it out any time if he wanted to get away and that the window had no fastenings what is the good of a man he said to himself at last if he does not understand mans talk now i am as silly and dumb as a man would be with us in the jungle i must speak their talk  he had not learned while he was with the wolves to imitate the challenge of bucks in the jungle and the grunt of the little wild pig for fun so as soon as messua pronounced a word mowgli would imitate it almost perfectly and before dark he had learned the name of many things in the hut  there was a difficulty at bedtime because mowgli would not sleep under anything that looked so like a panthertrap as that hut and when they shut the door he went through the window give him his will said messuas husband remember he can never till now have slept on a bed if he is indeed sent in the place of our son he will not run away  so mowgli stretched himself in some long clean grass at the edge of the field but before he had closed his eyes a soft gray nose poked him under the chin  phew said gray brother he was the eldest of mother wolfs cubs this is a poor reward for following thee twenty miles thou smellest of woodsmoke and cattlealtogether like a man already wake little brother i bring news  are all well in the jungle said mowgli hugging him  all except the wolves that were burned with the red flower now listen shere khan has gone away to hunt far off till his coat grows again for he is badly singed when he returns he swears that he will lay thy bones in the waingunga  there are two words to that i also have made a little promise but news is always good i am tired tonightvery tired with new things gray brotherbut bring me the news always  thou wilt not forget that thou art a wolf men will not make thee forget said gray brother anxiously  never i will always remember that i love thee and all in our cave but also i will always remember that i have been cast out of the pack  and that thou mayst be cast out of another pack men are only men little brother and their talk is like the talk of frogs in a pond when i come down here again i will wait for thee in the bamboos at the edge of the grazingground  for three months after that night mowgli hardly ever left the village gate he was so busy learning the ways and customs of men first he had to wear a cloth round him which annoyed him horribly and then he had to learn about money which he did not in the least understand and about ploughing of which he did not see the use then the little children in the village made him very angry luckily the law of the jungle had taught him to keep his temper for in the jungle life and food depend on keeping your temper but when they made fun of him because he would not play games or fly kites or because he mispronounced some word only the knowledge that it was unsportsmanlike to kill little naked cubs kept him from picking them up and breaking them in two he did not know his own strength in the least in the jungle he knew he was weak compared with the beasts but in the village people said that he was as strong as a bull he certainly had no notion of what fear was for when the village priest told him that the god in the temple would be angry with him if he ate the priests mangoes he picked up the image brought it over to the priests house and asked the priest to make the god angry and he would be happy to fight him it was a horrible scandal but the priest hushed it up and messuas husband paid much good silver to comfort the god and mowgli had not the faintest idea of the difference that caste makes between man and man when the potters donkey slipped in the claypit mowgli hauled it out by the tail and helped to stack the pots for their journey to the market at khanhiwara that was very shocking too for the potter is a lowcaste man and his donkey is worse when the priest scolded him mowgli threatened to put him on the donkey too and the priest told messuas husband that mowgli had better be set to work as soon as possible and the village headman told mowgli that he would have to go out with the buffaloes next day and herd them while they grazed no one was more pleased than mowgli and that night because he had been appointed a servant of the village as it were he went off to a circle that met every evening on a masonry platform under a great figtree it was the village club and the headman and the watchman and the barber who knew all the gossip of the village and old buldeo the village hunter who had a tower musket met and smoked the monkeys sat and talked in the upper branches and there was a hole under the platform where a cobra lived and he had his little platter of milk every night because he was sacred and the old men sat around the tree and talked and pulled at the big huqas the waterpipes till far into the night they told wonderful tales of gods and men and ghosts and buldeo told even more wonderful ones of the ways of beasts in the jungle till the eyes of the children sitting outside the circle bulged out of their heads most of the tales were about animals for the jungle was always at their door the deer and the wild pig grubbed up their crops and now and again the tiger carried off a man at twilight within sight of the village gates  mowgli who naturally knew something about what they were talking of had to cover his face not to show that he was laughing while buldeo the tower musket across his knees climbed on from one wonderful story to another and mowglis shoulders shook  buldeo was explaining how the tiger that had carried away messuas son was a ghosttiger and his body was inhabited by the ghost of a wicked old moneylender who had died some years ago and i know that this is true he said because purun dass always limped from the blow that he got in a riot when his accountbooks were burned and the tiger that i speak of he limps too for the tracks of his pads are unequal  true true that must be the truth said the graybeards nodding together  are all these tales such cobwebs and moontalk said mowgli that tiger limps because he was born lame as every one knows to talk of the soul of a moneylender in a beast that never had the courage of a jackal is childs talk  buldeo was speechless with surprise for a moment and the headman stared  oho it is the jungle brat is it said buldeo if thou art so wise better bring his hide to khanhiwara for the government has set a hundred rupees on his life better still talk not when thy elders speak  mowgli rose to go all the evening i have lain here listening he called back over his shoulder and except once or twice buldeo has not said one word of truth concerning the jungle which is at his very doors how then shall i believe the tales of ghosts and gods and goblins which he says he has seen  it is full time that boy went to herding said the headman while buldeo puffed and snorted at mowglis impertinence  the custom of most indian villages is for a few boys to take the cattle and buffaloes out to graze in the early morning and bring them back at night and the very cattle that would trample a white man to death allow themselves to be banged and bullied and shouted at by children that hardly come up to their noses so long as the boys keep with the herds they are safe for not even the tiger will charge a mob of cattle but if they straggle to pick flowers or hunt lizards they are sometimes carried off mowgli went through the village street in the dawn sitting on the back of rama the great herd bull and the slatyblue buffaloes with their long backwardsweeping horns and savage eyes rose out of their byres one by one and followed him and mowgli made it very clear to the children with him that he was the master he beat the buffaloes with a long polished bamboo and told kamya one of the boys to graze the cattle by themselves while he went on with the buffaloes and to be very careful not to stray away from the herd  an indian grazingground is all rocks and scrubs and tussocks and little ravines among which the herds scatter and disappear the buffaloes generally keep to the pools and muddy places where they lie wallowing or basking in the warm mud for hours mowgli drove them on to the edge of the plain where the waingunga came out of the jungle then he dropped from ramas neck trotted off to a bamboo clump and found gray brother ah said gray brother i have waited here very many days what is the meaning of this cattleherding work  it is an order said mowgli i am a village herd for a while what news of shere khan  he has come back to this country and has waited here a long time for thee now he has gone off again for the game is scarce but he means to kill thee  very good said mowgli so long as he is away do thou or one of the four brothers sit on that rock so that i can see thee as i come out of the village when he comes back wait for me in the ravine by the dhâktree in the centre of the plain we need not walk into shere khans mouth  then mowgli picked out a shady place and lay down and slept while the buffaloes grazed round him herding in india is one of the laziest things in the world the cattle move and crunch and lie down and move on again and they do not even low they only grunt and the buffaloes very seldom say anything but get down into the muddy pools one after another and work their way into the mud till only their noses and staring chinablue eyes show above the surface and then they lie like logs the sun makes the rocks dance in the heat and the herdchildren hear one kite never any more whistling almost out of sight overhead and they know that if they died or a cow died that kite would sweep down and the next kite miles away would see him drop and follow and the next and the next and almost before they were dead there would be a score of hungry kites come out of nowhere then they sleep and wake and sleep again and weave little baskets of dried grass and put grasshoppers in them or catch two praying mantises and make them fight or string a necklace of red and black junglenuts or watch a lizard basking on a rock or a snake hunting a frog near the wallows then they sing long long songs with odd native quavers at the end of them and the day seems longer than most peoples whole lives and perhaps they make a mud castle with mud figures of men and horses and buffaloes and put reeds into the mens hands and pretend that they are kings and the figures are their armies or that they are gods to be worshipped then evening comes and the children call and the buffaloes lumber up out of the sticky mud with noises like gunshots going off one after the other and they all string across the gray plain back to the twinkling village lights  day after day mowgli would lead the buffaloes out to their wallows and day after day he would see gray brothers back a mile and a half away across the plain so he knew that shere khan had not come back and day after day he would lie on the grass listening to the noises round him and dreaming of old days in the jungle if shere khan had made a false step with his lame paw up in the jungles by the waingunga mowgli would have heard him in those long still mornings  at last a day came when he did not see gray brother at the signal place and he laughed and headed the buffaloes for the ravine by the dhâktree which was all covered with goldenred flowers there sat gray brother every bristle on his back lifted  he has hidden for a month to throw thee off thy guard he crossed the ranges last night with tabaqui hotfoot on thy trail said the wolf panting  mowgli frowned i am not afraid of shere khan but tabaqui is very cunning  have no fear said gray brother licking his lips a little i met tabaqui in the dawn now he is telling all his wisdom to the kites but he told me everything before i broke his back shere khans plan is to wait for thee at the village gate this eveningfor thee and for no one else he is lying up now in the big dry ravine of the waingunga  has he eaten today or does he hunt empty said mowgli for the answer meant life and death to him  he killed at dawna pigand he has drunk too remember shere khan could never fast even for the sake of revenge  oh fool fool what a cubs cub it is eaten and drunk too and he thinks that i shall wait till he has slept now where does he lie up if there were but ten of us we might pull him down as he lies these buffaloes will not charge unless they wind him and i cannot speak their language can we get behind his track so that they may smell it  he swam far down the waingunga to cut that off said gray brother  tabaqui told him that i know he would never have thought of it alone mowgli stood with his finger in his mouth thinking the big ravine of the waingunga that opens out on the plain not half a mile from here i can take the herd round through the jungle to the head of the ravine and then sweep downbut he would slink out at the foot we must block that end gray brother canst thou cut the herd in two for me  not i perhapsbut i have brought a wise helper gray brother trotted off and dropped into a hole then there lifted up a huge gray head that mowgli knew well and the hot air was filled with the most desolate cry of all the junglethe huntinghowl of a wolf at midday  akela akela said mowgli clapping his hands i might have known that thou wouldst not forget me we have a big work in hand cut the herd in two akela keep the cows and calves together and the bulls and the ploughbuffaloes by themselves  the two wolves ran ladieschain fashion in and out of the herd which snorted and threw up its head and separated into two clumps in one the cowbuffaloes stood with their calves in the centre and glared and pawed ready if a wolf would only stay still to charge down and trample the life out of him in the other the bulls and the young bulls snorted and stamped but though they looked more imposing they were much less dangerous for they had no calves to protect no six men could have divided the herd so neatly  what orders panted akela they are trying to join again  mowgli slipped on to ramas back drive the bulls away to the left akela gray brother when we are gone hold the cows together and drive them into the foot of the ravine  how far said gray brother panting and snapping  till the sides are higher than shere khan can jump shouted mowgli keep them there till we come down the bulls swept off as akela bayed and gray brother stopped in front of the cows they charged down on him and he ran just before them to the foot of the ravine as akela drove the bulls far to the left  well done another charge and they are fairly started careful nowcareful akela a snap too much and the bulls will charge hujah this is wilder work than driving blackbuck didst thou think these creatures could move so swiftly mowgli called  i havehave hunted these too in my time gasped akela in the dust shall i turn them into the jungle  ay turn swiftly turn them rama is mad with rage oh if i could only tell him what i need of him today  the bulls were turned to the right this time and crashed into the standing thicket the other herdchildren watching with the cattle half a mile away hurried to the village as fast as their legs could carry them crying that the buffaloes had gone mad and run away but mowglis plan was simple enough all he wanted to do was to make a big circle uphill and get at the head of the ravine and then take the bulls down it and catch shere khan between the bulls and the cows for he knew that after a meal and a full drink shere khan would not be in any condition to fight or to clamber up the sides of the ravine he was soothing the buffaloes now by voice and akela had dropped far to the rear only whimpering once or twice to hurry the rearguard it was a long long circle for they did not wish to get too near the ravine and give shere khan warning at last mowgli rounded up the bewildered herd at the head of the ravine on a grassy patch that sloped steeply down to the ravine itself from that height you could see across the tops of the trees down to the plain below but what mowgli looked at was the sides of the ravine and he saw with a great deal of satisfaction that they ran nearly straight up and down while the vines and creepers that hung over them would give no foothold to a tiger who wanted to get out  let them breathe akela he said holding up his hand they have not winded him yet i must tell shere khan who comes we have him in a trap  he put his hands to his mouth and shouted down the ravineit was almost like shouting down a tunneland the echoes jumped from rock to rock  after a long time there came back the drawling sleepy snarl of a fullfed tiger just wakened  who calls said shere khan and a splendid peacock fluttered up out of the ravine screeching  i mowgli cattle thief it is time to come to the council rock downhurry them down akela down rama down  the herd paused for an instant at the edge of the slope but akela gave tongue in the full hunting yell and they pitched over one after the other just as steamers shoot rapids the sand and stones spurting up round them once started there was no chance of stopping and before they were fairly in the bed of the ravine rama winded shere khan and bellowed  ha ha said mowgli on his back now thou knowest and the torrent of black horns foaming muzzles and staring eyes whirled down the ravine just as boulders go down in floodtime the weaker buffaloes being shouldered out to the sides of the ravine where they tore through the creepers they knew what the business was before themthe terrible charge of the buffalo herd against which no tiger can hope to stand shere khan heard the thunder of their hoofs picked himself up and lumbered down the ravine looking from side to side for some way of escape but the walls of the ravine were straight and he had to hold on heavy with his dinner and drink willing to do anything rather than fight the herd splashed through the pool he had just left bellowing till the narrow cut rang mowgli heard an answering bellow from the foot of the ravine saw shere khan turn the tiger knew if the worst came to the worst it was better to meet the bulls than the cows with their calves and then rama tripped and stumbled and went on again over something soft and with the bulls at his heels crashed full into the other herd while the weaker buffaloes were lifted clean off their feet by the shock of the meeting that charge carried both herds out into the plain goring and stamping and snorting mowgli watched his time and slipped off ramas neck laying about right and left with his stick  quick akela break them up scatter them or they will be fighting one another drive them away akela hai rama hai hai hai my children softly now softly it is all over  akela and gray brother ran to and fro nipping the buffaloes legs and though the herd wheeled once to charge up the ravine again mowgli managed to turn rama and the others followed him to the wallows  shere khan needed no more trampling he was dead and the kites were coming for him already  brothers that was a dogs death said mowgli feeling for the knife he always carried in a sheath round his neck now that he lived with men but he would never have shown fight wallah his hide will look well on the council rock we must get to work swiftly  a boy trained among men would never have dreamed of skinning a tenfoot tiger alone but mowgli knew better than any one else how an animals skin is fitted on and how it can be taken off but it was hard work and mowgli slashed and tore and grunted for an hour while the wolves lolled out their tongues or came forward and tugged as he ordered them presently a hand fell on his shoulder and looking up he saw buldeo with the tower musket the children had told the village about the buffalo stampede and buldeo went out angrily only too anxious to correct mowgli for not taking better care of the herd the wolves dropped out of sight as soon as they saw the man coming  what is this folly said buldeo angrily to think that thou canst skin a tiger where did the buffaloes kill him it is the lame tiger too and there is a hundred rupees on his head well well we will overlook thy letting the herd run off and perhaps i will give thee one of the rupees of the reward when i have taken the skin to khanhiwara he fumbled in his waistcloth for flint and steel and stooped down to singe shere khans whiskers most native hunters always singe a tigers whiskers to prevent his ghost from haunting them  hum said mowgli half to himself as he ripped back the skin of a forepaw so thou wilt take the hide to khanhiwara for the reward and perhaps give me one rupee now it is in my mind that i need the skin for my own use heh old man take away that fire  what talk is this to the chief hunter of the village thy luck and the stupidity of thy buffaloes have helped thee to this kill the tiger has just fed or he would have gone twenty miles by this time thou canst not even skin him properly little beggar brat and forsooth i buldeo must be told not to singe his whiskers mowgli i will not give thee one anna of the reward but only a very big beating leave the carcass  by the bull that bought me said mowgli who was trying to get at the shoulder must i stay babbling to an old ape all noon here akela this man plagues me  buldeo who was still stooping over shere khans head found himself sprawling on the grass with a gray wolf standing over him while mowgli went on skinning as though he were alone in all india  yees he said between his teeth thou art altogether right buldeo thou wilt never give me one anna of the reward there is an old war between this lame tiger and myselfa very old war andi have won  to do buldeo justice if he had been ten years younger he would have taken his chance with akela had he met the wolf in the woods but a wolf who obeyed the orders of this boy who had private wars with maneating tigers was not a common animal it was sorcery magic of the worst kind thought buldeo and he wondered whether the amulet round his neck would protect him he lay as still as still expecting every minute to see mowgli turn into a tiger too  maharaj great king he said at last in a husky whisper  yes said mowgli without turning his head chuckling a little  i am an old man i did not know that thou wast anything more than a herdsboy may i rise up and go away or will thy servant tear me to pieces  go and peace go with thee only another time do not meddle with my game let him go akela  buldeo hobbled away to the village as fast as he could looking back over his shoulder in case mowgli should change into something terrible when he got to the village he told a tale of magic and enchantment and sorcery that made the priest look very grave  mowgli went on with his work but it was nearly twilight before he and the wolves had drawn the great gray skin clear of the body  now we must hide this and take the buffaloes home help me to herd them akela  the herd rounded up in the misty twilight and when they got near the village mowgli saw lights and heard the conches and bells in the temple blowing and banging half the village seemed to be waiting for him by the gate that is because i have killed shere khan he said to himself but a shower of stones whistled about his ears and the villagers shouted sorcerer wolfs brat jungledemon go away get hence quickly or the priest will turn thee into a wolf again shoot buldeo shoot  the old tower musket went off with a bang and a young buffalo bellowed in pain  more sorcery shouted the villagers he can turn bullets buldeo that was thy buffalo  now what is this said mowgli bewildered as the stones flew thicker  they are not unlike the pack these brothers of thine said akela sitting down composedly it is in my head that if bullets mean anything they would cast thee out  wolf wolfs cub go away shouted the priest waving a sprig of the sacred tulsi plant  again last time it was because i was a man this time it is because i am a wolf let us go akela  a womanit was messuaran across to the herd and cried oh my son my son they say thou art a sorcerer who can turn himself into a beast at will i do not believe but go away or they will kill thee buldeo says thou art a wizard but i know thou hast avenged nathoos death  come back messua shouted the crowd come back or we will stone thee  mowgli laughed a little short ugly laugh for a stone had hit him in the mouth run back messua this is one of the foolish tales they tell under the big tree at dusk i have at least paid for thy sons life farewell and run quickly for i shall send the herd in more swiftly than their brickbats i am no wizard messua farewell  now once more akela he cried bring the herd in  the buffaloes were anxious enough to get to the village they hardly needed akelas yell but charged through the gate like a whirlwind scattering the crowd right and left  keep count shouted mowgli scornfully it may be that i have stolen one of them keep count for i will do your herding no more fare you well children of men and thank messua that i do not come in with my wolves and hunt you up and down your street  he turned on his heel and walked away with the lone wolf and as he looked up at the stars he felt happy no more sleeping in traps for me akela let us get shere khans skin and go away no we will not hurt the village for messua was kind to me  when the moon rose over the plain making it look all milky the horrified villagers saw mowgli with two wolves at his heels and a bundle on his head trotting across at the steady wolfs trot that eats up the long miles like fire then they banged the temple bells and blew the conches louder than ever and messua cried and buldeo embroidered the story of his adventures in the jungle till he ended by saying that akela stood up on his hind legs and talked like a man  the moon was just going down when mowgli and the two wolves came to the hill of the council rock and they stopped at mother wolfs cave  they have cast me out from the man pack mother shouted mowgli but i come with the hide of shere khan to keep my word mother wolf walked stiffly from the cave with the cubs behind her and her eyes glowed as she saw the skin  i told him on that day when he crammed his head and shoulders into this cave hunting for thy life little frogi told him that the hunter would be the hunted it is well done  little brother it is well done said a deep voice in the thicket we were lonely in the jungle without thee and bagheera came running to mowglis bare feet they clambered up the council rock together and mowgli spread the skin out on the flat stone where akela used to sit and pegged it down with four slivers of bamboo and akela lay down upon it and called the old call to the council look look well o wolves exactly as he had called when mowgli was first brought there  ever since akela had been deposed the pack had been without a leader hunting and fighting at their own pleasure but they answered the call from habit and some of them were lame from the traps they had fallen into and some limped from shotwounds and some were mangy from eating bad food and many were missing but they came to the council rock all that were left of them and saw shere khans striped hide on the rock and the huge claws dangling at the end of the empty dangling feet  look well o wolves have i kept my word said mowgli and the wolves bayed yes and one tattered wolf howled  lead us again o akela lead us again o mancub for we be sick of this lawlessness and we would be the free people once more  nay purred bagheera that may not be when ye are full fed the madness may come upon you again not for nothing are ye called the free people ye fought for freedom and it is yours eat it o wolves  manpack and wolfpack have cast me out said mowgli now i will hunt alone in the jungle  and we will hunt with thee said the four cubs  so mowgli went away and hunted with the four cubs in the jungle from that day on but he was not always alone because years afterward he became a man and married  but that is a story for grownups   mowglis song  that he sang at the council rock when he danced on shere khans hide  the song of mowglii mowgli  am  singing let  the    jungle listen to the things i have done shere khan said he would killwould kill at the gates    in the twilight he would kill mowgli the frog he ate and he drank drink deep shere khan for when    wilt thou drink again sleep and dream of the kill i am alone on the grazinggrounds gray brother come to me    come to me lone wolf for there is big game afoot bring up the great bullbuffaloes the blueskinned herdbulls    with the angry eyes drive them to and fro as i order    sleepest thou still shere khan wake o wake here come i    and the bulls are behind rama the  king of the buffaloes stamped with his foot    waters of the waingunga whither went shere khan he is not sahi to dig holes nor mor the peacock that he    should

know it there is a great assembly in his honour alala i have no cloth to wrap me the kites will see that i am    naked i am ashamed to meet all these people lend me thy coat shere khan lend me thy gay striped coat that    i may go to the council rock by the bull that bought me i made a promisea little promise    only thy coat is lacking before i keep my word with the knife with the knife that men use with the knife    of the hunter i will stoop down for my gift waters of the waingunga shere khan gives me his coat for the love    that he bears me pull gray brother    pull akela heavy is the hide of shere khan the man pack are angry they throw stones and talk childs talk    my mouth is bleeding let me run away through the night through the hot night run swiftly with me my    brothers we will leave the lights of the village and go to the    low moon waters of the waingunga the man pack have cast me out i did them    no harm but they were afraid of me why wolf pack ye have cast me out too the jungle is shut to me and the    village gates are shut why as mang flies between the beasts and birds so fly i between the    village and the jungle why i dance on the hide of shere khan but my heart is very heavy my    mouth is cut and wounded with the stones from the village but    my heart is very light because i have come back to the jungle    why these two things fight together in me as the snakes fight in the    spring the water comes out of my eyes yet i laugh while it    falls why i am two mowglis but the hide of shere khan is under my feet all the jungle knows that i have killed shere khan look look    well o wolves ahae my heart is heavy with the things that i do not understand     tods amendment          the world hath set its heavy yoke         upon the old whitebearded folk           who strive to please the king         gods mercy is upon the young         gods wisdom in the baby tongue           that fears not anything                           the parable of chajju bhagat  now tods mamma was a singularly charming woman and every one in simla knew tods most men had saved him from death on occasions he was beyond his ayahs control altogether and perilled his life daily to find out what would happen if you pulled a mountain battery mules tail he was an utterly fearless young pagan about six years old and the only baby who ever broke the holy calm of the supreme legislative council  it happened this way tods pet kid got loose and fled up the hill off the boileaugunge road tods after it until it burst in to the viceregal lodge lawn then attached to peterhoff the council were sitting at the time and the windows were open because it was warm the red lancer in the porch told tods to go away but tods knew the red lancer and most of the members of council personally moreover he had firm hold of the kids collar and was being dragged all across the flowerbeds give my salaam to the long councillor sahib and ask him to help me take moti back gasped tods the council heard the noise through the open windows and after an interval was seen the shocking spectacle of a legal member and a lieutenantgovernor helping under the direct patronage of a commanderinchief and a viceroy one small and very dirty boy in a sailors suit and a tangle of brown hair to coerce a lively and rebellious kid they headed it off down the path to the mall and tods went home in triumph and told his mamma that all the councillor sahibs had been helping him to catch moti whereat his mamma smacked tods for interfering with the administration of the empire but tods met the legal member the next day and told him in confidence that if the legal member ever wanted to catch a goat he tods would give him all the help in his power thank you tods said the legal member  tods was the idol of some eighty jhampanis and half as many saises he saluted them all as o brother it never entered his head that any living human being could disobey his orders and he was the buffer between the servants and his mammas wrath the working of that household turned on tods who was adored by every one from the dhoby to the dogboy even futteh khan the villainous loafer khit from mussoorie shirked risking tods displeasure for fear his comates should look down on him  so tods had honour in the land from boileaugunge to chota simla and ruled justly according to his lights of course he spoke urdu but he had also mastered many queer sidespeeches like the chotee bolee of the women and held grave converse with shopkeepers and hillcoolies alike he was precocious for his age and his mixing with natives had taught him some of the more bitter truths of life the meanness and the sordidness of it he used over his bread and milk to deliver solemn and serious aphorisms translated from the vernacular into the english that made his mamma jump and vow that tods must go home next hot weather just when tods was in the bloom of his power the supreme legislature were hacking out a bill for the submontane tracts a revision of the then act smaller than the punjab land bill but affecting a few hundred thousand people none the less the legal member had built and bolstered and embroidered and amended that bill till it looked beautiful on paper then the council began to settle what they called the minor details as if any englishman legislating for natives knows enough to know which are the minor and which are the major points from the native point of view of any measure that bill was a triumph of safeguarding the interests of the tenant one clause provided that land should not be leased on longer terms than five years at a stretch because if the landlord had a tenant bound down for say twenty years he would squeeze the very life out of him the notion was to keep up a stream of independent cultivators in the submontane tracts and ethnologically and politically the notion was correct the only drawback was that it was altogether wrong a natives life in india implies the life of his son wherefore you cannot legislate for one generation at a time you must consider the next from the native point of view curiously enough the native now and then and in northern india more particularly hates being overprotected against himself there was a naga village once where they lived on dead and buried commissariat mules but that is another story  for many reasons to be explained later the people concerned objected to the bill the native member in council knew as much about punjabis as he knew about charing cross he had said in calcutta that the bill was entirely in accord with the desires of that large and important class the cultivators and so on and so on the legal members knowledge of natives was limited to englishspeaking durbaris and his own red chaprassis the submontane tracts concerned no one in particular the deputy commissioners were a good deal too driven to make representations and the measure was one which dealt with small landholders only nevertheless the legal member prayed that it might be correct for he was a nervously conscientious man he did not know that no man can tell what natives think unless he mixes with them with the varnish off and not always then but he did the best he knew and the measure came up to the supreme council for the final touches while tods patrolled the burra simla bazar in his morning rides and played with the monkey belonging to ditta mull the bunnia and listened as a child listens to all the stray talk about this new freak of the lord sahibs  one day there was a dinnerparty at the house of tods mamma and the legal member came tods was in bed but he kept awake till he heard the bursts of laughter from the men over the coffee then he paddled out in his little red flannel dressinggown and his nightsuit and took refuge by the side of his father knowing that he would not be sent back see the miseries of having a family said tods father giving tods three prunes some water in a glass that had been used for claret and telling him to sit still tods sucked the prunes slowly knowing that he would have to go when they were finished and sipped the pink water like a man of the world as he listened to the conversation presently the legal member talking shop to the head of a department mentioned his bill by its full namethe submontane tracts ryotwary revised enactment tods caught the one native word and lifting up his small voice said  oh i know all about that has it been murramutted yet councillor sahib  how much said the legal member murramuttedmendedput theek you  knowmade nice to please ditta mull  the legal member left his place and moved up next to tods  what do you know about ryotwari little man he said  im not a little man im tods and i know all about it ditta mull and choga lall and amir nath andoh lakhs of my friends tell me about it in the bazars when i talk to them  oh they dodo they what do they say tods  tods tucked his feet under his red flannel dressinggown and saidi must fink  the legal member waited patiently then tods with infinite compassion  you dont speak my talk do you councillor sahib  no   i  am  sorry  to  say i  do  not said the legal member  very well said tods i must fink in english  he spent a minute putting his ideas in order and began very slowly translating in his mind from the vernacular to english as many angloindian children do you must remember that the legal member helped him on by questions when he halted for tods was not equal to the sustained flight of oratory that follows  ditta mull says this thing is the talk of a child and was made up by fools but i dont think you are a fool councillor sahib said tods hastily you caught my goat this is what ditta mull saysi am not a fool and why should the sirkar say i am a child i can see if the land is good and if the landlord is good if i am a fool the sin is upon my own head for five years i take my ground for which i have saved money and a wife i take too and a little son is born ditta mull has one daughter now but he says he will have a son soon and he says at the end of five years by this new bundobust i must go if i do not go i must get fresh seals and takkusstamps on the papers perhaps in the middle of the harvest and to go to the lawcourts once is wisdom but to go twice is jehannum that is quite true explained tods gravely all my friends say so and ditta mull says always fresh takkus and paying money to vakils and chaprassis and lawcourts every five years or else the landlord makes me go why do i want to go am i a fool if i am a fool and do not know after forty years good land when i see it let me die but if the new bundobust says for fifteen years that is good and wise my little son is a man and i am burnt and he takes the ground or another ground paying only once for the takkusstamps on the papers and his little son is born and at the end of fifteen years is a man too but what profit is there in five years and fresh papers nothing but dikh trouble dikh we are not young men who take these lands but old onesnot farmers but tradesmen with a little moneyand for fifteen years we shall have peace nor are we children that the sirkar should treat us so  here tods stopped short for the whole table were listening the legal member said to tods is that all  all i can remember said tods but you should see ditta mulls big monkey its just like a councillor sahib  tods go to bed said his father  tods gathered up his dressinggown tail and departed the legal member brought his hand down on the table with a crashby jove said the legal member i believe the boy is right the short tenure is the weak point  he left early thinking over what tods had said now it was obviously impossible for the legal member to play with a bunnias monkey by way of getting understanding but he did better he made inquiries always bearing in mind the fact that the real nativenot the hybrid universitytrained muleis as timid as a colt and little by little he coaxed some of the men whom the measure concerned most intimately to give in their views which squared very closely with tods evidence  so the bill was amended in that clause and the legal member was filled with an uneasy suspicion that native members represent very little except the orders they carry on their bosoms but he put the thought from him as illiberal he was a most liberal man  after a time the news spread through the bazars that tods had got the bill recast in the tenureclause and if tods mamma had not interfered tods would have made himself sick on the baskets of fruit and pistachio nuts and cabuli grapes and almonds that crowded the verandah till he went home tods ranked some few degrees before the viceroy in popular estimation but for the little life of him tods could not understand why  in the legal members privatepaperbox still lies the rough draft of the submontane tracts ryotwary revised enactment and opposite the twentysecond clause pencilled in blue chalk and signed by the legal member are the words tods amendment     the story of muhammad din  who is the happy man he that sees in his own house at home little children crowned with dust leaping and falling and crying  munichandra translated by professor peterson   the poloball was an old one scarred chipped and dinted it stood on the mantelpiece among the pipestems which imam din khitmatgar was cleaning for me  does the heavenborn want this ball said imam din deferentially  the heavenborn set no particular store by it but of what use was a poloball to a khitmatgar  by your honours favour i have a little son he has seen this ball and desires it to play with i do not want it for myself  no one would for an instant accuse portly old imam din of wanting to play with poloballs he carried out the battered thing into the verandah and there followed a hurricane of joyful squeaks a patter of small feet and the thudthudthud of the ball rolling along the ground evidently the little son had been waiting outside the door to secure his treasure but how had he managed to see that poloball  next day coming back from office half an hour earlier than usual i was aware of a small figure in the diningrooma tiny plump figure in a ridiculously inadequate shirt which came perhaps halfway down the tubby stomach it wandered round the room thumb in mouth crooning to itself as it took stock of the pictures undoubtedly this was the little son  he had no business in my room of course but was so deeply absorbed in his discoveries that he never noticed me in the doorway i stepped into the room and startled him nearly into a fit he sat down on the ground with a gasp his eyes opened and his mouth followed suit i knew what was coming and fled followed by a long dry howl which reached the servants quarters far more quickly than any command of mine had ever done in ten seconds imam din was in the diningroom then despairing sobs arose and i returned to find imam din admonishing the small sinner who was using most of his shirt as a handkerchief  this boy said imam din judicially is a budmasha big budmash he will without doubt go to the jailkhana for his behaviour renewed yells from the penitent and an elaborate apology to myself from imam din  tell the baby said i that the sahib is not angry and take him away imam din conveyed my forgiveness to the offender who had now gathered all his shirt round his neck stringwise and the yell subsided into a sob the two set off for the door his name said imam din as though the name were part of the crime is muhammad din and he is a budmash freed from present danger muhammad din turned round in his fathers arms and said gravely it is true that my name is muhammad din tahib but i am not a budmash i am a man  from that day dated my acquaintance with muhammad din never again did he come into my diningroom but on the neutral ground of the garden we greeted each other with much state though our conversation was confined to talaam tahib from his side and salaam muhammad din from mine daily on my return from office the little white shirt and the fat little body used to rise from the shade of the creepercovered trellis where they had been hid and daily i checked my horse here that my salutation might not be slurred over or given unseemly  muhammad din never had any companions he used to trot about the compound in and out of the castoroil bushes on mysterious errands of his own one day i stumbled upon some of his handiwork far down the grounds he had half buried the poloball in dust and stuck six shrivelled old marigold flowers in a circle round it outside that circle again was a rude square traced out in bits of red brick alternating with fragments of broken china the whole bounded by a little bank of dust the waterman from the wellcurb put in a plea for the small architect saying that it was only the play of a baby and did not much disfigure my garden  heaven knows that i had no intention of touching the childs work then or later but that evening a stroll through the garden brought me unawares full on it so that i trampled before i knew marigoldheads dustbank and fragments of broken soap dish into confusion past all hope of mending next morning i came upon muhammad din crying softly to himself over the ruin i had wrought some one had cruelly told him that the sahib was very angry with him for spoiling the garden and had scattered his rubbish using bad language the while muhammad din laboured for an hour at effacing every trace of the dust bank and pottery fragments and it was with a tearful and apologetic face that he said talaam tahib when i came home from office a hasty inquiry resulted in imam din informing muhammad din that by my singular favour he was permitted to disport himself as he pleased whereat the child took heart and fell to tracing the groundplan of an edifice which was to eclipse the marigoldpoloball creation  for some months the chubby little eccentricity revolved in his humble orbit among the castoroil bushes and in the dust always fashioning magnificent palaces from stale flowers thrown away by the bearer smooth waterworn pebbles bits of broken glass and feathers pulled i fancy from my fowlsalways alone and always crooning to himself  a gailyspotted seashell was dropped one day close to the last of his little buildings and i looked that muhammad din should build something more than ordinarily splendid on the strength of it nor was i disappointed he meditated for the better part of an hour and his crooning rose to a jubilant song then he began tracing in the dust it would certainly be a wondrous palace this one for it was two yards long and a yard broad in groundplan but the palace was never completed  next day there was no muhammad din at the head of the carriagedrive and no talaam tahib to welcome my return i had grown accustomed to the greeting and its omission troubled me next day imam din told me that the child was suffering slightly from fever and needed quinine he got the medicine and an english doctor  they have no stamina these brats said the doctor as he left imam dins quarters  a week later though i would have given much to have avoided it i met on the road to the mussulman buryingground imam din accompanied by one other friend carrying in his arms wrapped in a white cloth all that was left of little muhammad din     the finances of the gods  the evening meal was ended in dhunni bhagats chubara and the old priests were smoking or counting their beads a little naked child pattered in with its mouth wide open a handful of marigold flowers in one hand and a lump of conserved tobacco in the other it tried to kneel and make obeisance to gobind but it was so fat that it fell forward on its shaven head and rolled on its side kicking and gasping while the marigolds tumbled one way and the tobacco the other gobind laughed set it up again and blessed the marigold flowers as he received the tobacco  from my father said the child he has the fever and cannot come wilt thou pray for him father  surely littlest but the smoke is on the ground and the nightchill is in the air and it is not good to go abroad naked in the autumn  i have no clothes said the child and all today i have been carrying cowdung cakes to the bazar it was very hot and i am very tired it shivered a little for the twilight was cool  gobind lifted an arm under his vast tattered quilt of many colours and made an inviting little nest by his side the child crept in and gobind filled his brassstudded leather waterpipe with the new tobacco when i came to the chubara the shaven head with the tuft atop and the beady black eyes looked out of the folds of the quilt as a squirrel looks out from his nest and gobind was smiling while the child played with his beard  i would have said something friendly but remembered in time that if the child fell ill afterwards i should be credited with the evil eye and that is a horrible possession sit thou still thumbling i said as it made to get up and run away where is thy slate and why has the teacher let such an evil character loose on the streets when there are no police to protect us weaklings in which ward dost thou try to break thy neck with flying kites from the housetop  nay sahib nay said the child burrowing its face into gobinds beard and twisting uneasily there was a holiday today among the schools and i do not always fly kites i play kerlikit like the rest  cricket is the national game among the schoolboys of the punjab from the naked hedgeschool children who use an old kerosinetin for wicket to the bas of the university who compete for the championship belt  thou play kerlikit thou art half the weight of the bat i said  the child nodded resolutely yea i do play perlayball owat ran ran ran i know it all  but thou must not forget with all this to pray to the gods according to custom said gobind who did not altogether approve of cricket and western innovations  i do not forget said the child in a hushed voice  also to give reverence to thy teacher and  gobinds voice softenedto abstain from pulling holy men by the beard little badling eh eh eh  the childs face was altogether hidden in the great white beard and it began to whimper till gobind soothed it as children are soothed all the world over with the promise of a story  i did not think to frighten thee senseless little one look up am i angry aré aré aré shall i weep too and of our tears make a great pond and drown us both and then thy father will never get well lacking thee to pull his beard peace peace and i will tell thee of the gods thou hast heard many tales  very many father  now this is a new one which thou hast not heard long and long ago when the gods walked with men as they do today but that we have not faith to see shiv the greatest of gods and parbati his wife were walking in the garden of a temple  which temple that in the nandgaon ward said the child  nay very far away maybe at trimbak or hurdwar whither thou must make pilgrimage when thou art a man now there was sitting in the garden under the jujube trees a mendicant that had worshipped shiv for forty years and he lived on the offerings of the pious and meditated holiness night and day  oh father was it thou said the child looking up with large eyes  nay i have said it was long ago and moreover this mendicant was married  did they put him on a horse with flowers on his head and forbid him to go to sleep all night long thus they did to me when they made my wedding said the child who had been married a few months before  and what didst thou do said i  i wept and they called me evil names and then i smote her and we wept together  thus did not the mendicant said gobind for he was a holy man and very poor parbati perceived him sitting naked by the temple steps where all went up and down and she said to shiv what shall men think of the gods when the gods thus scorn the worshippers for forty years yonder man has prayed to us and yet there be only a few grains of rice and some broken cowries before him after all mens hearts will be hardened by this thing and shiv said it shall be looked to and so he called to the temple which was the temple of his son ganesh of the elephant head saying son there is a mendicant without who is very poor what wilt thou do for him then that great elephantheaded one awoke in the dark and answered in three days if it be thy will he shall have one lakh of rupees then shiv and parbati went away  but there was a moneylender in the garden hidden among  the marigoldsthe child looked at the ball of crumpled blossoms in its handsay among the yellow marigolds and he heard the gods talking he was a covetous man and of a black heart and he desired that lakh of rupees for himself so he went to the mendicant and said oh brother how much do the pious give thee daily the mendicant said i cannot tell sometimes a little rice sometimes a little pulse and a few cowries and it has been pickled mangoes and dried fish  that is good said the child smacking its lips then  said  the moneylender  because  i  have  long watched thee and learned to love thee and thy patience i will give thee now five rupees for all thy earnings of the three days to come there is only a bond to sign on the matter but the mendicant said thou art mad in two months i do not receive the worth of five rupees and he told the thing to his wife that evening she being a woman said when did moneylender ever make a bad bargain the wolf runs the corn for the sake of the fat deer our fate is in the hands of the gods pledge it not even for three days  so the mendicant returned to the moneylender and would not sell then that wicked man sat all day before him offering more and more for those three days earnings first ten fifty and a hundred rupees and then for he did not know when the gods would pour down their gifts rupees by the thousand till he had offered half a lakh of rupees upon this sum the mendicants wife shifted her counsel and the mendicant signed the bond and the money was paid in silver great white bullocks bringing it by the cartload but saving only all that money the mendicant received nothing from the gods at all and the heart of the moneylender was uneasy on account of expectation therefore at noon of the third day the moneylender went into the temple to spy upon the councils of the gods and to learn in what manner that gift might arrive even as he was making his prayers a crack between the stones of the floor gaped and closing caught him by the heel then he heard the gods walking in the temple in the darkness of the columns and shiv called to his son ganesh saying son what hast thou done in regard to the lakh of rupees for the mendicant and ganesh woke for the moneylender heard the dry rustle of his trunk uncoiling and he answered father onehalf of the money has been paid and the debtor for the other half i hold here fast by the heel  the child bubbled with laughter and the moneylender paid the mendicant it said  surely for he whom the gods hold by the heel must pay to the uttermost the money was paid at evening all silver in great carts and thus ganesh did his work  nathu ohe nathu  a woman was calling in the dusk by the door of the courtyard  the child began to wriggle that is my mother it said  go then littlest answered gobind but stay a moment  he ripped a generous yard from his patchworkquilt put it over the childs shoulders and the child ran away     moti gujmutineer  once upon a time there was a coffeeplanter in india who wished to clear some forest land for coffeeplanting when he had cut down all the trees and burned the underwood the stumps still remained dynamite is expensive and slowfire slow the happy medium for stumpclearing is the lord of all beasts who is the elephant he will either push the stump out of the ground with his tusks if he has any or drag it out with ropes the planter therefore hired elephants by ones and twos and threes and fell to work the very best of all the elephants belonged to the very worst of all the drivers or mahouts and the  superior beasts name was moti guj he was the absolute property of his mahout which would never have been the case under native rule for moti guj was a creature to be desired by kings and his name being translated meant the pearl elephant because the british government was in the land deesa the mahout enjoyed his property undisturbed he was dissipated when he had made much money through the strength of his elephant he would get extremely drunk and give moti guj a beating with a tentpeg over the tender nails of the forefeet moti guj never trampled the life out of deesa on these occasions for he knew that after the beating was over deesa would embrace his trunk and weep and call him his love and his life and the liver of his soul and give him some liquor moti guj was very fond of liquorarrack for choice though he would drink palmtree toddy if nothing better offered then deesa would go to sleep between moti gujs forefeet and as deesa generally chose the middle of the public road and as moti guj mounted guard over him and would not permit horse foot or cart to pass by traffic was congested till deesa saw fit to wake up  there was no sleeping in the daytime on the planters clearing the wages were too high to risk deesa sat on moti gujs neck and gave him orders while moti guj rooted up the stumpsfor he owned a magnificent pair of tusks or pulled at the end of a ropefor he had a magnificent pair of shoulders while deesa kicked him behind the ears and said he was the king of elephants at evening time moti guj would wash down his three hundred pounds weight of green food with a quart of arrack and deesa would take a share and sing songs between moti gujs legs till it was time to go to bed once a week deesa led moti guj down to the river and moti guj lay on his side luxuriously in the shallows while deesa went over him with a coirswab and a brick moti guj never mistook the pounding blow of the latter for the smack of the former that warned him to get up and turn over on the other side then deesa would look at his feet and examine his eyes and turn up the fringes of his mighty ears in case of sores or budding ophthalmia after  inspection the two would come up with a song from the sea moti guj all black and shining waving a torn tree branch twelve feet long in his trunk and deesa knotting up his own long wet hair  it was a peaceful wellpaid life till deesa felt the return of the desire to drink deep he wished for an orgie the little draughts that led nowhere were taking the manhood out of him  he went to the planter and my mothers dead said he weeping  she died on the last plantation two months ago and she died once before that when you were working for me last year said the planter who knew something of the ways of nativedom  then its my aunt and she was just the same as a mother to me said deesa weeping more than ever she has left eighteen small children entirely without bread and it is i who must fill their little stomachs said deesa beating his head on the floor  who brought you the news said the planter the post said deesa  there hasnt been a post here for the past week get back to your lines  a devastating sickness has fallen on my village and all my wives are dying yelled deesa really in tears this time call chihun who comes from deesas village said the planter chihun has this man a wife  he said chihun no not a woman of our village would look at him theyd sooner marry the elephant chihun snorted deesa wept and bellowed  you will get into a difficulty in a minute said the planter go back to your work  now i will speak heavens truth gulped deesa with an inspiration i havent been drunk for two months i desire to depart in order to get properly drunk afar off and distant from this heavenly plantation thus i shall cause no trouble  a flickering smile crossed the planters face deesa said he youve spoken the truth and id give you leave on the spot if anything could be done with moti guj while youre away you know that he will only obey your orders  may the light of the heavens live forty thousand years i shall be absent but ten little days after that upon my faith and honour and soul i return as to the inconsiderable interval have i the gracious permission of the heavenborn to call up moti guj  permission was granted and in answer to deesas shrill yell the lordly tusker swung out of the shade of a clump of trees where he had been squirting dust over himself till his master should return  light of my heart protector of the drunken mountain of might give ear said deesa standing in front of him  moti guj gave ear and saluted with his trunk i am going away said deesa  moti gujs eyes twinkled he liked jaunts as well as his master one could snatch all manner of nice things from the roadside then  but you you fubsy old pig must stay behind and work  the twinkle died out as moti guj tried to look delighted he hated stumphauling on the plantation it hurt his teeth  i shall be gone for ten days oh delectable one hold up your near forefoot and ill impress the fact upon it warty toad of a dried mudpuddle deesa took a tentpeg and banged moti guj ten times on the nails moti guj grunted and shuffled from foot to foot  ten days said deesa you must work and haul and root trees as chihun here shall order you take up chihun and set him on your neck moti guj curled the tip of his trunk chihun put his foot there and was swung on to the neck deesa handed chihun the heavy ankus the iron elephantgoad  chihun thumped moti gujs bald head as a paviour thumps a kerbstone  moti guj trumpeted  be still hog of the backwoods chihuns your mahout for ten days and now bid me goodbye beast after mine own heart oh my lord my king jewel of all created elephants lily of the herd preserve your honoured health be virtuous adieu  moti guj lapped his trunk round deesa and swung him into the air twice that was his way of bidding the man goodbye  hell work now said deesa to the planter have i leave to go  the planter nodded and deesa dived into the woods moti guj went back to haul stumps  chihun was very kind to him but he felt unhappy and forlorn notwithstanding chihun gave him balls of spices and tickled him under the chin and chihuns little baby cooed to him after work was over and chihuns wife called him a darling but moti guj was a bachelor by instinct as deesa was he did not understand the domestic emotions he wanted the light of his universe back againthe drink and the drunken slumber the savage beatings and the savage caresses  none the less he worked well and the planter wondered deesa had vagabonded along the roads till he met a marriage procession of his own caste and drinking dancing and tippling had drifted past all knowledge of the lapse of time  the morning of the eleventh day dawned and there returned no deesa moti guj was loosed from his ropes for the daily stint he swung clear looked round shrugged his shoulders and began to walk away as one having business elsewhere  hi ho come back you shouted chihun come back and put me on your neck misborn mountain return splendour of the hillsides adornment of all india heave to or ill bang every toe off your fat forefoot  moti guj gurgled gently but did not obey chihun ran after him with a rope and caught him up moti guj put his ears forward and chihun knew what that meant though he tried to carry it off with high words  none of your nonsense with me said he to your pickets devilson  hrrump said moti guj and that was allthat and the forebent ears  moti guj put his hands in his pockets chewed a branch for a toothpick and strolled about the clearing making jest of the other elephants who had just set to work  chihun reported the state of affairs to the planter who came out with a dogwhip and cracked it furiously moti guj paid the white man the compliment of charging him nearly a quarter of a mile across the clearing and hrrumphing him into the verandah then he stood outside the house chuckling to himself and shaking all over with the fun of it as an elephant will  well thrash him said the planter he shall have the finest thrashing that ever elephant received give kala nag and nazim twelve foot of chain apiece and tell them to lay on twenty blows  kala nagwhich means black snakeand nazim were two of the biggest elephants in the lines and one of their duties was to administer the graver punishments since no man can beat an elephant properly  they took the whippingchains and rattled them in their trunks as they sidled up to moti guj meaning to hustle him between them moti guj had never in all his life of thirtynine years been whipped and he did not intend to open new experiences so he waited weaving his head from right to left and measuring the precise spot in kala nags fat side where a blunt tusk would sink deepest kala nag had no tusks the chain was his badge of authority but he judged it good to swing wide of moti guj at the last minute and seem to appear as if he had brought out the chain for amusement nazim turned round and went home early he did not feel fightingfit that morning and so moti guj was left standing alone with his ears cocked  that decided the planter to argue no more and moti guj rolled back to his inspection of the clearing an elephant who will not work and is not tied up is not quite so manageable as an eightyone ton gun loose in a heavy seaway he slapped old friends on the back and asked them if the stumps were coming away easily he talked nonsense concerning labour and the inalienable rights of elephants to a long nooning and wandering to and fro thoroughly demoralised the garden until sundown when he returned to his pickets for food  if you wont work you shant eat said chihun angrily youre a wild elephant and no educated animal at all go back to your jungle  chihuns little brown baby rolling on the floor of the hut stretched its fat arms to the huge shadow in the doorway moti guj knew well that it was the dearest thing on earth to chihun he swung out his trunk with a fascinating crook at the end and the brown baby threw itself shouting upon it moti guj made fast and pulled up till the brown baby was crowing in the air twelve feet above his fathers head  great chief said chihun flour cakes of the best twelve in number two feet across and soaked in rum shall be yours on the instant and two hundred pounds weight of freshcut young sugarcane therewith deign only to put down safely that insignificant brat who is my heart and my life to me  moti guj tucked the brown baby comfortably between his forefeet that could have knocked into toothpicks all chihuns hut and waited for his food he ate it and the brown baby crawled away moti guj dozed and thought of deesa one of many mysteries connected with the elephant is that his huge body needs less sleep than anything else that lives four or five hours in the night sufficetwo just before midnight lying down on one side two just after one oclock lying down on the other the rest of the silent hours are filled with eating and fidgeting and long grumbling soliloquies  at midnight therefore moti guj strode out of his pickets for a thought had come to him that deesa might be lying drunk somewhere in the dark forest with none to look after him so all that night he chased through the undergrowth blowing and trumpeting and shaking his ears he went down to the river and blared across the shallows where deesa used to wash him but there was no answer he could not find deesa but he disturbed all the elephants in the lines and nearly frightened to death some gipsies in the woods  at dawn deesa returned to the plantation he had been very drunk indeed and he expected to fall into trouble for outstaying his leave he drew a long breath when he saw that the bungalow and the plantation were still uninjured for he knew something of moti gujs temper and reported himself with many lies and salaams moti guj had gone to his pickets for breakfast his night exercise had made him hungry  call up your beast said the planter and deesa shouted in the mysterious elephantlanguage that some mahouts believe came from china at the birth of the world when elephants and not men were masters moti guj heard and came elephants do not gallop they move from spots at varying rates of speed if an elephant wished to catch an express train he could not gallop but he could catch the train thus moti guj was at the planters door almost before chihun noticed that he had left his pickets he fell into deesas arms trumpeting with joy and the man and beast wept and slobbered over each other and handled each other from head to heel to see that no harm had befallen  now we will get to work said deesa lift me up my son and my joy  moti guj swung him up and the two went to the coffeeclearing to look for irksome stumps  the planter was too astonished to be very angry     poetry  the nativeborn    weve drunk to the queengod bless her     weve drunk to our

peculiar fad           i learnt a lesson once it ran           thus quoth that most veracious man  it was an august evening and in snowy garments clad i paid a round of visits in the lines of hezabad when presently my waler saw and did not like at all a commissariat elephant careering down the mall  i couldnt see the driver and across my mind it rushed that that commissariat elephant had suddenly gone musth i didnt care to meet him and i couldnt well get down so i let the waler have it and we headed for the town  the buggy was a new one and praise dykes it stood the strain till the waler jumped a bullock just above the city drain and the next that i remember was a hurricane of squeals and the creature making toothpicks of my fivefoot patent wheels  he seemed to want the owner so i fled distraught with fear to the main drain sewage outfall while he snorted in my ear reached the fourfoot drainhead safely and in darkness and despair felt the brutes proboscis fingering my

lights  our brows are bound with spindrift and the weed is on our knees our loins are battered neath us by the swinging smoking seas from reef and rock and skerryover headland ness and voe the coastwise lights of england watch the ships of england go  through the endless summer evenings on the lineless level floors through the yelling channel tempest when the siren hoots and roars by day the dipping houseflag and by night the rockets trail as the sheep that graze behind us so we know them where they hail  we bridge across the dark and bid the helmsman have a care the flash that wheeling inland wakes his sleeping wife to prayer from our vexed eyries head to gale we bind in burning chains the lover from the searim drawnhis love in english lanes  we greet the clippers wingandwing that race the southern wool we warn the crawling cargo tanks of bremen leith and hull to each and all our equal lamp at peril of the sea the white wallsided warships or the whalers of

and say if any seek the lights of england sent you and by silence shall ye speak     the english flag  above the portico a flagstaff bearing the union jack remained fluttering in the flames for some time but ultimately when it fell the crowds rent the air with shouts and seemed to see significance in the incidentdaily papers   winds of the world give answer they are whimpering to and fro and what should they know of england who only england know the poor little streetbred people that vapour and fume and brag they are lifting their heads in the stillness to yelp at the english           flag  must we borrow a clout from the boerto plaster anew with dirt an irish liars bandage or an english cowards shirt we may not speak of england her flags to sell or share what is the flag of england winds of the world declare  the north wind blewfrom bergen my steelshod vanguards go i chase your lazy whalers home from the disko floe by the great north lights above me i work the will of god and the liner splits on the icefield or the dogger fills with cod  i barred my gates with iron i shuttered my doors with flame because to force my ramparts your nutshell navies came i took the sun from their presence i cut them down with my blast and they died but the flag of england blew free ere the spirit           passed  the lean white bear hath seen it in the long long arctic night the muskox knows the standard that flouts the northern light what is the flag of england ye have but my bergs to dare ye have but my drifts to conquer go forth for it is there  the south wind sighedfrom the virgins my midsea course was taen over a thousand islands lost in an idle main where the seaegg flames on the coral and the longbacked breakers           croon their endless ocean legends to the lazy locked lagoon  strayed amid lonely islets mazed amid outer keys i waked the palms to laughteri tossed the scud in the breeze never was isle so little never was sea so lone but over the scud and the palmtrees an english flag was flown  i have wrenched it free from the halliard to hang for a wisp on the           horn i have chased it north to the lizardribboned and rolled and torn i have spread its fold oer the dying adrift in a hopeless sea i have hurled it swift on the slaver and seen the slave set free  my basking sunfish know it and wheeling albatross where the lone wave fills with fire beneath the southern cross what is the flag of england ye have but my reefs to dare ye have but my seas to furrow go forth for it is there  the east wind roaredfrom the kuriles the bitter seas i come and me men call the homewind for i bring the english home looklook well to your shipping by the breath of my mad typhoon i swept your closepacked praya and beached your best at kowloon  the reeling junks behind me and the racing seas before i raped your richest roadsteadi plundered singapore i set my hand on the hoogli as a hooded snake she rose and i flung your stoutest steamers to roost with the startled crows  never the lotus closes never the wildfowl wake but a soul goes out on the east wind that died for englands sake man or woman or suckling mother or bride or maid because on the bones of the english the english flag is stayed  the desertdust hath dimmed it the flying wildass knows the scared white leopard winds it across the taintless snows what is the flag of england ye have but my sun to dare ye have but my sands to travel go forth for it is there  the west wind calledin squadrons the thoughtless galleons fly that bear the wheat and cattle lest streetbred people die they make my might their porter they make my house their path till i loose my neck from their rudder and whelm them all in my           wrath  i draw the gliding fogbank as a snake is drawn from the hole they bellow one to the other the frighted shipbells toll for day is a drifting terror till i raise the shroud with my breath and they see strange bows above them and the two go locked to death  but whether in calm or wrackwreath whether by dark or day i heave them whole to the conger or rip their plates away first of the scattered legions under a shrieking sky dipping between the rollers the english flag goes by  the dead dumb fog hath wrapped itthe frozen dews have kissed the naked stars have seen it the fellowstar in the mist what is the flag of england ye have but my breath to dare ye have but my waves to conquer go forth for it is there     englands answer  truly ye come of the blood slower to bless than to ban little used to lie down at the bidding of any man flesh of the flesh that i bred bone of the bone that i bare stark as your sons shall bestern as your fathers were deeper than speech our love stronger than life our tether but we do not fall on the neck nor kiss when we come together my arm is nothing weak my strength is not gone by sons i have borne many sons but my breasts are not dry look i have made ye a place and opened wide the doors that ye may talk together your barons and councillors wards of the outer march lords of the lower seas ay talk to your gray mother that bore you on her knees that ye may talk together brother to brothers face thus for the good of your peoplesthus for the pride of the race also we will make promise so long as the blood endures i shall know that your good is mine ye shall feel that my strength           is yours in the day of armageddon at the last great fight of all that our house stand together and the pillars do not fall draw now the threefold knot firm on the ninefold bands and the law that ye make shall be law after the rule of your lands this for the waxen heath and that for the wattlebloom this for the mapleleaf and that for the southern broom the law that ye make shall be law and i do not press my will because ye are sons of the blood and call me mother still now must ye speak to your kinsmen and they must speak to you after the use of the english in straightflung words and few go to your work and be strong halting not in your ways balking the end halfwon for an instant dole of praise stand to your work and be wisecertain of sword and pen who are neither children nor gods but men in a world of men

      blowing chill from the furrow of the ploughshare streams the fragrance of the           loam and the hawk nests on the cliffside and the jackdaw in the hill and my heart is back in england mid the sights and sounds of home but the garland of the sacrifice this wealth of rose and peach is ah köil little köil singing on the siris bough in my ears the knell of exile your ceaseless belllike
