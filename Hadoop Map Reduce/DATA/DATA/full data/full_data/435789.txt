435789	history of friedrich ii of prussia  frederick the great  by thomas carlyle     book xvithe ten years of peace17461756     chapter isanssouci  friedrich has now climbed the heights and sees himself on the upper tableland of victory and success his desperate lifeanddeath struggles triumphantly ended what may be ahead nobody knows but here is fair outlook that his enemies and austria itself have had enough of him no wringing of his silesia from this bad man not to be overset this one by never such exertions oversets us on the contrary plunges us heelsoverhead into the ditch so often as we like to apply to him nothing but heavy beatings disastrous breaking of crowns to be had on trying there five victories as voltaire keeps counting on his fingers with upturned eyesmollwitz chotusitz striegau sohr kesselsdorf the last done by anhalt but omitting hennersdorf and that sudden slitting of the big saxonaustrian projects into a cloud of feathers as fine a feat as anyfive victories counts voltaire calling on everybody or everybody but friedrich himself who is easily sated with that kind of thing to admire in the world are many opinions about friedrich in austria for instance what an opinion sinister gloomy in the extreme or in england which derives from austriaonly with additional dimness and with gloomy new provocations of its own before long many opinions about friedrich all dim enough but this that he is a very demon for fighting and the stoutest king walking the earth just now may well be a universal one a man better not be meddled with if he will be at peace as he professes to wish being  friedrich accordingly is not meddled with or not openly meddled with and has for the ten or eleven years coming a time of perfect external peace he himself is decided not to fight with a cat if he can get the peace kept and for about eight years hopes confidently that this by good management will continue possibletill in the last three years electric symptoms did again disclose themselves and such hope more and more died away it is well known there lay in the fates a third silesian war for him worse than both the others which is now the main segment of his history still lying ahead for us were this halcyon period done halcyon period counts from christmasday dresden 1745from this day peace to the end of my life had been friedrichs fond hope but on the 9th day of september 1756 friedrich was again entering dresden saxony some twelve days before and the crowning struggle of his life was beyond all expectation found to be still lying ahead for him awfully dubious for seven years thereafter  friedrichs history during this intervening halcyon or peace period must in some way be made known to readers but for a great many reasons especially at present it behooves to be given in compressed form riddled down to an immense extent out of those sad prussian repositories where the grain of perennial of significant and still memorable lies overwhelmed under rubbishmountains of the fairly extinct the poisonously dusty and forgettableach himmel which indispensable preliminary process how can an english editor at this time do it no prussian at any time having thought of trying it from a painful predecessor of mine i collect rummaging among his dismal papermasses the following three fragments worth reading here  1 friedrich was as busy in those years as in the generality of his life and his actions and salutary conquests over difficulties were many profitable to prussia and to himself very well worth keeping in mind but not fit for history or at least only fit in the summary form to be delineated in little with large generic strokesif we had the meanssuch details belonging to the prussian antiquary rather than to the english historian of friedrich in our day a happy ten years of time perhaps the time for montesquieus aphorism happy the people whose annals are blank in historybooks the prussian antiquary had he once got any image formed to himself of friedrich and of friedrichs history in its human lineaments and organic sequences will glean many memorabilia in those years which his readers then and not till then will be able to intercalate in their places and get human good of but alas while there is no intelligible human image nothing of lineaments or organic sequences or other than a jumbled mass of historical marinestores presided over by dryasdust and human stupor unsorted unlabelled tied up in blind sacks the very antiquary will have uphill work of it and his readers will often turn round on him with a gloomy expression of countenance  2 friedrichs lifelittle as he expected it that day when he started up from his aguefit at reinsberg and grasped the fiery opportunity that was shooting pastis a life of war the chief memory that will remain of him is that of a king and man who fought consummately well not peace and the muses no that is denied himthough he was so unwilling always to think it denied but his lifetask turned out to be a battle for silesia it consists of three grand struggles of war and not for silesia onlyunconsciously for what far greater things to his nation and to him  deeply unconscious of it they were passing their trials his nation and he in the great civilserviceexamination hall of this universe are you able to defend yourselves then and to hang together coherent against the whole world and its incoherencies and rages a question which has to be asked of nations before they can be recognized as such and be baptized into the general commonwealth they are mere hordes or accidental aggregates till that question come question which this nation had long been getting ready for which now under this king it answered to the satisfaction of gods and men yes heaven assisting we can stand on our defence and in the longrun as with air when you try to annihilate it or crush it to nothing there is even an infinite force in us and the whole world does not succeed in annihilating us upon which has followed what we term national baptismor rather this was the national baptism this furious one in torrent whirlwinds of fire done three times over till in gods or men there was no doubt left that was friedrichs function in the world and a great and memorable onenot to his own prussian nation only but to teutschland at large forever memorable  is teutschland a nation is there in teutschland still a nation austria not dishonestly but much sunk in superstitions and involuntary mendacities and liable to sink much farther answers always in gloomy proud tone yes i am the nation of teutschlandbut is mistaken as turns out for it is not mendacities conscious or other but veracities that the divine powers will patronize or even in the end will put up with at all which you ought to understand better than you do my friend for on the great scale and on the small and in all seasons circumstances scenes and situations where a son of adam finds himself that is true and even a sovereign truth and whoever does not know ithuman charity to him were such always possible would be that he were furnished with handcuffs as a part of his outfit in this world and put under guidance of those who do yes to him i should say a private pair of handcuffs were much usefuler than a ballotboxwere the times once settled again which they are far from being  so that if there be only austria for nation teutschland is in ominous case truly so but there is in teutschland withal very irrecognizable to teutschland yet authentically present a man of the properly unconquerable type there is also a select population drilled for him these two together will prove to you that there is a nation conquest of silesia three silesian wars labors and valors as of alcides in vindication of oneself and ones silesiasecretly how unconsciously that other and higher question of teutschland and of its having in it a nation was friedrichs sore task and his prussias at that time as teutschland may be perhaps now in our day beginning to recognize with hope with astonishment poor teutschland  3 and in fine leaving all that there is one thing undeniable in all human narrative it is the battle only and not the victory that can be dwelt upon with advantage friedrich has now by his second silesian war achieved greatness friedrich the great expressly so denominated by his people and others the struggle upwards is the romance your hero once weddedto glory or whoever the bride may bethe romance ends precise critics do object that there may still lie difficulties new perils and adventures aheadwhich proves conspicuously true in this case of ours and accordingly our book not being a romance but a history let us with all fidelity look out what these are and how they modify our royal gentleman who has got his wedding done with all fidelity but with all brevity no less for inasmuch as  well brevity in most cases is desirable and privately it must be owned there is another consideration of no small weight that our prussian resources falling altogether into bankruptcy during peaceperiods nature herself has so ordered it in this instance partly it is our books the prussian dryasdust reaching his acme on those occasions but in part too it is the events themselves that are small and want importance that have fallen dead to us in the huge new time and its uproars events not of flagrant notability like battles or warpassages to bridle dryasdust and guide him in some small measure events rather which except as characteristic of one memorable man and king are mostly now of no memorability whatever crowd all these indiscriminately into sacks and shake them out pellmell on us that is dryasdusts sweet way as if the largest marinestores establishment in all the world had suddenly on hest of some necromancer or maleficent person taken wing upon you and were dancing in boundless mad whirl round your devoted headsimmering and dancing very much at its ease nowhither asking you cheerfully what is your candid opinion then opinion heavens  you have to retire many yards and gaze with a desperate steadiness assuring yourself well it does right indisputably shadow forth something this was a thing alive and did at one time stick together as an organic fact on the earth though it now dances in dryasdust at such a rate it is only by selfhelp of this sort and long survey with rigorous selection and extremely extensive exclusion and oblivion that you gain the least light in such an element brevitylittle said when little has been got to be knownis an evident rule courage reader by good eyesight you will still catch some features of friedrich as we go along to say our little in a not unintelligible manner and keep the rest well hidden it is all we can do for you     friedrich declines the career of conquering hero goes into lawreform and gets ready a cottage residence for himself  friedrichs journey to pyrmont is the first thing recorded of him by the newspapers gone to take the waters as he did after his former war here is what i had noted of that small occurrence and of one or two others contiguous in date which prove to be of significance in friedrichs history  may 1217th 1746 say the old books his majesty sets out for pyrmont taking brunswick by the way arrives at pyrmont may 17th stays till june 8th three weeks good is busy corresponding with the king of france about a general peace but owing to the embitterment of both parties it was not possible at this time taking the waters at least and amusing himself from brunswick in passing he had brought with him his brotherinlaw the reigning duke rothenburg was there and brother henri darget expressly fluteplayer quanz withal and various musical people in all a train of above sixty persons i notice also that prince wilhelm of hessen was in pyrmont at the time with whom one fancies what speculations there might be about the late and present warpassages about the poor peace prospects your hessian siege so called of blair in athol culloden now comfortably done and other cognate topics that is the pyrmont journey  it is no surprise to us to hear in these months of new and continual attention to army matters to husbandry matters and to making good on all sides the ruins left by war of rebuilding at the royal expense the town of schmiedeberg which had been burnt of rebuilding and repairing from their damage all silesian villages and dwellings and still more satisfactory how in may 1746 there was in every circle of the country by exact liquidation of accounts so rapidly got done exact payment made to the individuals concerned 1 of all the hay straw and corn that had been delivered to his majestys armies 2 of all the horses that had perished in the kings work 3 of all the horses stolen by the enemy and of all the moneycontributions exacted by the enemy payment in ready cash and according to the rules of justice baar und billigmassig by his majesty seyfarth ii 22 23  it was from pyrmont may 1746or more definitely it was at potsdam early in the morning 15th september followingthat friedrich launched or shot forth from its moorings after much previous attempting and preparing a very great enterprise which he has never lost sight of since the day he began reigning nor will till his reign and life end the actual reform of law in prussia may 12th 1746 friedrich on the road to pyrmont answers his chief lawminister coccejis report of practical plan on this matter yes looks very hopefuland took it with him to consider at pyrmont during his leisure much considering of it then and afterwards there was and finally september 15th early in the morning cocceji had an interview with friedrich and the decisive fiat was given yes start on it in gods name pommern which they call the provincia litigiosa try it there first ranke ii 392 and cocceji a vigorous old man of sixtyseven one of the most learned of lawyers and a very hercules in cleaning lawstables has on friedrichs urgencieswhich have been repeated on every breathingtime of peace there has been and even sometimes in the middle of war last january 1745 for example and again express order january 1746 a fortnight after peace was signedactually got himself girt for this salutary work wash me out that horror of accumulation let us see the old pavements of the place again every lawsuit to be finished within the year  cocceji who had been meditating such matters for a great while 1st march 1738 friedrich wilhelms edict on law reform cocceji ready at that timebut his then majesty forbore and was himself eager to proceed in spite of considerable wigged oppositions and secret reluctances that there were did now on that fiat of september 15th get his select commission of six riddled together and adjoined to himthe likeliest six that prussia in her different provinces could yieldand got the stande of pommern after due committeeing and deliberating to consent and promise help december 31st 1746 was the day the stande consented and january 10th 1747 cocceji and his six set out for pommern on a longish enterprise in that province and the othersof which we shall have to take notice and give at least the dates as they occur  to sweep out pettifogging attorneys cancel improper advocates to regulate fees to war in a calm but deadly manner against pedantries circumlocutions and the multiplied forms of stupidity cupidity and human owlery in this departmentand on the whole to realize from every court now and onwards a decision to all lawsuits within a year after their beginning this latter result friedrich thinks will itself be highly beneficial and be the sign of all manner of improvements and cocceji scanning it with those potent laweyes of his ventures to assure him that it will be possible as in fact it provedhonor to cocceji and his king and kings father withal samuel von cocceji says an old note son of a law professor and himself once suchwas picked up by friedrich wilhelm for the official career many years ago a man of wholesome by no means weakly aspectto judge by his portrait which is the chief biography i have of him potent eyes and eyebrows ditto blunt nose honest almost careless lips and deep chin well dewlapped extensive penetrative face not pincered together but potently fallen closedcomfortable to see in a wig of such magnitude friedrich a judge of men calls him a man of sterling character caractere integre et droit whose qualities would have suited the noble times of the roman republic oeuvresiv 2 he has his herculean battle his master and he have with the owleries and the vulturous lawpedantrieswhich i always love friedrich for detesting as he doesand during the next five years the world will hear often of cocceji and of this prussian lawreform by friedrich and him  his majestys exertions to make peace were not successful what does lie in his power is to keep out of the quarrel himself it appears great hopes were entertained by some in england of gaining friedrich over of making him supreme captain to the cause of liberty and prospects were held out to him quasioffers made of a really magnificent natureundeniable though obscure herr ranke has been among the archives again and comes out with fractional snatches of a very strange paper from england capriciously hiding all details about it all intelligible explanation so that you in vain ask where when how by whomand can only guess to yourself that carteret was somehow at the bottom of the thing aut carteretus aut diabolus what would your majesty think to be elected stadtholder of holland without a stadtholder these dutch are worth nothing not hoistable nor of use when hoisted all palavering and pulling different ways must have a stadtholder and one that stands firm on some basis of his own stadtholder of holland king of prussiayou then in such position take the reins of this poor floundering englishdutch germanic antifrench war you and drive it in the style you have conquer back the netherlands to us french netherlands as well french and austrian netherlands together yours in perpetuity dutch stadtholderate as good as ditto this with prussia and its fighting capabilities will be a pleasant protestant thing austria cares little about the netherlands in comparison austria getting back its lorraine and alsace will be content will be strong on its feet what if it should even lose italy france spain sardinia the italian petty principalities and anarchies suppose they tug and tussle and collapse there as they can but let france try to look across the rhine again and to threaten teutschland england and the cause of human liberty temporal or spiritual  this is authentically the purport of herr rankes extraordinary document ranke iii 359 guessable as due to carteretus or diabolus here is an outlook here is a career as conquering hero if that were ones line a very magnificent groundplan hung up to kindle the fancy of a young kingwho is far too prudent to go into it at all more definite quasiofficial offers it seems were made him from the same quarter subsidies to begin with such subsidies as nobody ever had before say 1000000 pounds sterling by the year to which friedrich answered subsidies your excellency are we a hackneycoachman thenand with much contempt turned his back on that offer no fighting to be had by purchase or seduction out of this young man will not play the conquering hero at all nor the hackneycoachman at all has decided not to fight a cat if let alone but to do and endeavor a quite other set of things for the rest of his life  friedrich readers can observe is not uplifted with his greatness he has been too much beaten and bruised to be anything but modestly thankful for getting out of such a deadly clash of chaotic swords seems to have little pride even in his five victories or hides it well talks not overmuch about these things talks of them so far as we can hear with his old comrades only in praise of their prowesses as a simple human being not as a supreme of captains and at times acknowledges in a fine sincere way the omnipotence of luck in matters of war  one of the most characteristic traits extensively symbolical of friedrichs intentions and outlooks at this epoch is his installing of himself in the little dwellinghouse which has since become so celebrated under the name of sanssouci the plan of sanssoucian elegant commodious little country box quite of modest pretensions one story high on the pleasant hilltop near potsdam with other little green hills and pleasant views of land and water all roundhad been sketched in part by friedrich himself and the diggings and terracings of the hillside were just beginning when he quitted for the last war april 14th 1745 while he lay in those perilous enigmatic circumstances at neisse with pandours and devouring bugbears round him the foundationstone was laid knobelsdorf being architect once more as in the old reinsberg case and the work which had been steadily proceeding while the master struggled in those dangerous battles and adventures far away from it was in good forwardness at his return an object of cheerful interest to him prophetic of calmer years ahead  it was not till may 1747 that the formal occupation took place mayday 1747 he had a grand househeating or first dinner of 200 covers and may 19th20th was the first night of his sleeping there for the next forty years especially as years advanced he spent the most of his days and nights in this little mansion which became more and more his favorite retreat whenever the noises and scenic etiquettes were not inexorable sanssouci which we may translate nobother a busy place this too but of the quiet kind and more a home to him than any of the three fine palaces ultimately four which lay always waiting for him in the neighborhood berlin and charlottenburg are about twenty miles off potsdam which like the other two is rather consummate among palaces lies leftwise in front of him within a short mile and at length to right hand in a similar distance and direction came the neue schloss new palace of potsdam called also the palace of sanssouci in distinction from the dwellinghouse or as it were gardenhouse which made that name so famous  certainly it is a significant feature of friedrich and discloses the inborn proclivity he had to retirement to study and reflection as the chosen element of human life why he fell upon so ambitious a title for his royal cottage nobother was not practically a thing he of all men could consider possible in this world at the utmost perhaps by good care lessbother the name it appears came by accident he had prepared his tomb and various tombs in the skirts of this new cottage looking at these as the building of them went on he was heard to say one day spring 1746 dargens strolling beside him oui alors je serai sans souci once there one will be out of bother a saying which was rumored of and repeated in society being by such a man out of which rumor in society and the evident aim of the cottage royal there was gradually born as venus from the froth of the sea this name sanssouciwhich friedrich adopted and before the year was out had put upon his lintel in gold letters so that by mayday 1747 the name was in all mens memories and has continued ever since preuss i 268 c nicolai iii 1200 tourists know this cottage royal friedrichs three rooms in it one of them a library in another a little alcove with an iron bed iron without curtains old softened hat the usual royal nightcapaltogether a soldiers lodgingall this still stands as it did cheerfully looking down on its gardenterraces stairs greek statues and against the free skyperhaps we may visit it in time coming and take a more special view in the years now on hand friedrich i think did not much practically live there only shifted thither now and then his chief residence is still potsdam palace and in carnival time that of berlin with charlottenburg for occasional festivities especially in summer the gardens there being fine  this of sanssouci is but portion of a wider tendency wider set of endeavors on friedrichs part which returns upon him now that peace has returned that of improving his own domesticities while he labors at so many public improvements gazing long on that simmering typhoon of marinestores above mentioned we do trace three great heads of endeavor in this peace period first the reform of law which as above hinted is now earnestly pushed forward again and was brought to what was thought completion before long with much rumor of applause from contemporary mankind concerning which we are to give some indications were it only dates in their order though as the affair turned out not to be completed but had to be taken up again long after and is an affair lying wide of british kenthere need not and indeed cannot be much said of it just now secondly there is eager furthering of the husbandries the commerces practical artsespecially at present that of foreign commerce and shipping from the port of embden which shall have due notice and thirdly what must be our main topic here there is that of improving the domesticities the household enjoyments such as they wereespecially definable as renewal of the old reinsberg program attempt more strenuous than ever to realize that beautiful ideal which and the total failure of which and the consequent quasiabandonment of it for time coming are still intrinsically and by accident of considerable interest to modern readers  curious and in some sort touching to observe how that old original lifeprogram still reemerges on this king something of melodious possible in ones poor life is not there a life to the practical duties yes but to the muses as wellof friedrichs success in his lawreforms in his husbandries commerces and furtherances conspicuously great as it was there is no possibility of making careless readers cognizant at this day only by the great resultsa prussia quadrupled in his time and the likecan studious readers convince themselves in a cold and merely statistic way but in respect of life to the muses we have happily the means of showing that in actual vitality in practical struggle towards fulfillmentand how extremely disappointing the result was in a word voltaire pays his fifth and final visit in this period the voltaire matter comes to its consummation to that as to one of the few things which are perfectly knowable in this period of tenyears peace and in which mankind still take interest we purpose mostly to devote ourselves here  ten years of a great kings life ten busy years too and nothing visible in them of main significance but a crash of authors quarrels and the crowning visit of voltaire truly yes reader so it has been ordered innumerable highdressed gentlemen gods of this lower world are gone all to inorganic powder no comfortable or profitable memory to be held of them more and this poor voltaire without implement except the tongue and brain of himhe is still a shining object to all the populations and they say and symbol to me tell us of him he is the man very strange indeed changed times since for dogs barking at the heels of him and lions roaring aheadfor asses of mirepoix for foul creatures in high dizenment and foul creatures who were hungry valets of the samethis man could hardly get the highways walked and indeed had to keep his eyes well open and always have covert within reachunder pain of being torn to pieces while he went about in the flesh or rather in the bones poor lean being changed times within the century last past for indeed there was in that man what far transcends all dizenment and temporary potency over valets over legions treasurevaults and dim millions mostly blockhead a spark of heavens own lucency a gleam from the eternities in small measurewhich becomes extremely noticeable when the dance is over when your tallowdips and waxlights are burnt out and the brawl of the night is gone to bed     chapter iipeep at voltaire and his

keep imagining at his conveniencebut will be glad rather for the present to go with us for an actual look at m de voltaire and the divine emilie whom we have not seen for a long time not much has happened in the interim one or two things only which it can concern us to knowscattered fragments of memorial on the way thus far  1 m de voltaire has in 1745 made way at court divine emilie picked up her voltaire from that fine diplomatic course and went home with him out of our sight in the end of 1743 the diplomatic career gradually declaring itself barred to him thenceforth since which nevertheless he has had his successes otherwise especially in his old literary course on the whole brighter sunshine than usual though never without tempestuous clouds attending goes about with his divine emilie now wearing browner and leaner both of them and takes the good and evil of life mostly in a quiet manner sensible that afternoon is come  the thricefamous pompadour who had been known to him in the chrysalis state did not forget him on becoming headbutterfly of the universe by her help one long wish of his soul was gratified and did not hunger or thirst any more some uncertain footing

man voltaire and rameau readers have heard of rameaus nephew and musical readers still esteem rameau did their feat we may think with what perfection with what splendor of reward alas and the feat done was to one of the parties so unspeakably contemptible voltaire pensively surveying life brushes the sounding strings and hums to himself the carbuncle eyes carrying in them almost something of

here the game of cavagnole kind of biribi it would appear in the height of fashion then it was continued and maintained on the part of madame du chatelet you guess in a tone which is altogether unheard of in this place and was endured on the part of serene highness with a moderation not less surprising but what is unendurable is my babbleand herewith our nimble little woman hops off again into the general field of things and gossips largely how are you my queen whither are you going whither we that the maillebois people are away and also the villeneuves if anybody knew them now then how the estillacs to the number of four are coming tomorrow and cousin soquence for all his hunting can catch nothing and it is a continual coming and going and how boursoufle is to be played and a

as she can but not with me for i never go by land and she seems to have the hydrophobia when i take to the water thread of date is gone i almost think we must have got to saturday by this timeor perhaps it is only thursday and maillebois off prematurely to be out of the way of the farce little de staal takes no notice but continues gossiping rapidly  yesterday madame du chatelet got into her third lodging she could not any longer endure the one she had chosen there was noise in it smoke without fireprivately meseems a little the emblem of herself as to noise it was not by night that it incommoded her she told me but by day when she was in the thick of her work it deranges her ideas she is busy reviewing her principlesnewtons principia no doubt but de staal will understand it only as principes principles in generalit is an exercise she repeats every year without which the principles might get away and perhaps go so far she would never find them again you satirical little gypsy her head like enough is a kind of lockup for them rather than a birthplace or natural home and that is a case for watching carefully lest they get away she prefers the high air of this occupation to every kind of amusement and persists in not showing herself till after dark voltaire has produced some gallant verses unknown to editors which help off a little the bad effect of such unusual behavior  sunday 27th i told you on thursday no you did nt you only meant to tell that our spectres were going on the morrow and that the piece was to be played that evening all this has been done i cannot give you much of boursoufle done by one vanture mademoiselle piggery de la cochonniere madame du chatelet herself executed so perfectly the extravagance of her part that i own it gave me real pleasure but vanture only put his own fatuity into the character of boursoufle which wanted more he played naturally in a piece where all requires to be forced like the subject of itwhat a pity none of us has read this fine farce one paris did the part of muscadin little coxcomb which name represents his character in short it can be said the farce was well given the author ennobled it by a prologue for the occasion which he acted very well along with madame dufour as barbe governess barbarawho but for this brilliant action could not have put up with merely being governess to piggery and in fact she disdained the simplicity of dress which her part requiredas did the chief actress du chatelet herself age now fortyone who in playing piggery preferred the interests of her own face to those of the piece and made her entry in all the splendor and elegant equipments of a court ladyher principles though the key is turned upon them not unlike jumping out of window one would say she had a crow to pluck maille a partir clasp to open which is better with voltaire on this point but she is sovereign and he is slave i am very sorry at their going though i was worn out with doing her multifarious errands all the time she was here  wednesday 30th m le president henault has been asked hither and he is to bring you my queen tried all i could to hinder but they would not be put off if your health and disposition do suit it will be charming in any case i have got you a good apartment it is the one that madame du chatelet had seized upon after an exact review of all the mansion there will be a little less furniture than she had put in it madame had pillaged all her previous apartments to equip this one we found about seven tables in it for one item she needs them of all sizes immense to spread out her papers upon solid to support her necessaire slighter for her nicknacks pompons for her jewels and this fine arrangement did not save her from an accident like that of philip ii when after spending all the night in writing he got his despatches drowned by the oversetting of an inkbottle the lady did not pretend to imitate the moderation of that prince at any rate he was only writing on affairs of state and the thing they blotted on this occasion was algebra much more difficult to clean up again  this subject ought to be exhausted one word more and then it does end the day after their departure i receive a letter of four pages and a note enclosed which announces dreadful burlyburly m de voltaire has mislaid his farce forgotten to get back the parts and lost his prologue i am to find all that again excessively tremulous about his manuscripts m de voltaire of such value are they of such danger to him there is la pucelle for exampleenough to hang a man were it surreptitiously launched forth in printi am to send him the prologue instantly not by post because they would copy it to keep the parts for fear of the same accident and to lock up the piece under a

owing to french influence on the continent can get no recruits to hire gradually driven upon russia in such stress britannic majesty has this year hired for himself a 35000 russians 30000 regular foot 4000 ditto horse and 1000 cossacksuncommonly cheap only 150000 pounds the lot not 4 pounds per head by the year and in spite of many difficulties and hagglings they actually get on march from moscow

first to be lacy old marshal lacy then failing lacy why not general keithbut proves to be repnin after much hustling and intriguing repnin not keith that is the interesting point  such march of the russians on behalf of human liberty in pay of britannic majesty is a surprising fact and considerably discomposes the french who bestir themselves in sweden and elsewhere against russia and it with no

there is no word worthy to be saidexcept for one reason only that it finished off the connection of general keith with russia that this of seeing repnin his junior and inferior preferred to him was of many disgusts the last drop which made the cup run overand led the said general to fling it from him and seek new fields of employment from hamburg having got so far he addresses himself 1st september

snuffboxes wore two big rich boxes in his pockets five or six stood on tables about and more than a hundred in store coming out by turns for variety the cheapest of them cost 300 pounds 2000 thalers he had them as high as 1500 pounds at his death there were found 130 of various values they were the substance of all the jewelry he had besides these snuffboxes two gold watches only and a very small modicum of rings had yearly for personal expenditure 1200000 thalers 180000 pounds of civil list as we should say spent 33000 pounds of it and yearly gave the rest away in royal beneficences aid of

but this treating of battle and slaughter of death judgment and eternity as light playhouse matters this of rising into such transcendency of valor as to snap your fingers in the face of the almighty

remain alive which was received with gay clapping of hands admirable to the universe at least to the parisian univers and oneself such a prodigality of light daring is in these french gentlemen skilfully tickled by the marechal who uses this playwright among other implements for keeping them at the proper pitch was there ever seen such radiancy of valor very radiant indeedyet it seems to me gone somewhat into the phosphorescent kind shining in the dark as fish will do when rotten war has actually its serious character nor is death a farcical transaction however high your genius may go but what then it is the marechals trade to keep these poor people at the cutting pitch on any terms that will hold for the moment  i know not which was the most dissolute army ever seen in the world but this of saxes was very dissolute playwright favart had withal a beautiful clever wifeupon whom the courtships munificent blandishments threatenings and utmost endeavors of marechal de saxe in his character of goatfooted satyr could not produce the least impression for a whole year not the least whereupon the goatfooted had to get lettre de cachet for her had toin fact produce the brutalest adventure that is known of him even in this brutal kind poor favart rushing about in despair not permitted to run him through the belly and die with his wife undishonored had to console himself he and she and do agreeable theatricalities for a living as heretofore let us not speak of it  of saxes generalship which is now a thing fallen pretty much into oblivion i have no authority to speak he had much wild natural ingenuity in him cunning rapid whirls of contrivance and gained three battles and very many sieges amid the loudest clapping of hands that could well be he had perfect intrepidity not to be flurried by any amount of peril or confusion looked on that english column advancing at fontenoy with its fue infernal steadily through his perspective chewing his leaden bullet going to beat me then well nobody needed to be braver he had great goodnature too though of hot temper and so full of multifarious veracities a substratum of inarticulate good sense withal and much magnanimity run wild or run to seed a biglimbed swashing perpendicular kind of fellow haughty of face but jolly too with a big not ugly strutcaptivating to the french nation and fit god of war fitter than dalhousie i am sure for that susceptive people understood their army also what it was then and there and how by theatricals and otherwise to get a great deal of fire out of it great deal of firewhether by gradual conflagration or not on the road to ruin or not how he did not care in respect of military fame so called he had the great advantage of fighting always against bad generals sometimes against the very worst to his fame an advantage to himself and his real worth far the reverse had he fallen in with a friedrich even with a browne or a traun there might have been different news got friedrich who was never stingy in such matters except to his own generals where it might do hurt is profuse in his eulogies in his admirations of saxe amiable to see and not insincere but which perhaps practically do not mean very much  it is certain the french army reaped no profit from its experience of marechal de saxe and the high theatricalities ornamental blackguardisms and ridicule of death and life in the longrun a graver face would have been of better augury king friedrichs soldiers one observes on the eve of battle settle their bits of worldly business and wind up

their salaries raised  3 what seems to be friedrichs own invention what in outcome he thinks will be the summary of all good lawprocedure a final sentence three instances you can have but the third ends it for you within the year good surely a justice that intends to be exact must front the complicacies in a resolute piercing manner and will not be tedious nay a justice that is not moderately swifthuman hearts waiting for it the while in a cancerous state instead of hopefully following their workwhat comparatively is the use of its being never so exact  simple enough methods rough and ready needing in the execution clear human eyesight clear human honestywhich happen to be present here and without which no method whatever can be executed that will really profit  in the course of

yet read nor like being readis known to me for years past in a ghastly manner without the least profit to this present or to any other enterprisethough persons of name in jurisprudence call it meritorious in their science the first real attempt at a code in modern times but the truth is this cocceji codex remained a project merely never enacted anywhere it was not till 1773 that friedrich

second lawreform as they call it what we practically know from this time is that prussian lawsuits through friedrichs reign do all terminate or push at their utmost for terminating within one year

practice very gladly indeed welcomed his lawreform and from day to day enjoyed the sameno doubt with occasional remembrance who the donor was  of friedrichs literary works nobody not even friedrich himself will think it necessary that we say much but the fact is he is doing a great many things that way in prose the memoirs of brandenburg coming out as papers in the academy from time to time from 1746 and onward first published complete after slight revision by voltaire berlin 1751 in verse very secret as yet the palladion exquisite burlesque think some the art of war reckoned truly his best piece in verseand wishes sometimes he had voltaire here to perfect him a little this too would be one of the practical charms of voltaire friedrichs letter to algarotti oeuvresxviii 66 12th september 1749 for though king friedrich knows and remembers always that these things especially the verse part are mere amusements in comparison he has the creditable wish to do these well one would not fantasy ill even on the flute if one could help it why does nt voltaire come as quantz of the flute has done friedrich now that voltaire has fallen widower renews his pressings why dont you come patience your majesty voltaire will come  nobody can wish details in this department but there is one thing necessary to be mentioned that friedrich in these years 17491752 has printers out at potsdam and is printing in beautiful quarto form with copperplates to the extent of twelve copies the oeuvres poetical that is du philosophe de sanssouci only twelve copies i have heard gift of a single copy indicating that you are among the choicest of the chosen copies have now fallen extremely rare and are not in request at all with my readers or me but there was one copy which or the mistitle of which as oeuvre de poeshie du roi mon maitre became miraculously famous in a year or twoand is still memorable to us all on voltaires arrival we shall hear more of these things enough to say at present that the oeuvres du philosophe de sanssouci au donjon du chateau avec privilege dapollonthree thinnish quarto volumes all the poetry then on handwas finished early in 1750 before voltaire came that when voltaire came a revisal was undertaken a new edition with voltaires corrections and other changes total suppression of the palladion for one creditable change that this edition was to have been in two volumes that one accordingly rather thicker than the former sort was got finished in 1752 same title only the new date and no donjon du chateau this time one volume in 1752 after which owing to the explosions that ensued no second came nor ever willand that the actual contents of that farfamed oeuvre de poeshie number of volumes even are points of mystery to me at this day herr preussin the chronological list of friedrichs writings a useful accurate piece otherwise and in two other places where he triesis very indistinct on this of donjon du chateau and it is all but impossible to

am the king of prussia arrived about 12 at berlin king in from potsdam for one day and count podewils immediately introduced me into the royal closet when i delivered his britannic majestys letters into the king of prussias hands and made the usual compliments to him in the best manner i was able to which his prussian majesty replied to the best of my remembrance as followsi have the truest esteem for the king of britains person and i set the highest value on his friendship i have at different times received essential proofs of it and i desire you would acquaint the king your master that i will sic never forget them his prussian majesty afterwards said something with respect to myself and then asked me several questions about indifferent things and persons he seemed to express a great deal of esteem for my lord chesterfield and a great deal of kindness for mr villiers useful in the peaceofdresden time but did not once mention lord hyndford or mr leggehow singular  i was in the closet with his majesty exactly five minutes and a half my audience done prussian majesty came out into the general room where foreign ministers were waiting he said on stepping in just one word to

or otherwise and indeed went off rather in a hurry but for the next six or seven years he puddles about at a great rate in those northern courts giving away a great deal of money hatching many futile expensive intrigues at petersburg warsaw not much at berlin after the first trial there and will not be altogether avoidable to us in time coming as one could have wished besides he is horace walpoles friend and select london wit he contributed a good deal to the english notions about friedrich and has left considerable bits of acrid testimony on friedrich clear words of an eyewitness men call themwhich are still read by everybody the said walpole and others having since printed them in very dark condition in walpolegeorge the secondi 448461 the pieces which regard friedrich insir charles

sections of prose relating to other persons and objects now rather of an obsolete nature brevity is much due to hanbury and his testimonies since silence in the circumstances is not allowable here is one excerpt with the necessary light for reading it   it is on this romishking and other the like chimerical errands that witty hanbury then a much more admirable man than we now find him is prowling about in the german courts off and on for some ten years in all six of them still to come a sharpeyed man of shrewish quality given to intriguing to spying to bribing anxious to win his diplomatic game by every method though the stake as here is oftenest zero with fatal proclivity to scandal and what in london circles he has heard called wit little or nothing of real laughter in the soul of him at any time only a labored continual grin always of malicious nature and much trouble and jerking about to keep that up had evidently some modicum of real intellect of capacity for being wise but now has fatally devoted it nearly all to being witty on those poor terms a perverse barren spiteful little wretch the grin of him generally an affliction at this date his diplomatic correspondence i do not know nothing of him is discoverable in the statepaper office many of his papers it would seem are in the earl of essexs handsand might be of some historical use not of very much could the british

right hon henry who was a man of parts but evidently quite a vacuum on the polish side  of hanburys newsletters from foreign courts four or five incidentally printed are like the contents of a sloppail uncomfortable to the delicate mind not lies on the part of hanbury but foolish scandal poured into him a man more filled with credulous incredible scandal evil rumors of malfeasances by kings and magnates than most people known his rumored mysteries between poor polish majesty and pretty daughterinlaw the latter a clever and graceful creature daughter of the late unfortunate kaiser and a distinguished correspondent of friedrichs are to be regarded as mere poisoned wind seehanburys worksii 209240 that polish majesty gets into his dressinggown at two in the afternoon inaccessible thenceforth poor lazy creature one most readily believes but there or pretty much there ones belief has to stop the stories in walpole on the king of prussia have a grain of fact in them twisted into huge irrecognizable caricature in the williams opticmachinery much else one can discern to be in essence false altogether friedrich who could not stand that intriguing spying shrewish unfriendly kind

hanbury opticalmachinery on that side the dull tobaccosmoking saxonpolish majesty about whom he idly retails so many scandals had never done him any offence  on the whole if anybody wanted a swim in the sloppails of that extinct generation hanbury could he find an editor to make him legible might be printed for he really was deep in that sloppail or extinctscandal department and had heard a great many things apart from that in almost any other departmentexcept in so far as he seems to date rather carefullyi could not recommend him the letters and excerpts given in walpole are definable as one pennyworth of breadmuch ruined by such immersion but very harmless otherwise could you pick it out and clean itto twenty gallons of hanbury sherrissack or chamberslop i have found nothing that seems to be in all points true or probable but this worth cutting out and rendering legible on other accounts hanbury loquitur in condensed form  in the summer of last year 1749 there was somewhere in mahren a great austrian muster or review all the more interesting as it was believed or known that the prussian methods and manoeuvres were now to be the rule for austria not much of a review otherwise this of 1749 empressqueen and husband not personally there as in coming years they are wont to be that high lady being ardent to reform her army root and branch according to the prussian modelmore praise to her maria theresiens lebenp 160 what she did that way anno 1749 p 162 present at the reviews anno 1750 at this muster in mahren three prussian officers happened to make their appearancefor several imaginable reasons of little significance for the purpose of inveigling people to desert and enlist with them said the austrian authorities and ordered the three prussian officers unceremoniously off the ground which friedrich when he heard of it thought an unhandsome pipeclay procedure and kept in mind against the austrian authorities  next summer next spring 1750 an austrian captain being in mecklenburg travelling about met there an old acquaintance one chapeau hat can it be possible who is in great favor with the king of prussiavery well excellency hanbury but who in the name of wonder can this hat or chapeau have been after study one perceives that hanbury wrote chazeau meaning chasot an old acquaintance of our own brilliant sabring melodying chasot lieutenantcolonel of the baireuth dragoons who lies at treptow close on mecklenburg and is a declared favorite of the duchess often running over to the residenz there often enough but honi soit o reader the clever lady is towards sixty childless musical and her husbanddo readers recollect him at allis that collapsed tailoring duke whom friedrich once visitedand whose niece halfniece is charlotte wise little hardfavored creature now of six in clean bib and tucker ancestress of england that is to be whose papa will succeed if the serene tailor die firstwhich he did not quite to this duchess musical gallant chasot may well be a resource and she to him naturally the austrian captain having come to mecklenburg dined with serene highness he and chasot together with concert following and what not at the schloss of neustrelitzand now we will drop the chapeau and say chasot with comfort and a shade of new interest  the grand may review at berlin just ahead wont you look in it is straight on your road home suggests chasot to his travelling friend one would like it of all things answered the other but the king tush said chasot i will make that all straight and applies to the king accordingly permission to an austrian officer a good acquaintance of mine austrian officer friedrichs eyes lighten and he readily gives the permission this was at berlin on the very eve of the review and chasot and his austrian are made happy in that small matter and on the morrow end of may 1750 the austrian attends accordingly but to his astonishment has hardly begun to taste the manoeuvres whenone of friedrichs aidesdecamp gallops up by the kings command mein herr you retire on the instant  next day the austrian is for challenging chasot as you like that way answers chasot but learn first that on your affront i rode up to the king and asked publicly did not your majesty grant me permission unquestionably monsieur chasotand if he had not come how could i have paid back the moravian business of last year walpolegeorge the secondi 457 459this is much in friedrichs way not the unwelcomer that it includes a satirical twitch on chasot whom he truly likes withal or did like though now a little dissatisfied with those too frequent mecklenburg excursions and extramilitary cares of this merely squeezing the hanbury venom out of it i can believe every particular  did you ever hear of anything so shocking is hanburys meaning here and elsewhere i must tell you a story of the king of prussias regard for the law of nations continues he to walpole ib i 458 which proves to be a story turned topsyturvy of one hofmann brunswick envoy who quite beyond commission and a thing that must not be thought of at all had been detected in dangerous intriguings with the everbusy russian excellency or another and got flung into spandau adelung v 534 vii 132144seemingly pretty much his due in the matter and so of other hanbury things what a prussia for rigor of command one huge prison in a manner king intent on punctuality and all his business upon the square society official and unofficial kept rather strictly to their tackle their mode of movement not that of loose oxen at all such a detestable tyrantwho has ordered me hanbury elsewhither with my exquisite talents and admired wit     candidatus linsenbarth quasi lentilbeard likewise visits berlin  by far the notablest arrival in berlin is m de voltaires july 10th a few days before hanbury got his first audience five minutes long but that arrival will require a chapter to itselfmost important arrival that of all the least important again is probably that of candidatus linsenbarth in these same weeksa rugged povertystricken old licentiate of theology important to no mortal in berlin or elsewhereupon whom however and upon his procedures in that city we propose for our own objects to bestow a few glances rugged narrative of the thing in singular exotic dialect but true every word having fortunately come to us from linsenbarths own hand through rodenbeckbeitragei 463 et seq  berlin it must be admitted after all ones reading in poor dryasdust remains a dim empty object teutschland is dim and empty and out of the forty blind sacks or out of four hundred such what picture can any human head form to itself of friedrich as king or man a trifling adventure of that poor individual called linsenbarth candidatus theologiae one of the poorest of mortals but true and credible in every particular comes gliding by chance athwart all that and like the glimmer of a poor rushlight or kindled straw shows it us for moments a thing visible palpable as it worked and lived in the great dearth linsenbarth if i can faithfully interpret him for the modern reader will be worth attending to  date of linsenbarths adventure is juneaugust 1750 schloss of beichlingen and village of hemmleben are in the thuringen hill country weimar not far off to eastward the hero himself a tall awkward rawboned creature is for perhaps near forty years past a candidatus say licentiate or curate without cure subsists i should guess by schoolmasteringcheapest schoolmaster conceivable wages mere nothingin the villages about in the village of hemmleben latterly age as i discover grown to be sixtyone in those straitened but by no means forlorn circumstances and so here is veteran linsenbarth of hemmleben a kind of thuringian dominie sampson whose interview with such a brother mortal as friedrich king of prussia may be worth looking atif i can abridge it properly  well it appears in the year 1750 at this thriceobscure village of hemmleben the worthy old pastor cannabich diedworthy old man how he had lived there modestly studious frugal chiefly on farmproduce with tobacco and dutch theology a modest blessing to his fellowcreatures and now he is dead and the place vacant twenty pounds a year certain let us guess it twenty with glebeland piggeries poultryhutches who is now to get all that linsenbarth starts with his narrative in earnest  linsenbarth who i guess may have been assistant to the deceased cannabich and was now out of work says i had not the least thought of profiting by this vacancy but what happened the herr graf von werthern at schloss beichlingen sent his steward lehnsdirector fiefdirector is the title of this steward which gives rise to obsolete thought of milldues roadlabor payments in natura his lehnsdirector herr kettenbeil over to my logis cheap boarding quarters who brought a gracious salutation from his lord saying farther that i knew too well excellent cannabich gone from us alas the pastorate of hemmleben was vacant that there had various competitors announced themselves supplicando for the place the herr graf however had yet given none of them the fiat but waited always till i should apply as i had not done so he the lord graf would now of his own motion give me the preference and hereby confer the pastorate upon me  without all controversy here was a vocatio divina to be received with the most submissive thanks but the lame second messenger came hitching in halting messenger german proverb very soon kettenbeil began again he must mention to me sub rosa her ladyship the frau grafin wanted to have her ladysmaid provided for by this promotion too i must marry her and take the living at the same time  whew and this is the noble ladys way of thinking up in her fine schloss yonder linsenbarth will none of it for my notion fell at once says he when i heard it was do ut facias facio ut facias i give that thou mayest do i do that thou mayest do wilt have the kirk then take the irk willst du die pfarre so nimm die quarre on those terms my reply was most respectful thanks herr fiefjudge and no for such a vocation and why the vocation must have libertatem there must be no vitium essentiale in it it must be right in essentiali otherwise no honest man can accept it with a good conscience this were a marriage on constraint out of which a thousand inconvenientiae might spring hear linsenbarth in the piebald dialect with the sound heart and preference of starvation itself to some other things kettenbeil chainaxe went home and there was found another candidatus willing for the marriage on constraint out of which inconvenientiae might spring in linsenbarths opinion  and so did the sneakish courtly gentleman hofmann courtier as linsenbarth has it who grasped with both hands at my rejected offer experience before long continues linsenbarth for the loose thing of courttatters led him such a life that within three years age yet only thirty he had to bite the dust bite at the grass says linsenbarth proverbially which was an inconvenientia including all others and i had legitimam causam to refuse the vocation cum tali conditione  however it was very ill taken of me all over that thuringian region i was cried out upon as a headstrong foolish person the herr graf von werthern so ran the story had of his own kindness without request of mine offered me a living rara avis singular instance and i rash and without head flung away such gracious offer in short i was told to my face by goodnatured friends nobody would ever think of me for promotion againuniversal suffrage giving it clear against poor linsenbarth in this way  to get out of peoples sight at least continues he i decided to leave my native place and go to berlin 250 miles away or more and so it was that on june the 20th 1750 i landed at berlin for the first time and here straightway at the packhof or customhouse in searching of my things 400 thalers some 60 pounds all in nurnberg batzen were seized from mebatzen quartergroats we may say 7 and a half batzen go to a shilling what a sack there must have been of them 9000 in all about the size of herringscales in bad silver fruit of linsenbarths stern thrift from birth upwardsall snatched from him at one swoop and why says he quite historically yes why the reader to understand it wholly would need to read in myliussedictensammlungin seyfarth and elsewhere myliusedictxli january 1744 c c and to know the scandalous condition of german coinage at this time and long after every needy little potentate mixing his coin with copper at discretion and swindling mankind with it for a season needing to be peremptorily forbidden confiscated or ordered home by the like of friedrich linsenbarth answers his own and why with historical calmness  the king had some six years ago had the batzen utterly cried down ganz und gar they were not to circulate at all in his countries and i was so bold i had brought batzen hither into the kings capital konigliche residenz itself at the packhof there was but one answer contraband contrabandhere was a welcome for a man i made my excuses did not the least know came straight from thuringen many miles of road could not guess there what his majesty the king had been pleased to forbid in his theiro countries you should have informed yourself said the packhof people and were deaf to such considerations a man coming into such a residenz town as berlin with intent to abide there should have inquired a little what was what especially what coins were cried down and what allowed said they of the packhof poor linsenbarthbut what am i to do now how am i to live if you take my very money from me that is your outlook said theyand added he must even find stowage for his stack of herringscales or batzen as soon as it was sealed up we have no room for it in the packhof for a man here is a roughish welcome i must leave all my money here and find stowage for it in a day or two  there was accordingly a truckporter called in he loaded my effects on his barrow and rolled away he brought me to the white swan in the judenstrasse none of the grandest of streets that berlin jewry threw my things out and demanded four groschen two of my batzen 2 and a half exact would have done but i had no money at all the landlord came out seeing that i had a stuffed featherbed note the luggage of linsenbarth federbett of extreme tenuity a trunk full of linens a bag of books and other trifles he paid the man and sent me to a small room in the courtyard inn forms a court perhaps four stories high i could stay there he said he would give me food and drink in the meanwhile and so i lived in this inn eight weeks long without one red farthing in mere fear and anxiety june 20th plus eight weeks brings us to august 15th voltaire in height of feather and very great things just ahead grand carrousel 25th august cof which soon  the white swan was a place where carriers lodged some limb of the law of subaltern sort whom linsenbarth calls der advocat b one of the ousted of cocceji shall we fancy had to do with carriers and their piepowder lawsuits advocat b had noticed the gray dreary candidatus sitting sparrowlike in remote corners had spoken to himundertook for a louis dor no purchase no pay to get back his batzen for him they went accordingly one morning to a grand house it was a ministers name not given very grand official man he heard the advocat bs short statement and made answer monsieur and is it you that will pick holes in the kings law i have understood you were rather aiming at the hausvogtei common jail of berlin go on in that way and you are sure of your promotionadvocat b rushed out with linsenbarth into the street and there was neither pay nor purchase in that quarter  poor linsenbarth was next advised by simple neighbors to go direct to the king as every poor man can at certain hours of the day write out your case memorial with extreme brevity said they nothing but the essential points and those clear linsenbarth steam at the highpressure composed conzipirte a memorial of that right laconic sort wrote it fair mundirte esand went off therewith at opening of the gates middle time of august 1750 no date farther august 21st see rodenbeck diary which we often quote i 205without one farthing in my pocket in gods name to potsdam he continues  and at potsdam i was lucky enough to see the king my first sight of him he was on the palace esplanade there drilling his troops fine trim sanded expanse with the palace to rear and gardenwalks and river to front where friedrich wilhelm sat the last day he was out and ordered jockey philipss house to be actually set about where the troops do evolutions every morningthere is friedrich with cockedhat and blue coat say about 11 am  when the drill was over his majesty went into the garden and the soldiers dispersed only four officers remained lounging upon the esplanade and walked up and down for fright i knew not what to do i pulled the papers out of my pocketthese were my memorial two certificates of character and a thuringen pass poor soul the officers noticed this came straight to me and said what letters has he there then i thankfully and gladly imparted the whole and when the officers had read them they said we will give you him not even thee a good advice the king is extragracious today and is gone alone into the garden follow him straight thou wilt have luck  this i would not do my awe was too great they thereupon laid hands on me the mischievous dogs not illhumored either one took me by the right arm another by the left off off to the garden having got me thither they looked out for the king he was among the gardeners examining some rare plant stooping over it and had his back to us here i had to halt and the officers began in underhand tone the dogs to put me through my drill hat under left armright foot foremostbreast well forwardhead uppapers from pouchpapers aloft in right handsteady steadyand went their ways looking always round to see if i kept my posture i perceived well enough they were pleased to make game of me but i stood all the same like a wall being full of fear the officers were hardly out of the garden when the king turned round and saw this extraordinary machinetelegraph figure or whatever we may call it with papers pointing to the sky he gave such a look at me like a flash of sunbeams glancing through you and sent one of the gardeners to bring my papers which having got he struck into another walk with them and was out of sight in few minutes he appeared again at the place where the rare plant was with my papers open in his left hand and gave me a wave with them to come nearer i plucked up a heart and went straight towards him oh how thrice and fourtimes graciously this great monarch deigned to speak to me  king my good thuringian lieber thuringer you came to berlin seeking to earn your bread by industrious teaching of children and here at the packhof in searching your things they have taken your thuringen hoard from you true the batzen are not legal here but the people should have said to you you are a stranger and did nt know the prohibitionwell then we will seal up the bag of batzen you send it back to thuringen get it changed for other sorts we will not take it from you  be of heart however you shall have your money again and interest toobut my poor man berlin pavement is bare they dont give anything gratis you are a stranger before you are known and get teaching your bit of money is done what then  i understood the speech right well but my awe was too great to say your majesty will have the allhighest grace to allow me something but as i was so simple and asked for nothing he did not offer anything and so he turned away but had scarcely gone six or eight steps when he looked round and gave me a sign i was to walk by him and then began catechising  king where did you er study  linsenbarth your majesty in jena  king what years  linsenbarth from 1716 to 1720 born 1689 rodenbeck p 474 twentyfive when he went  king under what prorector

greatly astonished and knew not what to do least of all could it come into my head that the kings kammerhussar who waited on his majesty should wait on me i pressed him to sit by me but as he refused i did as bidden sat down took my spoon and went at it with a will frisch  the hussar took the beef from the table set it on the charcoal dish to keep it hot till wanted he did the like with the fish and roast game and poured me out wine and beerwas ever such a lucky barmecide i ate and drank till i had abundantly enough dessert confectionery what i coulda plateful of big black cherries and a plateful of pears my waitingman wrapped in paper and stuffed them into my pockets to be a refreshment on the way home and so i rose from the royal table and thanked god and the king in my heart that i had so gloriously dinedherrlich gloriously at last poor excellent downtrodden linsenbarth ones heart opens to him not ones larder only  the hussar took away at that moment a secretary came brought me a sealed order rescript to the packhof at berlin with my certificates testimonia and the pass told down on the table five tailducats schwanzdukaten and a gold friedrich under them about 3 pounds 10s i think better than 10 pounds of our day to a common man and better than 100 pounds to a linsenbarthsaying the king sent me this to take me home to berlin again  and if the hussar took me into the palace it was now the secretary that took me out again and there yoked with six horses stood a royal proviantwagon which having led me to the secretary said you people the king has given order you are to take this stranger to berlin and also to accept no drinkmoney from him i again through the herrn secretarium testified my most submissive thankfulness for all royal graciousnesses took my place and rolled away  on reaching berlin i went at once to the packhof straight to the officeroomstanding more erect this timeand handed them my royal rescript the head man opened the seal in reading he changed color went from pale to red said nothing and gave it to the second man to read the second put on his spectacles read and gave it to the third however he the head man rallied himself at last i was to come forward and be so good as write a quittance receipt that i had received for my 400 thalers all in batzen the same sum in brandenburg coin ready down without the least deduction my cash was at once accurately paid and thereupon the steward was ordered to go with me to the white swan in the judenstrasse and pay what i owed there whatever my score was for which end they gave him twentyfour thalers and if that were not enough he was to come and get more on these high terms linsenbarth marched out of the packhof for the second time the sublime head of him not turned either sweeping the very stars  that was what the king had meant when he said you shall have your money back and interest too videlicet that the packhof was to pay my expenses at the white swan the score however was only 10 thaler 4 groschen 6 pfennigs 30 shillings 5 pence and 2 or perhaps 3 quarterfarthings for what i had run up in eight weeksan uncommonly frugal rate of board for a man skilled in hermeneutics hebraics polemics thetica exegetics pastorale morale and practical christianity and the philosophy of zeno carried to perfection or nearly soand herewith this troubled history had its desired finish and our graywhiskered rawboned greathearted candidatus lay down to sleep at the white swan probably the happiest man in all berlin for the time being  linsenbarth dived now into privateteaching information as he calls it forming and kneading into his own likeness such of the young berliners as he could get hold ofsurely not without some good effect on them the model having besides hermeneutics in abundance so much natural worth about it he himself found the mine of informing a very barren one as to money continued poor in a high degree without honor without emolument to speak of and had a straitened laborious and what we might think very dark lifepilgrimage but the darkness was nothing to him he carried such an inextinguishable frugal rushlight within meat clothes and fire he did not again lack in berlin for the time he needed themsome twentyseven years still and if he got no printed praise in the reviews from baddish judges writing by the sheethere and there brother mortals who knew him by their own eyes and experiences looked or transiently spoke and even did a most real praise upon him now and then and on the whole he can do without praise and will stand strokes even without wincing or kicking where there is no chance  a certain berlin druggist herr medicinalassessor rose whom we may call druggist first for there were two that had to do with linsenbarth was good and human to him in roses house where he had come to teach the children and which continued always thenceforth a home to him when needful he wrote this narrative anno 1774 and died there three years afterwards24th august 1777 of apoplexy age 88 say the burial registers in rodenbeckbeitragei 472475 these latter details with others in confused form ib 462471 the narrative itself druggist second on succeeding the humane predecessor found linsenbarths papers in the drugstores of the place druggist second chanced to be one klaproth famed among the scientific of the world and by him the linsenbarth narrative was forwarded to publication and such fame as is requisite     sir jonas hanway stalks across the scene too in a pondering and observing manner  of the then very famous berlin carrousel of 1750 we propose to say little the now chief interesting point in it being that m de voltaire is curiously visible to us there but the truth is they were very great days at berlin those of autumn 1750 distinguished strangers come or coming the king giving himself up to entertainment of them to enjoyment of them with such a hearty outburst of magnificence this carrousel the apex of it as was rare in his reign there were his sisters of schwedt and baireuth with suite his dear wilhelmina queen of the scene came 8th august rodenbeck 205 there wereit would be tedious to count what other high herrschaften and durchlauchtig persons and to crown the whole and entertain wilhelmina as a queen should be there had come m de voltaire conquered at length to us as we hope and the dream of our youth realized voltaires reception july 10th and ever since has been mere splendor and kindness really extraordinary as we shall find farther on reception perfect in all points except that of the pompadours compliments alone that sublime creatures compliments to your majesty such her express command said voltaire je ne la connais pas answered friedrich with his clearringing voice i dont know her voltaire to madame denis potsdam 11th august 1750 oeuvreslxxiv 184sufficient intimation to voltaire but painful and surprising for which some diplomatic persons blame friedrich to this day but not i or any reader of mine a very proud young king in his silent way always the prouder and stands in no awe of the divine butterflies and crowned infatuations never so potent as more prudent people do  in a berlin of such stir and splendor the arrivals of sir jonas hanway of the young lord malton famed earl or marquis of rockingham that will be or of the witty excellency hanbury are as nothingsir jonass as less than nothing a sir jonas noticed by nobody but himself taking note dull worthy man and mentionable now on that account here is a scrap regarding him not quite to be thrown away  sir jonas hanway was not always so extinct as he has now become readers might do worse than turn to his now old book of travels again and the strange old london it awakens for us a russian trading company full of hope to the then mercantile mind a mr hanway despatched years ago as chief clerk inexpressibly interested to manage welland managing as you may read at large has done his best and utmost all this while and had such travellings through the naphtha countries sailings on the caspian such difficulties successesultimately failure owing to mr elton and thamas kouli khan mainly thamas kouli khanotherwise called nadir shah and a very hardheaded fellow by all appearancewiled and seduced mr elton an exnaval gentleman away from his ledgers to build him ships having set his heart on getting a navy and mr elton did build him spite of all i could say a bark or two on the caspianmost hopeful to the said nadir shah but did it come to anything it disgusted it alarmed the russians and ruined sir jonaswho is returning at this period prepared to render account of himself at london in a loftily resigned frame of mind jonas hanwayan account of cor in brief travels london 3 vols 4to 1753 ii 183 arrived in berlin from the caspian and petersburg side august 15th 1750  the remarks of sir jonas upon berlinfor he exercises everywhere a sapient observation on men and thingsare of dim tumidly insignificant character reminding us of an extinct minervas owl and reduce themselves mainly to this bit of ocular testimony that his prussian majesty rides much about often at a rapid rate with a pleasant business aspect humane though imperative handsome to look upon though with face perceptibly reddish and perhaps snuff on it were you near his age now thirtyeight gone a set appearance as if already got into his forties complexion florid figure muscular almost tending to be plump  listen well through hanway you will find king friedrich is an object of great interest personal as well as official and much the theme in berlin society admiration of him pride in him not now the audiblest tone though it lies at the bottom too our friedrich the great after all so hanway intimates though not express as to epithets or words used the king did a beautiful thing to lieutenantcolonel keith the other day as some readers may remember to lieutenantcolonel keith that poor keith who was nailed to the gallows for him in effigy at wesel long ago and got far less than he had expected the other day there had been a grand review part of it extending into madam knyphausens grounds who is keiths motherinlaw monsieur keith said the king to him i am sorry we had to spoil madams fine shrubbery by our manoeuvres have the goodness to give her that with my apologiesand handed him a pretty casket with key to it and in the interior 10000 crowns not a shrub of madams had been cut or injured but the king you see would count it 1500 pounds of damage done and here is acknowledgment for it which please accept is not that a gracious little touch  this king is doing something at embden sir jonas fears or trying to do in the tradeandnavigation way scandalous that english capitalists will lend money in furtherance of such destructive schemes by the foreigner for the rest sir jonas went to call on lord malton marquis of rockingham that will be an amiable and sober young nobleman come thus far on his grand tour and in time for the carrousel his lordships reception at court here one regretted to hear was nothing distinguished quite indifferent indeed had not the queenmother stept in with amendments the courts are not well together pity for it my lord and his tutor did me the honor to return my visit the rather as we all quartered in the same inn amiable young noblemanso distinguished since for having had unconsciously an edmund burke and such torrents of parliamentary eloquence in his breechespocket breechespocket literally how unknown to hanwayamiable young nobleman is not it ones duty to salute in passing such a one though i would by no means have it overdone and am a calmly independent man  sir jonas also saw the carrousel of which presently and admired the great men of berlin great men all obsolete now though then admired to infinitude some of them you may abuse me said the king to some stranger arrived in berlin you may abuse me and perhaps here and there get praise by doing it but i advise you not to doubt of lieberkuhn the fashionable doctor in any company in berlin hanway ii 190 202 chow fashionable are men  one collini a young italian quite new in berlin chanced also to be at the carrousel or at the latter half of itthough by no means in quest of such objects just at present poor young fellow as he came afterwards to be secretary or amanuensis of voltaire and will turn up in that capacity let us read this note upon him  signor como alessandro collini a young venetian gentleman of some family and education but of no employment or resource had in late years been asking zealously all round among his home circle what am i to do with myself mere echo answering whattill a signora sister of barberina the dancers answered try berlin and king friderico il grande there i could give you a letter to my sister at which collini grasps gets under way for berlinthrough wild alpine sceneries foreign guttural populations and with what thoughts poor young fellow it is a common course to take and sometimes answers sometimes not the cynosure of vague creatures with a sense of faculty without direction what clouds of winged migratory people gathering in to berlin all through this reign not since noahs ark a stranger menagerie of creatures mostly wild of whom voltaire alone is in our time worth mention  collini gazed upon the alpine chasms and shaggy icepalaces with tender memory of the adriatic courageously steered his way through the inoffensive guttural populations had got to berlin just in this time been had to dinner daily by the hospitable barberinas young cocceji always his fellowguestprivately my poor signorinas husband whispered old mamma both the barberinas were very kind to collini cheering him with good auguries and offers of help collini does not date with any punctuality but the german books will do it for him august 25th27th was carrousel and collini had arrived few days before collinimon sejour aupres de voltaireparis 1807 pp 121  and now it is time we were at the carrousel ourselvesin a brief transient way     chapter viberlin carrousel and voltaire visible there  readers have heard of the place du carrousel at paris and know probably that louis xiv held worldfamous carrousel there ad 1662 and in general that carrousel has something to do with tourneying or the shadow of tourneying it is in fact a kind of superb betailored running at the ring instead of beblacksmithed running at one another a second milder edition of those tournament sports and dangerous trials of strength and dexterity which were so grand a business in the old iron ages of which in the form of carrousel or otherwise down almost to the present day there have been examples among puissant lordsthough now it is felt to have become extremely hollow perhaps incapable of fully entertaining anybody except children and their nurses on a high occasion  a century ago before the volcanic explosion of so many things which it has since become wearisome to think of in this earnest world the tournament emblem of an age of chivalry which was gone but had not yet declared itself to be quite gone and even to be turned topsyturvy had still substance as a mummerynot enough i should say to spend much money upon not much real money except indeed the money were offered you gratis from other parties interested sir jonas kindly informs us by insinuation that this was to a good degree friedrichs case in the now carrousel a thing got up by the private efforts of different great lords and princes of the blood each party tailoring harnessing and furbishing himself and followers friedrich contributing little but the arena and general outfit i know not whether even the 40000 lamps for it took place by night were of his purchase though that is likely and know only that the suppers and interior palace entertainments would be his did not cost the king much money says sir jonas which is satisfactory to know for of the carrousel kind or of the royalmummery kind in general there has been for graceful arrangement for magnificence regardless of expenseinviting your amiable lord malton and the idlers of all countries and awakening the rapture of gazetteersnothing like it since louis the grands time nothingexcept perhaps that camp of muhlberg or radowitz where we once were done this one not at the kings expense alone but at other peoples chiefly that is an unexpected feature welcome if true and except for sir jonas would not have helped to explain the puzzle for us as it did in the then berlin circles muhlberg in my humble judgment was worth two of this as a mummerybut the meritorious feature of friedrichs is that it cost him very little  it was say all gazetteers and idle eyewitnesses a highly splendid spectacle by much the most effulgent exhibition friedrich ever made of himself in the expensivemummery department and i could give in extreme detail the phenomena of it but in mercy to poor readers will not fancy the assiduous hammering and sawing on the schlossplatz amid crowds of gay loungers giving cheerful note of preparation in those latter days of august 1750 and on wednesday night 25th august look and seefor the due moments only and vaguely enough as in the following excerpt  palaceesplanade of berlin 25th august 1750 dusk sinking into dark under a windy nocturnal sky a

lamps lapse wholly into darkness and the thing has finished for the time being august 27th it was repeated by daylight if possible more charming than ever but not to be spoken of farther under penalties to be mildly forgotten again every jot and tittle of itexcept one small insignificant iota which by accident still makes it remarkable namely that collini and the barberinas were there and that not only was voltaire again there among the princes and princesses but that collini saw voltaire and gives us transient sight of himthanks to collini thursday 27th august 1750 was the daylight version of the carrousel which collini if it were of any moment takes to have preceded that of the 40000 lamps sure enough collini was there with eyes open  madame de cocceji so one may call her though the known alias is barberina had engaged places she invited me to come and see this festivity we went and very grand it was the palaceesplanade was changed by carpentries and draperies into a vast amphitheatre the slopes of it furnished with benches for the spectators and at the four corners of it and at the bottom magnificently decorated boxes for the court vast oval amphitheatre the interior arena rectangular with its four entrances one for each of the four quadrilles the assemblage was numerous and brilliant all the court had come from potsdam to berlin  a little while before the king himself made appearance there rose suddenly a murmur of admiration and i heard all round me from everybody the name voltaire voltaire looking down i saw voltaire accordingly among a group of great lords who were walking over the arena towards one of the court boxes he wore a modest countenance but joy painted itself in his eyes you cannot love glory and not feel gratefully the prize attached to itattained as here i lost sight of him in few instants as he approached his box the place where i was not permitting farther view collinimon sejourp 21  this was collinis first sight of that great man de ce grand homme with whom thanks to barberina he had in a day or two the honor of an interview judgment favorable he could hope and before many months accident also favoring the inexpressible honor of seeing himself the great mans secretaryhow far beyond hope or aspiration in these carrousel days  voltaire had now been here some seven weeksarrived 10th july as we often noteafter on his own part a great deal of haggling hesitating and negotiating which we spare our readers the poor man having now become a quasiwidower painfully rallying with his whole strength towards new arrangementsnow was the time for friedrich to urge him come to me away from all that dismal imbroglio hither i say to which voltaire is not inattentive though he hesitates cannot in any case come without delaylingers in paris readjusting many things the poor shipwrecked being among kind dargentals and friends poor ishmael getting gray and his tent in the desert suddenly carried off

me a year ago you said always so soon as the lyingin is over i am yoursand now why dont you come  friedrich since they met last has had some experiences of voltaire which he does not like their roads trulyone adulating trajan in versailles and growing great by farces of the fair the other battling for his existence against men and devils trajan and company includedhave lain far apart their correspondence perceptibly languishing in consequence and even rumors rising on the subject voltaire wrote once give me a yard of ribbon sire your order of merit sire to silence those vile rumors which friedrich on such freeandeasy terms had silently declined a meddlesome forward kind of fellow always getting into scrapes and brabbles thinks friedrich but is really anxious now that the chance offers again to have such a levite for his priest the evident pink of human intellect and tries various incitements upon himhits at last i know not whether by device or by accident on one which say the french biographers did raise voltaire and set him under way  a certain m baculard darnaud a conceited foolish young fellow much patronized by voltaire and given to write verses which are unknown to me has been on voltaires recommending literary correspondent to friedrich paris bookagent and the like for some time past corresponding much with potsdam in a way found entertaining and is now

is about to set oeuvres de fredericxiv 95 verses a darnaud of date december 1749 i hope it was by device darnaud is such a silly fellow too absurd to reckon as morning to anybodys sunset except for his involuntary service for and against in this voltaire journey his name would not now be mentionable at all sunset exclaimed voltaire springing out of bed say the biographers and skipping about indignantly in his shirt i will show them i am not set yet duvernet second p 159 and instantly resolved on the berlin expedition went to compiegne where the court then was to bid his adieus nay to ask formally the royal leavefor we are historiographer and titular gentleman of the chamber and kings servant in a sense leave was at once granted him almost huffingly we hope not with too much readiness for this is a ticklish point one is going to prussia on a visit merely though it may be longish one would not have the door of france slammed to behind one the tone at court did seem a little succinct something almost of sneer in it but from the pompadour herself all was friendly mere witty cheery graciosities and my compliments to his majesty of prussiacompliments how answered when they came to hand je ne la connais pas  in short m de voltaire made all his arrangements got under way piously visited fontenoy and the battlefields in passing and is here since july 10thin very great splendor as we seeon his fifth visit to friedrich fifth which proved his lastand is still extremely celebrated in the world visit much misunderstood in france and england down to this day by no means sorted out into accuracy and intelligibility but left as what is saying a great deal probably the wastest chaos of all the sections of friedrichs history and has alone of them gone over the whole world being withal amusing to read and therefore well and widely remembered in that mendacious and semiintelligible state to lay these goblins full of noise ignorance and mendacity and give some true outline of the matter with what brevity is consistent with deciphering it at all is now our sad tasklaborious perhaps disgusting not impossible if readers will loyally assist  voltaire had taken every precaution that this visit should succeed or at least be no loss to one of the parties in a preliminary letter from parisprose and verse one of the cleverest diplomatic pieces ever penned letter really worth

valets but which were confiscated by voltaire and sent across to the waxchandlers so doubtless the spiteful rumor ran probably little but spite and fable berlin being bitter in its gossip stupid

common highways there is no doubt he was perfectly sincere and simple in all this high treatment of voltaire the foremost literary spirit of the world a man to be honored by me and by all men the trismegistus of human intellects what a conquest to have made how cheap is a little money a little patience and guidance for such solacement and ornament to ones barren life he had rashly hoped that the dreams of his youth could hereby still be a little realized and something of the old reinsberg program become a fruitful and blessed fact friedrich is loyally glad over his voltaire eager in all ways to content him make him happy and keep him here as the talking bird the singing tree and the golden water of intelligent mankind the glory of ones own court and the envy of the world will teach us the secret of the muses too french muses and help us in our bits of literature this latter too is a consideration with friedrich as why should it notthough by no means the sole or chief one as the french give it out to be  on his side voltaire is not disloyal either but is nothing like so completely loyal he has and continued always to have not unmixed with fear a real admiration for friedrich that terrible practical doer with the cutting brilliances of mind and character and the irrefragable common sense nay he has even a kind of love to him or something like itlove made up of gratitude for past favors and lively anticipation of future voltaire is by nature an attached or attachable creature flinging out fond boughs to every kind of excellence and especially holding firm by old ties he had made one fancies in him a mixed set of emotions direct and reflexthe consciousness of safe shelter were there nothing more of glory to oneself derived and still derivable from this high manin fine a sumtotal of actual desire to live with king friedrich which might surely have almost sufficed even for voltaire in a quieter element but the element was not quietfar from it nor was voltaire easily sufficeable    perpetual president maupertuis has a visit from one konig out of holland concerning the infinitely little  whether maupertuis in red wig with yellow bottom saw these high gauderies of the carrousel the plays in princess amelias antechamber and the rest of it i do not know but if so he was not in the top place nor did anybody take notice of him as everybody did of voltaire meanwhile i have something to quote as abridged and distilled from various sources chiefly from formey which will be of much concernment farther on  some four weeks after those carrousel effulgencies perpetual president maupertuis had a visit september 21st just while the sun was crossing the line thanks to formey for the date who keeps a notebook useful in these intricacies visit from professor konig an effective mathematical man from the dutch parts whom readers have forgotten again though they saw him once in violent quarrel about the infinitely little with madame du chatelet voltaire witnessing with painit was just as they quitted cirey together ten years ago for these new courses of adventure do readers recall the circumstance maupertuis referee in that quarrel had with a bluntness offensive to the female mind declared konig indisputably in the right and there had followed a dryness between the divine emilie and the flattener of the earth scarcely to be healed by voltaires best efforts  konig has gone his road since then become a fine solid fellow professor in a dutch university more latterly librarian to the dutch stadtholder still frank of speech and with a rugged freeandeasy turn but of manful manners really a person of various culture and as is still noticeable of a solid geometric turn of mind having now as librarian at the hague more leisure and more money he has made a run to berlinchiefly or entirely to see his maupertuis again whom he still remembers gratefully as his first patron in older times and a man of sound parts though rather blusterous now and then a little bit of scientific business also he has with him konig is member of the berlin academy for some years back and there is a thing he would speak with the perpetual president upon wants nothing else in berlin says formey a hearing by the road that maupertuis was not there he had actually turned homewards again but got truer tidings and came on the more was the pity as perhaps will appearhe arrived september 20th if you will be particular on cheeseparings called on me that day being lodged in my neighborhood and next day found maupertuis at home formey i 176179and flew into his arms again like a good boy long absent  maupertuis not many months ago had in two successive papers i think two communicated to the academy a discovery of metaphysicomathematical or altogether metaphysical nature on the laws of motiondiscovery which he has since that brought to complete perfection and sent forth to the universe at large in his sublime little book of cosmology in la beaumellevie de maupertuisparis 1856 pp 105130 confused account of this discovery and of the gradual publication of it to mankindvery gradual first of all in the old paris times in the berlin academy latterly and in fine to all the world in this essai de cosmologie berlin summer of 1750grateful academy striving to admire and believe with its perpetual president that the discovery was sublime to a degree second only to the flattening of the earth and would probably stand thenceforth as a milestone in the progress of human thought which discovery then be not too curious reader take only of it what shall concern you  it is well known there have been to the metaphysical head difficulties almost insuperable as to how in the system of nature motion is how in the name of wonder it can be and even whether it is at all difficulties to the metaphysical head sticking its nose into the gutter therenot difficult to my readers and me who can at all times walk across the room and triumphantly get over them but stick your nose into any gutter entity or object this of motion or another with obstinacyyou will easily drown if that be your determinationsuffice it for us to know in this matter that maupertuis intensely watching nature has discovered that the key of her enigma or at least the ultimate central door which hides all her motional enigmas the key to which cannot even be imagined as discoverable is that nature is superlatively thrifty in this affair of motion that she employs for every motion done or doable a minimum of action and that if you well understand this you will at least announce all her procedures in one proposition and have found the door which leads to everything which will be a comfort to you still looking vainly for the key if there is still no key conceivable  perpetual president maupertuis having surprised nature in this manner read papers upon it to an academy listening with upturned eyes new papers perfected out of oldfor he has long been hatching these phoenixeggs and has sent them out complete quite lately in a little book called cosmologie where alone i have had the questionable benefit of reading them grandly brief as if coming from delphi the utterance is loftily solemn elaborately modest abstruse to the now human mind but intelligible had it only been worth understandinga painful little book that cosmologie as the perpetual presidents generally are minimum of action loi depargne law of thrift he calls this sublime discoverythinks it will be sovereign in natural theology as well for how could nature be a saveall without designer presentand speaks of course among other technical points about vis viva or velocity multiplied by the square of the time which two points loi depargne and that the vis viva is always a minimum the reader can take along with him i will permit him to shake the others into limbo again as forgettable by human nature at this epoch and henceforth  in la beaumellesvie de maupertuisprinted at last paris 1856 after lying nearly a century in manuscript an obtuse worthless leaden little book there is much loud droning and detailing about this cosmologie this sublime discovery and the other sublime discoveries insights and apocalyptic utterances of maupertuis though in so confused a fashion it is seldom you can have the poor pleasure of learning exactly when or except by your own severe scrutiny exactly what for reasons that will appear certain of those apocalyptic utterances by perpetual president maupertuis have since got a new interest and one has actually a kind of wish to read the ipsissima verba of them at this date but in la beaumelle his modern editor lying fast asleep throughout there is no vestige of help nay maupertuiss own book oeuvres de maupertuislyon 1756 4 vols 4to luxurious creampaper quartos or octaves made foursquare by marginwhich you buy for these and the cognate objectsproves altogether worthless to you the maupertuis quartos are not readable for their own sake solemnly emphatic statement of what you already know concentrated struggle to get on wing and failure by so narrow a miss struggle which gets only on tiptoe and wont cease wriggling and flapping and then to your horror they prove to be carefully cleaned of all the maupertuisvoltaire matteredition being subsequent to that worldfamous explosion caveat emptorour excerpt proceeds  industrious konig like other mathematical people has been listening to these oracles on the law of minimum by the perpetual president and grieves to find after study that said law does not quite hold that in fact it is like descartess old key or general door worth little or nothing as leibnitz long ago seems to have transiently recognized konig has put his strictures on paper but will not dream of publishing till the perpetual president have examined them and satisfied himself and that is konigs business at present as he knocks on maupertuis while sol is crossing the line maupertuis has a house of the due style wife a daughter of minister borcks high borcks old as the diuvel no childrenhis back courts always a good deal dirty with pelicans bustards perhaps snakes and other zoological wretches which sometimes intrude into the drawingrooms otherwise very fine a man of some whims some habits arbitrary by nature but really honest though rather sublimish in his interior with red wig and yellow bottom  konig all filial gladness is received gladlythough by degrees with some surprise on the paternal part to find konig ripened out of son client and pupil into independent posture of a grown man frankly certain enough about himself and about the axioms of mathematics standing evidently on his own legs kindly as ever but on these new termsin fact rather an outspoken freeandeasy fellow i should guess not thinking that offence can be taken among friends formey confesses this was uncomfortable to maupertuis in fact a shock which he could not recover from they had various meetings over dinner aud otherwise at the perpetual presidents for perhaps two weeks at this time dates all to be had in formeys notebook if anybody would consult in the whole course of which the shock to the perpetual president increased instead of diminishing republican freedom and equality is evidently konigs method konig heeds not a whit the oracular talent or majestic position of maupertuis argues with the frankest logic when he feels dissentdrives a majestic perpetual president especially in the presence of third parties much out of patience thus one evening replying to some argument of the perpetual presidents he begins my poor friend mon pauvre ami dont you perceive thenupon which maupertuis sprang from his chair violently stamping and pirouetted round the room poor friend poor friend are you so rich then frank konig merely grinning till the paroxysm passed formey i 177 konig went home again re infecta about the end of the month  such a konighad better not have come as to his strictures on the law of thrift the arguings on them alone together or with friends by merely set maupertuis pirouetting and as to the konig manuscripts on them to be published in the leipzig acta after your remarks and permission maupertuis absolutely refused to look at said manuscripts publish them there here everywhere in the devil and his grandmothers name and then there is an end monsieur konig went his ways therefore finding nothing else for it published his strictures in the leipzig acta in march nextand never saw maupertuis again for one result out of several that followed i have no doubt he was out to voltaire more than once in this fortnight and eat the kings roast pleasantly with that eminent old friend voltaire always thought him a bon garcon justly by all the evidence i have and finds his talk agreeable and his berlin newsespecially that of maupertuis and his explosive pirouettings adieu herr professor you know not with your leipzig acta and fragment of leibnitz what an explosion you are preparing     chapter viim de voltaire has a painful jewlawsuit  voltaires terrestrial paradise at berlin did not long continue perfect scarcely had that grand carrousel vanished in the azure firmaments when little clouds began rising in its stead and before long black thunderstorms of a very strange and even dangerous character  it must have been a painful surprise to friedrich to hear from his voltaire some few weeks after those munificences that he voltaire was in very considerable distress of mind from the bad not to call it the felonious and traitorous conduct of m darnaudonce friedrichs shoeinghorn and risingsun for voltaires behoof now a vague flaunting creature without significance to friedrich or anybody that darnaud had done this and done that of an antivoltairian treasonous natureand that in short life was impossible in the neighborhood of such a darnauddarnaud has corrupted my clerk prince henri hungering in vain for la pucelle has got sight of it in this way clerk was dismissed accordingly one tinois an ingenious creatureand collini appointed in his stead darnaud has been gossiping to freron and the paris newspapers darnaud has voltaire to friedrich oeuvres de fredericxxii 257 undated november 1750has in effect been a flaunting young fool of dissolute esurient slightly profligate turn occasionally helping in the theatricals and much studious to make himself notable and useful to the princely kind a darnaud of nearly no significance to friedrich or to anybody a darnaud whose bits of fooleries and struttings about in the peacock or jackdaw way might surely have been below the notice of a trismegistus  friedrich painfully made sensible what a skinless explosive trismegistus he has got on hand answers i suppose in words little or nothingin letters i observe answers absolutely nothing to voltaire repeating and rerepeatingdoes simply dismiss darnaud a bon diable as voltaire to impartial people calls him or accept darnauds demission and cut the poor fool adrift who sallies out into infinite space to paris latterly alive there in 1805 and claims henceforth perpetual oblivion from us and mankind and now there will be peace in our garden of the gods and perpetual azure will return  alas darnaud is not well gone when there has begun brewing in threefold secrecy a mass of galvanic matter which in few weeks more filled the heavens with miraculous foul gases and the blackness of darknesswhich in short exploded about newyears time as the worldfamous voltairehirsch lawsuit still remembered though only as a portent and mystery by observant onlookers of which it is now our sad duty to say something though nowhere in the annals of jurisprudence is there a more despicable thing or a deeper involved in lies and deliriums by current reporters of it about which the sane mind can be called upon accidentally to speak a word beaten riddled shovelled washed in many waters by a patient though disgusted predecessor in this field there lies by me a copious but wearisome narrative of this matterthe more vivid portions of which if rightly disengaged and shown in sequence may satisfy the curious  duvernet who i can guess had talked with darget on the subject has alone of the french biographers some glimmer of knowledge about it duvernet admits that it was a thing of illegal stockjobbing that  1 that m de voltaire had agreed with a jew named hirsch to go to dresden and illegally purchase a good lot of steuerscheine saxon exchequer bills which are payable in gold to a bona fide prussian holding them but are much in discount otherwise as readers may remember and given hirsch a draft on paris due after some weeks for payment of the same hirsch leaving him a stock of jewels in pledge till the steuerscheine themselves come to hand  2 that hirsch having things of his own in view with the money sent no steuerscheine from dresden nothing but vague lying talk instead of steuer so that voltaires suspicions naturally kindling he stopped payment of the paris draft and ordered hirsch to come home at once  3 that hirsch coming a settlement was tried give me back my draft on paris you objectionable blockhead of a hirsch there are your diamonds there is something even for your expenses some fair moiety i think and let me never see your unpleasant face again to which hirsch examining the diamonds answered says duvernet not substantially incorrect hitherto though stepping along in total darkness and very partial on voltaires behalfhirsch examining the diamonds answered but you have changed some of them i cannot take theseand drove voltaire quite to despair and into the lawcourts which imprisoned hirsch and made him do justice duvernet tjdv 170 173 175vague utterly dateless tries one date and is mistaken even in the year wrong in nearly every detail the staire or steuer was a bank c c  in which last clause still more in the conclusion that it was to the triumph of voltaire duvernet does substantially mistake and indeed except as the best parisian reflex of this matter his account is worth nothingthough it may serve as introduction to the following irrefragable documents and more explicit featurings we learn from him and it is the one thing we learn of credible that voltaire when it came to law procedures begged maupertuis to speak for him to m jarriges a prussian frenchman one of the judges and that maupertuis answered i cannot interfere in a bad business me meler dune mauvaise affaire the other french biographies definable as ignoramus speaking in a loud voice to ignoratis require to be altogether swept aside in this matter even clog jumbling voltaires undated letters into confusion thrice confounded and droning out

documents produced in court and the sentence given ernst ferdinand kleinannalen der gesetzgebung und rechtsgelehrsamkeit in den preussischen staatenberlin und stettin 1790 v 215260 other lights are to be gathered with severe scrutiny and caution from the circumambient contemporary rumorespecially from the preface to a comedy so called of tantale en proces tantalus voltaire at lawwhich preface is

fine says my manuscript by sweeping out the distinctly false and well discriminating the indubitable from what is still in part dubitable sufficient twilight abridgable in a high degree i hope rises over the affair to render it visible in all its main features     the voltairehirsch transaction part i origin of lawsuit 10th november25th december 1750  saxon steuerschein some readers know is in the rough equivalent to exchequer bill payable at the saxon treasury to prussians in gold to all other men in paper onlywhich thanks to bruhl and his unheardof expenditures and financierings is now at a discount say of 25 or even 30 per cent by article eleventh of the dresden treaty of peace king friedrich if our readers have not forgotten got stipulated that all prussian holders of these scheine should be paid in gold interest at the due days and at the due days principal itselfin gold they whatever became of others no farther specifications as to proof method limits or conditions of any kind occur in regard to this eleventh article which is a just one beyond doubt but most carelessly drawn up apparently it trusts altogether to the personal honesty of all prussian subjects prove yourself a prussian subject and we pay your steuerschein in real money but now if a saxon or other nonprussian who can get no payment save in paper were to have his note smuggled or trafficked over into prussia and presented as a prussian one in our time such traffic would start on the morrow morning and in a week or two all notes whatsoever would be presented as prussian payable in gold not so in those daysthough a small contraband of that kind does by degrees threaten to establish itself and friedrich had to publish severe rescripts one before this hirschvoltaire business 10th august 1748 seyfarth i 62 one still severer after and menace it down again the malpractice seems to have proved menaceable in that manner nor was any new arrangement made upon itno change till the steuerscheine by their gradual terms were all paid either in real money or imaginary and thus in the course of years the thing burnt to the socket and went out  voltaires rash adventure dangerous navigation and gradual wreck in this forbidden sea of steuerscheinewill become conceivable to readers on study diligent enough of the following documents and select details   document first a small missive in voltaires hand  je prie instamment monsieur hersch de venir demain mardi matin a potsdam pour affaire pressante et daporter sic avec luy les diamants qui doivent servir pour la representation de la tragedie qui se jouera a cinq heures de soir chez sar monseigneur le prince henri  ce lundy a midy voltaire  which being interpreted rightly spelt and dated as by chance we can do with distinctness will run as follows in english  potsdam monday 9th november 1750 i earnestly request mr hirsch to come tomorrow tuesday morning to potsdam on business that is urgent and to bring with him the diamonds needed for the tragedy which is to be represented at five in the evening in his royal highness prince henrys apartment klein v 260  on tuesday the 10th say the old newspapers was rome sauveewith voltaire perceptible there as ciceron rodenbeck i 209 in due  a glorious enough ciceroand such a piece of urgent business done with your hirsch just before emerging on the stage  hirsch in that narrative describes himself as a young innocent creature not very old we will believe but as to innocencefor certain he is named abraham hirsch or hirschel a berlin jew of the period whom one inclines to figure as a florid oily man of semitic features in the prime of life who deals much in jewels moneys loans exchanges all kinds of jew barter whether absolutely in old clothes we do not knowcertainly not unless there is a penny to be turned the man is of oily semitic type not old in yearsthere is a fraternal hirsch and also a paternal who is head of the firmand this young one seems to be already old in jew art speaks french and other dialects in a hebrew partially intelligible manner supplies voltaire with diamonds for his stagedresses as we perceive to all appearance nearly destitute of human intellect but with abundance of vulpine instead very cunning stupid seemingly as a mule otherwiseand on the whole resembling in various points of character a mule put into breeches and made acquainted with the uses of money he is come on pressing businessperhaps not of stagediamonds alone here now is document second nearly of the same date may be of the very samemore likely is a few days later and betokens mysterious dialogue and consultation held on tuesday 10th it is in two hands written on some scrap or torn bit of paper to judge by the length of the lines   document second  in voltaires hand this part  savoir sil est encore tems de declarer les billets quon a sur la steure si on en specifie le numero dans la declaration  if it is still time to declare to announce in saxony and demand payment for notes one holds on the steuer if one is to specify the no in the declaration  in hirschs hand this part  lon peut declarer des billets sur la steure quon a en depost en pays etranger et dont on ne pourra savoir le numero que dans quinze jours ou trois semainesklein 259  one can declare notes on the steuer which one holds in deposit in foreign countries and of which one cannot state the no till after a fortnight or three weeks  which of these two was the serpent which the eve in this steuerschein tree of knowledge that grew in the middle of paradise remains entirely uncertain hirsch of course says it was voltaire voltaire not aware that document second remained in existence had denied that his hirsch business was in any way concerned with steuerand must have been a good deal struck when document second came to light though what could he do but still deny hirsch asserts himself to have objected the illegality the kings anger but that voltaire answered in hints about his favor with the king about his power to make one a courtjeweller if he liked and so at last tempted the baby innocence of hirschfor the rest admits that the steuernotes were expected to yield a profitof 35 per centand in fact a dramatic reader can imagine to himself dialogue enough at different times going on partly by words partly by hint innuendo and dumbshow between this pair of stagebeauties but for near a fortnight after document first there is nothing dated or that can be clearly believedtill  monday 23d november 1750 it is credibly certain the jew hirsch came again this day to the royal schloss of potsdam to voltaires apartment there right overhead of king friedrichs it iswhere after such dialogue as can be guessed at there was handed to hirsch by voltaire in the form of two negotiable bills a sum of about 2250 pounds with which the jew is to make at once for dresden and buy steuerscheine hirschs narrative in preface totantale en procesp 340 steuerscheine without fail but in talking or corresponding on the matter we are always to call them furs or diamondsmystery of mysteries being the rule for us this considerable sum of 2250 pounds may it not otherwise contrives voltaire be called a loan to jeweller hirsch so obliging a jeweller to buy furs or diamonds with at a gain of 35 per 100 pieces there will be above 800 pounds to me after all expenses cleared a very pretty stroke of business doable in few days  monday 23d november the beautiful wilhelmina one remarks is just making her packages right sad to end such a visit as this had been thursday night from her first sleepingplace there is a touching farewell to her brothertender melodiously sorrowful as the song of the swan wilhelmina to friedrich brietzen 26th november jour funeste pour moi oeuvres de fredericxxvii i 197 to voltaire she was always good always liked voltaire voltaire would be saying his adieus in state among the others to that high beingjust in the hours while such a scandalous hirschconcoction went on underground  as to the two bills and voltaires security for them readers are to note as follows bill first is a draft on voltaires paris banker for 40000 livres about 1600 pounds not payable for some weeks this i lend you monsieur hirsch mind lend youto buy furs yes truly what we call fursand before the bill falls payable there will be effects for it in monseigneur de voltaires hand which is security enough for monseigneur the second bill againtruth is there were in succession two second bills an intendedsecond of this same monday 23d which did not quite suit and an actualsecond two days later which did intendedsecond bill was one for 4000 thalers about 600 pounds drawn by voltaire on the sieur ephraima very famous jew of berlin now and henceforth with whom as moneychanger if not yet otherwise which perhaps ephraim thinks unlucky voltaire it would seem is in frequent communication this bill ephraim would not accept told hirsch he owed m de voltaire nothing turned me rudely away says hirsch two of a trade and no friends he and iso that there is nothing to be said of this ephraim bill and except as it elucidates some dark portions of the whirlpools need not have been noticed at all hirsch continues my authority got only two available bills the first on paris for 1600 pounds payable in some weeks and after a day or two this other the actual bill second which is a draft for 4430 thalers about 650 pounds by old father hirsch head of the firm on voltaire himselffurs too with that monsieur hirsch at the rate of 35 per piece you understand yea truly monseigneurdraft accepted by voltaire and the cash for it now handed to hirsch son the only absolutely ready money he has yet got towards the affair  for these two bills especially for this second i perceive voltaire holds borrowed jewels borrowed in theatrical times or partly bought from the hirsch firm and not paid for which make him sure till he see the steuer papers themselvesand now off my good sieur hirsch and know that if you please me there arethings in my power which would suit a man in the jeweller and hebrew line hirsch pushes home to berlin primed and loaded in this manner voltaire naturally auxious enough that the shot may hit alas the shot will not even go off for some time an ill omen  sunday 29th november hirsch we hear is still in berlin fancy the humor of voltaire after such a week as last tuesday december 1st hirsch still is not off go you son of amalek urges voltaire and sends his servant picard a very sharp fellow for perhaps the third timewho has orders now as hirsch discovers to stay with him not quit sight of him till he do go hirschs narrative see voltaires letter to darget oeuvreslxiv 11 hirschs hour of departure for dresden is not mentioned in the acts but i guess he could hardly get over wednesday with picard dogging him on these terms and must have taken the diligence on wednesday night to arrive in dresden about december 4th well at least our shot is off has not burst out and lodged in our person herethanked be all the gods  off sure enoughand what should we say if the whole matter were already oozing out if on this same sunday evening november 29th not quite a weeks time yet the matter as we learn long afterwards had been privately whispered to his majesty that voltaire has sent off a jew to buy steuerscheine and has promised to get him made courtjeweller voltaireoeuvreslxxiv 314 letter to friedrich february 1751after catastrophe so within a week and before hirsch is even gone for men are very porous weighty secrets oozing out of them like quicksilver through clay jars i could guess hirsch by way of galling insolent ephraim had blabbed something and in the course of five days it has got to the very kingthis kammerherr voltaire being such a favorite and famous man as never was the very bullseye of all kinds of berlin gossip in these days hm steuerscheine and the jew hirsch to be courtjeweller you say thinks the king that sunday night but locks the rumor in his royal mind he for his part or dismisses it as incredible there ought to be impervious vessels too among the porous voltaire notices nothing particular or nothing that he speaks of as particular this must have been a horrid week to him till hirsch got away hirsch is away december 2d in dresden safe enough but  but the fortnight that follows is conceivable as still worse hirsch writing darkly nothing to the purpose voltaire driving often into berlin hearing from ephraim hints about no connection with that house if monseigneur have intrusted hirsch with moneymay there be a good account of it and the like black care devouring monseigueur but nothing definite except the fact too evident that hirsch does not send or bring the smallest shadow of steuerscheinepeltries or diamonds we meanor any value whatever for that paris bill of ours payable shortly and which he has already got cashed in dresden nothing but excuses prevarications stupid incoherently deceptive jargon as of a mule intent on playing fox with you vivid correspondence is conceivable but nothing of it definite to us except this sample which we give translated  document third torn fraction in voltaires hand to hirsch doubtless early in december not proper il ne fallait pas to negotiate bills of exchange and never produce a single

on parisexcellent to him for trade of his own what is to be done with such an ass of balaam he has got the bit in his teeth it would seem heavens he too is capable of stopping short careless of spur and cudgel and miraculously speaking to a new prophet strange new revealer of the lords will in modern dialect in this enlightened eighteenth century itselfone thing the new prophet can do protest his paris bill  december 12th our next bit of certainty voltaire writes haste haste to paris dont pay and intimates to hirsch you will have to return your dresden banker his money for that paris bill at paris i have protested it mark me and there it never will be paid to him or you and you must come home again instantly job undone lies not untold you hirsch with money in hand appears not to have wanted for a briskish trade of his own in the dresden marts but this of cutting off his supplies brings him instantly backand at berlin december 16th new facts emerge again of a definite nature  wednesday 16th december 1750 today the king with court and voltaire come to berlin for the carnival rodenbeck i 209 today also voltaire not in carnival humor has appointed his jew to meet him in the royal palace itselfwe hope well remote from friedrichs apartmentthis sordid conference needing ones choicest diplomacy withal and such exquisite handling of bit and spur goes on and probably at great

paris tush cannot we make all that good in the first place i will buy of you these jewels this one discovers to have been the essence of the operation all or the best part of them which i have here in pawn for papas bill 650 pounds was it not well suppose i on the instant take 450 pounds worth or so of these jewels i want a great many jewels and you to pay me down a 200 or so of gold louis as balancegold louis no we will say frederics rather there now that is settled nothing more between us but settles itself if we continue friends upon which hirsch walked home thankful for the good job in jewels wondering only what the allowance for expenses and compensation will be and voltaire steps out newburnished into the royal carnival splendors with a load rolled from his mind  this complete settlement meanwhile rests evidently on two legs both of which are hollow what will the handsome compensation be i wonder thinks hirschand is horrorstruck to find shortly that voltaire considers 60 thalers about 9 pounds will be the fair sum more than ten times that is hirschs privately fixed idea on the other hand voltaire has been asking himself my 450 pounds worth of jewels were they justly valued though jew ephraim exaggerative and an enemy to this hirsch house answers justly i would give from 300 pounds to 250 pounds for themso that the legs both crumbling to powder complete settlement crashes down into chaos and there ensuesbut we must endeavor to be briefer  there ensues for about a week following such an inextricable scramble between the sieur hirsch and m de voltaire asas no reader not himself in the jewbill line or paid for understanding it could consent to have explained to him voltaire by way of mending the bad jewelbargain will buy of hirsch 200 pounds worth more jewels gets the new 200 pounds worth in hand cannot quite settle what articles will suit this think you that think you and intricately shuffles them about to hirsch and back hirsch singular to notice holds fast by that protested paris bill on frivolous pretexts always forgets to bring that may have its uses that in a court of justice yet meetings there are almost daily in the voltaire palaceapartment december 19th and december 24th there are two documents which we must spare the reader though he will hear of them again as highly notable especially of one of them as notable in the extremeindicating the abstrusest jewelbargainings scramblings rebargainings  my jewels are truly valued asseverates hirsch always ephraim is my enemy ask herr reklam chief jeweller in berlin an impartial man the meetings are occasionally of stormy character voltaires patience nearly out but did nt i return you that topaz ring value 75 pounds and you have not deducted it you one day picard and he pulled a ring doubtless this topaz off my finger says the pathetic hirsch and violently shoved me out of the room slamming their doorand sent me home along the corridors in a very scurvy humor thus under a skin of second settlement there are two galvanic elements getting ever more galvanic which no skin of settlement can prevent exploding before long  explosion there accordingly was most sad and dismal which rang through all the court circles of berlin and like a sound of hooting and of weeping mixed is audible over seas to this day but let not the reader insist on tracing the course of it henceforth klein though faithful and exact is not a pitaval and we find in him errors of the press the acutest actuary might spend weeks over these distracted moneyaccounts and inconsistent lists of jewels bought and not bought and would be unreadable if successful let us say the business catches fire at this point the voltairehirsch theatre is as if blown up into mere whirlwinds of igneous rum and smoky darkness henceforth all plunges into lawsuit into chaos of conflicting liesundecipherable not worth deciphering let us give what few glimpses of the thing are clearly discernible at their successive dates and leave the rest to picture itself in the readers fancy  it appears that meeting of december 24th above alluded to was followed by another on christmasday which proved the final one final total explosion took place at this new meetingwhich we find farther was at chasots lodging the chapeau of hanbury who is now in town like all the world for carnival hirsch does not directly venture on naming chasot but by implication by glimmers of evidence elsewhere one sufficiently discovers that it is he lieutenantcolonel kings friend a man glorious especially ever since hohenfriedberg and that haul of the sixtyseven standards all at once in the way of arbitration voltaire thinks chasot might do something in regard to those 450 pounds worth of bought jewels there is not such a judge in the world hirsch says next morning december 25th morrow after that jumbly account with probable slamming of the door and still worse voltaire went to a lieutenantcolonel in the kings service and ask him to send for me duvernet second p 172 hirschs narrative intantalep 344 this is chasot who knows these jewels well duvernetwho had talked a good deal with darget in latter years and alone of frenchmen sometimes yields a true particle of feature in things prussianduvernet tells us these jewels were once chasots own given him by a fond duchess of mecklenburgmusical old duchess verging towards sixty honi soit my friend what hirsch gave chasot for these jewels is not a doubtful quantity and may throw conviction into hirsch hopes voltaire  december 25th 1750 the interview at chasots was not lengthy but it was decisive hirsch never brings that paris bill privately fixed on that point hirschs claims as we gradually unravel the intricate mulemind of him rise very high indeed and as to the value of those jewels and what i allowed you for them monsieur chasot that is no rule tradeprofits you knownay the mule intimates as a last shift that perhaps they are not the same jewels that perhaps m de voltaire has changed some of them whereupon the matter catches fire irretrievably explodes m de voltaires patience flies quite done and fireeyed fury now guiding he springs upon the throat of hirsch like a catomountain clutches hirsch by the windpipe tumbles him about the room infamous canaille do you know whom you have got to do with that it is in my power to stick you into a hole underground for the rest of your life sirrah i will ruin and annihilate youand tossed me about the room with his fist on my throat says hirsch offering to have pity nevertheless if i would take back the jewels and return all writings narrative intantale eyes glancing like a rattlesnakes as we perceive and such a phenomenon as hirsch had not expected this christmas in short the matter has here fairly exploded and is blazing aloft as a mass of intricate fuliginous ruin not to be deciphered henceforth such a scene for chasot on the christmasday at berlin and we have got to     part ii the lawsuit itself 30th december 175018th and 26th february 1751  hirsch slunk hurriedly home uncertain whether dead or alive old hirsch hearing of such explosion considered his house and family ruined and being old and feeble took to bed upon it threatening to break his heart voltaire writes to niece denis on the morrow not hinting at the hirsch matter far from that but in uncommonly dreary humor my splendor here my glory never was the like of it mais mais but and ever again but at each new itemin fact the humor of a glorious phoenixpeacock suddenly douched and drenched in dirty water and feeling frost at hand to madame denis lxxiv 279 berlin palace 26th december 1750and ib 249 257 c of other dates humor intelligible enough when dates are compared  better than that voltaire is applying on all points of the compass to legal and influential persons for help in a court of law to chancellor cocceji to jarriges eminent prussian frenchman president of court to maupertuis who knows jarriges but will not meddle in a bad businessat last even to dull reverend formey whom he had not called on hitherto cocceji seems to have answered to the effect most certainly the courts are wide openbut as to help december 30th the suit voltaire versus hirsch comes to protocolthat is cocceji jarriges loper three eminent men have been named to try it and herr hofrath bell advocate for voltaire plaintiff hands in his first statement that day berlin resounds we may fancy how rumor laughter and wonder are in all polite quarters and continue more or less vivid for above two months coming here is one direct glimpse of plaintiff in this interim which we will give though the eyes are none of the best the first visit i formey had from voltaire was in the afternoon of january 8th 1751 suit begun ten days ago i had at the time a large party of friends voltaire walked across the apartment without looking at anybody and taking me by the hand made me lead him to a cabinet adjoining his lawsuit with a jew was the matter on hand he talked to me at large about his lawsuit and with the greatest vehemence he wound up by asking me to speak to lawpresident m de jarriges since chancellor i answered what was suitableprobably did speak to jarriges but might as well have held my tongue voltaire then took his leave stepping athwart the former apartment with some precipitation he noticed my eldest little girl then in her fourth year who was gazing at the diamonds on his cross of the order of merit bagatelles bagatelles mon enfant said he and disappeared formey i 232  on newyears day friday 1st january 1751 voltaire had legally applied to herr minister von bismark for warrant to arrest hirsch as a person that will not give up papers not belonging to him warrant was granted and hirsch lodged in limbo which worsens the state of poor old father hirsch threatening now really to die of heartbreak and other causes hirsch son from the interior of limbo appeals to bismark lord chancellor cocceji is seized of my plea your gracious lordshipall the same answers bismark produce caution or you cant get out hirsch produces caution and gets out after a day or twoand has been brought to protocol january 4th no delay in this court both parties through their advocates are now brought to book the points they agree in will be sifted out and laid on this side as truth what they differ in left lying on that side as a mixture of lies to be operated on by farther processes and protocols  we will not detail the lawsuitwhat i chiefly admire in it is its brevity cocceji has not reformed in vain good advocates none other allowed and no advocate talks he merely endeavors to think see and discover holds his tongue if he can discover nothing that doubtless is one source of the brevitymany lies are stated by hirsch many by voltaire but the judges without difficulty shovel these aside and come step by step upon the truth hirsch says plainly he was sent to buy steuerscheine at 35 per cent discount voltaire entirely denies the steuernotes says it was an affair of peltries and jewelries originating in loans of money to this ungrateful jew which necessitates much wriggling on the part of m de voltairebut he has himself written in a lawyers office in his young days and knows how to twist a turn of expression the judges are not there to judge about steuernotes but they give you to understand that voltaires peltryandjewelry story is moonshine hirsch produces the voltaire scraps of writing already known to our readers voltaire says mere extinct jottings which hirsch has furtively picked out of the grateor may be said to have picked papers annihilated by our bargain of december 16th and which should have been in the grate if they were not this felon never having kept his word in that respect peltries and jewelries i say he will not give me back that paris bill which was protested pays me the other 3000 crowns draft of 650 pounds in jewels overvalued by halfjewels furtively changed since plaintiff had them of me answers hirschand the steady judges keep their sieves going  the only documents produced by voltaire are two of 19th december and of 24th decemberwhich the reader has not yet seen but ought now to gain some notion of if possible they affect once more as that of december 16th had done to be final settlements or final settlement of 19th with codicil of 24th and turn on confused lists of jewels bought returned rebought that topaz ring torn from ones hand a conspicuous item which no reader would have patience to understand except in the succinct form let all readers note them howeverat least the first of them that of december 19th especially the words we mark in italics which have merited a sad place for it in the history of human sin and misery klein has given both documents in engraved facsimile we must help ourselves by simpler methods berlin december 19th 1750 voltaire writes hirsch signsand the italics are believed to be words foisted in by m de voltaire weeks after while the hirsch pleadings were getting stringent reada very sad memorial of m de voltaire  document fifth in voltaires hand written at two times and the old writing mended in parts to suit the newfor payment of 3000 thalers by me due i have sold to m de voltaire at the price costing by estimation and tax with 2 per cent for my commission or gratification written above the following diamonds taxed blotted into taxable as here adjoined vizseven pieces of jewelry pendeloques c with price affixed among which is the violated topazthe whole estimated by him him crossed out and me written over it being 3640 thalers whereupon received from monsieur de voltaire what is very strange not intelligible without study the sum of 2940 thalers and he has given me back the topaz with 60 crowns for my troubleberlin 19th december 1750 hitherto in voltaires hand after which hirsch writes aprouve a hirschel sic that is always his signature abraham hirschel so given by klein while klein and everybody call him hirsch stag as we have doneif only to save a syllable on the bad bargain and between these two lines  1750 and approved there is crushed in as afterthought valued by myself hirschs self 2940 add 60 is 3000 and in fine below the hirsch signature on what may be called the bottom margin there isi think avowedly voltaires and subsequentthis nb that hirschs valuing of all the jewels present lot and former lot is by real estimation between twice and thrice too high of which it is hoped your lordships will take notice  was there ever seen such a paper one end of it contradicting the other payment to m de voltaire and payment by m de voltairewith other blottings and foistings which print and italics will not represent hirsch denies he ever signed this paper is not that your writing then aprouve a hirschelno and they convict him of falsity in that respect the signature is his but the paper has been altered since he signed it that is what the poor dark mortal meant to express and in his mulish way he has expressed into a falsity what was in itself a truth there is not on candid examination of kleins facsimiles and the other evidence the smallest doubt but voltaire altered added and intercalated in his own privacy those words which we have printed in italics taxes changed into taxables estimated at into estimable at him for me and so on and above all the now first line of the paper for payment of 3000 thalers by me due and in last line the words valued by myself c are palpable interpolations sheer falsifications which hirsch is made to continue signing after his back is turned  no fact is more certain and few are sadder in the history of m de voltaire to that length has he been driven by stress of fortune nay when the judges not hiding their surprise at the form of this document asked will you swear it is all genuine voltaire answered yes certainlyfor what will a poor man not do in extreme stress of fortune hirsch as a jew is not permitted to make oath where a quasichristian will swear to the contrary or he gladly would and might justly the judges willing to prevent chance of perjury did not bring voltaire to swearing but contrived a way to justice without that  february 18th 1751 the court arrives at a conclusion hirschs diamonds whatever may have been written or forged are not nor were worth more than their value think the judges the paris bill is admitted to be voltaires not hirschs continue theyand if hirsch can prove that voltaire has changed the diamonds not a likely fact let him do so the rest does not concern us and to that effect on the above day runs their sentence you hirsch shall restore the paris bill mutual papers to be all restored or legally annihilated jewels to be valued by sworn experts and paid for at that price hirsch if he can prove that the jewels were changed has liberty to try it in a new action hirsch for falsely denying his signature is fined ten thalers thirty shillings such lie being a contempt of court whatever more  ha fined you jew villain hysterically shrieks voltaire in the wrong werent you then and fined thirty shillings hysterically trying to believe and make others believe that he has come off triumphant beaten my jew havent i says he to everybody though inwardly well enough aware how it stands and that he is a phoenix douched and has a tremor in the bones chancellor cocceji was far from thinking it triumphant to him here is a small note of coccejis addressed to his two colleagues jarriges and loper which has been found among the law papers  berlin 20th february 1751 the herr president von jarriges and privycouncillor loper are hereby officially requested to bring the remainder of the voltaire sentence to its fulfilment i am myself not well and can employ my time much better the herr von voltaire has given in a desperate memorial ein desperates memorial to this purport i swear that what is charged to me believed of me in the sentence is true and now request to have the jewels valued i have returned him this paper with notice that it must be signed by an advocatecocceji klein 256  so wrote chancellor cocceji on the saturday washing his hands of this sorry business voltaire is ready to make desperate oath if needful we said once m de voltaire was not given to lying far the reverse but yet see if you drive him into a corner with a sword at his throatalas yes he will lie a little forgery lay still less in his habits but he can do a stroke that way too one stroke unique in his life i do believe if a wild boar with frothy tusks is upon him tell it not in gathexcept for scientific purposes and be judicial arithmetical in passing sentence on it not shrieky mobbish and flying off into the infinite  berlin of course is loud on these matters the man whom the king delighted to honor this is he then king friedrich has quitted town some while ago returned to potsdam january 30th glad enough i suppose to be out of all this unmusical blowing of catcalls and indecent exposure to voltaire he has taken no notice silently leaves voltaire in his nook of the berlin schloss till the foul business get done voltaire filoute les juifs picks jew pockets writes he once to wilhelmina will get out of it by some gambade summerset writes he another time but 31st december 1750 oeuvres de fredericxxvii i 198 3d february 1751 ib 201and takes the matter with boundless contempt doubtless with some vexation but with the minimum of noise as a royal gentleman might jew hirsch is busy preparing for his new desperate action getting together proof that the jewels have been changed in proof jew hirsch will be weak but in pleading in public pamphlets and keeping a winged apollo fluttering disastrously in such a mudbath jew hirsch will be strong voltaire out of magnanimous pity to him consents next week to an agreement agreement is signed on thursday 26th february 1751papers all to be returned jewels nearly all except one or two paid at hirschs own price whereby on the whole as klein computes voltaire lost about 150 poundselsewhere i have seen it computed at 187 pounds not the least matter which old hirsch has died in the interim of broken heart blubbers the son day not known  and on these terms voltaire gets out of the business glad to close the intolerable rumor at some cost of money for all tongues were wagging and in defect of a times newspaper it appears there had pamphlets come out printed satires bound or in broadsidesapid exhilarative for a season and interesting to the idle mind of which tantale en proces may still for the sake of that preface to it be considered to have an obscure existence and such reduced to its authenticities was the adventure of the steuernotes a very bad adventure indeed unspeakably the worst that voltaire ever tried who had such talent in the finance line on which poor history is really ashamed to have spent so much time sorting it into clearness in the disgust and sorrow of her soul but perhaps it needed to be done let us hope at least it may not now need to be done again besides the klein the tantale en proces and the voltaire letters cited above there is inoeuvres de voltairelxiv pp 61106 as supplement there written offhand in the very thick of the hirsch affair a considerable set of notes to darget which might have been still more elucidative but are in their present dateless topsyturvied condition a very wonder of confusion to the studious reader  this is the first act of voltaires tragicfarce at the court of berlin readers may conceive to what a bleared frostbitten condition it has reduced the first favonian efflorescence there he considerably recovered in the second act such the indelible charm of the voltaire genius to friedrich but it is well known the first act rules all the others and here accordingly the third act failed not to prove tragical out of first act into second the following extracts of correspondence will guide the reader without commentary of ours  voltaire left languishing at berlin has fallen sick now that all is overno doubt in part really sick the unfortunate

 1 king friedrich to voltaire at berlin  potsdam 24th february 1751 i was glad to receive you in my house i esteemed your genius your talents and acquirements and i had reason to think that a man of your age wearied with fencing against authors and exposing himself to the storm came hither to take refuge as in a safe harbor  but on arriving you exacted of me in a rather singular manner not to take freron to write me news from paris and i had the weakness or the complaisance to grant you this though it is not for you to decide what persons i shall take into my service darnaud had faults towards you a generous man would have pardoned them a vindictive man hunts down those whom he takes to hating in a word though to me darnaud had done nothing it was on your account that he had to go

business is so well known in saxony that they have made grievous complaints of it to me  for my own share i have preserved peace in my house till your arrival and i warn you that if you have the passion of intriguing and caballing you have applied to the wrong hand i like peaceable composed people who do not put into their conduct the violent passions of tragedy in case you can resolve to live like a philosopher i shall be glad to see you but if you abandon yourself to all the violences of your passions and get into quarrels with all the world you will do me no good by coming hither

ostfriesland and the shipping interests  two foreign events following on the heel of the hirsch lawsuit were of interest to our berlin friends though not now of much to us or anybody april 5th 1751 the old king of sweden landgraf of hessencassel died whereby not only our friend wilhelm the managing landgraf becomes landgraf indeed if he should ever turn up on us again but princess ulrique is henceforth queen of sweden her husband the new king no doubt a welcome event to princess ulrique the high braveminded lady but which proved intrinsically an empty one not to say worse than empty to herself and her friends in times following friedrichs connection with sweden which he had been tightening lately by a treaty of alliance came in the longrun to nothing for him on the swedish side and

others and ever others have followed since to gradual considerable diminution of the dollart and relief of ostfriesland on this side furtherance of these things is much a concern of friedrichs the

he has declared embden a freehaven inviting trade to it from all peaceable nationsand readers do not know though sir jonas hanway and the jealous mercantile world well did what magnificent shipping companies and seaenterprises of his devising are afoot there of which one word and no second shall follow  september 1st 1750 those carrousel gayeties scarce done the asiatic trading company stept

and many english private persons doamong the latter one english lady name unknown but i always suspect miss barbara wyndham of the college salisbury concerning whom there will be honorable notice by and by  at the time of friedrichs visit the asiatic company is in full vogue making ready its first ship for canton first ship konig von preussen tons burden not given actually sailed 17th february next 1752 and was followed by a second named town of embden on the 19th of september following both of which prosperously reached canton and prosperously returned with cargoes of satisfactory profit the first of them konig von preussen had been boarded in the downs by an english captain thomson and his frigate and detained some daystill thomson took seven english seamen out of her act of parliament express said his grace of newcastle which done thomson found that the english jealousies would have to hold their hand no farther whatever ones wishes may be  nay within a year hence january 24th 1753 friedrich founded another company for india bengalische handelsgesellschaft which also sent out its pair of ships perhaps oftener than once and pointed as the other was doing to wide fields of enterprise for some time but luck was wanting and in part mismanagement and in whole the sevenyears war put an end to both companies before long friedrich is full of these thoughts among his other industrialisms and never quits them for discouragement but tries again when the obstacles cease to be insuperable ever since the acquisition of ostfriesland the furtherance of seacommerce had been one of friedrichs chosen objects let us carry our own goods at least silesian linens memel timbers stockfish what need of the dutch to do it and in many branches his progress had been remarkableespecially in this carrying trade while the war lasted and crippled all antienglish belligerents upon which indeed and the conduct of the english privateers to him there is a controversy going on with the english court in those years began in 1747 most distressful to his grace of newcastlewhich in part explains those stingy procedures of captain thomson home you seven english sailors when the first canton ship put to sea that controversy is by no means ended after three years but on the contrary after two years more comes to a crisis quite shocking to his grace of newcastle and defying all solution on his graces sidethe other party after such delays five years waiting having settled it for himself of which were the crisis come we will give some account  on the third day of his visit friedrich drove to aurich the seat of government and official little capital of ostfriesland where triumphal arches joyful reverences concourses demonstrations sumptuous dinner one item awaited his majesty i know not if in the way thither or back he passed those three huge oaks or the rotted stems or roots of them under which the ancient frisians lords of all between weser and rhine were wont to assemble in parliament without fourth estate or any eloquence except of the purely business sortor what his thoughts on the late ostfriesland bandbox parliaments may have been he returned to embden that night and on the morrow started homewards we may fancy tolerably pleased with what he had seen  king friedrichs main objects of pursuit in this period says a certain author whom we often follow i define as being three 1 reform of the law 2 furtherance of husbandry and industry in all kinds especially of shipping from embden 3 improvement of his own domesticities and household enjoymentsrenewal of the reinsberg program in short  in the first of these objects continues he king friedrichs success was very considerable and got him great fame in the world in his second head of efforts that of improving the industries and husbandries among his people his success though less noised of in foreign parts was to the near observer still more remarkable a perennial business with him this which even in the time of war he never neglects and which springs out like a stemmed flood whenever peace leaves him free for it his labors by all methods to awaken new branches of industry to cherish and further the old are incessant manifold unwearied and will surprise the uninstructed reader when he comes to study them an airy poetizing bantering lightly brilliant king supposed to be serious mainly in things of war how is he moiling and toiling like an evervigilant landsteward like the most industrious city merchant hardestworking merchants clerk to increase his industrial capital by any the smallest item  one day these things will deserve to be studied to the bottom and to be set forth by writing hands that are competent for the instruction and example of workersthat is to say of all men kings most of all when there are again kings at present i can only say they astonish me and put me to shame the unresting diligence displayed in them and the immense sumtotal of themwhat man in any the noblest pursuit can say that he has stood to it sixandforty years long in the style of this man nor did the harvest fail slow sure harvest which sufficed a patient friedrich in his own day harvest now in our day visible to everybody in a prussia all shooting into manufactures into commerces opulencesi only hope not too fast and on more solid terms than are universal at present those things might be didactic truly in various points to this generation and worth looking back upon from its high laissezfaire altitudes its triumphant scriptransactions and continents of goldnuggetspleasing it doubts not to all the gods to write well of what is called political economy meaning thereby increase of moneysworth is reckoned meritorious and our nearest approach to the rational sublime but to accomplish said increase in a high and indisputable degree and indisputably very much by your own endeavors wisely regulating those of others does not that approach still nearer the sublime  to prevent disappointment i ought to add that friedrich is the reverse of orthodox in political economy that he had not faith in freetrade but the reversenor had ever heard of those ultimate evangels unlimited competition fair start and perfervid race by all the world towards cheapandnasty as the likeliest winningpost for all the world which have since been vouchsafed us probably in the world there was never less of a freetrader constraint regulation encouragement discouragement reward punishment these he never doubted were the method and that government was good everywhere if wise bad only if not wise and sure enough these methods where human justice and the earnest sense and insight of a friedrich preside over them have results which differ notably from opposite cases that can be imagined the desperate notion of giving up government altogether as a relief from human blockheadism in your governors and their want even of a wish to be just or wise had not entered into the thoughts of friedrich nor driven him upon trying to believe that such in regard to any human interest whatever was or could be except for a little while in extremely developed cases the true way of managing it how disgusting accordingly is the prussia of friedrich to a hanbury williams who has bad eyes and dirty spectacles and hates friedrich how singular and lamentable to a mirabeau junior who has good eyes and loves him no knave no impertinent blockhead even can follow his own beautiful devices here but is instantly had up or comes upon a turnpike strictly shut for him was the like ever heard of snarls hanbury furiously as an angry dog might in a labyrinth it sees not the least use for what unspeakable want of libertyand reads to you as if he were lying outright

prussienne he calls it a londres privately paris 1788 8 vols 8vo which is a deadsea of statistics compiled by industrious major mauvillon with this fresh current of a gospel shining through it very fresh and brisk of few yards breadthdedicated to papa the true protevangelist of the thinga comparatively recent performance though now some seventy or eighty years the senior of an english unconscious facsimile which we have all had the pleasure of knowingwill fall to be noticed afterwards not by this editor we hope  many of friedrichs restrictive notionsas that of watching with such anxiety that money gold or silver coin be not carried out of the countrywill be found mistakes not in orthodox dismal science as now taught but in the nature of things and indeed the dismal science will generally excommunicate them in the lumptoo heedless that fact has conspicuously vindicated the general sumtotal of them and declared it to be much truer than it seems to the dismal science dismal science if that were important to me takes insufficient heed and does not discriminate between times past and times present times here and times there  certain it is king friedrichs success in national husbandry was very great the details of the very many new manufactures new successful everspreading enterprises fostered into existence by friedrich his canalmakings roadmakings bogdrainings colonizings and unwearied endeavorings in that kind will require a technical philosopher one day and will well reward such study and trouble of recording in a human manner but must lie massed up in mere outline on the present occasion friedrich as landfather shepherd of the people was great on the husbandry side also and we are to conceive him as a man of excellent practical sense doing unweariedly his best in that kind all his life long alone among modern kings his late father the one exception and even his father hardly surpassing him in that particular  in regard to embden and the shipping interests ostfriesland awakened very ardent speculations which were a novelty in prussian affairs nothing of foreign trade except into the limited baltic had been heard of there since the great electors time the great elector had ships forts on the coast of africa and tried hard for atlantic tradeout of this same embden where being summoned to protect in the troubles he had got some footing as contingent heir withal and kept a prussian battalion a good while and now on much fairer terms not less diligently turned to account it is his greatgrandsons turn friedrichs successes in this department the rather as embden and ostfriesland have in our time ceased to be prussian are not much worth speaking of but they connect themselves with some points still slightly memorable to us how for example his vigilantes and endeavors on this score brought him into rubbings not collisions but jealousies and gratings with the english and dutch the reader will see anon  lawreform is gloriously prosperous husbandry the like and shipping interest itself as yet but in the third grand head that of realizing the reinsberg program beautifying his domesticities and bringing his own hearth and household nearer the ideal friedrich was nothing like so successful in fact had no success at all that flattering reinsberg program it is singular how friedrich cannot help trying it by every new chance nor cast the notion out of him that there must be a kind of musesheaven realizable on earth that is the biographic phenomenon which has survived of those years and to that we will almost exclusively address ourselves on behalf of ingenuous readers     chapter ixsecond act of the voltaire visit  voltaires visit lasted in all about thirtytwo months and is divisible into three acts or stages the first we have seen how it commenced in brightness as of the sun and ended by that hirsch business in whirlwinds of smoke and sootvoltaire retiring on his passionate prayer to that silent countryhouse which he calls the marquisat there to lie in hospital and wash himself a little and let the skies wash themselves  the hirsch business having blown over as all things do voltaire resumed his place among the courtplanets and did his revolutions striving to forget that there ever was a hirsch or a sootexplosion of that nature in words nobody reminded him of it the king least of all and by degrees matters were again tolerably glorious and all might have gone well enough though the primal perfect splendor such fuliginous reminiscence being ineffaceable never could be quite reattained the diamond cross of merit the chamberlain gold key hung bright upon the man a man the admired of men he had work to do work of his own which he reckoned priceless that immortal siecle de louis quatorze which he stood by and honestly did while here the one fixed axis in those fooleries and whirlings of hiswork for the king two hours one hour a day which the king reckoned priceless in its sort for friedrich himself voltaire has with touches of real love coming out now and then a very sincere admiration mixed with fear and delights in shining to him and being well with him as the greatest pleasure now left in life besides the king he had society enough french in type and brilliant enough plenty of society or at his wish what was still better none at all he was bedded boarded lodged as if beneficent fairies had done it for him and for all these things no price asked you might say but that he would not throw himself out of window had the man been wisebut he was not wise he had if no big gloomy devil in him among the bright angels that were there a multitude of ravening tumultuary imps or little devils very illchained and was lodged he and his restless little devils in a skin far too thin for him and them  reckoning up the matter one cannot find that voltaire ever could have been a blessing at berlin either for friedrich or himself and it is to be owned that friedrich was not wise in so longing for him or clasping him so frankly in his arms as friedrich by this time probably begins to discoverthough indeed to friedrich the thing is of finite moment by no means of infinite as it was to voltaire at worst nothing but a little money thrown away thinks friedrich sure enough this is a strange trismegistus this of mine star firework shall we call him or terrestrial smokeandsoot work but one can fence oneself against the blind vagaries of the man and get a great deal of good by him in the lucid intervals to voltaire himself the position is most agitating but then its glories were there nothing more besides he is always thinking to quit it shortly which is a great sedative in troubles what with intermittencies safe hidings in ones marquisat or vacant interlunar cave with alternations of offence and reconcilement what with occasional actual flights to paris whitherward voltaire is always busy to keep a postern open and of which there is frequent talk and almost continual thought all along flights to be called visits and privately intending to be final but never proving sothe voltairefriedrich relation if left to itself might perhaps long have staggered about and not ended as it did  but alas no relation can be left to itself in this worldespecially if you have a porous skin there were other french here as well as voltaire revolving in the courtcircle and that beyond all others proved the fatal circumstance to him ne savezvous pas dont you know said he to chancellor jarriges one day that when there are two frenchmen in a foreign court or country one of them must die faut que lun des deux perisse seyfarth ii 191 c c which shocked the mind of jarriges but had a kind of truth too jew hirsch run into for low smuggling purposes had been a cape of storms difficult to weather but the continual leeshore were those frenchwith a heavy gale on and one of the rashest pilots he did strike the breakers there at last and it is well known total shipwreck was the issue our second act holding out dubiously in continual perils till autumn 1752 will have to pass then into a third of darker complexion and into a catastrophe very dark indeed  catastrophe which by farther ill accident proved noisy in the extreme producing worldwide shrieks from the one party stonesilence from the other which were answered by unlimited hooting catcalling and hahaing from all parts of the worldtheatre upon both the shrieky and the silent party catcalling not fallen quite dead to this day to friedrich the catcalling was not momentous being used to such things though to poor voltaire it was unlimitedly soand to readers interested in this memorable pair of men the rights and wrongs of the affair ought to be rendered authentically conceivable now at last were it humanly possibleafter so much catcalling at random smelfungus has a right to say speaking of this matter  never was such a jumble of loudroaring ignorances delusions and confusions as the current records of it are editors especially french editors treating of a hyperborean cimmerian subject like this are easygoing creatures and truly they have left it for us in a wonderful state dateless much of it by nature and by the lazy editors misdated into very chaos jumbling along there in mad defiance of top and bottom often the very year given wrongfull everywhere of lazy darkness irradiated only by stupid rages illdirected mockeriesand for issue cheerfully malicious hootings from the general mob of mankind with unbounded contempt of their betters which is not pleasant to see when mobs do get together round any signal object and editorial gentlemen with talent for it pour out from their respective barrelheads in a persuasive manner instead of knowledge ignorance set on fire they are capable of carrying it farwill it be possible to pick out the small glimmerings of real light from this mad dance of willowisps and fireflies thrown into agitation  it will be very difficult my friendwhy did not you yourself do it most true those actual voltairefriedrich letters of the time are a resource and pretty much the sole one letters a good few still extant which all had

day is not beautiful that sees a stone or two added theredaily voltaire sees himself at work on his siecle on those fine terms trowel in one hand weapon of war in the other and does actually accomplish it in the course of this year 1751with a great deal of punctuality and severe painstaking which readers of our day fallen careless of the subject are little aware of on voltaires behalf

taught from the fountainheadone wonders his majesty did not learn to spell which might have been got from a lower sourceand all this voltaire does teach with great strictness for example in the very first line in the very first word set before him  prussiens que la valeur conduisit a la gloire so friedrich had written ode aux prussiens which is specimen first and thus voltaire criticises the hero here makes his prussiens of two syllables and afterwards in another strophe he grants them three a king is master of his favors at the same time one does require a little uniformity and the iens are usually of two syllables as liens silesiens autrichiens excepting the monosyllables bien rienenough enougha severe punctual painstaking voltaire sitting with the schoolmasters bonnet on head ferula

things which is pleasant in so old a cat  smelfungus says he is a consummate artist in speech our voltaire that if you take the word speech in its widest sense and consider the much that can be spoken and the infinitely more that cannot and should not is voltaires supreme excellency among his fellowcreatures never rivalled to my poor judgment anywhere before or sincenor worth rivalling if we knew it well  another fine circumstance is that voltaire has frequent leave of absence and in effect passes a great deal of his time altogether by himself or in his own way otherwise what with friedrichs review journeys and business circuits considerable separations do occur of themselves and at any time voltaire has but to plead illness which he often does with ground and without and get away for weeks safe into the distance more or less remote he is at the marquisat as we laboriously make out at berlin in the empty palace perhaps in lodgings of his own though one would prefer the gratis method nursing his maladies which are many writing his louis quatorze lonely altogether your majesty and sad of humoryet giving his cosy little dinners and running out pretty often if well invited

are mostly not quite strangers to you  we know the sublime perpetual president in his red wig and sublime supremacy of pure science a gloomy set figure affecting the sententious the emphatic and a composed impregnabilitylike the jove of science with immensities of gloomy vanity not compressible at all times friedrich always strove to honor his perpetual president and duly adore the pure sciences in him but inwardly could not quite manage it though outwardly he failed in nothing impartial witnesses confess the king had a great deal of trouble with his gloomings and him who is this voltaire gloomily thinks the perpetual president to himself a fellow with a nimble tongue that is all knows nothing whatever of pure sciences except what fraction or tincture he has begged or stolen from myself and here is the king of the world in raptures with him  voltaire from of old had faithfully done his kowtows to this king of the sciences and with a sort of terror had suffered with incredible patience a great deal from him but there comes an end to all things voltaires patience not excepted it lay in the fates that maupertuis should steadily accumulate day after day and now more than ever heretofore upon the sensitive voltaire till as will be seen the sensitive voltaire could endure it no longer but had to explode upon this big bully accident lending a spark to go off like a

himself into trouble for love or hatred he fell into disfavor not long after that unsuccessful little mission in the first silesian war of which the reader has lost remembrance good for nothing in diplomacy thought friedrich but agreeable as company company in tents in the seat of war has its unpleasantness thought algarottiand began very privately sounding the waters at dresden for an eligible situation so that there has ensued a quarrel since then humble apologies followed by profound silencetill now there is reconcilement it is admitted friedrich had some real love for algarotti algarotti as we gather none at all for him but only for his greatness they parted again february 1753 without quarrel but for the last time algarotticorrespondence oeuvres de fredericxviii 86and i confess to a relief on the occasion  friedrich readers know by this time had a great appetite for conversation he talked well listened well one of his chief enjoyments was to give and receive from his fellowcreatures in that way i hope and indeed have evidence that he required good sense as the staple but in the form he allowed great latitude he by no means affected solemnity rather the reverse goes much upon the bantering vein far too much according to the complaining parties took pleasure cruel mortal in stirring up his company by the whip and even by the whip applied to raws for we find

open mouth and mind all in tumult la mettrie had left the army soon after that busy fontenoy evening chivalrous grammont his patron and protector who had saved him from many scrapes lay shot on the field la mettrie rushing on with mouth open and mind in tumult had from of old been continually getting into scrapes unorthodox to a degree the sorbonne greedy for him long since such his audacities in print his heavy hits boisterous quizzical logical and now he had set to attacking the medical faculty to quizzing medicine in his wild way doctor astruc doctor this and that of the first celebrity taking it very ill so that la mettrie had to demit to get out of france rather in a hurry lest worse befell  he had studied at leyden under boerhaave he had in fact considerable medical and other talent had he not been so tumultuous and openmouthed he fled to leyden and shot forth in safety there his fiery darts upon sorbonne and faculty at his own discretionwhich was always a minimum quantityhe had before long made leyden also too hot for him his books gained a kind of celebrity in the world awoke laughter and attention among the adventurous of readers astonishment at the blazing madcap a bon diable too as one could see and are still known to cataloguemakersthough with one exception lhomme machine not otherwise nor read at all lhomme machine man a machine is the exceptional book smallest of duodecimos to have so much wildfire in it this man a machine though tumultuous la mettrie meant nothing but openmouthed wisdom by it gave scandal in abundance so that even the leyden magistrates were scandalized and had to burn the afflicting little duodecimo by the common hangman and order la mettrie to disappear instantly from their city  which he had to dotowards king friedrich usual refuge of the persecuted seldom inexorable where there was worth even under bad forms recognizable and not a friend to burning poor men or their books if it could be helped la mettrie got some post like dargets or still more nominal readership some small pension to live upon and shelter to shoot forth his wildfire when he could hold it no longer fire not of a malignant incendiary kind but pleasantly lambent though maddish as friedrich perceived thus had la mettrie found a goshenand stood in considerable favor at court and in berlin society in the years now current according to nicolai friedrich never esteemed la mettrie which is easy to believe but found him a jester and ingenious madcap out of whom a great deal of merriment could be had over wine or the like to judge by nicolais authentic specimen their colloquies ran sometimes pretty deep into the cynical under showers of wildfire playing about and the highjinks must have been highish anekdotenvi 197227 when there had been enough of this friedrich would lend his la mettrie to the french excellency milord tyrconnel to oblige his excellency and get la mettrie out of the way for a while milord is at berlin a jacobite irishman of blusterous irish qualities though with plenty of sagacity and rough sense likes la mettrie and is not much a favorite with friedrich  tyrconnel had said at firstwhen rothenburg privately from friedrich came to consult him what are in practical form those assistances from the most christian majesty should we make alliance with him as your excellency proposes and chance to be attackedmorbleu assistance enough enumerating several mais morbleu si vous nous trompex vous serez ecrases if you deceive us you will be squelched valori ii 130 c he had been chosen for his rough tongue says valori our french court being piqued at friedrich and his sarcasms tyrconnel gives splendid dinners voltaire often of them does not love potsdam nor is loved by it nay i sometimes think a certain demon newswriter of whom by and by but do not know may be some hungry attache of tyrconnels hungry attache shut out from the divine suppers and upper planetary movements and reduced to look on them from his cold hutch in a doglike angry and hungry manner his flying allusions to voltaire son friedrichs squelette dapollon skeleton of an apollo and the like are barkings almost rabid  of the military sort about this time keith and rothenburg appear most frequently as guests or companions rothenburg had a great deal of friedrichs regard winterfeld is more a practical counseller and does not shine in learned circles as rothenburg may a fiery soldier too this rothenburg withala man probably of many talents and qualities though of distinctly decipherable there is next to no record of him or them he had a parisian wife who is sometimes on the point of coming with niece denis to berlin and of setting up their two french households there but never did it either of them to make an uncle or a husband happy rothenburg was bred a catholic he headed the subscription for the famous katholische kirche so delightful to the pope and liberal christians in those years but never gave a sixpence of money says voltaire once catholic kirk was got completed with difficulty stands there yet like a large washbowl set bottom uppermost on the top of a narrowish tub but none of rothenburgs money is in it in voltaires correspondence there is frequent mention of him not with any love but with a certain secret respect rather inclined to be disrespectful if it durst or could the eloquent vocal individual not quite at ease beside the more silent thinking and acting one what we know is friedrich greatly loved the man there is some straggle of correspondence between friedrich and him left but it is worth nothing gives no testimony of that or of anything else noticeableand that is the one fact now almost alone significant of rothenburg much loved and esteemed by the king employed diplomatically now and then perhaps talked with on such subjects which was the highest distinction poor man he is in very bad health in these months has never rightly recovered of his wounds and dies in the last days of 1751to the bitter sorrow of the king as is still on record a highly respectable dim figure far more important in friedrichs history than he looks as kings guest he can in these months play no part  highly respectable too and well worth talking to though left very dim to us in the books is marshal keith who has been growing gradually with the king and with everybody ever since he came to these parts in 1747 a man of scotch type the broad accent with its sagacities veracities with its steadfastly fixed moderation and its sly twinkles of defensive humor is still audible to us through the foreign wrappages not given to talk unless there is something to be said but well capable of it then friedrich the more he knows him likes him the better on all manner of subjects he can talk knowingly and with insight of his own on russian matters friedrich likes especially to hear himthough they differ in regard to the worth of russian troops very considerable military qualities in those russians thinks keith imperturbably obedient patient of a tough fibre and are beautifully strict to your order on the paradeground or off pooh mere rubbish mon cher thinks friedrich always to which keith unwilling to argue too long will answer well it is possible enough your majesty may try them some day if i am wrong it will be all the better for us which friedrich had occasion to remember by and by friedrich greatly respects this sagacious gentleman with the broad accent his brother the lord marischal is now in france ambassador at paris since september 1751 left potsdam 28th

bother you and expired a few minutes after nicolaianekdoteni 20 n  enough of this poor madcap friedrichs eloge of him read to the academy some time after it was generally thought and with great justice might as well have been spared the piece has nothing noisy nothing untrue but what has it of importance and surely the subject was questionable or more la mettrie might have done without eulogy from a king of men   he had been used to put himself at once on the most familiar footing with the king says thiebault unbelievable entered the kings apartment as he would that of a friend plunged down whenever he liked which was often and lay upon the sofas if it was warm took off his stock unbuttoned his waistcoat flung his periwig on the floor thiebault v 405 calls him la metherie knows as usual nothinghighly probable thinks stupid thiebault  the truth is says nicolai the king put no real value on la mettrie he considered him as a merryandrew fellow who might amuse you when half seasover entre deux vins de la mettrie showed himself unworthy of any favor he had not only did he babble and repeat about town what he heard at the kings table but he told everything in a false way and with malicious twists and additions this he especially did at lord tyrconnel the then french ambassadors table where at last he died nicolaianekdoteni 20 but could not take the orangeskin

because taste gout inclination sets no limits to its recompenses the king of prussia overloads men of talent with his benefits for precisely the reasons which induce a little german prince to overload

of his stupid footnotes  la beaumelle had a long course of it up and down the world in and out of the bastille writing much with inconsiderable recompense and always in a wooden manure worthy of his first vocation in the geneva time a man of pleasing physiognomy says formey and expressed himself well i received his visit 14th january 1752to which latter small circumstance welcome as a fixed date

de pradesde prades abbe de prades reader to the king though happily not an enemy of voltaires is in some sort la beaumelles counterpart or brother with a difference concerning whom also one wants only to know the exact date of his arrival as la beaumelle felt too straittied in the geneva vestures where it had been good for him to adjust himself and stay so did de prades in the sorbonne dittoand burst out on taking orders not into eloquent preachings or edifying devotional exercises but into loud blurts of mere heresy and heterodoxy blurts which were very loud and i believe very stupid which failed of being sublime even to the philosophic world and kindled the sorbonne into burning his book and almost burning himself had not he at once run for it  ran to holland and there continued blurting more at largedecidedly stupid for most part thinks voltaire but with glorious passages worth your majestys attentionupon which dalembert too helping poor de prades was invited to the readership vacant by la mettries eaglepie and came gladly and stayed at what date one occasionally asks for there are royal letters dateless but written in his hand that raise such question in the utter dimness otherwise date is september 1752 preuss i 368 ii 115 farther question one does not ask about de prades rather an emphatic intrusive kind of fellow i should guesswrote he not friedrich

let him out home to glogau sirrah stick to your canonry henceforth and let us hear no more of you at all which shall be his fate in these pages also  good my friend no more of him then only recollect september 1752 if dateless royal letters in de pradess hand turn up     chapter x demon newswriter of 1752  it must be owned the kings french colony of wits were a sorry set of people they tempt one to ask what is the good of wit then if this be it here are people sparkling with wit and have not understanding enough to discern what lies under their nose cannot live wisely with anybody least of all with one another  in fact it is tragic to think how ill this king succeeded in the matter of gathering friends with the whole world to choose from one fancies always he might have done better but no he could notand chiefly for this reason his love of wisdom was nothing like deep enough reverent enough and his love of esprit the mere garment or phantasm of wisdom was too deep friends do not drop into ones mouth one must know how to choose friends and that of esprit though a pretty thing is by no means the one requisite if indeed it be a requisite at all this present wit colony was the best that friedrich ever had and we may all see how good it was he took at last more and more into bantering his tablecompanions which i do not wonder at as the chief good he could get of them and had as we said especially in his later time in the manner of dublin hackneycoachmen established upon each animal its raw and makes it skip amazingly at touch of the whip cruel mortal thought his cattlebut after all how could he well help it with such a set  native literary men german or swiss there also were about friedrichs court of them happily he did not require esprit but put them into his academy or employed them in practical functions where honesty and good sense were the qualities needed worthy men several of these but unmemorable nearly all we will mention sulzer aloneand not for theories and philosophies of the fine arts allgemeine theorie der schonen kunste3 vols c c which then had their multitudes of readers but for a speech of friedrichs to him once which has often been repeated sulzer has a fine rugged wholesome swissgerman physiognomy both of face and mind and got his admirations as the berlin hugh blair that then was a sulzer whom friedrich always rather liked  friedrich had made him school inspector loved to talk a little with him about business were it nothing else well monsieur sulzer how are your schools getting on asked the king one daylong after this but nobody will tell me exactly when though the fact is certain enough how goes our education business surely not ill your majesty and much better in late years answered sulzerin late years why well your majesty in former time the notion being that mankind were naturally inclined to evil a system of severity prevailed in schools but now when we recognize that the inborn inclination of men is rather to good than to evil schoolmasters have adopted a more generous procedureinclination rather to good said friedrich shaking his old head with a sad smile alas dear sulzer ach mein lieber sulzer i see you dont know that damned race of creatures er kennt nicht diese verdammte race as i do nicolai iii 274the thing appears to have been said in french je vois bien mon cher sulzer que vous ne connaissez pas comme moi cette race maudite a laquelle nous appartenons but the german form is irresistibly attractive and is now heard proverbially from time to time in certain mouths here is a speech for youpardon the king who was himself so beneficent and excellent a king cry several editors of the rosepink type this present editor for his share will at once forgive but how can he ever forget  perhaps i mistake owns voltaire in his pasquinade of a vie privee but it seems to me at these suppers there was a great deal of esprit real wit and brilliancy going the king had it and made others have and what is extraordinary i never felt myself so free at any table conversation most pleasant testifies another most instructive animated not to be matched i should guess elsewhere in the world bielfeld letters voltaire vie privee very sprightly indeed and a fund of good sense a basis of practicality and fact necessary to be in it withal though otherwise it can foam over if some la mettrie be there and a good deal of wine in him to very great heights     a demon newswriter gives an idea of friedrich intelligible to the knowing classes in england and elsewhere  practically i can add only that these suppers of the gods begin commonly at halfpast eight concert just over and last till towards midnightnot later conveniently as the king must be up at five in summertime at four and needs between five and six hours of sleep or would the reader care to consult a piece expressly treating on all these points kind of manuscript newspaper fallen into my hands which seems to have had a widish circulation in its day idee de la personne de la maniere de vivre et de la cour du roi de prusse juin 1752 in therobinson papersone copy now in the british museum i have met with two copies of it in this country one of them to appearance once the property of george selwyn the other is among the robinson papers doubtless very luculent to robinson who is now home in england but remembers many a thing judging from various symptoms i could guess this ms to have been much about in the english aristocratic circles of that time and to have in some measure given said circles their idea as they were pleased to reckon it of that wonderful and questionable kinghighly distracted idea which in diluted form is still the staple english one  by the label demon newswriter it is not meant that the author of this poor paper was an actual devil or infernal spiritual essence of miraculous spectral nature by no means beyond doubt he is some poor frenchman more or less definable as fleshandblood gesturing about visibly at berlin in 1752 in cockedhat and bright shoebuckles grinning elaborate salutations to certain of his fellowcreatures there possibly some hungry attache of milord tyrconnels legation fatally shut out from the beatitudes of this barbarous court and willing to seek solacement and turn a dishonest penny in the percontra course who he is we need not know or care too evident he has the sad quality of transmuting in his dirty organs heavenly brilliancy more or less into infernal darkness and hatefulness which i reckon to have been at all times the principal function of a devilfunction still carried on extensively under firms of another title in this world  some snatches we will give for though it does not much concern a man or king seriously busy what the idle outer world may see good to talk of him his biographers in time subsequent are called to notice the matter as part of his lifeelement and characteristic of the world he had round him friedrichs affairs were much a wonder to his contemporaries especially his domesticities an item naturally obscure to the outer world were wonderful sure to be commented upon to all lengths and by the unintelligent first of all of contemporary mankind as we have sometimes said nobody was more lied ofof which let this of the demon newswriter be example one instead of many the demon newswriter deriving only from outside gossip and eavesdropping is wrong very oftenin fact he is seldom right except on points which have been officially fixed and are within reach of an inquisitive clerk of legation wrong often enough even in regard to external particulars how much more as to internaland will need checking as we go along  demon speaks first of friedrichs stature 5ft 6in as we know better than this demon pretty well proportioned not handsome and even something of awkward gauche acquired by a constrained bearing head slightly off the perpendicular acquired by his flute say the betterinformed is of the greatest politeness fine tone of voicefine even in swearing which is as common with him as with a grenadier adds this demon not worth attending to on such points  has never had a nightcap sleeps bareheaded in his later times would sleep in his hat which was always soft as duffel kneaded to softness as its first duty and did very well never a nightcap dressinggown or pair of slippers true only a kind of cloth cloak not quite much worn and very dirty for being powdered in the whole year round he goes in the uniform of his first battalion of guardsblue with red facings buttonhole trimmings in silver frogs at the inner end his coat buttons close to the shape waistcoat is plain yellow strawcolor hat threecornered has edging of spanish lace white plume horizontal resting on the lace all round boots on his legs all his life he cannot walk with shoes pooh you  he rises daily at fiveno he does nt at all in fact we had better clap the lid on this demon illinformed as to all these points and on such suggestion give the real account of them distilled from preuss and the abundant authentic sources  preuss says if readers could but remember him an almanac lies on the kings table marking for each day what specific duties the day will bring from five to six hours of sleep in summer he rises about three seldom after four in winter perhaps an hour later in his older time seven hours sleep came to be the stipulated quantity and he would sleep occasionally eight hours or even nine in certain medical predicaments not so in his younger years four am and five the set hours then summer and winter fire is lighted for him a quarter of an hour before king rises gets into his clothes stockings breeches boots he did sitting on the bed for one loves to be particular the rest in front of the fire in standing posture washing followed more compendious than his fathers used to be  letters specifically to his address a courier leaving berlin 9 pm had brought him in the dead of night these on the instant of the kings calling here a valet in the ante chamber brought in to him to be read while his hair was being done his uniform the king did not at once put on but got into a casaquin loose article of the dressinggown kind only shorter than ours of rich stuff sometimes of velvet with precious silver embroideries these casaquins were commonly skyblue which color he liked presents from his sisters and nieces letters being glanced over and hairclub done the lifeguard generaladjutant hands in the potsdam report all strangers that have entered potsdam or left it the principal item this with a berlin report which had come with the letters and what of armyreports had arrived adjutantgeneral delivering thesewere now glanced over and so by five oclock in the summer morning by six in the winter one sees in the gross what ones dayswork is to be the miscellaneous stones of it are now mostly here only mortar and walling of them to be thought of generaladjutant and his affairs are first settled on each thing a word or two which the generaladjutant always a highly confidential officer a hacke a winterfeld or the like pointedly takes down  generaladjutant gone the king in skyblue casaquin often in very faded condition steps into his writingroom walks about reading his letters more completely drinking first several glasses of water then coffee perhaps three cups with or without milk likes coffee and very strong after coffee he takes his flute steps about practising fantasying he has been heard to say speaking of music and its effects on the soul that during this fantasying he would get to considering all manner of things with no thought of what he was playing and that sometimes even the luckiest ideas about businessmatters have occurred to him while dandling with the flute sauntering so he is gradually breakfasting withal will eat intermittently small chocolate cakes and after his coffee cherries figs grapes fruits in their season very fond of fruit and has elaborate hothouses so passes the early morning  between nine and ten most of ones planwork being got through the questions of the day are settled or laid hold of for settling between nine and ten king takes to reading the excerpts i suppose of the more intricate or lengthier things of yesterday which his three cabinet raths clerk eichel and the other two have prepared for him king summons these three one after the other according to their department hands them the letters just read the excerpts now decided on and signifies in a minimum of words what the answers are to beclerk always in full dress listening with both his ears and pencil in hand may have of answers cabinetorders so called perhaps a dozen to be ready with before evening in a certain copy or finalregister book herr preusss windfall of which infra entitled kabinetsordenkopialbuch of one of the three clerks years 17461752 there are on the average ten cabinetorders daily sundays included preuss i 352 n  eichel and company dismissed king flings off his casaquin takes his regimental coat has his hair touched off with pomade with powder and is buttoned and ready in about five minutesready for parade which is at the stroke of eleven instead of later as it used to be in papas time if eleven is not yet come he will get on horseback go sweeping about oftenest with errands still at all events in the free solitude of air till paradetime do come the parole sentrysword of the day he has already given his adjutantgeneral parole which only the adjutant and commandant had known till now is formally given out and the troops go through their exercises manoeuvres under a strictness of criticism which never abates parade he by no chance ever misses says our demon friend  at the stroke of twelve continues preuss dinner is served dinner threefold that is a second table and a third only two courses dishes only eight even at the kings table eight also at the marshals or second table guests from seven to ten dinner plentiful and savory for the king had his favorites among edibles by no means caring to be splendidyearly expense of threefold dinner done accurately by contract was 1800 pounds linsenbarth we saw at the third table and how he fared the dinnerservice was of beautiful porcelain not silver still less gold except on the grandest occasions every guest eats at discretionof courseand drinks at discretion moselle or pontac kind of claret champagne and hungary are handed round on the kings signal king himself drinks bergerac or other clarets with water dinner lasts till twoif the conversation be seductive it has been known to stretch to four the kings great passion is for talk of the right kind he himself talks a great deal tippling wineandwater to the end and keeps on a level with the rising tide  with a bow from majesty dinner ends guests gently with a little saunter of talk to some of them all vanish and the king is in his own apartment again generally fluteplaying for about half an hour till eichel and the others come with their days work trayloads of cabinetorders i can fancy which are to be executed that is to be glanced through and signed signature for most part is all but there are marginalia and postscripts too in great number often of a spicy biting character which in our time are in request among the curious herr preuss who has right to speak declares that the spice of mockery has been exaggerated and that serious sense is always the aim both of document and of signer preuss had a windfall 12000 of these pieces or more in a lump in the way of gift which fell on him like mannaand led it is said to those friedrich studies extensive faithful quarryings in that vast wilderness of sliding shingle and chaotic boulders  coffee follows this despatch of eichel and consorts the day now ones own scandalous rumors prose and verse connect themselves with this particular epoch of the day which appear to be wholly lies of which presently in this afterdinner period fall the literary labors says preussa facile pen this kings only two hours of an afternoon allowed it instead of all day and the top of the morning about six or earlier even came the reader la mettrie or another came artists came learned talk at seven is concert which lasts for an hour halfpast eight is supper preuss i 344347 and with intermittencies pp 356 361 363 c to 376 abridged  demon newswriter says of the concert it is mostly of windinstruments king himself often taking part with his flute performers the best in europe he has threewhat shall we call them of male gendera counteralt and mamsell astrua an italian they are unique voices he cannot bear mediocrity it is but seldom he has any singing here to be admitted needs the most intimate favor now and then some young lord of distinction if he meet with such concert very wellbut let us now suppressing any little abhorrences hear him on another subject  dinner lasts one hour says our demon no better informed upon which the king returns to his apartment with bows it pretty often happens that he takes with him one of his young fellows these are all handsome like a picture faits a peindre and of the beautifulest faceadds he still worse informed poisonous malice mixing itself this time with the human darkness and reducing it to diabolic this demons paper abounds with similar allusions as do the more desperate sort of voltaire utterancesvie privee treating it as known fact letters to denis in occasional paroxysms as rumor of detestable nature probably true of one who is so detestable at least so formidable to a guilty sinner his guest others not to be called diabolical as herr dr busching for example speak of it as a thing credible as good as known to the wellinformed and beyond the least question there did a thriceabominable rumor of that kind run whispering audibly over all the world and gain belief from those who had appetite a most melancholy business solacing to human envyexplaining also to the dark human intellect why this king had commonly no women at his court a most melancholy portion of my rawmaterial this concerning which since one must speak of it here is what little i have to say  1 that proof of the negative in this or in any such case is by the nature of it impossible that it is indisputable friedrich did not now live with his wife nor seem to concern himself with the empire of women at all having except now and then his sisters and some foreign princess on short visit no women in his court and though a great judge of female merits graces and accomplishments seems to worship women in that remote way alone and not in any nearer which occasioned great astonishment in a world used so much to the contrary and gave rise to many conjectures among the idle of mankind what on earth or under earth can be the meaning of itand among others to the above scandalous rumor as some solacement to human malice and impertinent curiosity  2 that an opposite rumorwhich would indeed have been pretty fatal to this one but perhaps still more disgraceful in the eyes of a demon newswriterwas equally current and was much elaborated by the curious impertinent till nicolai got hold of it in herr dr zimmermanns responsible hands and conclusively knocked it on the head see zimmermannsfragmenteand nicolai patiently pounding it to powder whoever is curious on this disgusting subject  3 that for me proof in the affirmative or probable indication that way has not anywhere turned up nowhere for me in these extensive minings and siftings not the least of probable indication but contrariwise here and there rather definite indications pointing directly the opposite way for example correspondence with fredersdorfoeuvresxxvii iii 145 friedrich in his own utterances and occasional rhymes is abundantly cynical now and then rises to a kind of epic cynicism on this very matter but at no time can the painful critic call it cynicism as of other than an observer always a kind of vinegar cleanness in it except in theory cynicism of an impartial observer in a dirty element observer epically sensible when provoked to it of the brutal contemptibilities which lie in human life alongside of its big struttings and pretensions in friedrichs utterances there is that kind of cynicism undeniableand yet he had a modesty almost female in regard to his own person no servant having ever seen him in an exposed state preuss i 376 which had considerably strengthened rumor no 2 o ye poor impious longearedlongeared i will call you instead of twohorned and with only one hoof cloven among the tragical platitudes of human nature nothing so fills a considering brother mortal with sorrow and despair as this innate tendency of the common crowd in regard to its great men whensoever or almost whensoever the heavens do at long intervals vouchsafe us as their allincluding blessing anything of such practical blasphemy is it not if you reflect strangely possible that sin even now and ought to be religiously abhorred by every soul that has the least piety or nobleness act not the mutinous flunky my friend though there be great wages going in that line  4 that in these circumstances and taking into view the otherwise known qualities of this high fellowcreature the present editor does not for his own share value the rumor at a pins fee and leaves it and recommends his readers to leave it hanging by its own head in the sad subterranean regionstill probably not for a long while yet it drop to a far deeper and dolefuler region out of our way altogether  lamentable yes comments diogenes and especially so that the idle public has a hankering for such things but are there no obscene details at all then grumbles the disappointed idle public to itself something of reproach in its tone a public idleminded much depraved in every way thus too you will observe of dogs two dogs at meeting run first of all to the shameful parts of the constitution institute a strict examination more or less satisfactory in that department that once settled their interest in ulterior matters seems pretty much to die away and they are ready to part again as from a problem doneenough oh enough  practically we are getting no good of our demonand will dismiss him after a taste or two more  this demon newswriter has evidently never been to potsdam which he figures as the abode of horrid cruelty a kind of tartarus on earthwhere there is a dreadful scarcity of women for one item lamentable to ones moral feelings scarcity nothing like so great even among the soldierclasses as the demon newswriter imagines to himself nor productive of the results lamented prussian soldiers are not encouraged to marry if it will hurt the service nor do their wives march with the regiment except in such proportions as there may be sewing washing and the like womens work fairly wanted in their respective companies the potsdam first battalion i understand is hardly permitted to marry at all and in regard to lamentable results that of liebstenscheine sweetheartticketsor actual military legalizing of temporary marriages with regular privileges attached and fixed rules to be observedmight perhaps be the notablest point and the semilamentablest to a man or demon in the habit of lamenting preuss i 426 for the rest a considerably dreadful place this potsdam to the flaccid esurient and disorderly of mankindand strict as fate demon correct for once in inexorably punishing military sins  this king he says has a great deal of esprit much less of real knowledge connaissances than is pretended he excels only in the military part really excellent there has a facile expeditious pen and head understands what you say to him at the first word not taking nor wishing advice never suffering replies or remonstrances not even from his mother pretty well acquainted with works of esprit whether in prose or in verse burning very hot indeed to distinguish himself by performance of that kind but unable to reach the beautiful unless held up by somebody etaye it is said that in a splenetic moment his skeleton of an apollo squelette dapollon m de voltaire who is lean exceedingly exclaimed once some time ago when is it then that he will have done sending me his dirty linen to wash  the king is of a sharp mocking tongue withal pricking into whoever displeases him often careless of policy in that understands nothing of finance or still less of trade always looking direct towards more money which he loves much incapable of sowing as some of us do for a distant harvest treats almost all the world as slaves all his subjects are held in hard shackles rigorous for the least shortcoming where his interest is hurtnever pardons any fault which tends to inexactitude in the military service spandau very fullthough i did not myself count keeps in his pay nobody but those useful to him and capable of doing employments well true always and the instant he has no more need of them dismissing them with nothing false generally the subsidies imposed on his subjects are heavy in constant proportion to their feudal properties and their leases of domains contrats et baux and what is dreadful are exacted with the same rigor if your property gets into debtno remission by the iron grip of this king in the name of the state sell if you can find a purchaser or get confiscated altogether that is your only remedy surely a tyrant of a king  people who get nearest him will tell you that his politeness is not natural but a remnant of old habit when he had need of everybody against the persecutions of his father he respects his mother the only female for whom he has a sort of attention he esteems his wife and cannot endure her has been married nineteen years and has not yet addressed one word to her how true it was but a few days ago she handed him a letter petitioning some things of which she had the most pressing want he took the letter with that smiling polite and gracious air which he assumes at pleasure and without breaking the seal tore the letter up before her face made her a profound bow and turned his back on her was there

voltaire visit  meantime there has a fine controversy risen of mathematical philosophical and at length of very miscellaneous nature concerning that konigmaupertuis dissentience on the law of thrift wonderful controversy much occupying the socalled philosophic or scientific world especially the idler population that inhabit there upon this item of the infinitely littlewhich has in our time sunk into nothingatall and but for voltaire and the accident of his living near it would be forgotten altogetherwe must not enter into details but a few words to render voltaires share in it intelligible will be in the highest degree necessary here in brief form rough and ready are the successive stages of the business the origin and first stage of which have been known to us for some time past  september 1750 konig his wellmeant visit to berlin proving so futile had left maupertuis in the humor we sawpirouetting round his apartment in tempests of rage at such contradiction of sinners on his sublime law of thrift and fulminating permission to konig no time to read your paper of contradictions publish it in leipzig in jericho anywhere in the earth in heaven in the other place where you have the opportunity konig returning on these terms had nothing for it but to publish his paper and did publish it in the leipzigacta eruditorumfor march 1751 there it stands legible to this day and if any of the human species should again think of reading it i believe it will be found a reasonable solid and decisive paper of steadfast openly articulate by no means insolent tone considerably modifying maupertuiss law of thrift or minimum of actionfatal to the claim of its being a sublime discovery or indeed so far as true any discovery at all inacta eruditorumlipsiae 1751de universali principio aequilibrii et motusby no means uncivil to maupertuis though obliged to controvert him for examplequoe itaque de minima actionis in modificationibus modum obtinente in genere proferuntur vehementer laudo continent nempe facundum longeque pulcherrimum dynamices sublimioris principium cujus vim in difficillimis quoestionibus soepe expertus fui by way of finis to the paper there is given what proves extremely important to us an excerpt from an old letter of leibnitzs which perhaps it will be better to present here in corpore as so much turned on it afterwards konig thus winds up  i add only a word in finishing and that is that it appears mr leibnitz had a theory of action perhaps much more extensive than one would suspect at present there is a letter written by him to mr hermann an ancient mathematical sage at basel where he uses these expressions action is not what you think the consideration of time enters into it action is as the product of the mass by the space and the velocity or as the time by the vis viva i have remarked that in the modifications of motion the action becomes usually a maximum or a minimumand from this there might several propositions of great consequence be deduced it might serve to determine the curves described by bodies under attraction to one or more centres i had meant to treat of these things in the second part of my dynamique which i suppressed the reception of the first by prejudice in many quarters having disgusted me maupertuisiana no ii 22 fromacta eruditorumubi supra in maupertuisiana no iv 166 is the whole letter hanover

appeared on this business sixteen by count various type all 8vo size in my copy of which only no ii konigs appel au public and no iv 2d edition of said appel with appendix of correspondence are illuminative to read your minimum of action it would appear then is in some cases a maximum nothing can be said but that in every case it is either a maximum or minimum what a stroke for our law of thrift the at last conclusive proof of an intelligent creator as the perpetual president had fancied itsoho what is this my discovery an error and leibnitz discovered it so far as true  may 28th8th october 1751 maupertuis compressing himself what he can writes to konig very good monsieur but please inform me where is that letter of leibnitzs i have never seen or heard of it beforeand i want to make use of it myself to which konig answers henzi gave it me in copy unfortunate conspirator henzi who lost his head three years ago by sentence of the oligarch government at berne government by the two hundred of selectvestry nature very stiff arbitrary and become rife in abuses against whom had risen angry mutterings more than once and in 1749 a select plot not select enough for they discovered it in time poor excaptain henzi clerk of the saltoffice most frugal studious and quiet of men a very miracle it would appear of genius solid learning philosophy and pietynot the chief or first of the conspirators but by far the most distinguishedwas laid hold of july 2d 1749 and beheaded with another of them a day or two after much bewailed in a private way even by the better kinds of people copious account of him inadelungvii 8691he poor fellow had no end of papers and excerpts had as we know above a hundred volumes of the latter kind this and some other letters of leibnitzs among themi send you the whole letter copied faithfully from his copy the hague 26th june inmaupertuisianano iv 130 to that effect still in perfect goodhumor was konigs reply to his maupertuis  hm copy by henzi grumbles maupertuis to himselfsearch in berne then it must be there if anywhere to konig maupertuis answers nothing but sulkily resolves on having search madeand to give solemnity to the matter requests his excellency marquis de paulmy the french ambassador at berne to ask the government theregovernment having seized all henzis papers on beheading him excellency paulmy does accordingly make inquiry in the highest quarter some inquiries up and down not the least account of this or of any leibnitz letter to be had from among henzis papersthe hundred volumes seemingly exist no longeroriginal of this leibnitz piece is nowhere for eight months the highest authorities have been looking about with one knows not what vivacity or skill in searching and have found nothing whatever stage second of the business finishes in this manner  how lucky for the perpetual president had he stopped here to konig and the common contradiction of sinners he could have opposed as it was apparently his purpose to do an olympian silence pshaw whereby the small matter interesting to few would have dropped gently into dubiety into oblivion and been got well rid of but this of the great leibnitz touching on ones law of thrift and not only discovering it half a century beforehand but discovering that it was not true to leibnitz one must speakand the abstruse question is what is one to say find me the original let us be certain first that you can say that is one dear point and pretty much the only one the rest at this time as i conjecture may have been not a little abstruse to the perpetual president  and now had the perpetual president but stopped here there might still have rested a saving shadow of suspicion on konigs excerpt that it was not exact that it might be wrong in some vital pointyou never showed me the original monsieur unluckily the perpetual president did not stop one cannot well fancy him believing now or ever that konig had forged the excerpt most likely he had the fatal persuasion that these were leibnitzs words and the question what was to be said or done if the original should turn up might justly be alarming to a son of the pure sciences but at this point a new door of escape disclosed itself where is the original i sayand he rushed full speed into that galloping triumphantly feeling all safe  october 7th 1751 maupertuis summons his academy messieurs permit me to submit a case perhaps requiring your attention one of our number dissents from your presidents discovery of the law of thrift which surely he is free to do but furthermore he gives an excerpt purporting to be from leibnitz whereby it would appear that your presidents discovery sanctioned in your acts as new is not new but leibnitzs so far as it is good for anythingpossibly stolen therefore and at any rate fiftyfour years old in selfdefence i have demanded to see the original of said excerpt and the honorable member in question does not produce it what say you shame to him say they all there seem to be but few scientific members and most of them it is insinuated have pensions from the king through their perpetual presidentand determine to make a starchamber matter of it  accordingly next day october 8th secretary formey writes officially to konig produce that letter within one monthand has got his majesty to order that our prussian minister at the hague shall take charge of delivering such message and shall mark on what day thing serious you seeprussian minister at the hague delivers and dockets accordingly to konigs astonishment who is in a scene of deep trouble at this time royal highness the stadtholder suddenly dead or dying died october 22d leaving a very young heir and a very sorrowful widow and country much to think of that lies apart from the maupertuis matter which latter however is so very serious too his prussian majestys minister at berne is now charged to make new perquisition for the leibnitz original there in short within one month

extinct shadowy stygian we will not here be guilty of doing but hasten to the catastrophes that have still a memorability  konig having in fact nothing more to say about the leibnitz excerpt was in no breathless haste to obey his summons he sat almost two months before answering anything did then write however in a friendly strain to maupertuis december 10th 1751 maupertuisianano iv 132 almost on which same day as it chanced the academie after two months dignified waiting had in brief terms repeated its order on konig december 11th 1751 ib 137 to which konig makes no special answer having as good as answered the day beforebut does silently send off to switzerland to make inquiries and does write once or twice more when there is occasion for explainingalways in a clear sonorous manfully firm and respectful tone that he himself had or has no kind of reason to doubt the authenticity of the leibnitz letter that to himself and so far as he can judge to maupertuis the question of its authenticity is without special interesthe konig having thrown it in as a mere marginal illustration which decides nothing either for or against the law of thrift that he has in obedience to the academy caused search to be made in switzerland especially at basel where he judged the chance might lie but that of this particular letter nothing has come to light that he has two other leibnitz letters of indifferent tenor in the late henzis hand if these will serve in aught maupertuisianano iv 155 and ib 172192 the two letters themselvesbut what farther can he do in short konig speaks always in a clear businesslike manful tone the one person that makes a really respectful and respectable figure in this controversy of the infinitely little a man whom viewed from this quiet distance it seems almost inconceivably absurd to have suspected of forging for so small an object oh my president that dira regnandi cupido  question is however what the academy will do one member the best

your inquiry m moreau de maupertuis in a pamphlet entitled essai de cosmologie pretended that the only proof of the existence of god is the circumstance that arnrb is a minimum only proof p212 book xvi voila he asserts that in all possible cases action is a minimum what has been demonstrated false and he says he discovered this law of minimum what is not less false  m konig as well as other mathematicians wrote against this strange assertion and among other things m konig cited some sentences of a letter by leibnitz in which that great man says he has observed that in the modifications of motion the action usually becomes either a maximum or else a minimum  m moreau de maupertuis imagined that by producing this fragment it had been intended to snatch from him the glory of his pretended discoverythough leibnitz says precisely the contrary of what he advances he forced some pensioned members of the academy who are dependent on him to summon m konigas we know too well and

of scientific europe not only of plagiarism and blunder but of having abused his place to suppress free discussion and to persecute an honest man who had no crime but that of not being of his opinion several members of our academy have protested against so crying a procedure and would leave the academy were it not for fear of displeasing the king who is protector of it oeuvres de voltairelxiii 227 inmaupertuisianano xvi  king friedrichs position in the middle of all this was becoming uncomfortable of the controversy he understood or cared to understand nothing had to believe steadily that his academy must be right that konig was some loose bird envious of an eagle maupertuis sitting aloft on his high academic perch this friedrich took for the truth of the matterand could not let himself imagine that his sublime perpetual president who was usually very prudent and jovelike had been led by his truculent vanity which friedrich knew to be immense in the man though kept well out of sight into such playing of fantastic tricks before high heaven and other onlookers this view of the matter had hitherto been friedrichs nor do i know that he ever inwardly departed from itas outwardly he for certain never did standing kinglike clear always for his perpetual president till this hurricane of pamphlets blew by voltaires little piece therefore was the unwelcomest possible  this new bolt of electric fire launched upon the stormtost president from berlin itself and even from the kings house itselfby whom too clearly recognizablewhat an irritating thing unseemly in fact on voltaires part but could not be helped by a voltaire charged with electricity friedrich evidently in considerable indignation finding that public measures would but worsen the uproar took pen in hand wrote rapidly the indignant letter from an academician of berlin to an academician of paris oeuvres de fredericxv 5964 not dated datable october 1752 which piece of some length we cannot give here but will briefly describe as manifesting no real knowledge of the lawofthrift controversy but as taking the above loose view of it and as directed principally against the pretended member of our academy mischievous voltaire to wit whom it characterizes as such a manifest retailer of lies a concocter of stupid libels have you ever seen an action more malicious more dastardly more infamousand other hard terms the hardest he can find this is the privilege of anonymity on both sides of it  but imagine now a king and his voltaire doing witty discourse over their supper of the gods as on the set days is duly the case with such a consciousness burning like bude light though close veiled on the part of host and guest the friedrichvoltaire relation is evidently under sore stress of weather in those winterautumn months of 1752brown leaves splashy rains and winds moaning outwardly withal and alas the irrepressibly electric voltaire still far from having ended still only just beginning his antimaupertuis discharges has in the interim privately got his doctor akakia ready compared to which the former missile is as a popgun to a park of artillery shotted with old nails and broken glasssuch a constraint at the royal dinnertable amid wine and wit could not continue the credible account is it soon cracked asunder and after the conceivable sputterings sparklings and flashings of

indeed anything of true poetic humor in it but there is a gayety of malice a dexterity felicity inexhaustibility of laughing mockery and light banter capable of driving a perpetual president delirious

steps in on him blows him up with his own petards in a most unexampled manner not an owlery has that poor maupertuis in the struggle to be sublime often nearly successful but never once quite happened to drop from him but voltaire picks it up manipulates it reduces it to the sublimely ridiculous lodges it in the form of burning dust about the head of mon president needless to say of the comic engineer that he is unfair perversely exaggerative reiterative on the owleries of poor maupertuisit is his function to be all that clever but wrong do you say well yesand yet the ridiculous does require ridicule wise nature has silently so ordered and if ever truculent president in red wig with his absurd truculences tyrannies and perpetual struggles after the sublime did deserve to be exploded in laughter it could not have been more consummately donethough perversely always as must be owned  the hole bored through the earth for instance really one sometimes reflects on such a thing

suppressed never do to send our president pirouetting through the world in this manner with his wig on fire promise me on your honor voltaire promised but alas how could voltaire perform once more the rhadamanthine fact is voltaire as kings chamberlain was bound without any promise to forbear and rigidly suppress such an akakia against the kings perpetual president but withal let candid readers consider how difficult it was to do the absurd blusterous turkeycock who has every now and then been tyrannizing over you for twenty years here you have him filled with gunpowder so to speak and the train laid there wants but one sparkedition printed in holland edition done in berlin plenty of editions made or makable by a little surreptitious legerdemainand i never knew whether it was akakia in

flintspark will shoot him aloft scatter him as flaming ruin on all the winds and you are once and always to withhold said spark perhaps had akakia not yet been writtenbut all lies ready there one spark will do it at any momentand there are unguarded moments and the tempter must prevail  on what day akakia blazed out at berlin surreptitiously forwarded from holland or otherwise i could never

world is in conversation over maupertuis and it30000 copies sold in parisand friedrich naturally was in a towering passion at his chamberlain nothing for the chamberlain but to fly his presence to

his letter of agreement his royal book of poesies one of those twelve copies printed au donjon du chateau in happier timesand in short to go his ways as a friend not as a runaway or one dismissed but now by his late procedures at leipzig and firings out of portholes in that manner he had awakened friedrichs indignation againfriedrichs regret at allowing him to take those articles with him and produced a resolution in friedrich to have them back they are not generally articles of much moment but as marks of friendship they are now all falsities one of the articles might be of frightful importance that book of poesies thriceprivate oeuvre de poesies in which are satirical spurts affecting more than one crowned head one shudders to think what fires a spiteful voltaire might cause by publishing these this was friedrichs ideaand by no means a chimerical one as the fact proved said oeuvre being actually reprinted upon him at paris afterwards not by voltaire in the crisis of the sevenyears war to put him out with his uncle of england whom it quizzed in passages title of it isoeuvres du philosophe de sanssouciparis pretending to be potsdam 1760 1 vol 12mo at paris in january this whereupon at berlin with despatch april 9th the real edition properly castrated was sent forth under title poesies diverses 1 vol big 8vo preuss inoeuvres de fredericx preface p x see formey ii 255 under date misprinted 1763 we will have those articles back thinks friedrich that oeuvre most especially no difficulty wait for him at frankfurt as he passes home demand them of him there and has directly on those new firings through portholes at leipzig bidden fredersdorf take measures accordingly friedrich to wilhelmina 12th april 1753 oeuvresxxvii iii 227  fredersdorf did so early in april and onward had his official person waiting at frankfurt one freytag our prussian resident there very celebrated ever since vigilant in the extreme for voltaires arrivaland who did not miss that event voltaire arriving at last may 31st did with freytags hand laid gently on his sleeve at once give up what of the articles he had about himthe oeuvre unluckily not one of them and agreed to be under mild arrest parole dhonneur in the liondor hotel here till said oeuvre should come up under fredersdorfs guidance all this and what follows king friedrich after the general order given had nothing more to do with it and was gone upon his reviews  in the course of two weeks or more the oeuvre de poesie did come voltaire was impatient to go and he might perhaps have at once gone had freytag been clearly instructed so as to know the essential from the unessential here but he was notpoor subaltern freytag had to say on voltaires urgencies i will at once report to berlin if the answer be as we hope all right you are that moment at liberty this was a thing unexpected astonishing to voltaire a thing demanding patience silence in three days more with silence as turns out it would have been all beautifully overbut he was not strong in those qualities  voltaires arrest hitherto had been merely on his word of honor i promise on my honor not to go beyond the garden of this inn but he now without warning anybody privately revoked said word of honor and collini and he next morning whisked shiftily into a hackneycoach and were on the edge of being clear off to freytags terror and horror who however caught them in time and was rigorous enough now and loud enoughstreetmob gathering round the transaction voltaire very loud and freytag toothe matter taking fire here and scenes occurring which voltaire has painted in a highly flagrant manner  on the third day answer from berlin had come as expected answer as to the old score all right let him go but to punctual freytags mind here is now a new considerable item of sundries insult to his majesty to wit breaking his majestys arrest in such insolent loud mannerand freytag finds that he must write anew post is very slow and though fredersdorf answers constantly from berlin let him go let him go there have to be writings and rewritings and it is not till july 7th after a detention not of nearly three weeks as it might and would have been but of five and a day that voltaire gets off and then too at full gallop and in a very unseemly way  this is authentically the worldfamous frankfurt affairdone by fredersdorf as we say friedrich absent in silesia or in preussen even having no hand in it except the original order left with fredersdorf voltaire has used his flamingest colors on this occasion being indeed dreadfully provoked and chagrined painting the thing in a very flagrant mannerknown to all readers voltaires flagrant narrative had the round of the world to itself for a hundred years and did its share of execution against friedrich till at length recently a precise impartial hand the herr varnhagen thought of looking into the archives and has in a distinct minute and entertaining way explained the truth of it to everybodyleaving the voltaire narrative in rather sad condition varnhagen von ensevoltaire in frankfurt am mayn1753 separate as here 12mo pp 92 or inberliner kalenderfor 1846 we have little room but must give compressed from varnhagen and the other evidences a few of the characteristic points the story falls into two parts     part i fredersdorf sends instructions the oeuvre de poesie is got but  april 11th 1753 few days after that of maupertuiss cartel voltaire having set to firing through portholes again and the king being swift in his resolution on it factotum fredersdorf who has a freeflowing yet a steady and compact pen directs herr freytag our resident at frankfurtonmayn to procure from the authorities there on majestys request the necessary powers then vigilantly to look out for voltaires arrival to detain the said voltaire and if necessary arrest him till he deliver certain articles belonging to his majesty cross of merit gold key printed oeuvre de poesies and writings skripturen of his majestys in short various articlesthe specification of which is somewhat indistinct in fredersdorfs writing all this not so mathematically luminous and indisputable as in eichels it would have been freytag put questions and there passed several letters between fredersdorf and him but it was always uncomfortably hazy to freytag and he never understood or guessed that the oeuvre de poesies was the vital item and the rest formal in comparison which is justly considered to have been an unlucky circumstance as matters turned for help to himself freytag is to take counsel with one hofrath schmidt a substantial experienced burgher of frankfurt whose rathship is prussian  april 21st freytag answers that schmidt and he received his majestys allgracious orders the day before yesterday post takes eight days it would seem that they have procured the necessary powers and are now and will be diligently watchful to execute the same which one must say they in right earnest are patrolling about with lips strictly closed eyes vividly open and have a man or two privately on watch at the likely stations on the possible highwaysand so continue voltaire doing his annals of the empire and enjoying himself at gotha for weeks after left gotha 25th may clog inoeuvres de voltairexxv 192 nmuch unconscious of their patrolling  freytag is in no respect a shining diplomatistprobably some emeritus lieutenant doing his function for 30 pounds a year but does it in a practical solid manner writes with stiff brevity stiff but distinct with perfect observance of grammar both in french and german with good practical sense and faithful effort to do aright what his order is no trace of monsir of oeuvre de poeshie to be found in freytag and most or all of the ridiculous burs stuck on him by voltaire are to be pulled off again asas fibs or fictions solacing to the afflicted wit freytag is not of quick or bright intellect and unluckily just at the crisis of voltaires actual arrival both schmidt and fredersdorf are off to embden where there is grand meeting of the embden shipping company with comfortable dividends let us hopeand have left freytag to his own resources in case of emergency  thursday may 31st about eight in the evening voltaire does arrivemost prosperous journey hitherto by cassel marburg warburg and other places famous then or since

days more only wait varnhagen pp 3941 and in fact by next post as we find the opensesame did punctually come voltaire and all this big cawing rookery of miseries and rages would have at once taken wing again into the serene blue could voltaire but have had patience three days more but that was difficult for him too difficult     part ii voltaire in spite of his efforts does get away june

business walk out very gingerlyduck into a hackneycoach and attempt to escape by the mainz gate freytags spy runs breathless with the news never was a freytag in such taking terrified freytag has to throw on his coat order out three men to gallop by various routes jump into some excellencys coach kind excellency lent it which is luckily standing yoked near by and shoot with the velocity of life and death towards mainz gate voltaire whom the wellaffected porter suspecting something has rather been retarding is still there arrested in the kings nameand there is such a scene for freytag too is now raging ignited by such percussion of the terrors and speaks not like what they call a learned sergeant but like a drilled sergeant in heat of battle voltaires tongue also and collinisyour excellenz never heard such brazenfaced lies thrown on a man that i had offered for 1000 thalers to let them go that i hadin short the thing has caught fire broken into flaming chaos again  freytag to give one snatch from collinis side got into the carriage along with us and led us in this way across the mob of people to schmidts to see what was to be done with us sentries were put at the gate to keep out the mob we are led into a kind of countingroom clerk maidand manservants are about madam schmidt passes before voltaire with a disdainful air to listen to freytag recounting in the tone not of a learned sergeant what the matter is they seize our effects under violent protest worse than vain voltaire demands to have at least his snuffbox cannot do without snuff they answer it is usual to take everything  his voltaires eyes were sparkling with fury from time to time he lifted them on mine as if to interrogate me all on a sudden noticing a door half open he dashes through it and is out madam schmidt forms her squad shopmen and three maidservants and at their head rushes after what cries he cannot i be allowed toto vomit then they form circle round him till he do it call out collini who finds him bent down with his fingers in his throat attempting to vomit and is terrified mon dieu are you ill then he answered in a low voice tears in his eyes fingo fingo i pretend and collini leads him back re infecta the author of the henriade and merope what a spectacle collini pp 81 86 not for two hours had they done with their writings and arrangings our portfolios and cassette moneybox were thrown into an empty trunk what else could they be thrown intowhich was locked with a padlock and sealed with a paper voltaires arms on the one end and schmidts cipher on the other dorn freytags clerk was bidden lead us away sign of the bouc or billygoat there henceforth lion dor refusing to be concerned with us farther twelve soldiers madame denis with curtains of bayonetsand other wellknown flagrancies the 7th of july voltaire did actually go and then in an extreme hurryby his own blame again these final passages we touch only in the lump voltaires own narrative of these being so copious flamingly impressive and still known to everybody how much better for voltaire and us had nobody ever known it had it never been written had the poor hubbub no better than a chance streetriot all of it after amusing old frankfurt for a while been left to drop into the gutters forever to voltaire and various others me and my poor readers included that was the desirable thing  had there but been among ones resources a little patience and practical candor instead of all that vituperative eloquence and power of tragicomic description nay in that case this wretched streetriot hubbub need not have been at all truly m de voltaire had a talent for speech but lamentably wanted that of silencewe have now only the sad duty of pointing out the principal mendacities contained in m de voltaires worldfamous account for the other side has been heard since that and so of quitting a painful business the principal mendacitiesdeducting all that about poeshie and the like which we will define as poetic fictionare  1 that of the considerable files of soldiers almost a company of musketeers one would think stuck up round m de voltaire and party in the billygoat madame deniss bedcurtains being a screen of bayonets and the like the exact number of soldiers i cannot learn a schildwache of the townguard means one surely does not mean four for each prisoner reports the arithmetical freytag which in the extreme case would have been twelve in whole as collini gives it and next day we reduced them to two says freytag  2 that of the otherwise frightful night madame denis had the fellow dorn freytags clerk a poor hardworked frugal creature with frugal wife and family not far off insisting to sit in the ladys bedroom there emptying bottle after bottle nay at last as voltaire bethinks him after a few days threatening toplainly to excel all belief a thing not to be spoken of publicly indeed what lady could speak of it at all except in hints to an uncle of advanced yearsproved fact being that madame denis all in a flutter that first night at the billygoat had engaged dorn for a louisdor to sit in her bedroom and did actually pay him a louisdor for doing so this is very bad mendacity clearly conscious on m de voltaires part and even constructed by degrees  3 very bad also is that of the moneys stolen from him by those official people m de voltaire knows well enough how he failed to get his moneys and quitted frankfurt in a hurry here inexorably certain from the documents and testimonies on both parts is that final passage of the long firework last crackle of the rocket before it dropped perpendicular  july 6th complete opensesame having come freytag and schmidt duly invited voltaire to be present at the opening of seals his and theirs and to have his moneys and effects returned from that old trunk he speaks of but voltaire had by this time taken a higher flight july 6th voltaire was protesting before notaries about the unheardof violence done him the signal reparations due and disdained for the moment to concern himself with moneys or opening of seals seals moneys ye atrocious highwaymen  upon which they sent poor dorn with the sealed trunk in corpore to have it opened by voltaire himself collini in the billygoat next morning july 7th says he collini had just loaded two journeypistols part of the usual carriagefurniture and they lay on the table at sight of poor dorn darkening his chamberdoor voltaire the prey of various flurries and highflown vehemences snatched one of the pistols pistol without powder without flint without lock says voltaire efficient pistol just loaded testifies collinisnatched said pistol and clicking it to the cock plunged dornward with furious exclamations not quite unlikely to have shot dorn in the fleshy partshad not collini hurriedly struck up his hand mon dieu monsieur and dorn with trunk instantly vanished dorn naturally ran to a lawyer voltaire dreading trial for intended homicide instantly gathered himself and shot away self and pucelle with collini clear offleaving niece denis leaving moneys and other things to wait till tomorrow and settle as they could  after due lapse of days in the due legal manner the trunk was opened the 19 pounds of expenses 19 pounds and odd shillings not 100 pounds or more as voltaire variously gives it was accurately taken from it by schmidt and freytag to be paid where duein exact liquidation landlord of the billygoat so much hackneycoachmen riding constables sent in chase so much as per billand the rest 76 pounds 10s was punctually locked up again till voltaire should apply for it send it after him friedrich answered when inquired of send it after him but not reflects he unless there is somebody to take his receipt for itour gentleman being the man he is which case or any application from voltaire never turned up robbed by those highwaymen of prussian agents exclaimed voltaire everywhere instead of applying never applied nor ever forgot would fain have engaged collini to applyespecially when the french armies had got into frankfurtbut collini did not see his way three letters to collini on the subject januarymay 1759collinipp 208211  so that except as consolatory scoldingstock for the rest of his life voltaire got nothing of his 76 pounds 10s with jewels and snuffbox always lying ready in the trunk for him and it had i suppose at the long last to go by right of windfall to somebody or otherunless perhaps it still lie overwhelmed under dust and lumber in the garrets of the old rathhaus yonder waiting for a legal owner what became of it no man knows but that no doit of it ever went freytags or king friedrichs way is abundantly evident on the whole what an entertaining narrative is that of voltaires but what a pity he had ever written it  this was the finishing catastrophe tragical exceedingly which went loudsounding through the world and still goesthe more is the pity catastrophe due throughout to three causes first that fredersdorf not eichel wrote the order and introduced the indefinite phrase skripturen instead of sticking by the oeuvre de poesies the one essential point second that freytag was of heavy pipeclay nature third that voltaire was of impatient explosive nature and in calamities was wont not to be silent and consider but to lift up his voice having such a voice and with passionate melody appeal to the universe and do worse by way of helping himself  the poor voltaire after all ejaculates smelfungus lean of no health but melodious extremely in a shallow sense and truly very lonely old and weak in this world what an end to visit fifth began in olympus terminates in the lockup his conduct except in the jew case has nothing of bad at least of unprovokedly bad lost my teeth said he when things were at zenith thought i should never weep againnow when they are at nadir a sore blow to ones vanity in presence of assembled mankind and made still more poignant by

put down careful readers will mark and perhaps try to keep in mind wilhelminas tourings are not without interest to her friends of her voltaire acquaintanceship especially we shall hear again with voltaire friedrich himself had no farther correspondence or as good as none for four years and more what voltaire writes to him with gifts of books and the like in the tenderest regretful pathetically cooing tone enough to mollify rocks friedrich usually answers by de prades if at allin a quite discouraging manner in the end of 1757 on what hint we shall see the correspondence recommenced and did not cease again so long as they both lived  voltaire at potsdam is a failure then nothing to be made of that law is reformed embden has its shipping companies industry flourishes but as to the trismegistus of the muses coming to our hearth some eight of friedrichs years were filled by these three grand heads of effort perfect peace in all his borders and in 1753 we see how the celestial one of them has gone to wreck understand at last your majesty that there is no musesheaven possible on telluric terms and cast that notion out of your head  friedrich does cast it out more and more

conveniently riddled down to three first kingoftheromans question second englishprivateer question and then hanging curiously related to these two a third or englishfrench canada question of some importance all of them extremely important to friedrich especially that third and least expected of them  witty hanbury williams the english excellency at berlin busy intriguing little creature became distasteful there long since and they had to take him away recalled say the documents 22d january 1751 upon which no doubt he made a noise in downing street and got it appears recredentials to berlin

widespread intrigues russian german and other on hand robinson too is now home returned 1748 treaty of aix in his pocket and an excellency keith more and more famous henceforth has succeeded him in that austrian post busy people these and others now legationing in foreign parts able in their way but whose work proved to be that of spinning ropes from sand and must not detain us at this time  the errand of all these britannic excellencies is upon a notable scheme which royal george and his newcastle have devised of getting all made tight and the peace of aix doubleriveted so to speak and rendered secure against every contingencyby having archduke joseph at once elected king of the romans king of the romans straightway whereby he follows at once as kaiser should his father die and is liable to no french or other intriguing and we have taken a bond of fate that the balance cannot be canted again excellent scheme think both these heads and are stirring germany with all their might purse in hand to cooperate and do it inconceivable what trouble these prescient minds are at on this uncertain matter it was britannic majestys and newcastles main problem in this world for perhaps four years 17491753my own child as a fond noodle of newcastle used to call it though i rather think it was the other that begot the wretched object but had tired sooner of nursing it under

scathless but unfortunately friedrich whom we must not think of buying is not enthusiastic in the cause far from it the now kaiser has never yet got him according to bargain a reichsguarantee for the peace of dresden and needs endless flagitating to do it does it at length by way of furtherance to this romishking business 23d january14th may 1751 adelungvii 217 the chase of security and aggrandizement to the house of austria is by no means friedrichs chief aim this of king of the romans never could be managed by britannic majesty and his newcastle  it was very triumphant and i think

circles whichthough it was not the fact friedrichs opposition once that reichsguarantee of his own was got being mostly passive push it through the stolid element then you stolid fellows if you canawoke considerable outcry in england lively suspicion there of treasonous intentions to the cause of liberty on his prussian majestys part andcoupled with other causes that had risena great deal of illnature in very dark condition against his prussian majesty and it was not friedrichs blame chiefly or at all if indeed friedrich would have forwarded the enterprisebut he merely did not and the element was viscous stolid austria itself had wished the thing but with nothing like such enthusiasm as king georgeto whom the refusal by friedrich and fate was a bitter disappointment poor britannic majesty archduke joseph came to be king of the romans in due course right enough and long before that event almost before george had ended his vain effort to hasten it austria turned on its pivot and had clasped not england to its bosom but france thanks to that exquisite kaunitz and was in arms against england dear hanover and the cause of liberty vain to look too far aheadespecially with those fisheyes smelfungus has a note on kaunitz readable though far too irreverent of that superlative diplomatist and unjust to the real human merits he had  the struggles of britannic george to get a king

russian ports but from embden now which looks out into the atlantic and the general waters of europe and the world about which he is abundantly careful as we have seen anxious to go on good grounds in this matter and be accurately neutral and observant of the maritime laws he had in 1744 directly after coming to possession of ostfriesland instructed excellency andrie his minister in london to apply at the fountainhead and expressly ask of my lord carteret are hemp flax timber contraband no answered carteret andrie reported no and on this basis they acted satisfactorily for above a year but in

of british justice came forward with more and ever more complaints and instances to winnow the strictly true out of which from the halftrue or not provable his prussian majesty has appointed a commission fit people and under strict charges i can believe commission takes to friedrichs own knowledge a great deal of painsand it does not want for clean corn after all its winnowing plenty of facts which can be insisted on as indisputable such and such merchant ships schedules of them given in with every particular time name cargo value have been laid hold of on the ocean highway and

on which the matter turns and given such confused account in consequence that it is not well possible to gather from their report any clear and just idea of it at all verdict of the prussian

bonds and would henceforth pay no portion farther of that debt principal or interest about 250000 pounds now owing but proceed to indemnify his own people from it to the just lengthand deposit the

britannic majesty hah and embden ostfriesland is not his embden itself is mine a great deal of illnature was generated in england by this one affair of the privateers had there been no other and in dark cellars of mens minds empty and dark on this matter there arose strange caricature portraitures of friedrich and very mad notionsof friedrichs perversity astucity injustice malign and dangerous intentionsare more or less vocal in the old newspapers and distinguished correspondences of those days of which this one sample  to what height the humor of the english ran against friedrich is still curiously noticeable in a small transaction of tragic exjacobite nature which then happened and in the commentaries it awoke in their imagination cameron of lochiel who forced his way through the netherbow in edinburgh had been a notable rebel but got away to france and was safe in some military post there dr archibald cameron lochiels brother a studious contemplative gentleman bred to physic but not practising except for charity had quitted his books and attended the rebel march in a medical capacitynot from choice as he alleged but from compulsion of kindredand had been of help to various loyalists as well a foe of human pain and not of anything else whatever in fact as appears a very mild form of jacobite rebel he too got to france but had left his wife children and frugal patrimonies behind himand had to return in proper concealment more than once to look after them two visits i think two had been successfully transacted at intervals but the third in 1753 proved otherwise  march 12th 1753 wind of him being had and the slothounds uncoupled and put on his trail poor cameron was unearthed at the laird of glenbuckets and there laid hold of locked in edinburgh castlethence to the tower and to trial for high treason which went against him in spite of his fine pleadings and manful conciliatory appearances and manners executed 7th june 1753 his poor wife had twice squeezed her way into the royal levee at kensington with petition for mercyfainted the first time owing to the press and the agitation but did the second time fall on her knees before royal george and supplicatewho had to turn a deaf ear royal gentleman i hope not without pain  the truth is poor cameronthough i believe he had some vague jacobite errands withalnever would have harmed anybody in the rebel way and might with all safety have been let live but his grace of newcastle and the english generally had got the strangest notion into their head those appointments of earl marischal to paris of tyrconnel to berlin friedrichs nefarious spoiling of that salutary romishking project and now simultaneous with that his nefarious oonduct in our privateer business all this does it not prove himas the hanburys demon newswriters and wellinformed persons have taught usto be one of the worst men living and a king bent upon our ruin what is certain though now wellnigh inconceivable it was then in the upper classes and political circles universally believed that this dr cameron was properly an emissary of the king of prussias that camerons errand here was to rally the jacobite embers into new flameand that at the first clear sputter friedrich had 15000 men of his best prussianspartan troops ready to ferry over and help jacobitism to do the matter this time

concerned in meuxs porterbrewery with an eye to sale of nux vomica among all the kings that then were or that ever were king friedrich distinguished himself by the grand human virtue one of the most important for kings and for men of keeping well at homeof always minding his own affairs these were in fact the one thing he minded and he did that well he was vigilant observant all round for weathersymptoms thoroughly well informed of what his neighbors had on hand ready to interfere generally in some judicious soft way at any moment if his own countries or their interests came to be concerned certain till then to continue a speculative observer merely he had knowledge to an extent of accuracy which often surprised his neighbors but there is no instance in which he meddled where he had no businessand few i believe in which he did not meddle and to the purpose when he had  later in his reign in the time of the american war 1777 there is on the english part in regard to friedrich an equally distracted notion of the same kind brought to light again a conviction namely or moralcertainty that friedrich is about assisting the american insurgents against usand a very

the adjacent islands was ceded to the english and has ever since been possessed by them accordingly unluckily that treaty omitted to settle a line of boundary to landward or westward for their nova scotia or generally a boundary from north to south between the british colonies and the french in those parts  the treaty of aixlachapelle eager to conclude itself stipulated with great distinctness that cape breton all its guns and furnishings entire should be restored at once france extremely anxious on that point but for the rest had being in such haste flung itself altogether into the principle of statusquoante as the short way for getting through the boundary in america was vaguely defined as now to be what it had been before the war it had for many years before the war been a subject of constant altercation acadie for instance the nova scotia of the english since utrecht time the french maintained to mean only the peninsula or nook included between the ocean waters and the bay of fundy and more emphatic still on the isthmus or narrow space at northwest between said bay and the ocean or the gulf of st lawrence they had built forts stockades or i know not what on the missaquish hodie missiquash a winding difficult river northmost of the bay of fundys rivers which the french affirm to be the real limit in that quarter the sparse french colonists of the interior subjects of england are not to be conciliated by perfect toleration of religion and the like but have an invincible proclivity to join their countrymen outside and wish well to those stockades on the missiquash it must be owned too the french official people are far from scrupulous or squeamish show energy of management and are very skilful with the indians who are an important item canada is all french has its quebecs montreals a st lawrence river occupied at all the good military points and serving at once as bulwark and highway  southward and westward france in its exuberant humor claims

ploughed fields bearing crop have you it is to the good plougher not ultimately to the good cannonier that those portions of creation will belong the exuberant intention of the french is after getting back cape breton to restrict those aspiring english colonies mere ploughers and traders hardly numbering above one million to the space eastward of the alleghany mountains over which they are beginning to climb and southward of that missiquash or at farthest of the penobscot and kennebunk rivers hodie in the state of maine la gallisonniere governor of canadas despatch quebec 15th january

odd expert with the rifle far beyond them will occupy the rest of the world such is the french exuberant notion and october 1745 before signature at aixlachapelle much more before delivery of cape breton the commandant at detroit west end of lake erie had received orders to oppose peremptorily every english establishment not only thereabouts but on the ohio or its tributaries by monition first and then by force if monition do not serve  establishments of any solidity or regularity the english have not in those parts beyond the alleghanies all is desert from the canada lakes to the carolinas mere huntingground of the six nations dotted with here and there an english tradinghouse or adventurous squatters farmto whom now the french are to say home you instantly and leave the desert alone the french have distinct orders from court and energetically obey the same the english have indistinct orders from nature and do not want energy or mind to obey these confusions and collisions are manifold ubiquitous continual of which the history would be tiresome to everybody and need only be indicated here by a mark or two of the main passages  in 1749 three things had occurred worth mention first captain coram a publicspirited halfpay gentleman in london originator of the foundling hospital there had turned his attention to the fine capabilities and questionable condition of nova scotia with few inhabitants and those mostly disaffected and by many efforts now forgotten had got the government persuaded to despatch june 1749 a kind of halfpay or military colony to those parts more than 1400 persons disbanded officers soldiers and marines under colonel edward cornwallis brother of the since famous lord cornwallis coxespelhamii 113 who landed accordingly on that rough shore stockaded themselves in hardily endeavoring and enduring and next year built a town for themselves town of halifax so named from the then lord halifax president of the board of trade which stands there in more and more conspicuous manner at this day thanks to you captain coram though the ungrateful generations except dimly in coram street near your hospital have lost all memory of you as their wont is blockheads never mind them  the second thing is an ohio company has got together in virginia governor there encouraging britannic majesty giving charter march 1749 and what is still easier 500000 acres of land in those ohio regions since you are minded to colonize there in a fixed manner britannic majesty thinks the country between the monongahela and the kanahawy southern feeders of ohio will do best but is not particular ohio company we shall find chose at last as the eligible spot the topmost fork or very head of the ohiowhere monongahela river from south and alleghany river from north unite to form the ohio where stands in our day the big sooty town of pittsburg and its industries ohio company was laudably eager on this matter landsurveyor in it nay at length colonel of a regiment of 150 men raised by the ohio company was mr george washington whose family had much promoted the enterprise and who was indeed a steadygoing considerate closemouthed young gentleman who came to great distinction in the end  french governor la gallisonniere still the man getting wind of this ohio company still in embryo anticipates the birth sends a vigilant commandant thitherward with 300 men to trace and occupy the valleys of the ohio and of the st lawrence as far as detroit that officer buries plates of lead up and down the country with inscriptions signifying that from the farthest ridge whence water trickled towards the ohio the country belonged to france and nails the bourbon lilies to the foresttrees forbidding the indians all trade with the english expels the english traders from the towns of the miamis and writes to the governor of pennsylvania requesting him to prevent all farther intrusion vigilant governors these french and well supported from home duquesne the vigilant successor of la gallisonniere who is now wanted at home for still more important purposes as will appear finding the lead plates little regarded sends by and by 500 new soldiers from detroit into those ohio parts march of 100 miles or sothe french government having in this year 1750 shipped no fewer than 8000 men for their american garrisonsand where the ohio company venture on planting a stockade tears it tragically out as will be seen  the third thing worth notice in 1749 and still more in the following year and years had reference to nova scotia again one la corne a recklessly sanguinary partisan military gentleman of the trenck indigotrenck species nestles himself winter 174950 on that missiquash river head of the bay of fundy in the village of chignecto which is admittedly english ground though inhabited by french la corne compels or admits the inhabitants to swear allegiance to france again and to make themselves useful in fortifying not to say in drillingwith an eye to military work hearing of which colonel cornwallis and incipient halifax are much at a loss they in vain seek aid from the governor of massachusetts assembly to be consulted first to be convinced constitutional rightsnothing possible just at onceand can only send a party of 400 men to try and recover chignecto at any rate april 20th 1750 the 400 arrive there order la corne instantly to go bourbon flag is waving on his dikes this side the missiquash high time that he and it were gone village priest flamingly orthodox as all these priests are all picked for the business with his own hands sets fire to the church in chignecto inhabitants burn their houses and escape across the riverla corne as rearguard la corne across the missiquash declares that to a certainty he is now on french ground that he will at all hazards defend the territory here and maintain every inch of ittill regular commissioners due ever since the treaty of aix had not that romishking business been so pressing have settled what the boundary between the two countries ischignecto being ashes and the neighboring population gone cornwallis and his four hundred had to return to halifax  it was not till autumn following that chignecto could be solidly got hold of by the halifax people nor till a long time after that la corne could be dislodged from his stockades and sent packing gentlemans magazinexx 539 295 september 1750 a new expedition on chignecto found the place populous again indians french peasants seemingly soldiers of a sort who stood very fiercely behind their defences and needed a determined onrush and volley close into their noses before disappearing this was reckoned the first military bloodshed if this were really military on the french side and in november following some small british cruiser on those coasts falling in with a french brigantine from quebec evidently carrying military stores and solacements for la corne seized the same by force of battle since not otherwisethree men lost to the british five to the frenchand brought it to halifax lawful and necessary says the admiralty court sheer piracy shriek the frenchmatters breaking out into actual flashes of flame in this manner  british commissions two in number names not worth mention have at last in this year 1750 gone to paris and are holding manifold conferences with french dittoto no purpose any of them one reads the dreary tattle of the duke of newcastle upon it in the years onward just going to agree the duke hopes some difficulties but everybody french and english wanting mere justice and our and their commissioners being in such a generous spirit surely they will soon settle it his letters in coxespelhamii 407 september 1751 c they never did or could and steadily it went on worsening  that notable private assertion of the french that canada and louisiana mean all america west of the alleghanies had not yet oozed out to the english but it is gradually oozing out and that england will have to content itself with the moderate country lying east of that blue range not much above a million of you say the french and surely there is room enough east of the alleghanies we with our couple of colonies are the real americacounting it is true few settlers as yet but there shall be innumerable and in the mean while there are armydetachments blockhouses fortified posts command of the rivers of the indian nations of the waterhighways and military keys to you unintelligible and we will make it good  the exact cipher of the french guessed to be 50000 and their precise relativevalue as tillers and subduers of the soil in these two colonies of theirs as against the english thirteen would be interesting to know curious also their little bill of trouble taken in creating the continent of america in discovering it visiting surveying planting taming making habitable for manand what rhadamanthus would have said of those two documents enough the french have taken some trouble more or lessespecially in sending soldiers out of late the french to certain thousands languidly tilling hunting and adventuring and very skilful in wheedling the indian nations are actually there and they in the silence of rhadamanthus decide that merit shall not miss its wages for want of asking ours is america west of the alleghanies say the french openly before long  yours yours of all peoples answer the english and begin with lethargic effort to awake a little to that stupid foreign question important though stupid and foreign or lying far off who really owned all america probably few englishmen had ever asked themselves in their dreamiest humors nor could they now answer but that north america does not belong to the french can be doubtful to no english creature pitt chatham as we now call him is perhaps the englishman to whom of all others it is least doubtful pitt is in office at lastin some subaltern capacity paymaster of the forces for some years past in spite of majestys dislike of the outspoken manand has his eyes bent on americawhich is perhaps little as you would guess it such the main fact in that confused controversy just now  in 1753 28th august of that year goes message from the home government stand on your defence over there repel by force any foreign encroachments on british dominions holderness or robinson our old friend and directly on the heel of this november 1753 the virginia governorurged i can believe by the ohio company who are lying windbound so longdespatches mr george washington to inquire officially of the french commandant in those parts what he means then by invading the british territories while a solid peace subsists mr george had a long ride up those desert ranges and down again on the other side waters all out ground in a swash with december rains no help or direction but from wampums and wigwams mr george got to ohio head two big rivers monongahela from south alleghany from north coalescing to form a doublebig ohio for the far west and thought to himself what an admirable threelegged place might be chief post of those regionsnestegg of a diligent ohio company mr george some way down the ohio river found a strongish french fort logbarracks 200 riverboats with more building and a french commandant who cannot enter into questions of a diplomatic nature about peace and war my orders are to keep this fort and territory against all comers one must do ones orders monsieur adieu and the steadfast washington had to return without resultexcept that of the admirable threelegged place for dropping your nestegg in a commanding and defenceful way  ohio company painfully restrained so long in that operation took the hint at once despatched early in 1754 a party of some forty or thirtythree stout fellows with arms about them as well as tools go build us straightway a stockade in the place indicated you are warranted to smite down by shot or otherwise any gainsayer and furthermore directly got on foot and on the road thither a regiment of 150 men washington as colonel to it for perfecting said stockade and maintaining it against all comers  washington and his hundredandfiftywagonage provender and a piece or two of cannon all well attended tovigorously climbed the mountains got to the top 27th may 1754 and there met the thirtythree in retreat homewards stockade had been torn out six weeks ago 17th april last by overwhelming french force from the gentleman who said adieu and had the riverboats last fall and instead of our stockade they are now building a regular french fortfort duquesne they call it in honor of their governor duquesneagainst which washington and his regiment what are they washington strictly surveying girds himself up

place to arrive at that he would lose six weeks of marching by not having landed in pennsylvania instead found that his stores had been mispacked at corkthat this had happened and also thatand in short that chaos had been very considerably prevalent in this adventure of his and did still in all that now lay round it much prevail poor man very brave they say but without knowledge except of fielddrill a heart of iron but brain mostly of pipeclay quality a man severe and rigorous in regimental points contemptuous of the colonial militias that gathered to help him thricecontemptuous of the

moment  the burning of akakia and those foolish maupertuisvoltaire duellings by syringe and pistol had by no means been friedrichs one concern at the time voltaire went off precisely in those same months carnival 17521753 king friedrich had in a profoundly private manner come upon certain extensive antiprussian symptoms austrian russian saxon of a most dangerous abstruse but at length indubitable sort and is ever since prosecuting his investigation of them as a thing of life and death to him symptoms that there may well be a third silesian war ripening forward inevitable and of weightier and fiercer quality than ever so the symptoms indicate to friedrich with a fatally increasing clearness and of late he has to reflect withal if these frenchenglish troubles bring war our symptoms will be ripe as in fact they proved to be  king friedrichs investigations and decisions on this matter will be touched upon farther on but readers can take in the mean time the following small documentary piece as note of preparation the facts shadowed forth are of these years now current 17521755 though this judicial deposition to the facts is of ulterior date 1757  in the course of 1756 as will well appear farther on it became manifest to the saxon court and to all the world that somebody had been playing traitor in the dresden archives somebody especially in the foreign department copying furtively and imparting to prussia despatches of the most secret thricesecret and thricedangerous nature which lie reposited there who can have done it guesses researcher were many at length suspicion fell on one menzel a kanzellist government clerk of good social repute and superior official ability who is not himself in the foreign department at all but whose way of living or the like sign had perhaps seemed questionable in 1757 menzel and the saxon court and its businesses were all at warsaw menzel dreaming of no disturbance but prosecuting his affairs as formerlywhen one day september 24th the slothounds long scenting and tracking being now at the mark menzel and an associate of his were suddenly arrested confronted with their crimes with the proofs in readiness and next daymade a clear confession finding the matter desperate otherwise copy of which in notarial form exact and indisputable the reader shall now see as this story of friedrich and the saxon archives was very famous in the world and mythic circumstances are prevalent let us glance into it with our own eyes since there is opportunity in brief compass     extractus protocollorum in inquisitionssachenthat is to say extract of protocols in inquest contra friedrich wilhelm menzel and johann benjamin erfurth  at warsaw 25th september 1757 this day in the kings name in presence of legationsrath von saul hofrath ferbers and kriegsrath von gotze the undersigned examination of the kabinetskanzellist menzel arrested yesterday and now brought from his place of arrest to the royal palacewho admonitus de dicenda veritate made answers to the effect following  his name is friedrich wilhelm menzel age thirtyeight is a son of the late hofrath and privyreferendary menzel who formerly was in the kings service and died a few years back has been seventeen years kanzellist at the geheime cabinetscanzlei secret archive had taken the oath when he entered on his office  acknowledges some slips of paper zettel now shown to him to be his handwriting they contained news intended to be communicated to the prussian secretary benoit now residing here at dresden formerly  confesses that he has employed here as well as previously in dresden his brotherinlaw the journeyman goldsmith erfurth who was likewise arrested yesterday to convey to the prussian secretaries plessmann and benoit such pieces and despatches from the secret cabinet especially the foreign department as he menzel wanted to communicate to said prussian secretaries  confesses having received by degrees since the year 1752 from the prussian minister envoye von mahlzahn and the secretaries plessmann and benoit for such communications the sum of 3000 thalers 450 pounds in all  was led into these treasonable practices by the following circumstance he owed at that time 100 thalers on a promissory note to a certain rhenitz who then lived hielt sich auf at dresden and who pressed him much for payment as he pleaded inability to pay rhenitz hinted that he could put him into the way of getting money and accordingly at last took him to the then prussian secretary hecht at dresden by whom he was at once carried to the prussian minister von mahlzahn who gave him 100 thalers 15 pounds with the request to communicate to him now and then news from the archive of the cabinet for a length of time prisoner could not accomplish this as the said von mahlzahn wanted pieces from the foreign office and especially the correspondence with the two imperial courts of austria and russia these papers were locked in presses which prisoner could not get at moreover the court had in the mean time gone to warsaw prisoner remaining at dresden in that way many months passed without his being able to communicate anything till at last about december 1752 the secretary plessmann gave him a whole bunch of keys which were said to be sent by privycounsellor eichel of potsdam whom we know to try whether any of them would unlock the presses of the foreign department but none of them would and prisoner returned the keys pointing out however what alterations were required to fit the keyhole  and about three weeks after this plessmann provided prisoner with another set of keys among which one did unlock said presses with this key prisoner now repeatedly opened the presses and provided plessmann whenever requiredoftenest with petersburg despatches had also three years ago 1754 here in warsaw communicated vienna despatches three or four times to benoit especially on sundays and thursdays which were slack days nobody in the office about noon  the actual first of these communications did not take place till after easterfair 1753 prisoner not having till said fair received the second bunch of keys from plessmann now and then he had to communicate french despatches whenever he gave original despatches he received them back shortly after and replaced them in the presses during this present stay of the court at warsaw has communicated little to benoit except from the circulars legation newsletters when he found anything noteworthy in them also now and then the ponikau despatches ponikau being at the reichs diet in circumstances interesting to us has received one time and another several 100 thalers from benoit since the court came hither lastand so exit menzel  hereupon the second prisoner was brought inwho deposed as follows  he is named johann benjamin erfurth a goldsmith by trade age thirtytwo the prisoner menzels brotherinlaw  confesses that menzel had made use of him at dresden during one year to deliver several times sealed papers to the prussian secretary plessmann or rather mostly to plessmanns servant also that here in warsaw he has had to carry despatches to benoit and to deliver them into his own hands latterly he has delivered the despatches to certain prussian peasants who stopped at benoits and who always relieved each other and every time the one who went away directed prisoner in turn to him that arrived  he received from menzel yesterday towards noon a small sealed packet which he was to convey to the prussian peasant who had made an appointment with him at the prussian office hof here but as he was going to take it and had just got outside of the palace court a corporal took hold of him and arrested him confesses having concealed the parcel in his trouserspocket and to have denied that he had anything upon him actum ut supra  signed gotze with titles  next day september 26th menzel reexamined answers in effect following  plessmann never himself came into the archive office at dresden except the one time a time that will be notable to us when the prussians were there to take away the papers by force then plessmann was with themand we will remember the circumstance  before leaving dresden for poland last year 1756 he menzel had returned the said key to plessmann who gave him others for use here after his arrival here he returned these keys to benoit in the presence of erfurth saying they were of no use to him and that he could not get at the despatches here prisoner farther declares that it was the minister von mahlzahn who of his own accord and quite at the beginning made the proposal concerning the keys and when plessmann brought the keys he said expressly they were for the minister along with fifty thalers which he menzel received at the same time actum ut supra signed as before heldengeschichtev 677 as beylage or appendix to the kursachsen pro memoria to the reichs diet of date regensburg 31st january 1758  we could give some of the stolen pieces too but they are of abstruse tenor and would be mere enigmas to readers here enough that friedrich understands them to friedrichs intense and longcontinued scrutiny they indicate what is next to incredible but is at length fatally undeniable that the old treaty which we called of warsaw treaty for partitioning prussia is still in spite of all subsequent and superincumbent treaties to the contrary vigorously alive underground that saxon bruhl and her hungarian majesty to whom is now added czarish majesty are fixed as ever on cutting down this afflictive too aspiring king of prussia to the size of a brandenburg elector busy in these menzel documents considering how it may be done especially how the bearskin may be sharedand that in short there lies ahead inevitable seemingly and not far off a third silesian war  which punctually came true the third silesian warsince called sevenyears war that proving to be the length of itis now near breaks out has to break out august 1756 the heaviest and direst struggle friedrich ever had the greatest of all his prowesses achievements and endurances in this world and on the whole the last that was very great or that is likely to be memorable with posterity upon which accordingly we must try our utmost to leave some not untrue notion in this place and that once donecourage reader     friedrich is visible in holland to the naked eye for some minutes june 23d 1755  in 1755 it was that voltaire wrote not the first letter but the first very notable one to his royal friend after their great quarrel dated the delices near geneva 4th august 1755 in rodenbeck i 287 inoeuvres de fredericxxiii 7 not given by any of the french editors seductively repentant and oh so true so tenderroyal friend still obstinate who answers nothing or answers only through de prades yes yes we are aware and it was in the same year that friedrich first saw dalembertvoltaires successor in a sense and farther on 1st november 1755 that the earthquake of lisbon went horribly crashing through the thoughts of all mortalsthoughts of king friedrich among others whose reflections on it i apprehend are stingy snarlingly contemptuous rather than valiant and pious and need not detain us here one thing only we will mention for an accidental reason that friedrich this year made a short run to hollandand that actual momentary sight of him happens thereby to be still possible  in summer 1755 after the westcountry reviews and a short journey into ostfriesland whence to wesel on the rhinewhither friedrich had invited dalembert to meet him whom he finds un tresaimable garcon likely for the task in handfriedrich decided on a run into holland strictly incognito accompanied only by balbi engineer a genoese and one page bade his dalembert adieu and left wesel thitherward june 19th rodenbeck i 287 at amsterdam he viewed the bramkamp picturegallery the illustrious countryhouse of jew pinto at tulpenburg

thereabouts name of him de catt age twentyseven born at morges near geneva 1728had got holiday or had got errand poor good soul had decided on this same day 23d june 1755 to go to utrecht and so stept into the very boat where friedrich was he himself in a letter written long after to editor laveaux shall tell us the rest  as i could nt get into the roef cabin because it was all engaged i stayed with the other passengers in the steerage dans la barque meme and the weather being fine came up on deck after some time there stept out of the cabin a man in cinnamoncolored coat with gold buttonholes in black wig face and coat considerably dusted with spanish snuff he looked fixedly at me for a while and then said without farther preface who are you monsieur this cavalier tone from an unknown person whose exterior indicated nothing very important did not please me and i declined satisfying his curiosity he was silent but some time after he took a more courteous tone and said come in here to me monsieur you will be better here than in the steerage amid the tobaccosmoke this polite address put an end to all anger and as the singular manner of the man excited my curiosity i took advantage of his invitation we sat down and began to speak confidentially with one another  do you see the man in the garden yonder sitting smoking his pipe said he to me that man you may depend upon it is not happyi know not answered i but it seems to me until one knows a man and is completely acquainted with his situation and his way of thought one cannot possibly determine whether he is happy or unhappy  my gentleman admitted this very goodnatured and led the conversation on the dutch government he criticised itprobably to bring me to speak i did speak and gave him frankly to know that he was not perfectly instructed in the thing he was criticisingyou are right answered he one can only criticise what one is thoroughly acquainted withhe now began to speak of religion and with eloquent tongue to recount what mischief scholastic philosophy had brought upon the world then tried to prove that creation was impossible at this last point i stood out in opposition but how can one create something out of nothing said he that is not the question answered i the question is whether such a being as god can or cannot give existence to what has yet none he seemed embarrassed and added but the universe is eternalyou are in a circle said i how will you get out of iti skip over it said he laughing and then began to speak of other things  what form of government do you reckon the best inquired he among other things the monarchic if the king is just and enlightenedvery well answered he but where will you find kings of that sort and thereupon went into such a sally upon kings as could not in the least lead me to the supposition that he was one in the end he expressed pity for them that they could not know the sweets of friendship and cited on the occasion these verses his own i suppose            amitie plaisir des grandes ames           amitie que les rois ces illustres ingrats           sont assez malheureux de ne connaitre pas  i have not the honor to be acquainted with kings said i but to judge by what one has read in history of several of them i should believe monsieur that you on the whole are rightah oui oui i am right i know the gentlemen  we now got to speak of literature the stranger expressed himself with enthusiastic admiration of racine a droll incident happened during our dialogue my gentleman wanted to let down a little sashwindow and could nt manage it you dont understand that said i let me do that i tried to get it down but succeeded no better than he monsieur said he allow me to remark on my side that you upon my honor understand as little of it as ithat is true and i beg your pardon i was too rash in accusing you of want of expertnesswere you ever in germany he now asked me no but i should like to make that journey i am very curious to see the prussian states and their king of whom one hears so much and now i began to launch out on friedrichs actions but he interrupted me rapidly with the words nothing more of kings monsieur what have we to do with them we will spend the rest of our voyage on more agreeable and cheering objects and now he spoke of the best of all possible worlds and maintained that in our planet earth there was more evil than good i maintained the contrary and this dispute brought us to the end of our voyage  on quitting me he said i hope monsieur you will leave me your name i am very glad to have made your acquaintance perhaps we shall see one another again i replied as was fitting to the compliment and begged him to excuse me for contradicting him a little ascribe this i concluded to the illhumor which various little journeys i had to make in these days have given me i then told him my name and we parted laveauxhistoire de frederic2d edition strasbourg 1789 and blown now into six vols instead

whom the king liked on this interview and sent for soon after and at length got as lecteur du roi we shall hear again september 1755 sent for but de catt was ill and couldnt december 1757 got

king which is latterly in the royal archives at berlin and which might without harm or even with advantage be printed but has never yet been a very harmless de catt and we are surely obliged to him for this view of the travelling gentleman with the cinnamoncolored coat snuffy nose and black wig and his manner of talking on light external subjects while the inner man of him has weights enough pressing on it age still under fiveandforty but looks old for his years  june 23d 1755 it is in the very days while poor braddock is staggering down the alleghanies braddock fairly over the topand the fates waiting him at a fortnights distance far away on the other side of the world but it is notable enough how pitt is watching the thing and will at length get hand laid on it and get the kingship over it for above four years whereby the jenkinssear question will again this time on better terms coalesce with the silesian or partitionofprussia question and both these long controversies get definitely closed as the eternal decrees had seen good
