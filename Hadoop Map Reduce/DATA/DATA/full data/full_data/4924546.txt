felt bound to make himself some excuse for turning his back on his country in the hour of her trouble but when owen elmore sailed no one else seemed to think that he needed excuse all his friends said it was the best thing for him to do that he could have leisure and quiet over there and would be able to go on with his work  at the risk of giving a farcical effect to my narrative i am obliged to confess that the work of which elmores friends spoke was a projected history of venice so many literary americans have projected such a work that it may now fairly be regarded as a national enterprise elmore was too obscure to have been announced in the usual way by the newspapers as having this design but it was well known in his town that he was collecting materials when his professorship in the small inland college with which he was connected lapsed through the enlistment of nearly all the students the president became colonel of the college regiment and in parting with elmore while their boys waited on the campus without he had said now elmore you must go on with your history of venice go to venice and collect your materials on the spot were coming through this all right mr seward puts it at sixty days but ill give them six months to lay down their arms and we shall want you back at the end of the year dont you have any compunctions about going i know how you feel but it is perfectly right for you to keep out of it goodby they wrung each others hands for the last timethe president fell at fort donelson but now elmore followed him to the door and when he appeared there one of the boyish captains shouted three cheers for professor elmore and the president called for the tiger and led it whirling his cap round his head  elmore went back to his study sick at heart it grieved and vexed him that even these had not thought that he should go to the war and that his inward struggle on that point had been idle so far as others were concerned he had been quite earnest in the matter he had once almost volunteered as a private soldier he had consulted his doctor who sternly discouraged him he would have been truly glad of any accident that forced him into the ranks but as he used afterward to say it was not his idea of soldiership to enlist for the hospital at the distance of five hundred miles from the scene of hostilities it was absurd to enter the home guard and after all there were even at first some selfish people who went into the army and some unselfish people who kept out of it elmores bronchitis was a disorder which active service would undoubtedly have aggravated as it was he made a last effort to be of use to our government as a bearer of dispatches failing such an appointment he submitted to expatriation as he best could and in italy he fought for our cause against the english whom he found everywhere all but in arms against us  he sailed in fine with a very fair conscience i should be perfectly at ease he said to his wife as the steamer dropped smoothly down to sandy hook if i were sure that i was not glad to be getting away  you are not glad she answered  i dont know i dont know he said with the weak persistence of a man willing that his wife should persuade him against his convictions i wish that i felt certain of it  you are too sick to go to the war nobody expected you to go  i know that and i cant say that i like it as for being too sick perhaps its the part of a man to go if he dies on the way to the field it would encourage the others he added smiling faintly  she ignored the tint from voltaire in replying nonsense it would do no good at all at any rate its too late now  yes its too late now  the seasickness which shortly followed formed a diversion from his accusing thoughts each day of the voyage removed them further and with the preoccupations of his first days in europe his travel to italy and his preparations for a long sojourn in venice they had softened to a pensive sense of selfsacrifice which took a warmer or a cooler tinge according as the news from home was good or bad   ii  he lost no time in going to work in the marcian library and he early applied to the austrian authorities for leave to have transcripts made in the archives the permission was negotiated by the american consul then a young painter of the name of ferris who reported a mechanical facility on the part of the authoritiesas if he said they were used to obliging american historians of venice the foreign tyranny which cast a pathetic glamour over the romantic city had certainly not appeared to grudge such publicity as elmore wished to give her heroic memories though it was then at its most repressive period and formed a check upon the whole life of the place the tears were hardly yet dry in the despairing eyes that had seen the french fleet sail away from the lido after solferino without firing a shot in behalf of venice but lombardy the duchies the sicilies had all passed to sardinia and the pope alone represented the old order of native despotism in italy at venice the germans seemed tranquilly awaiting the change which should destroy their system with the rest and in the meantime there had occurred one of those impressive pauses as notable in the lives of nations as of men when after the occurrence of great events the forces of action and endurance seem to be gathering themselves against the stress of the future the quiet was almost consciously a truce and not a peace and this local calm had drawn into it certain elements that picturesquely and sentimentally heightened the charm of the place it was a refuge for many exiled potentates and pretenders the gondolier pointed out on the grand canal the palaces of the count of chambord the duchess of parma and the infante of spain and one met these fallen princes in the squares and streets bowing with distinct courtesy to any that chose to salute them every evening the piazza san marco was filled with the white coats of the austrian officers promenading to the exquisite military music which has ceased there forever the patrol clanked through the footways at all hours of the night and the lagoon heard the cry of the sentinel from fort to fort and from gunboat to gunboat through all this the demonstration of the patriots went on silent ceaseless implacable annulling every alien effort at gayety depopulating the theatres and desolating the ancient holidays  there was something very fine in this as a spectacle elmore said to his young wife and he had to admire the austere selfdenial of a people who would not suffer their tyrants to see them happy but they secretly owned to each other that it was fatiguing soon after coming to venice they had made some acquaintance among the italians through mr ferris and had early learned that the condition of knowing venetians was not to know austrians it was easy and natural for them to submit theoretically as americans they must respond to any impulse for freedom and certainly they could have no sympathy with such a system as that of austria by whatever was sacred in our own war upon slavery they were bound to abhor oppression in every form but it was hard to make the application of their hatred to the amiablelooking people whom they saw everywhere around them in the quality of tyrants especially when their venetian friends confessed that personally they liked the austrians besides if the whole truth must be told they found that their friendship with the italians was not always of the most penetrating sort though it had a superficial intensity that for a while gave the effect of lasting cordiality the elmores were not quite able to decide whether the pause of feeling at which they arrived was through their own defect or not much was to be laid to the difference of race religion and education but something they feared to the personal vapidity of acquaintances whose meridional liveliness made them yawn and in whose society they did not always find compensation for the sacrifices they made for it  but it is right said elmore it would be a sort of treason to associate with the austrians we owe it to the venetians to let them see that our feelings are with them  yes said his wife pensively  and it is better for us as americans abroad during this war to be retired  well we are retired said mrs elmore  yes there is no doubt of that he returned  they laughed and made what they could of chance american acquaintances at the caff√®s elmore had his history to occupy him and doubtless he could not understand how heavy the time hung upon his wifes hands they went often to the theatre and every evening they went to the piazza and ate an ice at florians this was certainly amusement and routine was so pleasant to his scholarly temperament that he enjoyed merely that he made a point of admitting his wife as much as possible into his intellectual life he read her his notes as fast as he made them and he consulted her upon the management of his theme which as his research extended he found so vast that he was forced to decide upon a much lighter treatment than he had at first intended he had resolved upon a history which should be presented in a series of biographical studies and he was so much interested in this conclusion and so charmed with the advantages of the form as they developed themselves that he began to lose the sense of social dulness and ceased to imagine it in his wife  a sort of indolence of the sensibilities in fact enabled him to endure ennui that made her frantic and he was often deeply bored without knowing it at the time or without a reasoned suffering he suffered as a child suffers simply almost ignorantly it was upon reflection that his nerves began to quiver with retroactive anguish he was also able to idealize the situation when his wife no longer even wished to do so his fancy cast a poetry about these venetian friends whose conversation displayed the occasional sparkle of ollendorffenglish on a dark ground of lagoonitalian and whose vivid smiling and gesticulation she wearied herself in hospitable efforts to outdo to his eyes their historic past clothed them with its interest and the long patience of their hope and hatred under foreign rule ennobled them while to hers they were too often only tiresome visitors whose powers of silence and of eloquence were alike to be dreaded it did not console her as it did her husband to reflect that they probably bored the italians as much in their turn when a young man very sympathetic for literature and the americans spent an evening as it seemed to her in crying nothing but per b√°cco she owned that she liked better his oppressor who once came by chance in the figure of a young lieutenant and who unbuckled his wife as he called his sword and putting her in a corner sat up on a chair in the middle of the room and sang like a bird and then told ghoststories the songs were out of heine and they reminded her of her girlish enthusiasm for german elmore was troubled at the lieutenants visit and feared it would cost them all their italian friends but she said boldly that she did not care and she never even tried to believe that the life they saw in venice was comparable to that of their little college town at home with its teas and picnics and simple easy social gayeties there she had been a power in her way she had entertained and had helped to make some matches but the venetians ate nothing and as for young people they never saw each other but by stealth and their matches were made by their parents on a moneybasis she could not adapt herself to this foreign life it puzzled her and her husbands conformity seemed to estrange them as far as it went it took away her spirit and she grew listless and dull even the history began to lose its interest in her eyes she doubted if the annals of such a people as she saw about her could ever be popular  there were other things to make them melancholy in their exile the war at home was going badly where it was going at all the letters now never spoke of any term to it they expressed rather the dogged patience of the time when it seemed as if there could be no end and indicated that the country had settled into shape about it and was pushing forward its other affairs as if the war did not exist mrs elmore felt that the america which she had left had ceased to be the letters were almost less a pleasure than a pain but she always tore them open and read them with eager unhappiness there were miserable intervals of days and even weeks when no letters came and when the reuter telegrams in the gazette of venice dribbled their vitriolic news of northern disaster through a few words or lines and galignanis long columns were filled with the hostile exultation and prophecy of the london press   iii  they had passed eighteen months of this sort of life in venice when one day a letter dropped into it which sent a thousand ripples over its stagnant surface mrs elmore read it first to herself with gasps and cries of pleasure and astonishment which did not divert her husband from the perusal of some notes he had made the day before and had brought to the breakfasttable with the intention of amusing her when she flattened it out over his notes and exacted his attention he turned an unwilling and lacklustre eye upon it then he looked up at her  did you expect she would come he asked in illmasked dismay  i dont suppose they had any idea of it at first when sue wrote me that lily had been studying too hard and had to be taken out of school i said that i wished she could come over and pay us a visit but i dont believe they dreamed of letting hersue says sotill the mortons coming seemed too good a chance to be lost i am so glad of it owen you know how much they have always done for me and here is a chance now to pay a little of it back  what in the world shall we do with her he asked  do everything why owen she urged with pathetic recognition of his coldness she is susy stevenss own sister  oh yesyes he admitted  and it was susy who brought us together  why of course  and oughtnt you to be glad of the opportunity  i am gladvery glad  it will be a relief to you instead of a care shes such a bright intelligent girl that we can both sympathize with your work and you wont have to go round with me all the time and i can matronize her myself  i see i see elmore replied with scarcely abated seriousness perhaps if she is coming here for her health she wont need much matronizing  oh pshaw shell be well enough for that shes overdone a little at school i shall take good care of her i can tell you and i shall make her have a real good time its quite flattering of susy to trust her to us so far away and i shall write and tell her we both think so  yes said elmore its a fearful responsibility  there are instances of the persistence of husbands in certain moods or points of view on which even wheedling has no effect the wise woman perceives that in these cases she must trust entirely to the softening influences of time and as much as possible she changes the subject or if this is impossible she may hope something from presenting a still worse aspect of the affair mrs elmore said in lifting the letter from the table if she sailed the 3d in the city of timbuctoo she will be at queenstown on the 12th or 13th and we shall have a letter from her by wednesday saying when she will be at genoa thats as far as the mortons can bring her and theres where we must meet her  meet her in genoa how  by going there for her replied mrs elmore as if this were the simplest thing in the world i have never seen genoa  elmore now tacitly abandoned himself to his fate his wife continued i neednt take anything merely run on and right back  when must we go he asked  i dont know yet but we shall have a letter tomorrow dont worry on my account owen her coming wont be a bit of care to me it will give me something to do and to think about and it will be a pleasure all the time to know that its for susy stevens and i shall like the companionship  elmore looked at his wife in surprise for it had not occurred to him before that with his company she could desire any other companionship he desired none but hers and when he was about his work he often thought of her he supposed that at these moments she thought of him and found society as he did in such thoughts but he was not a jealous or exacting man and he said nothing his treatment of the approaching visit from susy stevenss sister had not been enthusiastic but a spark had kindled his imagination and it burned warmer and brighter as the days went by he found a charm in the thought of having this fresh young life here in his charge and of teaching the girl to live into the great and beautiful history of the city there was still much of the schoolmaster in him and he intended to make her sojourn an education to her and as a literary man he hoped for novel effects from her mind upon material which he was above all trying to set in a new light before himself  when the time had arrived for them to go and meet miss mayhew at genoa he was more than reconciled to the necessity but at the last moment mrs elmore had one of her old attacks what these attacks were i find myself unable to specify but as every lady has an old attack of some kind i may safely leave their precise nature to conjecture it is enough that they were of a nervous character that they were accompanied with headache and that they prostrated her for several days during their continuance she required the active sympathy and constant presence of her husband whose devotion was then exemplary and brought up long arrears of indebtedness in that way  well what shall we do he asked as he sank into a chair beside the lounge on which mrs elmore lay her eyes closed and a slice of lemon placed on each of her throbbing temples with the effect of a new sort of blinders shall i go alone for her  she gave his hand the kind of convulsive clutch that signified impossible for you to leave me  he reflected the mortons will be pushing on to leghorn and somebody must meet her how would it do for mr hoskins to go  mrs elmore responded with a clutch tantamount to horrors how could you think of such a thing  well then he said the only thing we can do is to send a valet de place for her we can send old cazzi hes the incarnation of respectability five francs a day and his expenses will buy all the virtues of him shell come as safely with him as with me  mrs elmore had applied a vividly thoughtful pressure to her husbands hand she now released it in token of assent and he rose  but dont be gone long she whispered  on his way to the caff√® which cazzi frequented elmore fell in with the consul  by this time a change had taken place in the consular office mr ferris some months before had suddenly thrown up his charge and gone home and after the customary interval of shipchandler the california sculptor hoskins had arrived out with his commission in his pocket and had set up his allegorical figure of the pacific slope in the room where ferris had painted his too metaphysical conception of a venetian priest mrs elmore had never liked ferris she thought him cynical and opinionated and she believed that he had not behaved quite well towards a young american ladya miss vervain who had stayed awhile in venice with her mother she was glad to have him go but she could not admire mr hoskins who however goodhearted was too hopelessly western he had had part of one foot shot away in the nine months service and walked with a limp that did him honor and he knew as much of a consuls business as any of the authors or artists with whom it is the tradition to fill that office at venice besides he was at least a fellowamerican and elmore could not forbear telling him the trouble he was in a young girl coming from their town in america as far as genoa with friends and expecting to be met there by the elmores with whom she was to pass some months mrs elmore utterly prostrated by one of her old attacks and he unable to leave her or to take her with him to genoa the friends with whom miss mayhew travelled unable to bring her to venice she of course unable to come alone the case deepened and darkened in elmores view as he unfolded it  why cried the consul sympathetically if i could leave my post id go  oh thank you cried elmore eagerly remembering his wife i couldnt think of letting you  look here said the consul taking an official letter with the seal broken from his pocket this is the first time i couldnt have left my post without distinct advantage to the public interests since ive been here but with this letter from turin telling me to be on the lookout for the alabama i couldnt go to genoa even to meet a young lady the austrians have never recognized the rebels as belligerents if she enters the port of venice all ive got to do is to require the deposit of her papers with me and then i should like to see her get out again i should like to capture her of course i dont mean miss mayhew said the consul recognizing the double sense in which his language could be taken  it would be a great thing for you said elmorea great thing  yes it would set me up in my own eyes and stop that infernal clatter inside about going over and taking a hand again  yes elmore assented with a twinge of the old shame i didnt know you had it too  if i could capture the alabama i could afford to let the other fellows fight it out  i congratulate you with all my heart said elmore sadly and he walked in silence beside the consul  well said the latter with a laugh at elmores pensive rapture im as much obliged to you as if i had captured her ill go up to the piazza with you and see cazzi  the affair was easily arranged cazzi was made to feel by the consuls intervention that the shield of american sovereignty had been extended over the young girl whom he was to escort from genoa and two days later he arrived with her mrs elmores attack now was passing off and she was well enough to receive miss mayhew halfrecumbent on the sofa where she had been prone till her arrival it was pretty to see her fond greeting of the girl and her joy in her presence as they sat down for the first long talk and elmore realized even in his dreamy withdrawal how much the bright active spirit of his wife had suffered merely in the restriction of her english now it was not only english they spoke but that american variety of the language of which i hope we shall grow less and less ashamed and not only this but their parlance was characterized by local turns and accents which all came welcomely back to mrs elmore together with those still more intimate inflections which belonged to her own particular circle of friends in the little town of patmos n y lily mayhew was of course not of her own set being five or six years younger but women more easily than men ignore the disparities of age between themselves and their juniors and in susy stevenss absence it seemed a sort of tribute to her to establish her sister in the affection which mrs elmore had so long cherished their friendship had been of such a thoroughly trusted sort on both sides that mrs stevens the memorably brilliant sue mayhew in her girlish days had felt perfectly free to act upon mrs elmores invitation to let lily come out to her and here the child was as much at home as if she had just walked into mrs elmores parlor out of her sisters house in patmos   iv  they briefly dispatched the facts relating to miss mayhews voyage and her journey to genoa and came as quickly as they could to all those things which mrs elmore was thirsting to learn about the town and its people is it much changed i suppose it is she sighed the war changes everything  oh you dont notice the war much said miss mayhew but patmos is gayperfectly delightful weve got one of the camps there now and such times as the girls have with the officers we have lots of fun getting up things for the sanitary hops on the paradeground at the camp and going out to see the prisonersyou never saw such a place  the prisoners murmured mrs elmore  why yes cried lily with a gay laugh didnt you know that we had a prisoncamp too some of the southerners look real nice i pitied them she added with unabated gayety  your sister wrote to me said mrs elmore but i couldnt realize it i suppose and so i forgot it  yes pursued lily and frank halseys in command you would never know by the way he walks that he had a cork leg of course he cant dance though poor fellow hes pale and hes perfectly fascinating sos dick burton with his empty sleeve hes one of the recruiting officers and theres nobody so popular with the girls you cant think how funny it is professor elmore to see the old college buildings used for barracks dick says its much livelier than it was when he was a student there  i suppose it must be dreamily assented the professor does he find plenty of volunteers  well you know the young girl explained that the old style of volunteering is all over  no i didnt know it  yes its the bounties now that they rely upon and they do say that it will come to the draft very soon now some of the young men have gone to canada but everybody despises them oh mrs elmore i should think youd be so glad to have the professor off here and honorably out of the way  im dishonorably out of the way i can never forgive myself for not going to the war said elmore  why how ridiculous cried lily nobody feels that way about it now as dick burton says weve come down to business i tell you when you see arms and legs off in every direction and women going about in black you dont feel that its such a romantic thing any more there are mighty few engagements now mrs elmore when a regiment sets off no presentation of revolvers in the town hall and some of the widows have got married again and that i dont think is right but what can they do poor things you remember tom friars widow mrs elmore  tom friars widow is tom friar dead  why of course one of the first i think it was balls bluff well shes married but she married his cousin and as dick burton says that isnt so bad isnt it awful mrs clapps losing all her boysall five of them it does seem to bear too hard on some families and then when you see every one of those six armstrongs going through without a scratch  i suppose said elmore that business is at a standstill the streets must look rather dreary  business at a standstill exclaimed lily what has sue been writing you all this time why there never was such prosperity in patmos before everybody is making money and people that you wouldnt hardly speak to a year ago are giving parties and inviting the old college families you ought to see the residences and business blocks going up all over the place i dont suppose you would know patmos now you remember george fenton mrs elmore  mr haskells clerk  yes well hes made a fortune out of an army contract and hes going to marrythe engagement came out just before i leftbella stearns  at these words mrs elmore sat uprightthe only posture in which the fact could be imagined lily  oh i can tell you these are gay times in america triumphed the young girl she now put her hand to her mouth and hid a yawn  youre sleepy said mrs elmore well you know the way to your room youll find everything ready there and i shall let you go alone you shall commence being at home at once  yes i am sleepy assented lily and she promptly said her goodnights and vanished though a keener eye than elmores might have seen that her promptness had a coloror say lightof hesitation in it  but he only walked up and down the room after she was gone in unheedful distress gay times in america good heavens is the child utterly heartless celia or is she merely obtuse  she certainly isnt at all like sue sighed mrs elmore who had not had time to formulate lilys defence but shes excited now and a little off her balance shell be different tomorrow besides all america seems changed and the people with it we shouldnt have noticed it if we had stayed there but we feel it after this absence  i never realized it before as i did from her babble the letters have told us the same thing but they were like the histories of other times camps prisoners barracks mutilation widowhood death sudden gains social upheavalsit is the old hideous story of war come true of our day and country its terrible  she will miss the excitement said mrs elmore i dont know exactly what we shall do with her of course she cant expect the attentions shes been used to in patmos with those young men  elmore stopped and stared at his wife what do you mean celia  we dont go into society at all and she doesnt speak italian how shall we amuse her  well upon my word i dont know that were obliged to provide her amusement let her amuse herself let her take up some branch of study or ofofresearch and get something besides fun into her head if possible he spoke boldly but his wifes question had unnerved him for he had a soft heart and liked people about him to be happy we can show her the objects of interest and there are the theatres he added  yes that is true said mrs elmore we can both go about with her i will just peep in at her now and see if she has everything she wants she rose from her sofa and went to lilys room whence she did not return for nearly three quarters of an hour by this time elmore had got out his notes and in their transcription and classification had fallen into forgetfulness of his troubles his wife closed the door behind her and said in a low voice little above a whisper as she sank very quietly into a chair well it has all come out owen  what has all come out he asked looking up stupidly  i knew that she had something on her mind by the way she acted and you saw her give me that look as she went out  nono i didnt what look was it she looked sleepy  she looked terribly terribly excited and as if she would like to say something to me that was the reason i said i would let her go to her room alone  oh  of course she would have felt awfully if i had gone straight off with her so i waited it may never come to anything in the world and i dont suppose it will but its quite enough to account for everything you saw in her  i didnt see anything in herthat was the difficulty but what is itwhat is it celia you know how i hate these delays  why im not sure that i need tell you owen and yet i suppose i had better it will be safer said mrs elmore nursing her mystery to the last enjoying it for its own sake and dreading it for its effect upon her husband i suppose you will think your troubles are beginning pretty early she suggested  is it a trouble  well i dont know that it is if it comes to the very worst i dare say that every one wouldnt call it a trouble  elmore threw himself back in his chair in an attitude of endurance what would the worst be  why its no use even to discuss that for its perfectly absurd to suppose that it could ever come to that but the case added mrs elmore perceiving that further delay was only further suffering for her husband and that any fact would now probably fall far short of his apprehensions is simply this and i dont know that it amounts to anything but at peschiera just before the train started she looked out of the window and saw a splendid officer walking up and down and smoking and before she could draw back he must have seen her for he threw away his cigar instantly and got into the same compartment he talked awhile in german with an old gentleman who was there and then he spoke in italian with cazzi and afterwards when he heard her speaking english with cazzi he joined in i dont know how he came to join in at first and she doesnt either but it seems that he knew some english and he began speaking he was very tall and handsome and distinguishedlooking and a perfect gentleman in his manners and she says that she saw cazzi looking rather queer but he didnt say anything and so she kept on talking she told him at once that she was an american and that she was coming here to stay with friends and as he was very curious about america she told him all she could think of it did her good to talk about home for she had been feeling a little blue at being so far away from everybody now i dont see any harm in it do you owen  it isnt according to the custom here but we neednt care for that of course it was imprudent  of course mrs elmore admitted the officer was very polite and when he found that she was from america it turned out that he was a great sympathizer with the north and that he had a brother in our army dont you think that was nice  probably some mere soldier of fortune with no heart in the cause said elmore  and very likely he has no brother there as i told lily he told her he was coming to padua but when they reached padua he came right on to venice that shows you couldnt place any dependence upon what he said he said he expected to be put under arrest for it but he didnt carehe was coming do you believe theyll put him under arrest  i dont knowi dont know said elmore in a voice of grief and apprehension which might well have seemed anxiety for the officers liberty  i told her it was one of his jokes he was very funny and kept her laughing the whole way with his broken english and his witty little remarks she says hes just dying to go to america who do you suppose it can be owen  how should i know weve no acquaintance among the austrians groaned elmore  thats what i told lily shes no idea of the state of things here and she was quite horrified but she says he was a perfect gentleman in everything he belongs to the engineer corpsthats one of the highest branches of the service he told herand he gave her his card  gave her his card  mrs elmore had it in the hand which she had been keeping in her pocket and she now suddenly produced it and elmore read the name and address of ernst von ehrhardt captain of the royalimperial engineers peschiera she says she knows he wanted hers but she didnt offer to give it to him and he didnt ask her where she was going or anything  he knew that he could get her address from cazzi for ten soldi as soon as her back was turned said elmore cynically what then  why he saidand this is the only really bold thing he did dothat he must see her again and that he should stay over a day in venice in hopes of meeting her at the theatre or somewhere  its a piece of highhanded impudence cried elmore now celia you see what these people are do you wonder that the italians hate them  youve often said they only hate their system  the austrians are part of their system he thinks he can take any liberty with us because he is an austrian officer lily must not stir out of the house tomorrow  she will be too tired to do so said mrs elmore  and if he molests us further i will appeal to the consul elmore began to walk up and down the room again  well i dont know whether you could call it molesting exactly suggested mrs elmore  what do you mean celia do you suppose that shesheencouraged this officer  owen it was all in the simplicity and innocence of her heart  well then that she wishes to see him again  certainly not but thats no reason why we should be rude about it  rude about it how is simply avoiding him rudeness is proposing to protect ourselves from his impertinence rudeness  no and if you cant see the matter for yourself owen i dont know how any one is to make you  why celia one would think that you approved of this mans behaviorthat you wished her to meet him again you understand what the consequences would be if we received this officer you know how all the venetians would drop us and we should have no acquaintances here outside of the army  who has asked you to receive him owen and as for the italians dropping us that doesnt frighten me but what could he do if he did meet her again she neednt look at him she says he is very intelligent and that he has read a great many english books though he doesnt speak it very well and that he knows more about the war than she does but of course she wont go out tomorrow all that i hate is that we should seem to be frightened into staying at home  she neednt stay in on his account you said she would be too tired to go out  i see by the scattering way you talk owen that your mind isnt on the subject and that youre anxious to get back to your work i wont keep you  celia celia be fair now cried elmore you know very well that im only too deeply interested in this matter and that im not likely to get back to my work tonight at least what is it you wish me to do  mrs elmore considered a while i dont wish you to do anything she returned placably of course youre perfectly right in not choosing to let an acquaintance begun in that way go any further we shouldnt at home and we shant here but i dont wish you to think that lily has been imprudent under the circumstances she doesnt know that it was anything out of the way but she happened to do the best that any one could of course it was very exciting and very romantic girls like such things and theres no reason they shouldnt we must manage added mrs elmore so that she shall see that we appreciate her conduct and trust in her entirely i wouldnt do anything to wound her pride or selfconfidence i would rather send her out alone tomorrow  of course said elmore  and if i were with her when she met him i believe i should leave it entirely to her how to behave  well said elmore youre not likely to be put to the test hell hardly force his way into the house and she isnt going out  no said mrs elmore she added after a silence im trying to think whether ive ever seen him in venice hes here often but there are so many tall officers with fair complexions and english beards i should like to know how he looks she said he was very aristocraticlooking  yes its a fine type said elmore theyre all nobles i believe  but after all theyre no better looking than our boys who come up out of nothing  ours are americans said elmore  and they are the best husbands as i told lily  elmore looked at his wife as she turned dreamily to leave the room but since the conversation had taken this impersonal turn he would not say anything to change its complexion a conjecture vaguely taking shape in his mind resolved itself to nothing again and left him with only the ache of something unascertained   v  in the morning lily came to breakfast as blooming as a rose the sense of her simple fresh wholesome loveliness might have pierced even the indifference of a man to whom there was but one pretty woman in the world and who had lived since their marriage as if his wife had absorbed her whole sex into herself this deep unconscious constancy was a noble trait in him but it is not so rare in men as women would have us believe for elmore miss mayhew merely pervaded the place in her finer way as the flowers on the table did as the sweet butter the new eggs and the mornings french bread did he looked at her with a perfectly serene ignorance of her piquant face her beautiful eyes and abundant hair and her trim straight figure but his wife exulted in every particular of her charm and was as generously glad of it as if it were her own as women are when they are sure that the charm of others has no designs the ladies twittered and laughed together and as he was a man without small talk he soon dropped out of the conversation into a reverie from which he found himself presently extracted by a question from his wife  we had better go in a gondola hadnt we owen she seemed to be as she put this trying to look something into him he on his part tried his best to make out her meaning but failed  he simply asked where are you going out  yes lily has some shopping she must do i think we can get it at pazientis in san polo  again she tried to pierce him with her meaning it seemed to him a sudden advance from the position she had taken the night before in regard to miss mayhews not going out but he could not understand his wifes look and he feared to misinterpret if he opposed her going he decided that she wished him for some reason to oppose the gondola so he said i think youd better walk if lily isnt too tired  oh im not tired at all she cried  i can go with you in that direction on my way to the library he added  well that will be very nice said mrs elmore discontinuing her look and leaving her husband with an uneasy sense of wantonly assumed responsibility  she can step into the frari a moment and see those tombs he said i think it will amuse her  lily broke into a laugh is that the way you amuse yourselves in venice she asked and mrs elmore hastened to reassure her  thats the way mr elmore amuses himself you know his history makes every bit of the past fascinating to him  oh yes that history everybody is looking out for that said lily  is it possible said elmore with a pensive sarcasm in which an agreeable sense of flattery lurked that people still remember me and my history  yes indeed cried miss mayhew frank halsey was talking about it the night before i left he couldnt seem to understand why i should be coming to you at venice because he said it was a history of florence you were writing it isnt is it you must be getting pretty near the end of it professor elmore  im getting pretty near the beginning said elmore sadly  it must be hard writing histories theyre so awfully hard to read said lily innocently does it interest you she asked with unaffected compassion  yes he said far more than it will ever interest anybody else  oh i dont believe that she cried sweetly seizing the occasion to get in a little compliment  mrs elmore sat silent while things were thus going against miss mayhew and perhaps she was then meditating the stroke by which she restored the balance to her own favor as soon as she saw her husband alone after breakfast well owen she said youve done it now  done what he demanded  oh nothing perhaps she answered while she got on her things for the walk with unusual gayety and with the consciousness of unknown guilt depressing him he followed the ladies upon their errand subdued distraught but gradually forgetting his sin as he forgot everything but his history his wife hated to see him so miserable and whispered at the shopdoor where they parted dont be troubled owen i didnt mean anything  by what  oh if youve forgotten never mind she cried and she and miss mayhew disappeared within  it was two hours later when he next saw them after he had turned over the book he wished to see and had found the passage which would enable him to go on with his work for the rest of the day at home he was fitting his key into the housedoor when he happened to look up the little street toward the bridge that led into it and there defined against the sky on the level of the bridge he saw mrs elmore and miss mayhew receiving the adieux of a distinguishedlooking man in the austrian uniform the officer had brought his heels together in the conventional manner and with his cap in his right hand while his left rested on the hilt of his sword and pressed it down he was bowing from the hips once twice and he was gone  the ladies came down the calle with rapid steps and flushed faces and elmore let them in his wife whispered as she brushed by his elbow i want to speak with you instantly owen well now she added when they were alone in their own room and she had shut the door what do you say now  what do i say now celia retorted elmore with just indignation it seems to me that it is for you to say somethingor nothing  why you brought it on us  elmore merely glanced at his wife and did not speak for this passed all force of language  didnt you see me looking at you when i spoke of going out in a gondola at breakfast  yes  what did you suppose i meant  i didnt know  when i was trying to make you understand that if we took a gondola we could go and come without being seen lily had to do her shopping but if you chose to run off on some interpretation of your own was i to blame i should like to know no indeed you wont get me to admit it owen  elmore continued inarticulate but he made a low miserable sibillation between his set teeth  such presumption such perfect audacity i never saw in my life cried mrs elmore fleetly changing the subject in her own mind and leaving her husband to follow her as he could it was outrageous her words were strong but she did not really look affronted and it is hard to tell what sort of liberty it is that affronts a woman it seems to depend a great deal upon the person who takes the liberty  that was the man i suppose said elmore quietly  yes owen answered his wife with beautiful candor it was seeing that he remained unaffected by her display of this virtue she added dont you think he was very handsome  i couldnt judge at such a distance  well he is perfectly splendid and i dont want you to think he was disrespectful at all he wasnt he was everything that was delicate and deferential  did you ask him to walk home with you  mrs elmore remained speechless for some moments then she drew a long breath and said firmly if you wont interrupt me with gratuitous insults owen i will tell you all about it and then perhaps you will be ready to do me justice i ask nothing more she waited for his contrition but proceeded without it in a somewhat meeker strain lily couldnt get her things at pazientis and we had to go to the merceria for them then of course the nearest way home was through st marks square i made lily go on the florian side so as to avoid the officers who were sitting at the quadri and we had got through the square and past san mo√Øs√® as far as the stadt gratz i had never thought of how the officers frequented the stadt gratz but there we met a most magnificent creature and i had just said what a splendid officer when she gave a sort of stop and he gave a sort of stop and bowed very low and she whispered its my officer i didnt dream of his joining us and i dont think he did at first but after he took a second look at lily it really seemed as if he couldnt help it he asked if he might join us and i didnt say anything  didnt say anything  no how could i refuse in so many words and i was frightened and confused any way he asked if we were going to the music in the giardini pubblici and i said no that miss mayhew was not going into society in venice but was merely here for her health thats all there is of it now do you blame me owen  no  do you blame her  no  well i dont see how he was to blame  the transaction was a little irregular but it was highly creditable to all parties concerned  mrs elmore grew still meeker under this irony indignation and censure she would have known how to meet but his quiet perplexed her she did not know what might not be coming lily scarcely spoke to him she pursued and i was very cold i spoke to him in german  is german a particularly repellent tongue  no but i was determined he should get no hold upon us he was very polite and very respectful as i said but i didnt give him an atom of encouragement i saw that he was dying to be asked to call but i parted from him very stiffly  is it possible  owen what is there so wrong about it all hes clearly fascinated with her and as the matter stood he had no hope of seeing her or speaking with her except on the street perhaps he didnt know it was wrongor didnt realize it  i dare say  what else could the poor fellow have done there he was he had stayed over a day and laid himself open to arrest on the bare chanceone in a hundredof seeing lily and when he did see her what was he to do  obviously to join her and walk home with her  you are too bad owen suppose it had been one of our own poor boys he looked like an american  he didnt behave like one one of our own poor boys as you call them would have been as far as possible from thrusting himself upon you he would have had too much reverence for you too much selfrespect too much pride  what has pride to do with such things my dear i think he acted very naturally he acted upon impulse im sure youre always crying out against the restraints and conventionalities between young people over here and now when a european does do a simple unaffected thing  elmore made a gesture of impatience this fellow has presumed upon your being americanson your ignorance of the customs hereto take a liberty that he would not have dreamed of taking with italian or german ladies he has shown himself no gentleman  now there you are very much mistaken owen thats what i thought when lily first told me about his speaking to her in the cars and i was very much prejudiced against him but when i saw him today i must say that i felt that i had been wrong he is a gentleman buthe is desperate  oh indeed  yes said mrs elmore shrinking a little under her husbands sarcastic tone why owen she pleaded cant you see anything romantic in it  i see nothing but a vulgar impertinence in it i see it from his standpoint as an adventure to be bragged of and laughed over at the messtable and the caff√® im going to put a stop to it  mrs elmore looked daunted and a little bewildered well owen she said i put the affair entirely in your hands  elmore never could decide upon just what theory his wife had acted he had to rest upon the fact already known to him of her perfect truth and conscientiousness and his perception that even in a good woman the passion for manoeuvring and intrigue may approach the point at which men commit forgery he now saw her quelled and submissive but he was by no means sure that she looked at the affair as he did or that she voluntarily acquiesced  all that i ask is that you wont do anything that youll regret afterward and as for putting a stop to it i fancy its put a stop to already hes going back to peschiera this afternoon and thatll probably be the last of him  very well said elmore if that is the last of him i ask nothing better i certainly have no wish to take any steps in the matter  but he went out of the house very unhappy and greatly perplexed he thought at first of going to the stadt gratz where captain ehrhardt was probably staying for the tap of vienna beer peculiar to that hostelry and of inquiring him out and requesting him to discontinue his attentions but this course upon reflection was less highhanded than comported with his present mood and he turned aside to seek advice of his consul he found mr hoskins in the best humor for backing his quarrel he had just received a second dispatch from turin stating that the rumor of the approaching visit of the alabama was unfounded and he was thus left with a force of unexpended belligerence on his hands which he was glad to contribute to the defence of mr elmores family from the pursuit of this austrian officer  this is a very simple affair mr elmorehe usually said elmore but in his haughty frame of mind he naturally threw something more of state into their intercoursea very simple affair fortunately all that i have to do is to call on the military governor and state the facts of the case and this fellow will get his orders quietly and definitively this war has sapped our influence in europetheres no doubt of it but i think its a pity if an american family living in this city cant be safe from molestation and if it cant i want to know the reason why  this language was very acceptable to elmore and he thanked the consul at the same time he felt his own resentment moderated and he said im willing to let the matter rest if he goes away this afternoon  oh of course hoskins assented if he clears out thats the end of it ill look in tomorrow and see how youre getting along  dontdont give them the impression that iveprofited by your kindness suggested elmore at parting  you havent yet i only hope you may have the chance  thank you i dont think i do  elmore took a long walk and returned home tranquillized and clarified as to the situation since it could be terminated without difficulty and without scandal in the way hoskins had explained he was not unwilling to see a certain poetry in it he could not repress a degree of sympathy with the bold young fellow who had overstepped the conventional proprieties in the ardor of a romantic impulse and he could see how this very boldness while it had a terror would have a charm for a young girl there was no necessity except for the purpose of holding mrs elmore in check to look at it in an ugly light perhaps the officer had inferred from lilys innocent frankness of manner that this sort of approach was permissible with americans and was not amusing himself with the adventure but was in love in earnest elmore could allow himself this view of a case which he had so completely in his own hands and he was sensible of a sort of pleasure in the novel responsibility thrown upon him few men at his age were called upon to stand in the place of a parent to a young girl to intervene in her affairs and to decide who was and who was not a proper person to pretend to her acquaintance  feeling so secure in his right he rebelled against the restraint he had proposed to himself and at dinner he invited the ladies to go to the opera with him he chose to show himself in public with them and to check any impression that they were without due protection as usual the pit was full of officers and between the acts they all rose as usual and faced the boxes which they perused through their lorgnettes till the bell rang for the curtain to rise but mrs elmore having touched his arm to attract his notice instructed him by a slow turning of her head that captain ehrhardt was not there after that he undoubtedly breathed freer and in the relaxation from his sense of bravado he enjoyed the last acts of the opera more than the first miss mayhew showed no disappointment and she bore herself with so much grace and dignity and yet so evidently impressed every one with her beauty that he was proud of having her in charge he began himself to see that she was pretty   vi  the next day was sunday and in going to church they missed a call from hoskins whom elmore felt bound to visit the following morning on his way to the library and inform of his belief that the enemy had quitted venice and that the whole affair was probably at an end he was strengthened in this opinion by mrs elmores fear that she might have been colder than she supposed she hoped that she had not hurt the poor young fellows feelings and now that he was gone and safely out of the way elmore hoped so too  on his return from the library his wife met him with an air of mystery before which his heart sank owen she said lily has a letter  not bad news from home celia  no a letter which she wishes to show you it has just come as i dont wish to influence you i would rather not be present mrs elmore slipped out of the room and miss mayhew glided gravely in holding an open note in her hand and looking into elmores eyes with a certain unfathomable candor of which she had the secret  here she said is a letter which i think you ought to see at once professor elmore and she gave him the note with an air of unconcern which he afterward recalled without being able to determine whether it was real indifference or only the calm resulting from the transfer of the whole responsibility to him she stood looking at him while he read                                     miss        in this evening i am just arrived from venise 4 hours afterwards i      have had the fortune to see you and to speake with youand to      favorite me of your gentil acquaintanceship at railaway i never      forgeet the moments i have seen you your pretty and nice figure      had attached my heard so much that i deserted in the hopiness to      see you at venise and i was so lukely to speak with you cut too      short and in the possibility to understand all i wished to go      also in this sonday to venise but i am sory that i cannot      beaucause i must feeled now the consequences of the desertation      pray miss to agree the assurance of my lov and perhaps i will be      so lukely to receive a notice from you miss if i can hop a little      hapiness sympathie tr√®s humble                                                       e von ehrhardt   elmore was not destitute of the national sense of humor but he read this letter not only without amusement in its english but with intense bitterness and renewed alarm it appeared to him that the willingness of the ladies to put the affair in his hands had not strongly manifested itself till it had quite passed their own control and had become a most embarrassing difficultywhen in fact it was no longer a merit in them to confide it to him in the resentment of that moment his suspicions even accused his wife of desiring from idle curiosity and sentiment the accidental meeting which had resulted in this fresh aggression  why did you show me this letter he asked harshly  mrs elmore told me to do so lily answered  did you wish me to see it  i dont suppose i wished you to see it i thought you ought to see it  elmore felt himself relenting a little what do you want done about it he asked more gently  that is what i wished you to tell me replied the girl  i cant tell you what you wish me to do but i can tell you this miss mayhew this mans behavior is totally irregular he would not think of writing to an italian or german girl in this way if he desired totopay attention to her he would write to her father  yes thats what mrs elmore said she said she supposed he must think it was the american way  mrs elmore began her husband but he arrested himself there and said very well i want to know what i am to do i want your full and explicit authority before i act we will dismiss the fact of irregularity we will suppose that it is fit and becoming for a gentleman who has twice met a young lady by accidentor once by accident and once by his own insistenceto write to her do you wish to continue the correspondence  no  elmore looked into the eyes which dwelt full upon him and though they were clear as the windows of heaven he hesitated i must do what you say no matter what you mean you know  i mean what i say  perhaps he suggested you would prefer to return him this letter with a few lines on your card  no i should like him to know that i have shown it to you i should think it a liberty for an american to write to me in that way after such a short acquaintance and i dont see why i should tolerate it from a foreigner though i suppose their customs are different  then you wish me to write to him  yes  and make an end of the matter once for all  yes  very well then elmore sat down at once and wrote        sirmiss mayhew has handed me your note of yesterday and begs me      to express her very great surprise that you should have ventured to      address her she desires me also to add that you will consider at      an end whatever acquaintance you suppose yourself to have formed      with her                                    your obedient servant                                                         owen elmore   he handed the note to lily yes that will do she said in a low steady voice she drew a deep breath and laying the letter softly down went out of the room into mrs elmores  elmore had not had time to kindle his sealingwax when his wife appeared swiftly upon the scene  i want to see what you have written owen she said  dont talk to me celia he replied thrusting the wax into the candlelight you have put this affair entirely in my hands and lily approves of what i have written i am sick of the thing and i dont want any more talk about it  i must see it said mrs elmore with finality and possessed herself of the note she ran it through and then flung it on the table and dropped into a chair while the tears started to her eyes what a cold cutting merciless letter she cried  i hope he will think so said elmore gathering it up from the table and sealing it securely in its envelope  youre not going to send it exclaimed his wife  yes i am  i didnt suppose you could be so heartless  very well then i wont send it said elmore i put the affair in your hands what are you going to do about it  nonsense  on the contrary im perfectly serious i dont see why you shouldnt manage the business the gentleman is an acquaintance of yours i dont know him elmore rose and put his hands in his pockets what do you intend to do do you like this clandestine sort of thing to go on i dare say the fellow only wishes to amuse himself by a flirtation with a pretty american but the question is whether you wish him to do so im willing to lay his conduct to a misunderstanding of our customs and to suppose that he thinks this is the way americans do i take the matter at its best he speaks to lily on the train without an introduction he joins you in your walk without invitation he writes to her without leave and proposes to get up a correspondence it is all perfectly right and proper and will appear so to lilys friends when they hear of it but im curious to know how youre going to manage the sequel do you wish the affair to go on and how long do you wish it to go on  you know very well that i dont wish it to go on  then you wish it broken off  of course i do  how  i think there is such a thing as acting kindly and considerately i dont see anything in captain ehrhardts conduct that calls for savage treatment said mrs elmore  you would like to have him stopped but stopped gradually well i dont wish to be savage either and i will act upon any suggestion of yours i want lilys people to feel that we managed not only wisely but humanely in checking a man who was resolved to force his acquaintance upon her  mrs elmore thought a long while then she said why of course owen youre right about it there is no other way there couldnt be any kindness in checking him gradually but i wish she added sorrowfully that he had not been such a complete goose and then we could have done something with him  i am obliged to him for the perfection which you regret my dear if he had been less complete he would have been much harder to manage  well said mrs elmore rising i shall always say that he meant well but send the letter  her husband did not wait for a second bidding he carried it himself to the general postoffice that there might be no mistake and no delay about it and a man who believed that he had a feeling and tender heart experienced a barbarous joy in the infliction of this pitiless snub i do not say that it would not have been different if he had trusted at all in the sincerity of captain ehrhardts passion but he was glad to discredit it a misgiving to the other effect would have complicated the matter but now he was perfectly free to disembarrass himself of a trouble which had so seriously threatened his peace he was responsible to miss mayhews family and mrs elmore herself could not say then or afterward that there was any other way open to him i will not contend that his motives were wholly unselfish no doubt a sense of personal annoyance of offended decorum of wounded respectability qualified the zeal for miss mayhews good which prompted him he was still a young and inexperienced man confronted with a strange perplexity he did the best he could and i suppose it was the best that could be done at any rate he had no regrets and he went cheerfully about the work of interesting miss mayhew in the monuments and memories of the city  since the decisive blow had been struck the ladies seemed to share his relief the pursuit of captain ehrhardt while it flattered might well have alarmed and the loss of a not unpleasant excitement was made good by a sense of perfect security whatever repining miss mayhew indulged was secret or confided solely to mrs elmore to elmore himself she appeared in better spirits than at first or at least in a more equable frame of mind to be sure he did not notice very particularly he took her to the places and told her the things that she ought to be interested in and he conceived a better opinion of her mind from the quick intelligence with which she entered into his own feelings in regard to them though he never could see any evidence of the overstudy for which she had been taken from school he made her like mrs elmore the partner of his historical researches he read his notes to both of them now and when his wife was prevented from accompanying him he went with lily alone to visit the scenes of such events as his researches concerned and to fill his mind with the local color which he believed would give life and character to his studies of the past they also went often to the theatre and though lily could not understand the plays she professed to be entertained and she had a grateful appreciation of all his efforts in her behalf that amply repaid him he grew fond of her society he took a childish pleasure in having people in the streets turn and glance at the handsome girl by his side of whose beauty and stylishness he became aware through the admiration looked over the shoulders of the austrians and openly spoken by the italian populace it did not occur to him that she might not enjoy the growth of their acquaintance in equal degree that she fatigued herself with the appreciation of the memorable and the beautiful and that she found these long rambles rather dull he was a man of little conversation and unless mrs elmore was of the company miss mayhew pursued his pleasures for the most part in silence one evening at the end of the week his wife asked why do you always take lily through the piazza on the side farthest from where the officers sit are you afraid of her meeting captain ehrhardt  oh no i consider the ehrhardt business settled but you know the italians never walk on the officers side  you are not an italian what do you gain by flattering them up i should think you might suppose a young girl had some curiosity  i do and i do everything i can to gratify her curiosity i went to san pietro di castello today to show her where the brides of venice were stolen  the oldest and dirtiest part of the city what could the child care for the brides of venice now be reasonable owen  its a romantic story i thought girls liked such thingsabout getting married  and thats the reason you took her yesterday to show her the bucentaur that the doges wedded the adriatic in well what was your idea in going with her to the cemetery of san michele  i thought she would be interested i had never been there before myself and i thought it would be a good opportunity to verify a passage i was at work on we always show people the cemetery at home  that was considerate and why did you go to canarregio on wednesday  i wished her to see the statue of sior antonio rioba you know it was the venetian pasquino in the revolution of 48  charming  and the campo di giustizia where the executions used to take place  delightful  andandthe house of tintoretto faltered elmore  delicious she cares so much for tintoretto and youve been with her to the jewish buryingground at the lido and the spanish synagogue in the ghetto and the fishmarket at the rialto and youve shown her the house of othello and the house of desdemona and the prisons in the ducal palace and three nights youve taken us to the piazza as soon as the austrian band stopped playing and all the interesting promenading was over and those stuffy old italians began to come to the caff√®s well i can tell you thats no way to amuse a young girl we must do something for her or she will die she has come here from a country where girls have always had the best time in the world and where the times are livelier now than they ever were with all this excitement of the war going on and here she is dropped down in the midst of this absolute deadness no calls no picnics no parties no dancesnothing we must do something for her  shall we give her a ball asked elmore looking round the pretty little apartment  theres nothing going on among the italians but you might get us invited to the german casino  i dare say but i will not do that  then we could go to the luogotenenza to the receptions mr hoskins could call with us and they would send us cards  that would make us simply odious to the venetians and our house would be thronged with officers what ive seen of them doesnt make me particularly anxious for the honor of their further acquaintance  well i dont ask you to do any of these things said mrs elmore who had in fact mentioned them with the intention of insisting upon an abated claim but i think you might go and dine at one of the hotelsat the danieliinstead of that italian restaurant and then lily could see somebody at the table dh√¥te and not simply perish of despair  ii didnt suppose it was so bad as that said elmore  why of course she hasnt said anythingshes far too wellbred for that but i can tell from my own feelings how she must suffer i have you owen she said tenderly but lily has nobody she has gone through this ehrhardt business so well that i think we ought to do all we can to divert her mind  well now celia you see the difficulty of our positionthe nature of the responsibility we have assumed how are we possibly here in venice to divert the mind of a young lady fresh from the parties and picnics of patmos  we can go and dine at the danieli replied mrs elmore  very well let us go then but she will learn no italian there she will hear nothing but english from the travellers and bad french from the waiters while at our restaurant  pshaw cried mrs elmore what does lily care for italian im sure i never want to hear another word of it  at this desperate admission elmore quite gave way he went to the danieli the next morning and arranged to begin dining there that day there is no denying that miss mayhew showed an enthusiasm in prospect of the change that even the sight of the pillar to which foscarini was hanged head downwards for treason to the republic had not evoked she made herself look very pretty and she was visibly an impression at the table dh√¥te when she sat down there elmore had found places opposite an elderly lady and quite a young gentleman of english speech but of not very english effect otherwise who bowed to lily in acknowledgment of some former meeting the old lady said so youve reached venice at last im very pleased for your sake as if at some point of the progress thither she had been privy to anxieties of lily about arriving at her destination and in fact they had been in the same hotels at marseilles and genoa the young gentleman said nothing but he looked at lily throughout the dinner and seemed to take his eyes from her only when she glanced at him then he dropped his gaze to his neglected plate and blushed when they left the table he made haste to join the elmores in the readingroom where he contrived with creditable skill to get lily apart from them for the examination of an illustrated newspaper at which neither of them looked they remained chatting and laughing over it in entire irrelevancy till the elderly lady rose and said herbert herbert i am ready to go now upon which he did not seem at all so but went submissively  who are those people lily asked mrs elmore as they walked towards florians for their afterdinner coffee the austrian band was playing in the centre of the piazza and the tall blond german officers promenaded back and forth with dark hungarian women who looked each like a princess of her race the lights glittered upon them and on the brilliant groups spread fanwise out into the piazza before the caff√®s the scene seemed to shake and waver in the splendor like something painted  oh their name is andersen or something like that and theyre from helgoland or some such place i saw them first in paris but we didnt speak till we got to marseilles thats his aunt theyre english subjects someway and hes got an appointment in the civil servicei think he called itin india and he doesnt want to go and i told him he ought to go to america thats what i tell all these europeans  its the best advice for them said mrs elmore  they dont seem in any great haste to act upon it laughed miss mayhew who was the redfaced young man that seemed to know you and stared so  thats an english artist who is staying here he has a curious nameroseblack and he is the most impudent and pushing man in the world i wouldnt introduce him because i saw he was just dying for it  miss mayhew laughed as she laughed at everything not because she was amused but because she was happy this childlike gayety of heart was great part of her charm  elmore had quieted his scruples as a good venetian by coming inside of the caff√® while the band played instead of sitting outside with the bad patriots but he put the ladies next the window and so they were not altogether sacrificed to his sympathy with the dimostrazione   vii  the next morning elmore was called from his bedat no very early hour it must be owned but at least before a nine oclock breakfastto see a gentleman who was waiting in the parlor he dressed hurriedly with a thousand exciting speculations in his mind and found mr roseblack looking from the balcony window you have a pleasant position here he said easily as he turned about to meet elmores look of indignant demand ive come to ask all about our friends the andersens  i dont know anything about them answered elmore i never saw them before  a√∂h said the painter elmore had not invited him to sit down but now he dropped into a chair with the air of asking elmore to explain himself the young lady of your party seemed to know them how uncommonly pretty all your american young girls are but im told they fade very soon i should like to make up a picnic party with you all for the lido  thank you replied elmore stiffly miss mayhew has seen the lido  a√∂h thats her name its a pretty name he looked through the open door into the diningroom where the table was set for breakfast with the usual watergoblet at each plate i see you have beer for breakfast theres nothing so nice you know would youwould you mind giving me a glahs  through an undefined sense of the duties of hospitality elmore was surprised by this impudence into sending out to the next caff√® for a pitcher of beer roseblack poured himself out one glass and another till he had emptied the pitcher conversing affably meanwhile with his silent host  why didnt you turn him out of doors demanded mrs elmore as soon as the painters departure allowed her to slip from the closed door behind which she had been imprisoned in her room  i did everything but that replied her husband whom this interview had saddened more than it had angered  you sent out for beer for him  i didnt know but it might make him sick really the thing is incredible i think the man is cracked  he is an englishman and he thinks he can take any kind of liberty with us because we are americans  that seems to be the prevalent impression among all the european nationalities said elmore lets drop him for the present and try to be more brutal in the future  mrs elmore so far from dropping him turned to lily who entered at that moment and recounted the extraordinary adventure of the morning which scarcely needed the embellishment of her fancy it was not really a gallon of beer but a quart that mr roseblack had drunk she enlarged upon previous aggressions of his and said finally that they had to thank mr ferris for his acquaintance  ferris couldnt help himself said elmore he apologized to me afterward the man got him into a corner but he warned us about him as soon he could and roseblack would have made our acquaintance any way i believe hes crazy  i dont see how that helps the matter  it helps to explain it concluded elmore with a sigh we cant refer everything to our being american lambs and his being a ravening european wolf  of course he came round to find out about lily said mrs elmore the andersens were a mere blind  oh mrs elmore cried lily in deprecation  the bell jangled that is the postman said mrs elmore  there was a homeletter for lily and one from lilys sister enclosed to mrs elmore the ladies rent them open and lost themselves in the crosswritten pages and neither of them saw the dismay with which elmore looked at the handwriting of the envelope addressed to him his wife vaguely knew that he had a letter and meant to ask him for it as soon as she should have finished her own when she glanced at him again he was staring at the smiling face of miss mayhew as she read her letter with the wild regard of one who sees another in mortal peril and can do nothing to avert the coming doom but must dumbly await the catastrophe  what is it owen asked his wife in a low voice  he started from his trance and struggled to answer quietly ive a letter here which i suppose id better show to you first  they rose and went into the next room miss mayhew following them with a bright absent look and then dropping her eyes again to her letter  elmore put the note he had received into his wifes hands without a word        sirmy position permitted me to take a woman i am a soldier but      i am an engineeroperateous and i can exercise wherever my      profession in the civil life i have seen miss mayhew and i have      great sympathie for she i think i will be lukely with her if miss      mayhew would be of the same intention of me       if you believe sir that my open and realy proposition will not      offendere miss mayhew pray to handed to her this note pray sir to      excuse me the liberty to fatigue you and to go over with silence      if you would be of another intention                               your obedient servant                                                 e von ehrhardt   mrs elmore folded the letter carefully up and returned it to her husband if he had perhaps dreaded some triumphant outburst from her he ought to have been content with the thoroughly daunted look which she lifted to his and the silence in which she suffered him to do justice to the writer  this is the letter of a gentleman celia he said  yes she responded faintly  it puts another complexion on the affair entirely  yes why did he wait a whole week she added  it is a serious matter with him he had a right to take time for thinking it over elmore looked at the date of the peschiera postmark and then at that of venice on the back of the envelope no he wrote at once this has been kept in the venetian office and probably read there by the authorities  his wife did not heed the conjecture he began all wrong she grieved why couldnt he have behaved sensibly  we must look at it from another point of view now replied elmore he has repaired his error by this letter  no no he hasnt  the question is now what to do about the changed situation this is an offer of marriage it comes in the proper way its a very sincere and manly letter the man has counted the whole cost hes ready to leave the army and go to america if she says so hes in love how can she refuse him  perhaps she isnt in love with him said mrs elmore  oh thats true i hadnt thought of that then its very simple  but i dont know that she isnt murmured mrs elmore  well ask her  how could she tell  how could she tell  yes do you suppose a child like that can know her own mind in an instant  i should think she could  well she couldnt she liked the excitementthe romanticality of it but she doesnt know any more than you or i whether she cares for him i dont suppose marriage with anybody has ever seriously entered her head yet  it will have to do so now said elmore firmly theres no help for it  i think the american plan is much better pouted mrs elmore its horrid to know that a mans in love with you and wants to marry you from the very start of course it makes you hate him  i dare say the american plan is better in this as in most other things but we cant discuss abstractions celia we must come down to business what are we to do  i dont know  we must submit the question to her  to that innocent unsuspecting little thing never cried mrs elmore  then we must decide it as he seems to expect we may without reference to her said her husband  no that wont do let me think mrs elmore thought to so little purpose that she left the word to her husband again  you see we must lay the matter before her  couldntcouldnt we let him come to see us awhile couldnt we explain our ways to him and allow him to pay her attentions without letting her know about this letter  im afraid he wouldnt understandthat we couldnt make it clear to him said elmore if we invited him to the house he would consider it as an acceptance he wants a categorical answer and he has a right to it it would be no kindness to a man with his ideas to take him on probation he has behaved honorably and were bound to consider him  oh i dont think hes done anything so very great said mrs elmore with that disposition we all have to disparage those who put us in difficulties  hes done everything he could do said elmore shall i speak to miss mayhew  no you had better let me sighed his wife i suppose we must but i think its horrid everything could have gone on so nicely if he hadnt been so impatient from the beginning of course she wont have him now she will be scared and that will be the end of it  i think you ought to be just to him celia i cant help feeling for him he has thrown himself upon our mercy and he has a claim to right and thoughtful treatment  she wont have anything to do with him youll see  i shall be very glad of that elmore began  why should you be glad of it demanded his wife  he laughed i think i can safely leave his case in your hands dont go to the other extreme if she married a german he would let her black his bootslike that general in munich  who is talking of marriage retorted mrs elmore  captain ehrhardt and i thats what it comes to and it cant come to anything else i like his courage in writing english and its wonderful how he hammers his meaning into it lukely isnt bad is it and my position permitted me to take a womani suppose he means that he has money enough to marry onis delicious upon my word i have a good deal of sympathie for he  for shame owen its wicked to make fun of his english  my dear i respect him for writing in english the whole letter is touchingly brave and fine confound him i wish i had never heard of him what does he come bothering across my path for  oh dont feel that way about it owen cried his wife its cruel  i dont i wish to treat him in the most generous manner after all it isnt his fault but you must allow celia that its very annoying and extremely perplexing we cant make up miss mayhews mind for her even if we found out that she liked him it would be only the beginning of our troubles weve no right to give her away in marriage or let her involve her affections here but be judicious celia  its easy enough to say that  ill be back in an hour said elmore im going to the square we mustnt lose time  as he passed out through the breakfastroom lily was sitting by the window with her letter in her lap and a happy smile on her lips when he came back she happened to be seated in the same place she still had a letter in her lap but she was smiling no longer her face was turned from him as he entered and he imagined a wistful droop in that corner of her mouth which showed on her profile  but she rose very promptly and with a heightened color said i am sorry to trouble you to answer another letter for me professor elmore i manage my correspondence at home myself but here it seems to be different  it neednt be different here lily said elmore kindly you can answer all the letters you receive in just the way you like we dont doubt your discretion in the least we will abide by any decision of yours on any point that concerns yourself  thank you replied the girl but in this case i think you had better write she kept slipping ehrhardts letter up and down between her thumb and finger against the palm of her left hand and delayed giving it to him as if she wished him to say something first  i suppose you and celia have talked the matter over  yes  and i hope you have determined upon the course you are going to take quite uninfluenced  oh quite so  i feel bound to tell you said elmore that this gentleman has now done everything that we could expect of him and has fully atoned for any error he committed in making your acquaintance  yes i understand that mrs elmore thought he might have written because he saw he had gone too far and couldnt think of any other way out of it  that occurred to me too though i didnt mention it but were bound to take the letter on its face and thats open and honorable have you made up your mind  yes  do you wish for delay there is no reason for haste  theres no reason for delay either said the girl yet she did not give up the letter or show any signs of intending to terminate the interview if i had had more experience i should know how to act better but i must do the best i can without the experience i think that even in a case like this we should try to do right dont you  yes above all other cases said elmore with a laugh  she flushed in recognition of her absurdity i mean that we oughtnt to let our feelings carry us away i saw so many girls carried away by their feelings when the first regiments went off that i got a horror of it i think its wicked it deceives both and then you dont know how to break the engagement afterward  youre quite right lily said elmore with a rising respect for the girl  professor elmore can you believe that with all the attentions ive had ive never seriously thought of getting married as the end of it all she asked looking him freely in the eyes  i cant understand itno man could i supposebut i do believe it mrs elmore has often told me the same thing  and thisletteritmeans marriage  that and nothing else the man who wrote it would consider himself cruelly wronged if you accepted his attentions without the distinct purpose of marrying him  she drew a deep breath i shall have to ask you to write a refusal for me but still she did not give him the letter  have you made up your mind to that  i cant make up my mind to anything else  elmore walked unhappily back and forth across the room i have seen something of international marriages since ive been in europe he said sometimes they succeed but generally theyre wretched failures the barriers of different race language education religiontheyre terrible barriers its very hard for a man and woman to understand each other at the best with these differences added its almost a hopeless case  yes thats what mrs elmore said  and suppose you were married to an austrian officer stationed in italy you would have no society outside of the garrison every other human creature that looked at you would hate you and if you were ordered to some of those half barbaric principalitiesmoldavia or wallachia or into hungary or bohemiaeverywhere your husband would be an instrument for the suppression of an alien or disaffected population what a fate for an american girl  if he were good said the girl replying in the abstract she neednt care  if he were good you neednt care no and he might leave the austrian service and go with you to america as he hints what could he do there he might get an appointment in our army though thats not so easy now or he might go to patmos and live upon your friends till he found something to do in civil life  lily began a laugh why professor elmore i dont want to marry him what in the world are you arguing with me for  perhaps to convince myself i feel that i oughtnt to let these considerations weigh as a feather in the balance if you are at allat allahem excuse meattached to him that of course outweighs everything else  but im not cried the girl how could i be ive only met him twice it would be perfectly ridiculous i know im not i ought to know that if i know anything  years afterward it occurred to elmore when he awoke one night and his mind without any reason flew back to this period in venice that she might have been referring the point to him for decision but now it only seemed to him that she was adding force to her denial and he observed nothing hysterical in the little laugh she gave  well then we cant have it over too soon ill write now if you will give me his letter  she put it behind her professor elmore she said i am not going to have you think that he ever behaved in the least presumingly and whatever you think of me i must tell you that i suppose i talked very freely with himjust as freely as i should with an american i didnt know any better he was very interesting and i was homesick and so glad to see any one who could speak english i suppose i was a goose but i felt very far away from all my friends and i was grateful for his kindness even if he had never written this last letter i should always have said that he was a true gentleman  well  that is all i cant have him treated as if he were an adventurer  you want him dismissed  yes  a man cant distinguish as to the terms of a dismissal theyre always insolentmore insolent than ever if you try to make them kindly i should merely make this as short and sharp as possible  yes she said breathlessly as if the idea affected her respiration  but i will show it to you and i wont send it without your approval  thank you but i shall not want to see it id rather not she was going out of the room  will you leave me his letter you can have it again  she turned red in giving it him i forgot why its written to you anyway she cried with a laugh and put the letter on the table  the two doors opened and closed one excluded lily and the other admitted mrs elmore  owen i approve of all you said except that about the form of the refusal i will read what you say i intend that it shall be made kindly  very well ill copy a letter of yours or write from your dictation  no you write it and ill criticise it  oh you talk as if i were eager to write the letter cant you imagine its being a very painful thing to me he demanded  it didnt seem to be so before  why the situation wasnt the same before he wrote this letter  i dont see how he was as much in earnest then as he is now and you had no pity for him  oh my goodness cried elmore desperately dont you see the difference he hadnt given any proof before  oh proof proof you men are always wanting proof what better proof could he have given than the way he followed her about proof indeed i suppose youd like to have lily prove that she doesnt care for him  yes said elmore sadly i should like very much to have her prove it  well you wont get her to what makes you think she does  i dont do you  no answered mrs elmore reluctantly  celia celia you will drive me mad if you go on in this way the girl has told me over and over that she wishes him dismissed why do you think she doesnt  i dont who hinted such a thing but i dont want you to enjoy doing it  enjoy it so you think i enjoy it what do you suppose im made of perhaps you think i enjoyed catechizing the child about her feelings toward him perhaps you think i enjoy the whole confounded affair well i give it up i will let it go if i cant have your full and hearty support ill let it go ill do nothing about it  he threw ehrhardts letter on the table and went and sat down by the window his wife took the letter up and read it over why you see he asks you to pass it over in silence if you dont consent  does he asked elmore i hadnt noticed that  perhaps youd better read some of your letters owen before you answer them  really i had forgotten i had forgotten that the letter was written to me at all i thought it was to lily and she had got to thinking so too well then i wont do anything about it he drew a breath of relief  perhaps suggested his wife he asked that so as to leave himself some hope if he should happen to meet her again  and we dont wish him to have any hope  mrs elmore was silent  celia cried her husband indignantly i cant have you playing fast and loose with me in this matter  i suppose i may have time to think she retorted  yes if you will tell me what you do think but that i must know its a thing too vital in its consequences for me to act without your full concurrence i wont take another step in it till i know just how far you have gone with me if i may judge of what this mans influence upon lily would be by the fact that he has brought us to the verge of the only real quarrel weve ever had  whos quarrelling owen asked mrs elmore meekly im not  well well we wont dispute about that i want to know whether you thought with me that it was improper for him to address her in the car  yes  and still more improper for him to join you in the street  yes but he was very gentlemanly  no matter about that you were just as much annoyed as i was by his letter to her  i dont know about annoyed it scared me  very well and you approved of my answering it as i did  i had nothing to do with it i thought you were acting conscientiously ill say that much  youve got to say more you have got to say you approved of it for you know you did  ohapproved of it yes  thats all i want now i agree with you that if we pass this letter in silence it will leave him with some hope you agree with me that in a marriage between an american girl and an austrian officer the chances would be ninetynine to a hundred against her happiness at the best  there are a great many unhappy marriages at home said mrs elmore impartially  that isnt the point celia and you know it the point is whether you believe the chances are for or against her in such a marriage do you  do i what  agree with me  yes but i say they might be very happy i shall always say that  elmore flung up his hands in despair well then say what shall be done now  this was perhaps just what mrs elmore did not choose to say she was silent a long timeso long that elmore said but theres really no haste about it and took some notes of his history out of a drawer and began to look them over with his back turned to her  i never knew anything so heartless she cried owen this must be attended to at once i cant have it hanging over me any longer it will make me sick  he turned abruptly round and seating himself at the table wrote a note which he pushed across to her it acknowledged the receipt of captain von ehrhardts letter and expressed miss mayhews feeling that there was nothing in it to change her wish that the acquaintance should cease in after years the terms of this note did not always appear to elmore wisely chosen or humanely considered but he stood at bay and he struck mercilessly in spite of the explicit concurrence of both miss mayhew and his wife he felt as if they were throwing wholly upon him a responsibility whose fearfulness he did not then realize even in his wifes send it he was aware of a subtile reservation on her part   viii  mrs elmore and lily again rose buoyantly from the conclusive event but he succumbed to it for the delicate and fastidious invalid keeping his health evenly from day to day upon the condition of a free and peaceful mind the strain had been too much he had a bad night and the next day a gastric trouble declared itself which kept him in bed half the week and left him very weak and tremulous his friends did not forget him during this time hoskins came regularly to see him and supplied his place at the table dh√¥te of the danieli going to and fro with the ladies and efficiently protecting them from the depredations of the austrian soldiery from mr roseblack he could not protect them and both the ladies amused elmore with a dramatization of how the englishman had boldly outwitted them and trampled all their finessing under foot by simply walking up to them in the readingroom and saying this is miss mayhew i suppose and putting himself at once on the footing of an old family friend they read to elmore and they put his papers in order so that he did not know where to find anything when he got well but they always came home from the hotel with some lively gossip and this he liked they professed to recognize an anxiety on the part of mr andersens aunt that his mind should not be diverted from the civil service in india by thoughts of young american ladies but she sent some delicacies to elmore and one day she even came to call with her nephew in extreme reluctance and anxiety as they pretended to him  the next afternoon the young man called alone and elmore who was now on foot received him in the parlor before the ladies came in mr andersen had a bunch of flowers in one hand and a small wooden box containing a little turtle on a saladleaf in the other the poor animals are sold in the piazza at venice for souvenirs of the city and people often carry them away elmore took the offerings simply as he took everything in life and interpreted them as an expression however odd of mr andersens sympathy with his recent sufferings of which he gave him some account but he practised a decent selfdenial here and they were already talking of the weather when the ladies appeared he hastened to exhibit the tokens of mr andersens kind remembrance and was mystified by the young mans confusion and the impatient almost contemptuous air with which his wife listened to him hoskins came in at that moment to ask about elmores health and showed the hostile civility to andersen which young men use toward each other in the presence of ladies and then seeing that the latter had secured the place at miss mayhews side on the sofa he limped to the easy chair near mrs elmore and fell into talk with her about roseblacks pictures which he had just seen they were based upon an endeavor to trace the moral principles believed by mr ruskin to underlie venetian art and they were very queer so hoskins said he roughly sketched an idea of some of them on a block he took from his pocket  mr andersen and lily went out upon one of the highrailed balconies that overhung the canal and stood there with their backs to the others she seemed to be listening with averted face while he with his cheek leaning upon one hand and his elbow resting on the balcony rail kept a pensive attitude after they had apparently ceased to speak something in their pose struck the sculptors fancy and he made a hasty sketch of them and was showing it to the elmores when lily suddenly descended into the room again and saying something about its being quite dark went out and left mr andersen to make his adieux to the others he startled them by saying that he was to set off for india in the morning and he went away very melancholy  well i dont know said hoskins thoughtfully retouching his sketch that i should feel very lively about going out to india myself  he seems to be a very affectionate young fellow observed elmore and ive no doubt he will feel the separation from his friends but i really dont know why he should have brought me a bouquet and a small turtle in a box on the eve of his departure  what cried hoskins with a rude guffaw and when elmore had showed his gifts hoskins threw back his head and laughed indecently his behavior nettled elmore and it sent mrs elmore prematurely out of the room for not content with his explosions of laughter he continued for some time to amuse himself by touching up with the point of his pencil the tail of the turtle which he had turned out of its box upon the table at mrs elmores withdrawal he stopped and presently said goodnight rather soberly  then she returned owen she asked sadly did you really think these flowers and that turtle were for you  why yes he answered  well i dont know whether i wouldnt almost rather it had been a joke i believe that i would rather despise your heart than your head why should mr andersen bring you flowers and a turtle  upon my word i dont know  they were for lily and your mistake has added another pang to the poor young fellows suffering she has just refused him she said and as elmore continued to glare blankly at her she added she was refusing him there on the balcony while that disgusting mr hoskins was sketching them and he had his hand up that way because he was crying  this is horrible celia cried elmore the scent of the flowers lying on the table seemed to choke him the turtle clawing about on the smooth surface looked demoniacal why  now dont ask me why she refused him owen of course she couldnt care for a boy like that but he cant realize it and its just as miserable for him as if he were a thousand years old  elmore hung his head it was all a mistake but how should i know any better i am a straightforward man celia and i am unfit for the care that has been thrown upon me its more than i can bear no im not fit for it he cried at last and his wife seeing him so crushed now said something to console him  i know youre not i see it more and more but i know that you will do the best you can and that you will always act from a good motive only do try to be more on your guard  i willi will he answered humbly  he had a temptation the next time he visited hoskins to tell him the awful secret and to see how the situation of that night with this lurid light upon it affected him it could do poor andersen now on his way to india no harm he yielded to his temptation at the same time that he confessed his own blunder about the flowers  hoskins whistled i tell you what he said after a long pause there are some things in history that i never could realizelike mary queen of scots for instance putting on her best things and stepping down into the front parlor of that castle to have her head off but a thing like this happening on your own balcony helps you to realize it  it helps you to realize it assented elmore deeply oppressed by the tragic parallel  hes just beginning to feel it about now said hoskins with strange sang froid i reckon its a good deal like being shot i didnt fully appreciate my little hit under a couple of days then i began to find out that something had happened look here he added i want to show you something and he pulled the wet cloth off a breadth of clay which he had set up on a board stayed against the wall it was a basrelief representing a female figure advancing from the left corner over a stretch of prairie towards a bulk of forest on the right bison bear and antelope fled before her a lifted hand shielded her eyes a star lit the fillet that bound her hair  thats the best thing youve done hoskins said elmore what do you call it  well i havent settled yet i have thought of westward the star of empire but thats rather long and ive thought of american enterprise i aint in any hurry to name it you like it do you  i like it immensely cried elmore you must let me bring the ladies to see it  well not just yet said the sculptor in some confusion i want to get it a little further along first  they stood looking together at the figure and when elmore went away he puzzled himself about something in ithe could not tell exactly what he thought he had seen that face and figure before but this is what often occurs to the connoisseur of modern sculpture his mind heavily reverted to lily and her suitors take her in one way especially in her subordination to himself the girl was as simply a child as any in the worldgoodhearted tender and sweet and as he could see without tendency to flirtation take her in another way confront her with a young and marriageable man and elmore greatly feared that she unconsciously set all her beauty and grace at work to charm him another life seemed to inform her and irradiate from her apart from which she existed simple and childlike still in the security of his own deposited affections it appeared to him cruelly absurd that a passion which any other pretty girl might and some other pretty girl in time must have kindled should cling when once awakened so inalienably to the pretty girl who had in a million chances chanced to awaken it he wondered how much of this constancy was natural and how much merely attributive and traditional and whether human happiness or misery were increased by it on the whole   ix  in the respite which followed the dismissal of andersen the english painter roseblack visited the elmores as often as the servant who had orders in his case to say that they were impediti failed of her duty they could not always escape him at the caff√® and they would have left off dining at the hotel but for the shame of feeling that he had driven them away if he had been an englishman repelling their advances instead of an englishman pursuing them he could not have been more offensive he affronted their national as well as personal selfesteem he early declared himself a sympathizer with the southrons as the london press then called them and he expressed the current belief of his compatriots that we were going to the dogs  what do you really make of him owen asked mrs elmore after an evening that in its improbable discomfort had passed quite like a nightmare  well ive been thinking a good deal about him i have been wondering if in his phenomenal way he is not a final expression of the national geniusthe stupid contempt for the rights of others the tacit denial of the rights of any people who are at english mercy the assumption that the courtesies and decencies of life are for use exclusively towards englishmen  this was in that embittered old wartime we have since learned how forbearing and generous and amiable englishmen are how they never take advantage of any one they believe stronger than themselves or fail in consideration for those they imagine their superiors how you have but to show yourself successful in order to win their respect and even affection  but for the present mrs elmore replied to her husbands perverted ideas yes it must be so and she supported him in the ineffectual experiment of deferential politeness christian charity broad humanity and savage rudeness upon roseblack it was all one to roseblack  he took an air of serious protection towards mrs elmore and often gave her advice while he practised an easy gallantry with lily and ignored elmore altogether his intimacy was superior to the accidents of their moods and their slights and snubs were accepted apparently as interesting expressions of a civilization about which he was insatiably curious especially as regarded the relations of young people there was no mistaking the fact that roseblack in his way had fallen under the spell which elmore had learned to dread but there was nothing to be done and he helplessly waited he saw what must come and one evening it came when roseblack in more than usually offensive patronage lolled back upon the sofa at miss mayhews side and said about flirtations now in americatell me something about flirtations weve heard so much about your american flirtations we only have them with married ladies on the continent and i dont suppose mrs elmore would think of one  i dont know what you mean said lily i dont know anything about flirtations  this seemed to amuse roseblack as an uncommonly fine piece of american humor which was then just beginning to make its way with the english oh but come now you dont expect me to believe that you know if you wont tell me suppose you show me what an american flirtation is like suppose we get up a flirtation how should you begin  the girl rose with a more imposing air than elmore could have imagined of her stature but almost any woman can be awful in emergencies i should begin by bidding you goodevening she answered and swept out of the room  elmore felt as if he had been left alone with a man mortally hurt in combat and were likely to be arrested for the deed he gazed with fascination upon roseblack and wondered to see him stir and at last rise and with some incoherent words to them get himself away he dared not lift his gaze to the mans eyes lest he should see there some reflection of the pain that filled his own he would have gone after him and tried to say something in condolence but he was quite helpless to move and as he sat still gazing at the door through which roseblack disappeared mrs elmore said quietly  well really i think that ought to be the last of him you see shes quite able to take care of herself when she knows her ground you cant say that she has thrown the brunt of this affair upon you owen  i am not so sure of that sighed elmore i think i suffer less when i do it than when i see it its horrible  he deserved it every bit returned his wife  oh i dare say elmore granted but the sight even of justice isnt pleasant i find  i dont understand you owen how can you care so much for this impudent wretchs little snub and yet be so indifferent about refusing captain ehrhardt  im not indifferent about it my dear i know that i did right but i dont know that i could do right under the same circumstances again  in fact there were times when elmore found almost insupportable the absolute conclusion to which that business had come it is hard to believe that anything has come to an end in this world for a time death itself leaves the ache of an unsatisfied expectation as if somehow the interrupted life must go on and there is no change we make or suffer which is not denied by the sensation of daily habit if ehrhardt had really come back from the vague limbo to which he had been so inexorably relegated he might only have restored the original situation in all its discomfort and apprehension yet maintaining as he did this perfect silence and absence he established a hold upon elmores imagination which deepened because he could not discuss the matter frankly with his wife he weakly feared to let her know what was passing in his thoughts lest some misconception of hers should turn them into selfaccusal or urge him to some attempt at the reparation towards which he wavered he really could have done nothing that would not have made the matter worse and he confined himself to speculating upon the character and history of the man whom he knew only by the incoherent hearsay of two excited women and by the brief record of hope and passion left in the notes which lily treasured somewhere among the archives of a young girls triumphs he had a morbid curiosity to see these letters again but he dared not ask for them and indeed it would have been an idle selfindulgence he remembered them perfectly well seeing lily so indifferent it was characteristic of him in that safety from consequences which he chiefly loved that he should tacitly constitute himself in some sort the champion of her rejected suitor whose pain he luxuriously fancied in all its different stages and degrees his indolent pity even developed into a sort of selfrighteous abhorrence of the girls hardness but this was wholly within himself and could work no sort of harm if he never ventured to hint these feelings to his wife he was still further from confessing them to lily but once he approached the subject with hoskins in a wellguarded generality relating to the different kinds of sensibility developed by the european and american civilization a recent suicide for love which excited all venice at that timean austrian officer hopelessly attached to an italian girl had shot himselfhad suggested their talk and given fresh poignancy to the misgivings in elmores mind  well said hoskins those dutch are queer they dont look at women as respectfully as we do and they mix up so much cabbage with their romance that you dont know exactly how to take them and yet here you find this fellow suffering just as much as a white man because the girls folks wont let her have him in fact i dont know but he suffered more than the average american citizen i think we have a great deal more common sense in our loveaffairs we respect women more than any other people and i think we show them more true politeness we let em have their way more and get their finger into the pie right along and its right we should but we dont make fools of ourselves about them as a general rule we know theyre awfully nice and they know we know it and its a perfectly understood thing all round weve been used to each other all our lives and theyre just as sensible as we are they like a fellow when they do like him about as well as any of em but they know hes a man and a brother after all and hes got ever so much human nature in him well now i reckon one of these dutch chaps the first time he gets a chance to speak with a pretty girl thinks hes got hold of a goddess and i suppose the girl feels just so about him why its natural they shouldtheyve never had any chance to know any better and your feelings are apt to get the upper hand of you at such times anyway i dont blame em one of em goes off and shoots himself and the other one feels as if she was never going to get over it well now look at the way miss lily acted in that little business of hers one of these girls over here would have had her head completely turned by that adventure but when she couldnt see her way exactly clear she puts the case in your hands and then stands by what you do as calm as a clock  it was a very perplexing thing i did the best i knew said elmore  why of course you did cried hoskins and she sees that as well as you or i do and she stands by you accordingly i tell you that girls got a cool head  in his soul elmore ungratefully and inconsistently wished that her heart were not equally cool but he only said yes she is a good and sensible girl i hope thetheother one is equally resigned  oh hell get along answered hoskins with the indifference of one man for the sufferings of another in such matters we are able to offer a brother very little comfort and scarcely any sympathy in those unhappy affairs of the heart which move women to a pretty compassion for a disappointed sister a man in love is in no wise interesting to us for that reason and if he is unfortunate we hope at the farthest that he will have better luck next time it is only here and there that a sentimentalist like elmore stops to pity him and it is not certain that even he would have sighed over captain ehrhardt if he had not been the means of his disappointment as it was he came away feeling that doubtless ehrhardt had got along and resolved at least to spend no more unavailing regrets upon him  the time passed very quietly now and if it had not been for hoskins the ladies must have found it dull he had nothing to do except as he made himself occupation with his art and he willingly bestowed on them the leisure which elmore could not find they went everywhere with him and saw the city to advantage through his efforts doors closed to ordinary curiosity opened to the magic of his card and he showed a pleasure in using such little privileges as his position gave him for their amusement he went upon errands for them he was like a brother with something more than a brothers pliability he came half the time to breakfast with them and was always welcome to all he had the gift of extracting comfort from the darkest news about the war he was a prophet of unfailing good to the union cause and in many hours of despondency they willingly submitted to the authority of his greater experience and took heart again  i like your indomitable hopefulness hoskins said elmore on one of those occasions when the consul was turning defeat into victory theres a streak of unconscious poetry in it just as there is in your taking up the subjects you do i imagine that so far as the judgment of the world goes our fortunes are at the lowest ebb just now  oh the world is wrong interrupted the consul those london papers are all in the pay of the rebels  i mean that we have no sort of sympathy in europe and yet here you are embodying in your conception of westward the arrogant faith of the days when our destiny seemed universal union and universal dominion there is something sublime to me in your treatment of such a work at such a time i think an italian for instance if his country were involved in a life and death struggle like this of ours would have expressed something of the anxiety and apprehension of the time in it but this conception of yours is as serenely undisturbed by the facts of the war as if secession had taken place in another planet there is something greek in that repose of feeling triumphant over circumstance it is like the calm beauty which makes you forget the anguish of the laoco√∂n  is that so professor said hoskins blushing modestly as an artist often must in these days of creative criticism he seemed to reflect awhile before he added well i reckon youre partly right if we ever did go to smash it would take us a whole generation to find it out we have all been raised to put so much dependence on uncle sam that if the old gentleman really did pass in his checks we should only think he was lying low for a new deal i never happened to think it out before but im pretty sure its so  your work wouldnt be worth half so much to me if you had thought it out said elmore its the unconsciousness of the faith that makes its chief value as i said before and there is another thing about it that interests and pleases me still more  whats that asked the sculptor  the instinctive way in which you have given the figure an entirely american quality there was something very familiar to me in it the first time you showed it but ive only just been able to formulate my impression i see now that while the spirit of your conception is greek you have given it as you ought the purest american expression your westward is no hellenic goddess she is a vivid and selfreliant american girl  at these words hoskins reddened deeply and seemed not to know where to look mrs elmore had the effect of escaping through the door into her own room and miss mayhew ran out upon the balcony hoskins followed each in turn with a queer glance and sat a moment in silence then he said well i reckon i must be going and went rather abruptly without offering to take leave of the ladies  as soon as he was gone lily came in from the balcony and whipped into mrs elmores room from which she flashed again in swift retreat to her own and was seen no more and then mrs elmore came back with a flushed face to where her husband sat mystified  my dear he said gravely im afraid youve hurt mr hoskinss feelings  do you think so she asked and then she burst into a wild cry of laughter o owen owen you will kill me yet  really he replied with dignity i dont see any occasion in what i said for this extraordinary behavior  of course you dont and thats just what makes the fun of it so you found something familiar in mr hoskinss statue from the first did you she asked and you didnt notice anything particular in it  particular particular he demanded beginning to lose his patience at this  oh she exclaimed couldnt you see that it was lily all over again  elmore laughed in turn why so it is so it is that accounts for everything that puzzled me i dont wonder my maunderings amused you it was ridiculous to be sure when in the world did she give him the sittings and how did you manage to keep it from me so well  owen cried his wife with terrible severity you dont think that lily would let him put her into it  why i supposedi didnt knowi dont see how he could have done it unless  he did it without leave or license said mrs elmore we saw it all along but he never let on as he would say about it and we never meant to say anything of course  then replied elmore delighted with the fact it has been a purely unconscious piece of cerebration  cerebration exclaimed mrs elmore with more scorn than she knew how to express i should think as much  well i dont know said elmore with the pique of a man who does not care to be quite trampled under foot i dont see that the theory is so very unphilosophical  oh not at all mocked his wife its philosophical to the last degree be as philosophical as you please owen i shall love you still the same she came up to him where he sat and twisting her arm round his face patronizingly kissed him on top of the head then she released him and left him with another burst of derision   x  after this elmore had such an uncomfortable feeling that he hated to see hoskins again and he was relieved when the sculptor failed to make his usual call the next evening he had not been at dinner either and he did not reappear for several days then he merely said that he had been spending the time at chioggia with a french painter who was making some studies down there and they all took up the old routine of their friendly life without embarrassment  at first it seemed to elmore that lily was a little shy of hoskins and he thought that she resented his using her charm in his art but before the evening wore away he lost this impression they all got into a long talk about home and she took her place at the piano and played some of the warsongs that had begun to supersede the old negro melodies then she wandered back to them with fingers that idly drifted over the keys and ended with stop dat knockin in which hoskins joined with his powerful bass in the recitative let me in and elmore himself had half a mind to attempt a part the sculptor rose as she struck the keys with a final crash but lingered as his fashion was when he had something to propose if he felt pretty sure that the thing would be liked he brought it in as if he had only happened to remember it he now drew out a large square ceremoniouslooking envelope at which he glanced as if after all he was rather surprised to see it and said oh by the by mrs elmore i wish youd tell me what to do about this thing heres something thats come to me in my official capacity but it isnt exactly consular businessif it was i dont believe i should ask any lady for instructionsand i dont know exactly what to do its so long since i corresponded with a princess that i dont even know how to answer her letter  the ladies perhaps feared a hoax of some sort and would not ask to see the letter and then hoskins recognized his failure to play upon their curiosity with a laugh and gave the letter to mrs elmore it was an invitation to a mask ball of which all venice had begun to speak a great russian lady who had come to spend the winter in the lagoons and had taken a whole floor at one of the hotels had sent out her cards apparently to all the available people in the city for the event which was to take place a fortnight later in the mean time a thrill of preparation was felt in various quarters and the ordinary course of life was interrupted in a way that gave some idea of the old times when venice was the capital of pleasure and everything yielded there to the great business of amusement mrs elmore had found it impossible to get a pair of fine shoes finished until after the ball a dress which lily had ordered could not be made their laundress had given notice that for the present all fluting and quilling was out of the question one already heard that the chief venetian perruquier and his assistants were engaged for every moment of the fortyeight hours before the ball and that whoever had him now must sit up with her hair dressed for two nights at least mrs elmore had a fanatical faith in these stories and while agreeing with her husband as a matter of principle that mask balls were wrong and that it was in bad taste for a foreigner to insult the sorrow of venice by a festivity of the sort at such a time she had secretly indulged longings which the sight of hoskinss invitation rendered almost insupportable her longings were not for herself but for lily if she could provide lily with the experience of a masquerade in venice she could overpay all the kindnesses that the mayhews had ever done her it was an ambition neither ignoble nor ungenerous and it was with a really heroic effort that she silenced it in passing the invitation to her husband and simply saying to hoskins of course you will go  i dont know about that he answered thats the point i want some advice on you see this document calls for a lady to fill out the bill  oh returned mrs elmore you will find some americans at the hotels you can take them  well now i was thinking mrs elmore that i should like to take you  take me she echoed tremulously what an idea im too old to go to mask balls  you dont look it suggested hoskins  oh i couldnt go she sighed but its very very kind  hoskins dropped his head and gave the low chuckle with which he confessed any little bit of humbug well you or miss lily  lily had retired to the other side of the room as soon as the parley about the invitation began without asking or seeing she knew what was in the note and now she felt it right to make a feint of not knowing what mrs elmore meant when she asked what do you say lily  when the question was duly explained to her she answered languidly i dont know do you think id better  i might as well make a clean breast of it first as last said hoskins i thought perhaps mrs elmore might refuse shes so stiff about some thingshere he gave that chuckle of hisand so i came prepared for contingencies it occurred to me that it mightnt be quite the thing and so i went round to the spanish consul and asked him how he thought it would do for me to matronize a young lady if i could get one and he said he didnt think it would do at all hoskins let this adverse decision sink into the breasts of his listeners before he added but he said that he was going with his wife and that if we would come along she could matronize us both i dont know how it would work he concluded impartially  they all looked at elmore who stood holding the princesss missive in his hand and darkly forecasting the chances of consent and denial at the first suggestion of the matter a reckless hope that this ball might bring ehrhardt above their horizon again sprang up in his heart and became a desperate fear when the whole responsibility of action was as usual left with him he stood feeling that hoskins had used him very ill  i suppose began mrs elmore very thoughtfully that this will be something quite in the style of the old masquerades under the republic  regular ridotto business the spanish consul says answered hoskins  it might be very useful to you owen she resumed in an historical way if lily were to go and take notes of everything so that when you came to that period you could describe its corruptions intelligently  elmore laughed i never thought of that my dear he said returning the invitation to hoskins your historical sense has been awakened late but it promises to be very active lily had better go by all means and i shall depend upon her coming home with very full notes upon her dancelist  they laughed at the professors sarcasm and hoskins having undertaken to see that the last claims of etiquette were satisfied by getting an invitation sent to miss mayhew through the spanish consul went off and left the ladies to the discussion of ways and means mrs elmore said that of course it was now too late to hope to get anything done and then set herself to devise the character that lily would have appeared in if there had been time to get her ready or if all the workpeople had not been so busy that it was merely frantic to think of anything she first patriotically considered her as columbia with the customary drapery of stars and stripes and the cap of liberty but while holding that she would have looked very pretty in the dress mrs elmore decided that it would have been too hackneyed and besides everybody would have known instantly who it was  why not have had her go in the character of mr hoskinss westward suggested elmore with lazy irony  the very thing cried his wife owen you deserve great credit for thinking of that no one else would have done it no one will dream what it means and it will be great fun letting them make it out we must keep it a dead secret from mr hoskins and let her surprise him with it when he comes for her that evening it will be a very pretty way of returning his compliment and it will be a sort of delicate acknowledgement of his kindness in asking her and in so many other ways yes youve hit it exactly owen she shall go as westward  go echoed elmore who had with difficulty realized the rapid change of tense i thought you said you couldnt get her ready  we must manage somehow replied mrs elmore and somehow a shoemaker for the sandals a seamstress for the delicate flowing draperies a hairdresser for the adjustment of the young girls rebellious abundance of hair beneath the starlit fillet were actually foundwith the help of hoskins as usual though he was not suffered to know anything of the character to whose makeup he contributed the perruquier a personage of lordly address naturally and of a dignity heightened by the demand in which he found himself came early in the morning and was received by elmore with a selfpossession that illcomported with the solemnity of the occasion sit down said elmore easily pushing him a chair the ladies will be here presently  but i have no time to sit down signore replied the artist with an imperious bow and the ladies must be here instantly  mrs elmore always said that if she had not heard this conversation and hurried in at once the perruquier would have left them at that point but she contrived to appease him by the manifestation of an intelligent sympathy she made lily leave her breakfast untasted and submit her beautiful head to the touch of this man with whom it was but a head of hair and nothing more and in an hour the work was done the artist whisked away the cloth which covered her shoulders and crying behold bowed splendidly to the spectators and without waiting for criticism or suggestion took his napoleon and went his way all that day the work of his skill was sacredly guarded and the custodian of the treasure went about with her head on her shoulders as if it had been temporarily placed in her keeping and were something she was not at all used to taking care of more than once mrs elmore had to warn her against sinister accidents remember lily she said that if anything did happen nothing could be done to save you in spite of himself elmore shared these anxieties and in the depths of his wonted studies he found himself pursued and harassed by vague apprehensions which upon analysis proved to be fears for miss lilys hair it was a great moment when the robe came homerather latefrom the dressmakers and was put on over lilys head but from this thrilling rite elmore was of course excluded and only knew of it afterwards by hearsay he did not see her till she came out just before hoskins arrived to fetch her away when she appeared radiantly perfect in her dress and in the air with which she meant to carry it off at mrs elmores direction she paraded dazzlingly up and down the room a number of times bending over to see how her dress hung as she walked mrs elmore with her head on one side scrutinized her in every detail and elmore regarded her young beauty and delight with a pride as innocent as her own a dim regret evaporating in a long sigh which made the others laugh recalled him to himself as the bell rang and hoskins appeared he was received in a preconcerted silence and he looked from one to the other with his queer knowing smile and took in the whole affair without a word  isnt it a pretty idea said mrs elmore studied from an antique basrelief or just the same as an antiquefull of the anguish and the repose of the laoco√∂n  mrs elmore said the sculptor youre too many for me i reckon the procession had better start before i make a fool of myself well this was all hoskins could say but it sufficed the ladies declared afterwards that if he had added a word more it would have spoiled it they had expected him to go to the ball in the character of a miner perhaps or in that of a trapper of the great plains but he had chosen to appear more naturally as a courtier of the time of louis xiv when you go in for a disguise he explained you cant make it too complete and i consider that this limp of mine adds the last touch  its no use to sit up for them mrs elmore said when she and her husband had come in from calling good wishes and last instructions after them from the balcony as their gondola pushed away we shant see anything more of them till morning now this she added is something like the gayety that people at home are always fancying in europe why i can remember when i used to imagine that american tourists figured brilliantly in salons and conversazioni and spent their time in masking and throwing confetti in carnival and going to balls and opera i didnt know what american tourists were then and how dismally they moped about in hotels and galleries and churches and i didnt know how stupid europe was sociallyhow perfectly dead and buried it was especially for young people it would be fun if things happened so that lily never found it out i dont think two offers alreadyor three if you count roseblackare very bad for any girl and now this ball coming right on top of it where she will see hundreds of handsome officers well shell never miss patmos at this rate will she  perhaps she had better never have left patmos suggested elmore gravely  i dont know what you mean owen said his wife as if hurt  i mean that its a great pity she should give herself up to the same frivolous amusements here that she had there the only good that europe can do american girls who travel here is to keep them in total exile from what they call a good timefrom parties and attentions and flirtations to force them through the hard discipline of social deprivation to take some interest in the things that make for civilizationin history in art in humanity  now there i differ with you owen i think american girls are the nicest girls in the world just as they are and i dont see any harm in the things you think are so awful youve lived so long here among your manuscripts that youve forgotten there is any such time as the present if you are getting so europeanized i think the sooner we go home the better  i getting europeanized began elmore indignantly  yes europeanized and i dont want you to be so severe with lily owen the child stands in terror of you now and if you keep on in this way she cant draw a natural breath in the house  there is always something flattering at first to a gentle and peaceable man in the notion of being terrible to any one elmore melted at these words and at the fear that he might have been in some way that he could not think of really harsh  i should be very sorry to distress her he began  well you havent distressed her yet his wife relented only you must be careful not to she was going to be very circumspect owen on your account for she really appreciates the interest you take in her and i think she sees that it wont do to be at all free with strangers over here this ball will be a great education for lilya great education im going to commence a letter to sue about her costume and all that and leave it open to finish up when lily gets home  when she went to bed she did not sleep till after the time when the girl ought to have come and when she awoke to a late breakfast lily had still not returned by eleven oclock she and elmore had passed the stage of accusing themselves and then of accusing each other for allowing lily to go in the way they had and had come to the question of what they had better do and whether it was practicable to send to the spanish consulate and ask what had become of her they had resigned themselves to waiting for one halfhour longer when they heard her voice at the watergate gayly forbidding hoskins to come up and running out upon the balcony mrs elmore had a glimpse of the courtier very tawdry by daylight reentering his gondola and had only time to turn about when lily burst laughing into the room  oh dont look at me professor elmore she cried im literally danced to rags  her dress and hair were splashed with drippings from the wax candles she was wildly decorated with favors from the german and one of these had been used to pin up a rent which the spur of a hussar had made in her robe her hair had escaped from its fastenings during the night and in putting it back she had broken the star in her fillet it was now kept in place by a bit of blackandyellow cord which an officer had lent her he said he should claim it of me the first time we met she exclaimed excitedly why professor elmore she implored with a laugh dont look at me so  grief and indignation were in his heart you look like the spectre of last night he said with dreamy severity and as if he saw her merely as a vision  why thats the way i feel she answered and with a reproachful owen his wife followed her flight to her room   xi  elmore went out for a long walk from which he returned disconsolate at dinner he was one of those people common enough in our puritan civilization who would rather forego any pleasure than incur the reaction which must follow with all the keenness of remorse and he always mechanically pitied for the operation was not a rational one such unhappy persons as he saw enjoying themselves but he had not meant to add bitterness to the anguish which lily would necessarily feel in retrospect of the nights gayety he had not known that he was recognizing by those unsparing words of his the nervous misgivings in the girls heart he scarcely dared ask as he sat down at table with mrs elmore alone whether lily were asleep  asleep she echoed in a low tone of mystery i hope so  celia celia he cried in despair what shall i do i feel terribly at what i said to her  sh at what you said to her oh yes yes that was cruel but there is so much else poor child that i had forgotten that  he let his plate of soup stand untasted whywhy he faltered didnt she enjoy herself and a historian of venice whose mind should have been wholly engaged in philosophizing the republics difficult past hung abjectly upon the question whether a young girl had or had not had a good time at a ball  yes oh yes she enjoyed herselfif thats all you require replied his wife of course she wouldnt have stayed so late if she hadnt enjoyed herself  no he said in a tone which he tried to make leading but his wife refused to be led by indirect methods she ate her soup but in a manner to carry increasing bitterness to elmore with every spoonful  come celia he cried at last tell me what has happened you know how wretched this makes me tell me it whatever it is of course i must know it in the end are there any new complications  no new complications said his wife as if resenting the word but you make such a bugbear of the least little matter that theres no encouragement to tell you anything  excuse me he retorted i havent made a bugbear of this  you havent had the opportunity this was so grossly unjust that elmore merely shrugged his shoulders and remained silent when it finally appeared that he was not going to ask anything more his wife added if you could listen like any one else and not interrupt with remarks that distort all ones ideasthen as he persisted in his silence she relented still further why of course as you say you will have to know it in the end but i can tell you to begin with owen that its nothing you can do anything about or take hold of in any way whatever it is its done and over so it neednt distress you at all  ah ive known some things done and over that distressed me a great deal he suggested  the princess wasnt so very young after all said mrs elmore as if this had been the point in dispute but very fat and jolly and very kind she wasnt in costume but there was a young countess with her helping receive who appeared as nightblack tulle you know with silver stars the princess seemed to take a great fancy to lilythe russians always have sympathized with us in the warand all the time she wasnt dancing the princess kept her by her holding her hand and patting it the officershundreds of them in their white uniforms and those magnificent hussar dresseswere very obsequious to the princess and lily had only too many partners she says you cant imagine how splendid the scene was with all those different costumes and the rooms a perfect blaze of waxlights the windows were battened so that you couldnt tell when it came daylight and she hadnt any idea how the time was passing they were not all in masks and there didnt seem to be any regular hour for unmasking she cant tell just when the supper was but she thinks it must have been towards morning she says mr hoskins got on capitally and everybody seemed to like him he was so jolly and goodnatured and when they found out that he had been wounded in the war they made quite a belle of him as he called it the princess made a point of introducing all the officers to lily that came up after they unmasked they paid her the greatest attention and you can easily see that she was the prettiest girl there  i can believe that without seeing said elmore with magnanimous pride in the loveliness that had made him so much trouble well  well they couldnt any of them get the hang as mr hoskins said of the character she came in for a good while but when they did they thought it was the best idea there and it was all your idea owen said mrs elmore in accents of such tender pride that he knew she must now be approaching the difficult passage of her narration it was so perfectly new and unconventional she got on very well speaking italian with the officers for she knew as much of it as they did  here mrs elmore paused and glanced hesitatingly at her husband they only made one little mistake but that was at the beginning and they soon got over it elmore suffered but he did not ask what it was and his wife went on with smooth caution lily thought it was just as it is at home and she mustnt dance with any one unless they had been introduced so after the first dance with the spanish consul as her escort a young officer came up and asked her and she refused for she thought it was a great piece of presumption afterwards the princess told her she could dance with any one introduced or not and so she did and pretty soon she saw this first officer looking at her very angrily and going about speaking to others and glancing toward her she felt badly about it when she saw how it was and she got mr hoskins to go and speak to him mr hoskins asked him if he spoke english and the officer said no and it seems that he didnt know italian either and mr hoskins tried him in spanishhe picked up a little in new mexicobut the officer didnt understand it and all at once it occurred to mr hoskins to say parlezvous fran√ßais and says the officer instantly oui monsieur  of course the man knew french he ought to have tried him with that in the beginning what did hoskins say then asked elmore impatiently  he didnt say anything that was all the french he knew  elmore broke into a cry of laughter and laughed on and on with the wild excess of a sad man when once he unpacks his heart in that way his wife did not perhaps feel the absurdity as keenly as he but she gladly laughed with him for it smoothed her way to have him in this humor mr hoskins just took him by the arm and said here you come along with me and led him up to the princess where lily was sitting and when the princess had explained to him lily rose and mustered up enough french to say je vous prie monsieur de danser avec moi and after that they were the greatest friends  that was very pretty in her it was sovereignly gracious said elmore  oh if an american girl is left to manage for herself she can always manage cried mrs elmore  well and what else asked her husband  oh i dont know that it amounts to anything said mrs elmore but she did not delay further  it appeared from what she went on to say that in the german which began not long after midnight there was a figure fancifully called the symphony in which musical toys were distributed among the dancers in pairs the possessor of a small pandean pipe or tin horn went about sounding it till he found some lady similarly equipped when he demanded her in the dance in this way a tall mask to whom a penny trumpet had fallen was stalking to and fro among the waltzers blowing the silly plaything with a disgusted air when lily all unconscious of him where she sat with her hand in that of her faithful princess breathed a responsive note the mask was instantly at her side and she was whirling away in the waltz she tried to make him out but she had already danced with so many people that she was unable to decide whether she had seen this mask before he was not disguised except by the little visor of black silk coming down to the point of his nose his blond whiskers escaped at either side and his blond moustache swept beneath like the whiskers and moustaches of fifty other officers present and he did not speak this was a permissible caprice of his but if she were resolved to make him speak this also was a permissible caprice she made a whole turn of the room in studying up the italian sentence with which she assailed him perdoni maschera ma cosa ha detto non ho ben inteso  speak english mask came the reply i did not say anything it came certainly with a german accent and with a foreigners deliberation but it came at once and clearly  the english astonished her and somehow it daunted her for the mask spoke very gravely but she would not let him imagine that he had put her down and she rejoined laughingly oh i knew that you hadnt spoken but i thought i would make you  you think you can make one do what you will asked the mask  oh no i dont think i could make you tell me who you are though i should like to make you  and why should you wish to know me if you met me in piazza you would not recognize my salutation  how do you know that demanded lily i dont know what you mean  oh it is understood yet already answered the mask your compatriot with whom you live wishes to be well seen by the italians and he would not let you bow to an austrian  that is not so exclaimed lily indignantly  professor elmore wouldnt be so mean and if he would i shouldnt she was frightened but she felt her spirit rising too you seem to know so well who i am do you think it is fair for you to keep me in ignorance  i cannot remain masked without your leave shall i unmask do you insist  oh no she replied you will have to unmask at supper and then i shall see you im not impatient i prefer to keep you for a mystery  you will be a mystery to me even when you unmask replied the mask gravely  lily was ill at ease and she gave a little unsuccessful laugh you seem to take the mystery very coolly she said in default of anything else  i have studied the american manner replied the mask in america they take everything coolly life and death love and hateall things  how do you know that you have never been in america  that is not necessary if the americans come here to show us  they are not true americans if they show you that cried the girl  no  but i see that you are only amusing yourself  and have you never amused yourself with me  how could i she demanded if i never saw you before  but are you sure of that she did not answer for in this masquerade banter she had somehow been growing unhappy shall i prove to you that you have seen me before you dare not let me unmask  oh i can wait till supper i shall know then that i have never seen you before i forbid you to unmask till supper will you obey she cried anxiously  i have obeyed in harder things replied the mask  she refused to recognize anything but meaningless badinage in his words oh as a soldier yesyou must be used to obeying orders he did not reply and she added releasing her hand and slipping it into his arm i am tired now will you take me back to the princess  he led her silently to her place and left her with a profound bow  now said the princess they shall give you a little time to breathe i will not let them make you dance every minute they are indiscreet you shall not take any of their musical instruments and so you can fairly escape till supper  thank you said lily absently that will be the best way and she sat languidly watching the dancers a young naval officer who spoke english ran across the floor to her  come he cried i shall have twenty duels on my hands if i let you rest here when there are so many who wish to dance with you he threw a pipe into her lap and at the same moment a pipe sounded from the other side of the room  this is a conspiracy exclaimed the girl i will not have it i am not going to dance any more she put the pipe back into his hands he placed it to his lips and sounded it several times and then dropped it into her lap again with a laugh and vanished in the crowd  that little fellow is a rogue said the princess but he is not so bad as some of them monsieur she cried in french to the fairwhiskered tall mask who had already presented himself before lily i will not permit it if it is for a trick you must unmask i will dispense mademoiselle from dancing with you  the mask did not reply but turned his eyes upon lily with an appeal which the holes of the visor seemed to intensify it is a promise she said to the princess rising in a sort of fascination i have forbidden him to unmask before supper  oh very well answered the princess if that is the case but make him bring you back soon it is almost time  did you hear mask asked the girl as they waltzed away i will only make two turns of the room with you  perdoni  this is too bad she exclaimed i will not be trifled with in this way either speak english or unmask at once  the mask again answered in italian with a repeated apology for not understanding you understand very well retorted lily now really indignant and you know that this passes a jest  can you speak german asked the mask in that tongue  yes a little but i do not choose to speak it if you have anything to say to me you can say it in english  i cannot understand english replied the mask still in german and now lily thought the voice seemed changed but she clung to her belief that it was some hoax played at her expense and she continued her efforts to make him answer her in english the two turns round the room had stretched to half a dozen in this futile task but she felt herself powerless to leave the mask who for his part betrayed signs of embarrassment as if he had undertaken a ruse of which he repented a confused movement in the crowd and a sudden cessation of the music recalled her to herself and she now took her partners arm and hurried with him toward the place where she had left the princess but the princess had already gone into the supperroom and she had no other recourse than to follow with the stranger  as they entered the supperroom she removed her little visor and she felt rather than saw the mask put up his hand and lift away his own he turned his head and looked down upon her with the face of a man she had never seen before  ah you are there she heard the princesss voice calling to her from one of the tables how tired you look herehere i will make you drink this glass of wine  the officer who brought her the wine gave her his arm and led her to the princess and the late mask mixed with the twoscore other tall blond officers  the night which stretched so far into the day ended at last and she followed hoskins down to their gondola he entered the boat first to give her his hand in stepping from the riva at the same moment she involuntarily turned at the closing of the door behind her and found at her side the tall blond mask or one of the masks if there were two who had danced with her he caught her hand suddenly to his lips and kissed it  adieuforgive he murmured in english and then vanished indoors again   owen said mrs elmore dramatically at the end of her narration who do you think it could have been  i have no doubt as to who it was celia replied elmore with a heat evidently quite unexpected to his wife and if lily has not been seriously annoyed by the matter i am glad that it has happened i have had my regretsmy doubtswhether i did not dismiss that mans pretensions too curtly too unkindly but i am convinced now that we did exactly right and that she was wise never to bestow another thought upon him a man capable of contriving a petty persecution of this sortof pursuing a young girl who had rejected him in this shameless fashionis no gentleman  it was a persecution said mrs elmore with a dazed air as if this view of the case had not occurred to her  a miserable unworthy persecution repeated her husband  yes  and we are well rid of him he has relieved me by this last performance immensely and i trust that if lily had any secret lingering regrets he has given her a final lesson though i must say in justice to her poor girl she didnt seem to need it  mrs elmore listened with a strange abeyance she looked beaten and bewildered while he vehemently uttered these words she could not meet his eyes with her consciousness of having her intended romance thrown back upon her hands and he seemed in nowise eager to meet hers for whatever consciousness of his own well it isnt certain that he was the one after all she said   xii  long after the ball lily seemed to elmores eye not to have recovered her former tone he thought she went about languidly and that she was fitful and dreamy breaking from moods of unwonted abstraction in bursts of gayety as unnatural she did not talk much of the ball he could not be sure that she ever recurred to it of her own motion hoskins continued to come a great deal to the house and she often talked with him for a whole evening elmore fancied she was very serious in these talks  he wondered if lily avoided him or whether this was only an illusion of his but in any case he was glad that the girl seemed to find so much comfort in hoskinss company and when it occurred to him he always said something to encourage his visits his wife was singularly quiescent at this time as if having accomplished all she wished in lilys presence at the princesss ball she was willing to rest for a while from further social endeavor life was falling into the dull routine again and after the past shocks his nerves were gratefully clothing themselves in the old habits of tranquillity once more when one day a letter came from the overseers of patmos university offering him the presidency of that institution on condition of his early return the board had in view certain changes intended to bring the university abreast with the times which they hoped would meet his approval  among these was a modification of the name which was hereafter to be patmos university and military institute the board not only believed that popular feeling demanded the introduction of military drill into the college but they felt that a college which had been closed at the beginning of the rebellion through the dedication of its president and nearly all its students to the war could in no way so gracefully recognize this proud fact of its history as by hereafter making war one of the arts which it taught the board explained that of course mr elmore would not be expected to take charge of this branch of instruction at once a competent military assistant would be provided and continued under him as long as he should deem his services essential the letter closed with a cordial expression of the desire of elmores old friends to have him once more in their midst at the close of labors which they were sure would do credit to the good old university and to the whole city of patmos  elmore read this letter at breakfast and silently handed it to his wife they were alone for lily as now often happened had not yet risen well he said when she had read it in her turn she gave it back to him with a look in her dimmed eyes which he could not mistake i see there is no doubt of your feeling celia he added  i dont wish to urge you she replied but yes i should like to go back yes i am homesick i have been afraid of it before but this chance of returning makes it certain  and you see nothing ridiculous in my taking the presidency of a military institute  they say expressly that they dont expect you to give instruction in that branch  no not immediately it seems he said with his pensive irony and the history  havent you almost got notes enough  elmore laughed sadly i have been here two years it would take me twenty years to write such a history of venice as i ought not to be ashamed to write it would take me five years to scamp it as i thought of doing oh i dare say i had better go back i have neither the time nor the money to give to a work i never was fit forof whose magnitude even i was unable to conceive  dont say that cried his wife with the old sympathy you will write it yet i know you will i would rather spend all my days in thiswatery mausoleum than have you talk so owen  thank you my dear but the work wont be lost even if i give it up at this point i can do something with my material i suppose and you know that if i didnt wish to give up my project i couldnt its a sign of my unfitness for it that im able to abandon it the man who is born to write the history of venice will have no volition in the matter he cannot leave it and he will not die till he has finished it he feebly crushed a bit of bread in his fingers as he ended with this burst of feeling and he shook his head in sad negation to his wifes tender protestoh you will come back some day to finish it  no one ever comes back to finish a history of venice he said  oh yes you will she returned but you need the rest from this kind of work now just as you needed rest from your college work before you need a change of standpointand the american standpoint will be the very thing for you  perhaps so perhaps so he admitted at any rate this is a handsome offer and most kindly made celia its a great compliment i didnt suppose they valued me so much  of course they valued you and they will be very glad to get you i call it merely letting the historic material ripen in your mind or else i shouldnt let you accept and i shall be glad to go home owen on lilys account the child is getting no good here shes drooping  drooping  yes dont you see how she mopes about  im afraidthati havenoticed  he was going to ask why she was drooping but he could not he said recurring to the letter of the overseers so patmos is a city  of course it is by this time said his wife with all that prosperity  now that they were determined to go their little preparations for return were soon made and a week after elmore had written to accept the offer of the overseers they were ready to follow his letter home their decision was a blow to hoskins under which he visibly suffered and they did not realize till then in what fond and affectionate friendship he held them he now frankly spent his whole time with them he disconsolately helped them pack and he did all that a consul can do to secure free entry for some objects of venice that they wished to get in without payment of duties at new york  he said a dozen times i dont know what i will do when youre gone and toward the last he alarmed them for his own interests by beginning to say well i dont see but what i will have to go along  the last night but one lily felt it her duty to talk to him very seriously about his future and what he owed to it she told him that he must stay in italy till he could bring home something that would honor the great precious suffering country for which he had fought so nobly and which they all loved she made the tears come into her eyes as she spoke and when she said that she should always be proud to be associated with one of his works hoskinss voice was quite husky in replying is that the way you feel about it he went away promising to remain at least till he finished his basrelief of westward and his figure of the pacific slope and the next morning he sent around by a facchino a note to lily  she ran it through in the presence of the elmores before whom she received it and then with a cry of i think mr hoskins is too bad she threw it into mrs elmores lap and catching her handkerchief to her eyes she broke into tears and went out of the room the note read        dear miss lilyyour kind interest in me gives me courage to say      something that will very likely make me hateful to you forevermore      but i have got to say it and you have got to know it and its all      the worse for me if you have never suspected it i want to give my      whole life to you wherever and however you will have it with you      by my side i feel as if i could really do something that you would      not be ashamed of in sculpture and i believe that i could make you      happy i suppose i believe this because i love you very dearly and      i know the chances are that you will not think this is reason      enough but i would take one chance in a million and be only too      glad of it i hope it will not worry you to read this as i said      before i had to tell you perhaps it wont be altogether a      surprise i might go on but i suppose that until i hear from you i      had better give you as little of my eloquence as possible                                                          clay hoskins   well upon my word said elmore to whom his wife had transferred the letter this is very indelicate of hoskins i must say i expected something better of him he looked at the note with a face of disgust  i dont know why you had a right to expect anything better of him as you call it retorted his wife its perfectly natural  natural cried elmore to put this upon us at the last moment when he knows how much trouble ive  lily reentered the room as precipitately as she had left it and saved him from betraying himself as to the extent of his confidences to hoskins professor elmore she said bending her reddened eyes upon him i want you to answer this letter for me and i dont want you to write as youi mean dont make it so cuttingsosowhy i like mr hoskins hes been so kind and if you said anything to wound his feelings  i shall not do that you may be sure because for one reason i shall say nothing at all to him replied elmore  you wont write to him she gasped  no  why what shall i doooo demanded lily prolonging the syllable in a burst of grief and astonishment  i dont know answered elmore  owen cried his wife interfering for the first time in response to the look of appeal that lily turned upon her you must write  celia he retorted boldly i wont write i have a genuine regard for hoskins i respect him and i am very grateful to him for all his kindness to you he has been like a brother to you both  why of course interrupted lily i never thought of him as anything but a brother  and though i must say i think it would have been more thoughtful andandmore considerate in him not to do this  we did everything we could to fight him off from it interrupted mrs elmore both of us we saw that it was coming and we tried to stop it but nothing would help perhaps as he says he did have to do it  i didnt dream of hishaving any suchidea said elmore i felt so perfectly safe in his coming i trusted everything to him  i suppose you thought his wanting to come was all unconscious cerebration said his wife disdainfully well now you see it wasnt  yes but its too late now to help it and though i think he ought to have spared us this if he thought there was no hope for him still i cant bring myself to inflict pain upon him and the long and the short of it is i wont  but how is he to be answered  i dont know you can answer him  i could never do it in the world  i own its difficult said elmore coldly  oh i will answer himi will answer him cried lily rather than have any trouble about it herehere she said reaching blindly for pen and paper as she seated herself at elmores desk give me the ink quick oh dear what shall i say what date is itthe 25th and it doesnt matter about the day of the week dear mr hoskinsdear mr hoskinsdear mr hoskought you to put clay hoskins esq at the top or the bottomor not at all when youve said dear mr hoskins esquire seems so cold anyway and i wont put it dear mr hoskinsprofessor elmore she implored reproachfully tell me what to say  that would be equivalent to writing the letter he began  well write it then she said throwing down the pen i dont ask you to dictate it write itwrite anythingjust in pencil you know that wont commit you to anything they say a thing in pencil isnt legaland ill copy it out in the first person  owen said his wife you shall not refuse its inhuman its inhospitable when lily wants you to so why i never heard of such a thing  elmore desperately caught up the sheet of paper on which lily had written dear mr hoskins and groaning out well well he added        i have your letter come to the station tomorrow and say goodby      to her whom you will yet live to thank for remaining only                                                your friend                                                   elizabeth mayhew   there there that will do beautifullybeautifully oh thank you professor elmore ever and ever so much that will save his feelings and do everything said lily sitting down again to copy it while mrs elmore looking over her shoulder mingled her hysterical excitement with the girls and helped her out by sealing the note when it was finished and directed  it accomplished at least one purpose intended it kept hoskins away till the final moment and it brought him to the station for their adieux just before their train started a consciousness of the absurdity of his part gave his face a humorously rueful cast but he came pluckily to the mark he marched straight up to the girl its all right miss lily he said and offered her his hand which she had a strong impulse to cry over then he turned to mrs elmore and while he held her hand in his right he placed his left affectionately on elmores shoulder and looking at lily he said you ought to get miss lily to help you out with your history professor she has a very good stylequite a literary style i should have said if i hadnt known it was hers i dont like her subjects though they broke into a forlorn laugh together he wrung their hands once more without a word and without looking back limped out of the waitingroom and out of their lives  they did not know that this was really the last of hoskinsone never knows that any parting is the lastand in their inability to conceive of a serious passion in him they quickly consoled themselves for what he might suffer they knew how kindly how tenderly even they felt towards him and by that juggle with the emotions which we all practise at times they found comfort for him in the fact another interest another figure began to occupy the morbid fancy of elmore and as they approached peschiera his expectation became intense there was no reason why it should exist it would be by the thousandth chance even if ehrhardt were still there that they should meet him at the railroad station and there were a thousand chances that he was no longer in peschiera he could see that his wife and lily were restive too as the train drew into the station they nodded to each other and pointed out of the window as if to identify the spot where lily had first noticed him they laughed nervously and it seemed to elmore that he could not endure their laughter  during that long wait which the train used to make in the old austrian times at peschiera while the police authorities vis√©d the passports of those about to cross the frontier elmore continued perpetually alert he was aware that he should not know ehrhardt if he met him but he should know that he was present from the looks of lily and mrs elmore and he watched them they dined well in waiting while he impatiently trifled with the food and ate next to nothing and they calmly returned to their places in the train to which he remounted after a last despairing glance around the platform in a passion of disappointment the old longing not to be left so wholly to the effect of what he had done possessed him to the exclusion of all other sensations and as the train moved away from the station he fell back against the cushions of the carriage sick that he should never even have looked on the face of the man in whose destiny he had played so fatal a part   xiii  in america life soon settled into form about the daily duties of elmores place and the daily pleasures and cares which his wife assumed as a leader in patmos society their sojourn abroad conferred its distinction the day came when they regarded it as a brilliant episode and it was only by fitful glimpses that they recognized its essential dulness after they had been home a year or two elmore published his story of venice in the lives of her heroes which fell into a ready oblivion he paid all the expenses of the book and was puzzled that in spite of this the final settlement should still bring him in debt to his publishers he did not understand but he submitted and he accepted the failure of his book very meekly if he could have chosen he would have preferred that the saturday review which alone noticed it in london with three lines of exquisite slight should have passed it in silence but after all he felt that the book deserved no better fate he always spoke of it as unphilosophized and incomplete without any just claim to being  lily had returned to her sisters household but though she came home in the heyday of her young beauty she failed somehow to take up the story of her life just where she had left it in patmos on the way home she had refused an offer in london and shortly after her arrival in america she received a letter from a young gentleman whom she had casually seen in geneva and who had found exile insupportable since parting with her and was ready to return to his native land at her bidding but she said nothing of these proposals till long afterwards to professor elmore who she said had suffered enough from her offers she went to all the parties and picnics and had abundant opportunities of flirtation and marriage but she neither flirted nor married she seemed to have greatly sobered and the sound sense which she had always shown became more and more qualified with a thoughtful sweetness at first the relation between her and the elmores lost something of its intimacy but when after several years her health gave way a familiarity even kinder than before grew up she used to like to come to them and talk and laugh fondly over their old venetian days but often she sat pensive and absent in the midst of these memories and looked at elmore with a regard which he found hard to bear a gentle unconscious wonder it seemed in which he imagined a shade of tender reproach  when she recovered her health after a journey to the west one winter they saw that by some subtile and indefinable difference she was no longer a young girl perhaps it was because they had not met her for half a year but perhaps it was ageshe was now thirty however it was elmore recognized with a pang that the first youth at least had gone out of her voice and eyes she only returned to arrange for a long sojourn in the west she liked the climate and the people she said and she seemed well and happy she had planned starting a kindergarten school in omaha with another young lady she said that she wanted something to do she will end by marrying one of those western widowers said mrs elmore  i wonder she didnt take poor old hoskins mused elmore aloud  no you dont dear said his wife who had not grown less direct in dealing with him you know it would have been ridiculous besides she never cared anything for himshe couldnt you might as well wonder why she didnt take captain ehrhardt after you dismissed him  i dismissed him  you wrote to him didnt you  celia cried elmore this i cannot bear did i take a single step in that business without her request and your full approval didnt you both ask me to write  yes i suppose we did  suppose  well we didif you want me to say it and im not accusing you of anything i know you acted for the best but you can see yourself cant you that it was rather sudden to have it end so quickly  she did not finish her sentence or he did not hear the close in the miserable absence into which he lapsed celia he asked at last do you think sheshe had any feeling about him  oh cried his wife restively how should i know  i didnt suppose you knew he pleaded i asked if you thought so  what would be the use of thinking anything about it the matter cant be helped now if you inferred from anything she said to you  she told me repeatedly in answer to questions as explicit as i could make them that she wished him dismissed  well then very likely she did  very likely celia  yes at any rate its too late now  yes its too late now he was silent again and he began to walk the floor after his old habit without speaking he was always mute when he was in pain and he startled her with the anguish in which he now broke forth i give it up i give it up celia celia im afraid i did wrong yes im afraid that i spoiled two lives i ventured to lay my sacrilegious hands upon two hearts that a divine force was drawing together and put them asunder it was a lamentable blunderit was a crime  why owen how strangely you talk how could you have done any differently under the circumstances  oh i could have done very differently i might have seen him and talked with him brotherly face to face he was a fearless and generous soul and i was meanly scared for my wretched little decorums for my responsibility to her friends and i gave him no chance  we wouldnt let you give him any interrupted his wife  dont try to deceive yourself dont try to deceive me celia i know well enough that you would have been glad to have me show mercy and i would not even show him the poor grace of passing his offer in silence if i must refuse it i couldnt spare him even so much as that  we decidedwe both decidedthat it would be better to cut off all hope at once urged his wife  ah it was i who decided thatdecided everything leave me to deal honestly with myself at last celia i have tried long enough to believe that it was not i who did it the pentup doubt of years the longsilenced selfaccusal burst forth in his words oh i have suffered for it i thought he must come back somehow as long as we stayed in venice when we left peschiera without a glimpse of himi wonder i outlived it but even if i had seen him there what use would it have been would i have tried to repair the wrong done what did i do but impute unmanly and impudent motives to him when he seized his chance to see her once more at that masquerade  no no owen he was not the one lily was satisfied of that long ago it was nothing but a chance a coincidence perhaps it was some one he had told about the affair  no matter no matter if i thought it was he my blame is the same and she poor girlin my lying compassion for him i used to accuse her of coldheartedness of indifference i wonder she did not abhor the sight of me how has she ever tolerated the presence the friendship of a man who did her this irreparable wrong yes it has spoiled her life and it was my work no no celia you and she had nothing to do with it except as i forced your consentit was my work and however i have tried openly and secretly to shirk it i must bear this fearful responsibility  he dropped into a chair and hid his face in his hands while his wife soothed him with loving excuses for what he had done with tender protests against the exaggerations of his remorse she said that he had done the only thing he could do that lily wished it and that she never had blamed him why i dont believe she would ever have married captain ehrhardt anyhow she was full of that silly fancy of hers about dick burton all the timeyou know how she used always to be talking about him and when she came home and found she had outgrown him she had to refuse him and i suppose its that thats made her rather melancholy she explained that major burton had become extremely fat that his moustache was too big and black and his laugh too loud there was nothing left of him in fact but his empty sleeve and lily was too conscientious to marry him merely for that  in fact elmores regret did reflect a monstrous and distorted image of his conduct he had really acted the part of a prudent and conscientious man he was perfectly justifiable at every step but in the retrospect those steps which we can perfectly justify sometimes seem to have cost so terribly that we look back even upon our sinful stumblings with better heart heaven knows how such things will be at the last day but at that moment there was no wrong no folly of his youth of which elmore did not think with more comfort than of this passage in which he had been so wise and right  of course the time came when he saw it all differently again when his wife persuaded him that he had done the best that any one could do with the responsibilities that ought never to have been laid on a man of his temperament and habits when he even came to see that lilys feeling was a matter of pure conjecture with him and that so far as he knew she had never cared anything for ehrhardt yet he was glad to have her away he did not like to talk of her with his wife he did not think of her if he could help it  they heard from time to time through her sister that her little enterprise in omaha was prospering and that she was very contented out west at last they heard directly from her that she was going to be married till then elmore had been dumbly tormented in his sombre moods with the solution of a problem at which his imagination vainly toiledthe problem of how some day she and ehrhardt should meet again and retrieve the error of the past for him he contrived this encounter in a thousand different ways by a thousand different chances what he so passionately and sorrowfully longed for accomplished itself continually in his dreams but only in his dreams  in due course lily married and from all they could understand very happily her husband was a clergyman and she took particular interest in his parochial work which her good heart and clear head especially qualified her to share with him to connect her fate any longer with that of ehrhardt was now not only absurd it was improper yet elmore sometimes found his fancy forgetfully at work as before he could not at once realize that the tragedy of this romance such as it was remained to him alone except perhaps as ehrhardt shared it with him indeed elmore still sought to fret his remorse and keep it poignant and his final failure to do so made him ashamed but what lasting sorrow can one have from the disappointment of a man whom one has never seen if lily could console herself it seemed probable that ehrhardt too had got along     at the sign of the savage   as they bowled along in the deliberate german express train through the black forest colonel kenton said he had only two things against the region it was not black and it was not a forest he had all his life heard of the black forest and he hoped he knew what it was the inhabitants burned charcoal high up the mountains and carved toys in the winter when shut in by the heavy snows they had easter eggs all the year round with overshot millwheels in the valleys and cherrytrees all about always full of blossoms or ripe fruit just as you liked to think they were very poor people but very devout and lived in little villages on a friendly intimacy with their cattle the young women of these hamlets had each a long braid of yellow hair down her back blue eyes and a white bodice with a catscradle lacing behind the men had bellcrowned hats and spindlelegs they buttoned the breath out of their bodies with round pewter buttons on tight short crimson waistcoats  now here said the colonel breathing on the window of the car and rubbing a little space clear of the frost i see nothing of the sort either i have been imposed upon by what i have heard of the black forest or this is not the black forest im inclined to believe that there is no black forest and never was there isnt he added looking again so as not to speak hastily a charcoalburner or an easter egg or a cherry blossom or a yellow braid or a red waistcoat to enliven the whole desolate landscape what are we to think of it bessie  mrs kenton who sat opposite huddled in speechless comfort under her wraps and rugs and was just trying to decide in her own mind whether it was more delicious to let her feet now that they were thoroughly warm rest upon the carpetcovered cylinder of hot water or hover just a hairs breadth above it without touching it answered a little impatiently that she did not know in ordinary circumstances she would not have been so short with the colonels nonsense she thought that was the way all men talked when they got well acquainted with you and as coming from a sex incapable of seriousness she could have excused it if it had not interrupted her in her solution of so nice a problem colonel kenton however did not mind he at once possessed himself of much more than his share of the cylinder extorting a cry of indignation from his wife who now saw herself reduced from a fastidious choice of luxuries to a mere vulgar strife for the necessaries of lifea thing any woman abhors  well well said the colonel keep your old hotwater bottle if there was any other way of warming my feet i wouldnt touch it it makes me sick to use it i feel as if the doctor was going to order me some boneset tea give me a good redhot patent carheater that smells enough of burning iron to make your head ache in a minute and sets your car on fire as soon as it rolls over the embankment thats what i call comfort a hotwater bottle shoved under your feeti should suppose i was a woman and a feeble one at that ill tell you what i think about this black forest business bessie i think its part of a system of deception that runs through the whole german character i have heard the germans praised for their sincerity and honesty but i tell you they have got to work hard to convince me of it from this out i am on my guard i am not going to be taken in any more  it became the colonels pleasure to develop and exemplify this idea at all points of their progress through germany they were going to italy and as mrs kenton had had enough of the sea in coming to europe they were going to italy by the only allrail route then existingfrom paris to vienna and so down through the simmering to trieste and venice wherever they stopped whatever they did before reaching vienna colonel kenton chose to preserve his guarded attitude ah they pretend this is stuttgart do they he said on arriving at the suabian capital a likely story they pretended that was the black forest you know bessie at munich and this is munich he sneered whenever the conversation flagged during their sojourn its outrageous the way they let these swindling little towns palm themselves off upon the traveller for cities hes heard of this place will be calling itself berlin next when his wife guidebook in hand was struggling to heat her admiration at some cold history of kaulbach and in her failure clinging fondly to the fact that kaulbach had painted it kaulbach the colonel would exclaim and half close his eyes and slowly nod his head and smile what guidebook is that youve got bessie looking curiously at the volume he knew so well ohbaedeker and are you going to let a black forest dutchman like baedeker persuade you that this daub is by kaulbach come thats a little too much he rejected the birthplaces of famous persons one and all they could not drive through a street or into a park whose claims to be this or that street or park he did not boldly dispute and he visited a pitiless incredulity upon the dishes of the table dh√¥te concerning which he always answered his wifes questions oh he says its beef or veal or fowl as the case might be and though he never failed to relish his own dinner strange fears began to affect the appetite of mrs kenton it happened that he never did come out with these sneers before other travellers but his wife was always expecting him to do so and afterwards portrayed herself as ready to scream the whole time she was not a nervous person and regarding the colonels jokes as part of the matrimonial contract she usually bore them as i have hinted with severe composure accepting them all good bad and indifferent as something in the nature of man which she should understand better after they had been married longer the present journey was made just after the close of the war they had seen very little of each other while he was in the army and it had something of the fresh interest of a bridal tour but they sojourned only a day or two in the places between strasburg and vienna it was very cold and very unpleasant getting about and they instinctively felt what every wise traveller knows that it is folly to be lingering in germany when you can get into italy and so they hurried on  it was nine oclock one night when they reached salzburg and when their baggage had been visited and their passports examined they had still half an hour to wait before the train went on they profited by the delay to consider what hotel they should stop at in vienna and they advised with their bradshaw on the point this railway guide gave in its laconic fashion several hotels and specified the kaiserin elisabeth as one at which there was a table dh√¥te briefly explaining that at most hotels in vienna there was none  that settles it said mrs kenton we will go to the kaiserin elisabeth of course im sure i never want the bother of ordering dinner in english let alone german which never was meant for human beings to speak  its a language you cant tell the truth in said the colonel thoughtfully you cant call an open country an open country you have to call it a black forest mrs kenton sighed patiently but i dont know about this kaiserin elisabeth business how do we know thats the real name of the hotel how can we be sure that it isnt an alias an assumed name trumped up for the occasion i tell you bessie we cant be too cautious as long as were in this fatherland of lies what guidebook is this baedeker oh bradshaw well thats some comfort bradshaws an englishman at least if it had been baedeker  oh edward edward mrs kenton burst out will you never give that up here youve been harping on it for the last four days and worrying my life out with it i think its unkind its perfectly bewildering me i dont know where or what i am any more some tears of vexation started to her eyes at which colonel kenton put the shaggy arm of his overcoat round her and gave her an honest hug  well he said i give it up from this out though i shall always say that it was a joke that wore well and i can tell you bessie that its no small sacrifice to give up a joke that youve just got into prime working order so that you can use it on almost anything that comes up but thats a thing that you can never understand let it all pass well go to the kaiserin elisabeth and submit to any sort of imposition theyve a mind to practise upon us i shall not breathe freely i suppose till we get into italy where people mean what they say haw haw haw laughed the colonel honest iagos the man im after  the doors of the waitingroom were thrown open and cries of erste klasse zweite klasse dritte klasse summoned the variously assorted passengers to carriages of their several degrees the colonel lifted his little wife into a nonsmoking firstclass carriage and established her against the cushioned barrier dividing the two seats so that her feet could just reach the hotwater bottle as he called it and tucked her in and built her up so with wraps that she was a prodigy of comfort and then folding about him the long furlined coat which she had bought him at munich in spite of his many protests that the fur was artificial he sat down on the seat opposite and proudly enjoyed the perfect content that beamed from mrs kentons face looking so small from her heap of luxurious coverings  well bessie this would be very pleasantif you could believe in it he said as the train smoothly rolled out of the station but of course it cant be genuine there must be some dodge about it ive no doubt youll begin to feel perfectly horrid the first thing you know  mrs kenton let him go on as he did at some length and began to drowse while he amused himself with a gross parody of things she had said during the past four days in those years while their wedded bliss was yet practically new colonel kenton found his wife an inexhaustible source of mental refreshment he prized beyond measure the feminine inadequacy and excess of her sayings he had stored away such a variety of these that he was able to talk her personal parlance for an hour together indeed he had learned the trick of inventing phrases so much in her manner that mrs kenton never felt quite safe in disowning any monstrous thing attributed to her her drowse now became a little nap and presently a delicious doze in which she drifted far away from actual circumstance into a realm where she seemed to exist as a mere airy thought of her physical self suddenly she lost this thought and slept through all stops at stations and all changes of the hotwater cylinder to renew which the guard faithful to colonel kentons bribe alone opened the door  wake up bessie she heard her husband saying were at vienna  it seemed very improbable but she did not dispute it what time is it she asked as she suffered herself to be lifted from the carriage into the keen air of the winter night  three oclock said the colonel hurrying her into the waitingroom where she sat still somewhat remote from herself but getting nearer and nearer while he went off about the baggage now then he cried cheerfully when he returned and he led his wife out and put her into a fiacre the driver bent from his perch and arrested the colonel as he was getting in after mrs kenton with words in themselves unintelligible but so probably in demand for neglected instructions that the colonel said oh kaiserin elisabeth and again bowed his head towards the fiacre door when the driver addressed further speech to him so diffuse and so presumably unnecessary that colonel kenton merely repeated with rising impatience kaiserin elisabethkaiserin elisabeth i tell you and getting in shut the fiacre door after him  the driver remained a moment in mumbled soliloquy then he smacked his whip and drove rapidly away they were aware of nothing outside but the starlit winter morning in unknown streets till they plunged at last under an archway and drew up at a sort of lodge door from which issued an example of the universal goldcapbanded continental hotel portier so like all others in europe that it seemed idle for him to be leading an individual existence he took the colonels passport and summoned a waiter who went bowing before them up a staircase more or less grandiose and led them to a pleasant chamber whither he sent directly a woman servant she bade them a hearty good morning in her tongue and kneeling down before the tall porcelain stove kindled from her apronful of blocks and sticks a fire that soon penetrated the travellers with a rich comfort it was of course too early yet to think of breakfast but it was fortunately not too late to think of sleep they were both very tired and it was almost noon when they woke the colonel had the fire rekindled and he ordered breakfast to be served them in their room beefsteak and coffeehere he said pointing to the table and as he made mrs kenton snug near the stove he expatiated in her own terms upon the perfect loveliness of the whole affair and the touch of nature that made coffee and beefsteak the same in every language it seemed that the kaiserin elisabeth knew how to serve such a breakfast in faultless taste and they sat long over it in that sense of sovereign satisfaction which beefsteak and coffee in your own room can best give at last the colonel rose briskly and announced the order of the day they were to go here they were to stop there they were to see this they were to do that  nothing of the kind said mrs kenton i am not going out at all today its too cold and if we are to push on to trieste tomorrow i shall need the whole day to get a little rested besides i have some jobs of mending to do that cant be put off any longer  the colonel listened with an air of joyous admiration bessie said he this is inspiration i dont want to see their old town and i shall ask nothing better than to spend the day with you here at our own fireside you can sew and iill read to you bessie this was a little too gross even mrs kenton laughed at this the act of reading being so abhorrent to colonel kentons active temperament that he was notorious for his avoidance of all literature except newspapers in about ten minutes passed in an agreeable idealization of his purpose which came in that time to include the perusal of all the books on italy he had picked up on their journey the colonel said he would go down and ask the portier if they had the new york papers  when he returned somewhat disconsolate to say they had not and had apparently never heard of the herald or tribune his wife smiled subtly then i suppose youll have to go to the consuls for them  why bessie it isnt a thing i should have suggested i cant bear the thoughts of leaving you here alone but as you say no ill tell you ill not go for the new york papers but i will just step round and call upon the representative of the countrypay my respects to him you knowif you wish it but id far rather spend the time here with you bessie in our cosy little boudoir i would indeed  mrs kenton now laughed outright andit was a tremendous sarcasm for herasked him if he were not afraid the example of the black forest was becoming infectious  oh come now bessie no joking pleaded the colonel in mock distress ill tell you what my dear the head waiter here speaks english like aan ollendorff and if you get to feeling a little lonesome while im out you can just ring and order something from him you know it will cheer you up to hear the sound of your native tongue in a foreign land but pshaw i shant be gone a minute  by this time the colonel had got on his overcoat and gloves and had his hat in one hand and was leaning over his wife resting the other hand on the back of the chair in which she sat warming the toes of her slippers at the draft of the stove she popped him a cheery little kiss on his mustache and gave him a small push stay as long as you like ned i shall not be in the least lonesome i shall do my mending and then i shall take a nap and by that time it will be dinner you neednt come back before dinner what hour is the table dh√¥te  oh cried the colonel guiltily the fact is i wasnt going to tell you i thought it would vex you so much there is no table dh√¥te here and never was bradshaw has been depraved by the moral atmosphere of germany id as soon trust baedeker after this  well never mind said mrs kenton we can tell them to bring us what they like for dinner and we can have it whenever we like  bessie exclaimed the colonel i have not done justice to you and i supposed i had i knew how bright and beautiful you were but i didnt think you were so amiable i didnt indeed this is a real surprise he said getting out at the door he opened it to add that he would be back in an hour and then he went his way with the light heart of a husband who has a day to himself with his wifes full approval  at the consulate a still greater surprise awaited colonel kenton this was the consul himself who proved to be an old companioninarms and into whose awful presence the colonel was ushered by a hausmeister in a cocked hat and a goldbraided uniform finer than that of all the american majorgenerals put together the friends both shouted hollo and you dont say so and threw back their heads and laughed  why didnt you know i was here demanded the consul when the hard work of greeting was over i thought everybody knew that  oh i knew you were rusting out in some of these dutch towns but i never supposed it was vienna but that doesnt make any difference so long as you are here at this they smacked each other on the knees and laughed again that carried them by a very rough point in their astonishment and they now composed themselves to the pleasure of telling each other how they happened to be then and there with glances at their personal history when they were making it together in the field  well now what are you going to do the rest of the day asked the consul at last with a look at his watch as i understand it you re going to spend it with me somehow the question is how would you like to spend it  this is a handsome offer davis but i dont see how im to manage exactly replied the colonel for the first time distinctly recalling the memory of mrs kenton my wife wouldnt know what had become of me you know  oh yes she would retorted the consul with a bachelors ignorant ease of mind on a point of that kind well go round and take her with us  the colonel gravely shook his head she wouldnt go old fellow shes in for a days rest and odd jobs ill tell you what ill just drop round and let her know ive found you and then come back again youll dine with us wont you colonel kenton had not always found old comradeship a bond between mrs kenton and his friends but he believed he could safely chance it with davis whom she had always rather likedwith such small regard as a ladys devotion to her husband leaves her for his friends  oh ill dine with you fast enough said his friend but why dont you send a note to mrs kenton to say that well be round together and save yourself the bother did you come here alone  bless your heart no i forgot him the poor devils out there cooling his heels on your stairs all this time i came with a complete guide to vienna cant you let him in out of the weather a minute  well have him in so that he can take your note back but he doesnt expect to be decently treated they dont here you just sit down and write it said the consul pushing the colonel into his own chair before his desk and when the colonel had superscribed his note he called in the lohndienerpatient hat in handand where are you stopping he asked the colonel  oh i forgot that at the kaiserin elisabeth ill just write it  never mind well tell him where to take it see here added the consul in a serviceable viennese german of his own construction take this to the kaiserin elisabeth quick and as the man looked up in a dull surprise do you hear the kaiserin elisabeth  i dont know what it is about that hotel said the colonel when the man had meekly bowed himself away with a hat that swept the ground in honor of a handsome drinkmoney but the mention of it always seems to awaken some sort of reluctance in the minds of the lower classes our driver wanted to enter into conversation with me about it this morning at three oclock and i had to be pretty short with him if you dont know the language it isnt so difficult to be short in german as ive heard and another curious thing is that bradshaw says the kaiserin elisabeth has a table dh√¥te and the headwaiter says she hasnt and never did have  oh you cant trust anybody in europe said the consul sententiously id leave bradshaw and the waiter to fight it out among themselves well get back in time to order a dinner its always better and then we can dine alone and have a good time  they couldnt keep us from having a good time at a table dh√¥te even but i dont mind  by this time they had got on their hats and coats and sallied forth they first went to a caf√© and had some of that famous viennese coffee and then they went to the imperial and municipal arsenals and viewed those collections of historical bricabrac including the head of the unhappy turkish general who was strangled by his sovereign because he failed to take vienna in 1683 this from familiarity had no longer any effect upon the consul but it gave colonel kenton prolonged pause i should have preferred a subordinate position in the sultans army i believe he said why davis what a museum we could have had out of the army of the potomac alone if lincoln had been as particular as that sultan  from the arsenals they went to visit the paradeground of the garrison and came in time to see a manoeuvre of the troops at which they looked with the frank respect and reserved superiority with which our veterans seem to regard the military of europe then they walked about and noted the principal monuments of the city and strolled along the promenades and looked at the handsome officers and the beautiful women colonel kenton admired the life and the gay movement everywhere since leaving paris he had seen nothing so much like new york but he did not like their shovelling up the snow into carts everywhere and dumping all that fine sleighing into the danube by the way said his friend lets go over into leopoldstadt and see if we cant scare up a sleigh for a little turn in the suburbs  its getting late isnt it asked the colonel  not so late as it looks you know we havent the high american sun here  colonel kenton was having such a good time that he felt no trouble about his wife sitting over her mending in the kaiserin elisabeth and he yielded joyfully thinking how much she would like to hear about the suburbs of vienna a husband will go through almost any pleasure in order to give his wife an entertaining account of it afterwards besides a bachelor companionship is confusing it makes many things appear right and feasible which are perhaps not so it was not till their driver who had turned out of the beaten track into a wayside drift to make room for another vehicle attempted to regain the road by too abrupt a movement and the shafts of their sledge responded with a loud crickcrack that colonel kenton perceived the error into which he had suffered himself to be led at three miles distance from the city and with the winter twilight beginning to fall he felt the pang of a sudden remorse it grew sorer with every homeward step and with each successive failure to secure a conveyance for their return in fine they trudged back to leopoldstadt where an absurd series of discomfitures awaited them in their attempts to get a fiacre over into the main city they visited all the stands known to the consul and then they were obliged to walk but they were not tired and they made their distance so quickly that colonel kentons spirits rose again he was able for the first time to smile at their misadventure and some misgivings as to how mrs kenton might stand affected towards a guest under the circumstances yielded to the thought of how he should make her laugh at them both good old davis mused the colonel and affectionately linked his arm through that of his friend and they stamped through the brilliantly lighted streets gay with uniforms and the picturesque costumes with which the levant at vienna encounters the london and paris fashions suddenly the consul arrested their movement didnt you say you were stopping at the kaiserin elisabeth  why yes certainly  well its just around the corner here the consul turned him about and in another minute they walked under an archway into a courtyard and were met by the portier at the door of his room with an inquiring obeisance  colonel kenton started the cap and the capband were the same and it was to all intents and purposes the same portier who had bowed him away in the morning but the face was different on noting this fact colonel kenton observed so general a change in the appointments and even architecture of the place that old fellow he said to the consul youve made a little mistake this isnt the kaiserin elisabeth  the consul referred the matter to the portier perfectly that was the kaiserin elisabeth well then said the colonel tell him to have us shown to my room the portier discovered a certain embarrassment when the colonels pleasure was made known to him and ventured something in reply which made the consul smile  look here kenton he said youve made a little mistake this time youre not stopping at the kaiserin elisabeth  oh pshaw come now dont bring the consular dignity so low as to enter into a practical joke with a hotel porter it wont do we got into vienna this morning at three and drove straight to the kaiserin elisabeth we had a room and fire and breakfast about noon tell him who i am and what i say  the consul did so the portier slowly and respectfully shaking his head at every point when it came to the name he turned to his books and shook his head yet more impressively then he took down a letter spelled its address and handed it to the colonel it was his own note to mrs kenton that quite crushed him he looked at it in a dull mechanical way and nodded his head with compressed lips then he scanned the portier and glanced round once more at the bedevilled architecture well said he at last theres a mistake somewhere unless there are two kaiserin elisabeths davis ask him if there are two kaiserin elisabeths  the consul compassionately put the question received with something like grief by the portier impossible  then im not stopping at either of them continued the colonel so far so goodif you want to call it good the question is now if im not stopping at the kaiserin elisabeth he demanded with sudden heat and raising his voice how the devil did i get there  the consul at this broke into a fit of laughter so violent that the portier retired a pace or two from these maniacs and took up a safe position within his doorway you didntyou didntget there shrieked the consul thats what made the whole trouble youyou meant well but you got somewhere else he took out his handkerchief and wiped the tears from his eyes  the colonel did not laugh he had no real pleasure in the joke on the contrary he treated it as a serious business very well said he it will be proved next that i never told that driver to take me to the kaiserin elisabeth as it appears that i never got there and am not stopping there will you be good enough to tell me he asked with polished sarcasm where i am stopping and why and how  i wish with all my heart i could gasped his friend catching his breath but i cant and the only way is to go round to the principal hotels till we hit the right one it wont take long come he passed his arm through that of the colonel and made an explanation to the portier as if accounting for the vagaries of some harmless eccentric he had in charge then he pulled his friend gently away who yielded after a survey of the portier and the courtyard with a frown in which an indignant sense of injury quite eclipsed his former bewilderment he had still this defiant air when they came to the next hotel and used the portier with so much severity on finding that he was not stopping there either that the consul was obliged to protest if you behave in that way kenton i wont go with you the mans perfectly innocent of your stopping at the wrong place and some of these hotel people know me and i wont stand your bullying them and i tell you what youve got to let me have my laugh out too you know the things perfectly ridiculous and theres no use putting any other face on it the consul did not wait for leave to have his laugh out but had it out in a series of furious gusts at last the colonel himself joined him ruefully  of course said he i know im an ass and i wouldnt mind it on my own account i would as soon roam round after that hotel the rest of the night as not but i cant help feeling anxious about my wife im afraid shell be getting very uneasy at my being gone so long shes all alone there wherever it is and  well but shes got your note shell understand  what a fool you are davis theres my note cried the colonel opening his fist and showing a very small wad of paper in his palm shed have got my note if shed been at the kaiserin elisabeth but shes no more there than i am  oh said his friend sobered at this to be sure well  well its no use trying to tell a man like you but i suppose that shes simply distracted by this time you dont know what a woman is and how she can suffer about a little matter when she gives her mind to it  oh said the consul again very contritely im very sorry i laughed buthere he looked into the colonels gloomy face with a countenance contorted with agonythis only makes it the more ridiculous you know and he reeled away drunk with the mirth which filled him from head to foot but he repented again and with a superhuman effort so far subdued his transports as merely to quake internally and tremble all over as he led the way to the next hotel arm in arm with the bewildered and embittered colonel he encouraged the latter with much genuine sympathy and observed a proper decorum in his interviews with one portier after another formulating the colonels story very neatly and explaining at the close that this american herr who had arrived at vienna before daylight and directed his driver to take him to the kaiserin elisabeth and had left his hotel at one oclock in the belief that it was the kaiserin elisabeth felt now an added eagerness to know what his hotel really was from the circumstance that his wife was there quite alone and in probable distress at his long absence at first colonel kenton took a lively interest in this statement of his case and prompted the consul with various remarks and substatements he was grateful for the compassion generally shown him by the portiers and he strove with himself to give some account of the exterior and locality of his mysterious hotel but the fact was that he had not so much as looked behind him when he quitted it and knew nothing about its appearance and gradually the reiteration of the points of his misadventure to one portier after another began to be as a tale of little meaning though the words are strong his personation of an american herr in great trouble of mind was an entire failure except as illustrating the national apathy of countenance when under the influence of strong emotion he ceased to take part in the consuls efforts in his behalf the whole abominable affair seemed as far beyond his forecast or endeavor as some result of malign enchantment and there was no such thing as carrying off the tragedy with selfrespect distressing as it was there could be no question but it was entirely ridiculous he hung his head with shame before the portiers at being a party to it he no longer felt like resenting daviss amusement he only wondered that he could keep his face in relating the idiotic mischance each successive failure to discover his lodging confirmed him in his humiliation and despair very likely there was a way out of the difficulty but he did not know it he became at last almost an indifferent spectator of the consuls perseverance he began to look back with incredulity at the period of his life passed before entering the fatal fiacre that morning he received the final portiers rejection with something like a personal derision  thats the last place i can think of said the consul wiping his brow as they emerged from the courtyard for he had grown very warm with walking so much  oh all right said the colonel languidly  but we wont give it up lets go in here and get some coffee and think it over a bit they were near one of the principal caf√©s which was full of people smoking and drinking the viennese m√©lange out of tumblers  by all means assented colonel kenton with inconsequent courtliness think it over its all thats left us  matters did not look so dark quite after a tumbler of coffee with milk but they did not continue to brighten so much as they ought with the cigars now let us go through the facts of the case said the consul and the colonel wearily reproduced his original narrative with every possible circumstance but you know all about it he concluded i dont see any end of it i dont see but im to spend the rest of my life in hunting up a hotel that professes to be the kaiserin elisabeth and isnt i never knew anything like it  it certainly has the charm of novelty gloomily assented the consul it must be owned that his gloom was a respectful feint i have heard of men running away from their hotels but i never did hear of a hotel running away from a man before now yeshold on i have too aladdins palaceand with mrs aladdin in it at that its a parallel case here he abandoned himself as usual while colonel kenton viewed his mirth with a dreary grin when he at last caught his breath i beg your pardon i do indeed the consul implored i know just how you feel but of course its coming out right weve been to all the hotels i know of but there must be others well get some more names and start at once and if the genie has dropped your hotel anywhere this side of africa we shall find it if the worst comes to the worst you can stay at my house tonight and start new tomoh i forgotmrs kenton really the whole thing is such an amusing muddle that i cant seem to get over it he looked at kenton with tears in his eyes but contained himself and decorously summoned a waiter who brought him whatever corresponds to a city directory in vienna there he said when he had copied into his notebook a number of addresses i dont think your hotel will escape us this time and discharging his account he led the way to the door colonel kenton listlessly following  the wretched husband was now suffering all the anguish of a just remorse and the heartlessness of his behavior in going off upon his own pleasure the whole afternoon and leaving his wife alone in a strange hotel to pass the time as she might was no less a poignant reproach because it seemed so inconceivable in connection with what he had always taken to be the kindness and unselfishness of his character we all know the sensation and i know none on the whole so disagreeable so little flattering so persistent when once it has established itself in the illdoers consciousness to find out that you are not so good or generous or magnanimous as you thought is next to having other people find it out probably the unfriendliest discovery that can be made but i suppose it has its uses colonel kenton now saw the unhandsomeness of his leaving his wife at all and he beheld in its true light his shabbiness in not going back to tell her he had found his old friend and was to bring him to dinner the lohndiener would of course have taken him straight to his hotel and he would have been spared this shameful exposure which he knew well enough davis would never forget but would tell all his life with an everincreasing garniture of fiction he cursed his weakness in allowing himself to dawdle about those arsenals and that paradeground and to be so far misguided by a hardened bachelor as to admire certain yellowhaired german and blackhaired hungarian women on the promenade when he came to think of going out in that sledge it was with anathema maranatha he groaned in spirit but he owned that he was rightly punished though it seemed hard that his wife should be punished too and then he went on miserably to figure first her slight surprise at his being gone so long then her vague uneasiness and her conjectures then her dawning apprehensions and her helplessness her probable sending to the consulate to find out what had become of him her dismay at learning nothing of him there her waiting and waiting in wild dismay as the moments and hours went by her frenzied running to the door at every step and her despair when it proved not his he had seen her suffering from less causes and where was she in what low shabby tavern had he left her he choked with rage and grief and could hardly speak to the gentleman a naturalized fellowcitizen of vienna to whom he found the consul introducing him  i wonder if you cant help us said the consul my friend here is the victim of a curious annoyance and he stated the case in language so sympathetic and decorous as to restore some small shreds of the colonels selfrespect  ah said their new acquaintance who was mercifully not a man of humor or too polite to seem so thats another trick of those scamps of fiacredrivers he took you purposely to the wrong hotel and was probably feed by the landlord for bringing you but why should you make yourselves so much trouble you know colonel kentons landlord had to send his name to the police as soon as he came and you can get his address there at once  goodby said the consul very hastily with a crestfallen air come along kenton  what did he send my name to the police for demanded the colonel in the open air  oh its a form they do it with all travellers its merely to secure the imperial government against your machinations  and do you mean to say you ought to have known cried the colonel halting him that you could have found out where i was from the police at once before we had walked all over this moral vineyard and wasted half a precious lifetime  kenton contritely admitted the other i never happened to think of it  well davis youre a pretty consul that was all the colonel said and though his friend was voluble in selfexculpation and condemnation he did not answer him a word till they arrived at the police office a few brief questions and replies between the commissary and the consul solved the long mystery and colonel kenton had once more a hotel over his head the commissary certified to the respectability of the place but invited the colonel to prosecute the driver of the fiacre in behalf of the general publicwhich seemed so right a thing that the colonel entered into it with zeal and then suddenly relinquished it remembering that he had not the rogues number that he had not so much as looked at him and that he knew no more what manner of man he was than his own image in a glass under the circumstances the commissary admitted that it was impossible and as to bringing the landlord to justice nothing could be proved against him  will you ask him said the colonel the outside price of a firstclass assault and battery in vienna  the consul put as much of this idea into german as the language would contain which was enough to make the commissary laugh and shake his head warningly  it wouldnt do he says kenton it isnt the custom of the country  very well then i dont see why we should occupy his time he gave his hand to the commissary whom he would have liked to embrace and then hurried forth again with the consul there is one little thing that worries me still he said i suppose mrs kenton is simply crazy by this time  is she of a verynervousdisposition faltered the consul  nervous well if you could witness the expression of her emotions in regard to mice you wouldnt ask that question davis  at this desolating reply the consul was mute for a moment then he ventured ive heardor read i dont know whichthat women have more real fortitude than men and that they find a kind of moral support in an actual emergency that they wouldnt find inmice  pshaw answered the colonel you wait till you see mrs kenton  look here kenton said the consul seriously and stopping short ive been thinking that perhapsii had better dine with you some other day the fact is the situation now seems so purely domestic that a third person you know  come along cried the colonel i want you to help me out of this scrape im going to leave that hotel as soon as i can put my things together and youve got to browbeat the landlord for me while i go up and reassure my wife long enough to get her out of that den of thieves what did you say the scoundrelly name was  the gasthof zum wilden manne  and what does wildun manny mean  the sign of the savage we should make it i supposethe wild man  well i dont know whether it was named after me or not but if id found that sign anywhere for the last four or five hours i should have known it for home there hasnt been any wilder man in vienna since the town was laid out i reckon and i dont believe there ever was a wilder woman anywhere than mrs kenton is at this instant  arrived at the sign of the savage colonel kenton left his friend below with the portier and mounting the stairs three steps at a time flew to his room flinging open the door he beheld his wife dressed in one of her best silks before the mirror bestowing some last prinks touching her back hair with her hand and twitching the bow at her throat into perfect place she smiled at him in the glass and said wheres captain davis  captain davis gasped the colonel drytongued with anxiety and fatigue oh hes down there hell be up directly  she turned and came forward to him how do you like it then she advanced near enough to encounter the moustache why how heated and tired you look  yes yesweve been walking iim rather late aint i bessie  about an hour i ordered dinner at six and its nearly seven now the colonel started he had not dared to look at his watch and he had supposed it must be about ten oclock it seemed years since his search for the hotel had begun but he said nothing he felt that in some mysterious and unmerited manner heaven was having mercy upon him and he accepted the grace in the sneaking way we all accept mercy i knew youd stay longer than you expected when you found it was davis  how did you know it was davis asked the colonel blindly feeling his way  mrs kenton picked up her almanach de gotha it has all the consular and diplomatic corps in it  i wont laugh at it any more said the colonel humbly werent youuneasy bessie  no i mended away here and fussed round the whole afternoon putting the trunks to rights and i got out this dress and ran a bit of lace into the collar and then i ordered dinner for i knew youd bring the captain and i took a nap and by that it was nearly dinnertime  oh said the colonel  yes and the headwaiter was as polite as peas theyve all been very attentive i shall certainly recommend everybody to the kaiserin elisabeth  yes assented the wretched man i reckon its about the best hotel in vienna  well now go and get captain davis you can bring him right in here were only travellers why what makes you act so queerly has anything happened mrs kenton was surprised to find herself gathered into her husbands arms and embraced with a rapture for which she could see no particular reason  bessie said her husband i told you this morning that you were amiable as well as bright and beautiful i now wish to add that you are sensible im awfully ashamed of being gone so long but the fact is we had a little accident our sleigh broke down out in the country and we had to walk back  oh you poor old fellow no wonder you look tired  he accepted the balm of her compassion like a candid and innocent man yes it was pretty rough but i didnt mind it except on your account i thought the delay would make you uneasy with that he went out to the head of the stairs and called davis  yes responded the consul and he ascended the stairs in such trepidation that he tripped and fell part of the way up  have you been saying anything to that man about my going away  no ive simply been blowing him up on the fiacre drivers account he swears they are innocent of collusion but of course theyre not  well all right mrs kenton is waiting for us to go to dinner and look here whispered the colonel dont you open your mouth except to put something into it till i give you the cue  the dinner was charming and had suffered little or nothing from the delay mrs kenton was in raptures with it and after a thimbleful of the good hungarian wine had attuned her tongue she began to sing the praises of the kaiserin elisabeth  the k began the consul who had hitherto guarded himself very well but the colonel arrested him at that letter with a terrible look he returned the look with a glance of intelligence and resumed the kaiserin elisabeth has the best cook in vienna  and everybody about has such nice honest faces said mrs kenton im sure i couldnt have felt anxious if you hadnt come till midnight i knew i was perfectly secure here  quite right quite right said the consul all classes of the viennese are so faithful now i dare say you could have trusted that driver of yours who brought you here before daylight this morning with untold gold no stranger need fear any of the tricks ordinarily practised upon travellers in vienna they are a truthful honest virtuous populationlike all the germans in fact  there ned what do you say to that with your black forest nonsense triumphed mrs kenton  colonel kenton laughed sheepishly well i take it all back bessie i wasnt quite satisfied with the appearance of the black forest country when i came to it he explained to the consul and mrs kenton and i had our little joke about the fraudulent nature of the germans  our little joke retorted his wife i wish we were going to stay longer in vienna they say you have to make bargains for everything in italy and here i suppose i could shop just as at home  precisely said the consul the viennese shopkeepers being the most notorious jews in europe  oh we cant stop longer than till the morning remarked the colonel i shall be sorry to leave vienna and the kaiserin elizabeth but we must go  better hang on awhile you wont find many hotels like it kenton observed his friend  no i suppose not sighed the colonel but ill get the address of their correspondent in venice and stop there  thus these craven spirits combined to delude and deceive the helpless woman of whom half an hour before they had stood in such abject terror if they had found her in hysterics they would have pitied and respected her but her good sense her amiability and noble selfcontrol subjected her to their shameless mockery  colonel kenton followed the consul downstairs when he went away and pretended to justify himself ill tell her one of these days he said but theres no use distressing her now  i didnt understand you at first said the other but i see now it was the only way  yes saves needless suffering i say davis this is about an even thing between us a united states consul ought to be of some use to his fellowcitizens abroad and if he allows them to walk their legs off hunting up a hotel which he could have found at the first policestation if he had happened to think of it he wont be very anxious to tell the joke i suppose  i dont propose to write home to the papers about it  all right so in the courtyard of the wild man they parted  long after that mrs kenton continued to recommend people to the kaiserin elisabeth even when the truth was made known to her she did not see much to laugh at im sure i was always very glad the colonel didnt tell me at once she said for if i had known what i had been through i certainly should have gone distracted     tonellis marriage   there was no richer man in venice than tommaso tonelli who had enough on his florin a day and none younger than he who owned himself fortyseven years old he led the cheerfullest life in the world and was quite a monster of content but when i come to sum up his pleasures i fear that i shall appear to my readers to be celebrating a very insipid and monotonous existence i doubt if even a summary of his duties could be made attractive to the conscientious imagination of hardworking people for tonellis labors were not killing nor for that matter were those of any venetian that i ever knew he had a stated employment in the office of the notary cenarotti and he passed there so much of every working day as lies between nine and five oclock writing upon deeds and conveyances and petitions and other legal instruments for the notary who sat in an adjoining room secluded from nearly everything in this world but snuff he called tonelli by the sound of a little bell and when he turned to take a paper from his safe he seemed to be abstracting some secret from longlapsed centuries which he restored again and locked back among the dead ages when his clerk replaced the document in his hands these hands were very soft and pale and their owner was a colorless old man whose silvery hair fell down a face nearly as white but as he has almost nothing to do with the present affair i shall merely say that having been compromised in the last revolution he had been obliged to live ever since in perfect retirement and that he seemed to have been blanched in this social darkness as a plant is blanched by growth in a cellar his enemies said that he was naturally a timid man but they could not deny that he had seen things to make the brave afraid or that he had now every reason from the police to be secret and cautious in his life he could hardly be called company for tonelli who must have found the day intolerably long but for the visit which the notarys pretty granddaughter contrived to pay every morning in the cheerless mezz√† she commonly appeared on some errand from her mother but her chief business seemed to be to share with tonelli the modest feast of rumor and hearsay which he loved to furnish forth for her and from which doubtless she carried back some fragments of gossip to the family apartments tonelli called her with that mingled archness and tenderness of the venetians his paronsina and as he had seen her grow up from the smallest possible of little mistresses there was no shyness between them and they were fully privileged to each others society by her mother when she flitted away again tonelli was left to a stillness broken only by the soft breathing of the old man in the next room and by the shrill discourse of his own loquacious pen so that he was commonly glad enough when it came five oclock at this hour he put on his black coat that shone with constant use and his faithful silk hat worn down to the pasteboard with assiduous brushing and caught up a very jaunty cane in his hand then saluting the notary he took his way to the little restaurant where it was his custom to dine and had his tripe soup and his risotto or dish of fried liver in the austere silence imposed by the presence of a few poor austrian captains and lieutenants it was not that the italians feared to be overheard by these enemies but it was good dimostrazione to be silent before the oppressor and not let him know that they even enjoyed their dinners well enough under his government to chat sociably over them to tell the truth this duty was an irksome one to tonelli who liked far better to dine as he sometimes did at a cookshop where he met the folk of the people gente del popolo as he called them and where though himself a person of civil condition he discoursed freely with the other guests and ate of their humble but relishing fare he was known among them as sior tommaso and they paid him a homage which they enjoyed equally with him as a person not only learned in the law but a poet of gift enough to write wedding and funeral verses and a veteran who had fought for the dead republic of fortyeight they honored him as a most travelled gentleman who had been in the tyrol and who could have spoken german if he had not despised that tongue as the language of the ugly croats like one born to it who for example spoke venetian more elegantly than sior tommaso or tuscan when he chose and yet he was poora man of that genius patience when garibaldi came we should see the facchini and gondoliers who had been wagging their tongues all day at the church corners and ferries were never tired of talking of this gifted friend of theirs when having ended some impressive discourse or some dramatic story he left them with a sudden adieu and walked quickly away toward the riva degli schiavoni  here whether he had dined at the cookshop or at his more genteel and gloomy restaurant of the bronze horses it was his custom to lounge an hour or two over a cup of coffee and a virginia cigar at one of the many caff√®s and to watch all the world as it passed to and fro on the quay tonelli was gray he did not disown it but he always maintained that his heart was still young and that there was moreover a great difference in persons as to age which told in his favor so he loved to sit there and look at the ladies and he amused himself by inventing a pet name for every face he saw which he used to teach to certain friends of his when they joined him over his coffee these friends were all young enough to be his sons and wise enough to be his fathers but they were always glad to be with him for he had so cheery a wit and so good a heart that neither his years nor his follies could make any one sad his kind face beamed with smiles when pennellini chief among the youngsters in his affections appeared on the top of the nearest bridge and thence descended directly towards his little table then it was that he drew out the straw which ran through the centre of his long virginia and lighted the pleasant weed and gave himself up to the delight of making aloud those comments on the ladies which he had hitherto stifled in his breast sometimes he would feign himself too deeply taken with a passing beauty to remain quiet and would make his friend follow with him in chase of her to the public gardens but he was a fickle lover and wanted presently to get back to his caff√® where at decent intervals of days or weeks he would indulge himself in discovering a spy in some harmless stranger who in going out looked curiously at the scar tonellis cheek had brought from the battle of vicenza in 1848  something of a spy no he asked at these times of the waiter who flattered by the penetration of a frequenter of his caff√® and the implication that it was thought seditious enough to be watched by the police assumed a pensive importance and answered something of a spy certainly  upon this tonelli was commonly encouraged to proceed did i ever tell you how i once sent one of those ugly muzzles out of a caff√® i knew him as soon as i saw himi am never mistaken in a spyand i went with my newspaper and sat down close at his side then i whispered to him across the sheet we are two eh says he it is a very small caff√® and there is no need of more than one and then i stared at him and frowned he looks at me fixedly a moment then gathers up his hat and gloves and takes his pestilency off  the waiter who had heard this story man and boy a hundred times made a quite successful show of enjoying it as he walked away with tonellis fee of half a cent in his pocket tonelli then had left from his days salary enough to pay for the ice which he ate at ten oclock but which he would sometimes forego in order to give the money in charity though more commonly he indulged himself and put off the beggar with another time my dear i have no leisure now to discuss those matters with thee  on holidays this routine of tonellis life was varied in the forenoon he went to mass at st marks to see the beauty and fashion of the city and then he took a walk with his four or five young friends or went with them to play at bowls or even made an excursion to the main land where they hired a carriage and all those venetians got into it like so many seamen and drove the horse with as little mercy as if he had been a sailboat at seven oclock tonelli dined with the notary next whom he sat at table and for whom his quaint pleasantries had a zest that inspired the paronsina and her mother to shout them into his dull ears that he might lose none of them he laughed a kind of faded laugh at them and rubbing his pale hands together showed by his act that he did not think his best wine too good for his kindly guest the signora feigned to take the same delight shown by her father and daughter in tonellis drolleries but i doubt if she had a great sense of his humor or indeed cared anything for it save as she perceived that it gave pleasure to those she loved otherwise however she had a sincere regard for him for he was most useful and devoted to her in her quality of widowed mother and if she could not feel wit she could feel gratitude which is perhaps the rarer gift if not the more respectable  the little mistress was dependent upon him for nearly all the pleasures and for the only excitements of her life as a young girl she was at best a sort of caged bird who had to be guarded against the youth of the other sex as if they on their part were so many marauding and ravening cats during most days of the year the paronsinas parrot had almost as much freedom as she he could leave his gilded prison when he chose and promenade the notarys house as far down as the marble well in the sunless court and the paronsina could do little more the signora would as soon have thought of letting the parrot walk across their campo alone as her daughter though the local dangers either to bird or beauty could not have been very great the greengrocer of that sequestered campo was an old woman the apothecary was gray and his shop was haunted by none but superannuated physicians the baker the butcher the waiters at the caff√® were all professionally and as purveyors to her family out of the question the sacristan who sometimes appeared at the perruquiers to get a coal from under the curlingtongs to kindle his censer had but one eye which he kept single to the service of the church and his perquisite of candledrippings and i hazard little in saying that the paronsina might have danced a polka around campo san giuseppe without jeopardy so far as concerned the handsome woodcarver for his wife always sat in the shop beside him nevertheless a custom is not idly handed down by mother to daughter from the dawn of christianity to the middle of the nineteenth century and i cannot deny that the local perruquier though stricken in years was still so far kept fresh by the immortal youth of the wax heads in his window as to have something beauish about him or that just at the moment the paronsina chanced to go into the campo alone a leone from florians might not have been passing through it when he would certainly have looked boldly at her perhaps spoken to her and possibly pounced at once upon her fluttering heart so by day the paronsina rarely went out and she never emerged unattended from the silence and shadow of her grandfathers house  if i were here telling a story of the paronsina or indeed any story at all i might suffer myself to enlarge somewhat upon the daily order of her secluded life and show how the seclusion of other venetian girls was the widest liberty as compared with hers but i have no right to play with the readers patience in a performance that can promise no excitement of incident no charm of invention let him figure to himself if he will the ancient and halfruined palace in which the notary dwelt with a gallery running along one side of its inner court the slender pillars supporting upon the corroded sculpture of their capitals a clinging vine that dappled the floor with palpitant light and shadow in the afternoon sun the gate whose exquisite saracenic arch grew into a carven flame was surmounted by the armorial bearings of a family that died of its sins against the serenest republic long ago the marble cistern which stood in the middle of the court had still a ducal rose upon either of its four sides and little lions of stone perched upon the posts at the head of the marble stairway climbing to the gallery their fierce aspects worn smooth and amiable by the contact of hands that for many ages had mouldered in tombs toward the canal the palace windows had been immemorially bricked up for some reason or caprice and no morning sunlight save such as shone from the bright eyes of the paronsina ever looked into the dim halls it was a fit abode for such a man as the notary exiled in the heart of his native city and it was not unfriendly in its influences to a quiet vegetation like the signoras but to the paronsina it was sad as venice itself where in some moods i have wondered that any sort of youth could have the courage to exist nevertheless the paronsina had contrived to grow up here a child of the gayest and archest spirit and to lead a life of due content till after her return home from the comparative freedom and society of madame prateuxs school where she spent three years in learning all polite accomplishments and whence she came with brilliant hopes and romances ready imagined for any possible exigency of the future she adored all the modern italian poets and read their verse with that stately and rhythmical fulness of voice which often made it sublime and always pleasing she was a relentless patriot an italianissima of the vividest green white and red and she could interpret the historical novels of her countrymen in their subtilest application to the modern enemies of italy but all the paronsinas gifts and accomplishments were to poor purpose if they brought no young men awooing under her balcony and it was to no effect that her fervid fancy peopled the palaces empty halls with stately and gallant company out of marco visconti nicol√≤ de lapi margherita pusterla and the other romances since she could not hope to receive any practicable offer of marriage from the heroes thus assembled her grandfather invited no guests of more substantial presence to his house in fact the police watched him too narrowly to permit him to receive society even had he been so minded and for kindred reasons his family paid few visits in the city to leave venice except for the autumnal villeggiatura was almost out of the question repeated applications at the luogotenenza won the two ladies but a tardy and scanty grace and the use of the passport allowing them to spend a few weeks in florence was attended with so much vexation in coming and going upon the imperial confines and when they returned home they were subject to so great fear of perquisition from the police that it was after all rather a mortification than a pleasure that the government had given them the signora received her few acquaintances once a week but the paronsina found the old ladies tedious over their cups of coffee or tumblers of lemonade and declared that her mammas reception days were a martyrdomactually a martyrdom to her she was full of life and the beautiful and tender longing of youth she had a warm heart and a sprightly wit but she led an existence scarce livelier than a ghosts and she was so poor in friends and resources that she shuddered to think what must become of her if tonelli should die it was not possible thanks to god that he should marry  the signora herself seldom cared to go out for the reason that it was too cold in winter and too hot in summer in the one season she clung all day to her wadded armchair with her scaldino in her lap and in the other season she found it a sufficient diversion to sit in the great hall of the palace and be fanned by the salt breeze that came from the adriatic through the vinegarlanded gallery but besides this habitual inclemency of the weather which forbade outdoor exercise nearly the whole year it was a displeasure to walk in venice on account of the stairways of the bridges and the signora much preferred to wait till they went to the country in the autumn when she always rode to take the air the exceptions to her custom were formed by those afterdinner promenades which she sometimes made on holidays in summer then she put on her richest black and the paronsina dressed herself in her best and they both went to walk on the molo before the pillars of the lion and the saint under the escort of tonelli  it often happened that at the hour of their arrival on the molo the moon was coming up over the low bank of the lido in the east and all that prospect of shipbordered quay island and lagoon which at its worst is everything that heart can wish was then at its best and far beyond words to paint on the right stretched the long giudecca with the domes and towers of its palladian church and the swelling foliage of its gardens and its line of warehousespainted pink as if even business grateful to be tolerated amid such lovely scenes had striven to adorn herself in front lay san giorgio picturesque with its church and pathetic with its political prisons and farther away to the east again the gloomy mass of the madhouse at san servolo and then the slender campanili of the armenian convent rose over the gleaming and tremulous water tonelli took in the beauty of the scene with no more consciousness than a bird but the paronsina had learnt from her romantic poets and novelists to be complimentary to prospects and her heart gurgled out in rapturous praises of this the unwonted freedom exhilarated her there was intoxication in the encounter of faces on the promenade in the dazzle and glimmer of the lights and even in the music of the austrian band playing in the piazza as it came purified to her patriotic ear by the distance there were none but italians upon the molo and one might walk there without so much as touching an officer with the hem of ones garment and a little later when the band ceased playing she should go with the other italians and possess the piazza for one blessed hour in the mean time the paronsina had a sharp little tongue and after she had flattered the landscape and had from her true heart once for all saluted the promenaders as brothers and sisters in italy she did not mind making fun of their peculiarities of dress and person she was signally sarcastic upon such ladies as tonelli chanced to admire and often so stung him with her jests that he was glad when pennellini appeared as he always did exactly at nine oclock and joined the ladies in their promenade asking and answering all those questions of ceremony which form venetian greeting he was a youth of the most methodical exactness in his whole life and could no more have arrived on the molo a moment before or after nine than the bronze giants on the clocktower could have hastened or lingered in striking the hour nature which had made him thus punctual and precise gave him also good looks and a most amiable kindness of heart the paronsina cared nothing at all for him in his quality of handsome young fellow but she prized him as an acquaintance whom she might salute and be saluted by in a city where her grandfathers isolation kept her strange to nearly all the faces she saw sometimes her evenings on the molo wasted away without the exchange of a word save with tonelli for her mother seldom talked and then it was quite possible her teasing was greater than his patience and that he grew taciturn under her tongue at such times she hailed pennellinis appearance with a double delight for if he never joined in her attacks upon tonellis favorites he always enjoyed them and politely applauded them if his friend reproached him for this treason he made him every amend in answering she is jealous tonellia wily compliment which had the most intense effect in coming from lips ordinarily so sincere as his  the signora was weary of the promenade long before the austrian music ceased in the piazza and was very glad when it came time for them to leave the molo and go and sit down to an ice at the caff√® florian this was the supreme hour to the paronsina the one heavenly excess of her restrained and eventless life all about her were scattered tranquil italian idlers listening to the music of the strolling minstrels who had succeeded the military band on either hand sat her friends and she had thus the image of that tender devotion without which a young girl is said not to be perfectly happy while the very heart of adventure seemed to bound in her exchange of glances with a handsome foreigner at a neighboring table on the other side of the piazza a few officers still lingered at the caff√® quadri and at the specchi sundry groups of citizens in their dark dress contrasted well with these white uniforms but for the most part the moon and gasjets shone upon the broad empty space of the piazza whose loneliness the presence of a few belated promenaders only served to render conspicuous as the giants hammered eleven upon the great bell the austrian sentinel under the ducal palace uttered a long reverberating cry and soon after a patrol of soldiers clanked across the piazza and passed with echoing feet through the arcade into the narrow and devious streets beyond the young girl found it hard to rend herself from the dreamy pleasure of the scene or even to turn from the fine impersonal pain which the presence of the austrians in the spectacle inflicted all gave an impression something like that of the theatre with the advantage that here ones self was part of the pantomime and in those days when nearly everything but the puppetshows was forbidden to patriots it was altogether the greatest enjoyment possible to the paronsina the pensive charm of the place imbued all the little company so deeply that they scarcely broke it as they loitered slowly homeward through the deserted merceria when they reached the campo san salvatore on many a lovely summers midnight their footsteps seemed to waken a nightingale whose cage hung from a lofty balcony there for suddenly at their coming the bird broke into a wild and thrilling song that touched them all and suffused the tender heart of the paronsina with an inexpressible pathos  alas she had so often returned thus from the piazza and no stealthy footstep had followed hers homeward with loves persistence and diffidence she was young she knew and she thought not quite dull or hideous but her spirit was as sole in that melancholy city as if there were no youth but hers in the world and a little later than this when she had her first affair it did not originate in the piazza nor at all respond to her expectations in a loveaffair in fact it was altogether a business affair and was managed chiefly by tonelli who having met a young doctor laurelled the year before at padua had heard him express so pungent a curiosity to know what the paronsina would have to her dower that he perceived he must be madly in love with her so with the consent of the signora he had arranged a correspondence between the young people and all went on well at firstthe letters from both passing through his hands but his office was anything but a sinecure for while the doctor was on his part of a cold temperament and disposed to regard the affair merely as a proper way of providing for the natural affections the paronsina cared nothing for him personally and only viewed him favorably as abstract matrimonyas the means of escaping from the bondage of her girlhood and the sad seclusion of her life into the world outside her grandfathers house so presently the correspondence fell almost wholly upon tonelli who worked up to the point of betrothal with an expense of finesse and sentiment that would have made his fortune in diplomacy or poetry what should he say now that stupid young doctor would cry in a desperation when tonelli delicately reminded him that it was time to answer the paronsinas last note say this that and the other tonelli would answer giving him the heads of a proper letter which the doctor took down on square bits of paper neatly fashioned for writing prescriptions and for gods sake caro dottore put a little warmth into it the poor doctor would try but it must always end in tonellis suggesting and almost dictating every sentence and then the letter being carried to the paronsina made her laugh this is very pretty my poor tonelli but it was never my onoratissimo dottore who thought of these tender compliments ah that allusion to my mouth and eyes could only have come from the heart of a great poet it is yours tonelli dont deny it and tonelli taken in his weak point of literature could make but a feeble pretence of disclaiming the child of his fancy while the paronsina being in this reckless humor more than once responded to the doctor in such fashion that in the end the inspiration of her altered and amended letter was tonellis even after the betrothal the lovemaking languished and the doctor was indecently patient of the late day fixed for the marriage by the notary in fact the doctor was very busy and as his practice grew the dower of the paronsina dwindled in his fancy till one day he treated the whole question of their marriage with such coldness and uncertainty in his talk with tonelli that the latter saw whither his thoughts were drifting and went home with an indignant heart to the paronsina who joyfully sat down and wrote her first sincere letter to the doctor dismissing him  it is finished she said and i am glad after all perhaps i dont want to be any freer than i am and while i have you tonelli i dont want a younger lover younger diana you are in the flower of youth and i believe you will never wither did that rogue of a doctor then really give you the elixir of youth for writing him those letters tell me tonelli as a true friend how long have you been fortyseven ever since your fiftieth birthday listen i have been more afraid of losing you than my sweetest doctor i thought you would be so much in love with lovemaking that you would go breakneck and court some one in earnest on your own account  thus the paronsina made a jest of the loss she had sustained but it was not pleasant to her except as it dissolved a tie which love had done nothing to form her life seemed colder and vaguer after it and the hour very far away when the handsome officers of her king all good venetians in those days called victor emanuel our king should come to drive out the austrians and marry their victims she scarcely enjoyed the prodigious privilege offered her at this time in consideration of her bereavement of going to the comedy under tonellis protection and along with pennellini and his sister while the poor signora afterwards had real qualms of patriotism concerning the breach of public duty involved in this distraction of her daughter she hoped that no one had recognized her at the theatre otherwise they might have a warning from the venetian committee thou knowest she said to the paronsina that they have even admonished the old conte tradonico who loves the comedy better than his soul and who used to go every evening thy aunt told me and that the old rogue when people ask him why he doesnt go to the play answers my mistress wont let me but fie i am saying what young girls ought not to hear  after the affair with the doctor i say life refused to return exactly to its old expression and i suppose that if what presently happened was ever to happen it could not have occurred at a more appropriate time for a disaster or at a time when its victims were less able to bear it i do not know whether i have yet sufficiently indicated the fact but the truth is both the paronsina and her mother had from long use come to regard tonelli as a kind of property of theirs which had no right in any way to alienate itself they would have felt an attempt of this sort to be not only very absurd but very wicked in view of their affection for him and dependence upon him and while the paronsina thanked god that he would never marry she had a deep conviction that he ought not to marry even if he desired it was at the same time perfectly natural nay filial that she should herself be ready to desert this old friend whom she felt so strictly bound to be faithful to her loneliness as matters fell out she had herself primarily to blame for tonellis loss for in that interval of disgust and ennui following the doctors dismissal she had suffered him to seek his own pleasure on holiday evenings and he had thus wandered alone to the piazza and so one night had seen a lady eating an ice there and fallen in love without more ado than another man should drink a lemonade  this facility came of habit for tonelli had now been falling in love every other day for some forty years and in that time had broken the hearts of innumerable women of all nations and classes the prettiest watercarriers in his neighborhood were in love with him as their mothers had been before them and ladies of noble condition were believed to cherish passions for him especially gay and beautiful foreigners as they sat at florians were taken with hopeless love of him and he could tell stories of very romantic adventure in which he figured as hero though nearly always with moral effect for example there was the countess from the mainlandshe merited the sad distinction of being chief among those who had vainly loved him if you could believe the poet who both inspired and sang her passion when she took a palace in venice he had been summoned to her on the pretended business of a secretary but when she presented herself with those idle accounts of her factor and tenants on the mainland her household expenses and her correspondence with her advocate tonelli perceived at once that it was upon a wholly different affair that she had desired to see him she was a rich widow of forty of a beauty supernaturally preserved and very great this is no place for thee tonelli mine the secretary had said to himself after a week had passed and he had understood all the waywardness of that unhappy ladys intentions thou art not too old but thou art too wise for these follies though no saint and so had gathered up his personal effects and secretly quitted the palace but such was the countesss fury at his escape that she never paid him his weeks salary nor did she manifest the least gratitude that tonelli out of regard for her son a very honest young man refused in any way to identify her but to all except his closest friends pretended that he had passed those terrible eight days on a visit to the country village where he was born it showed pennellinis ignorance of life that he should laugh at this history and i prefer to treat it seriously and to use it in explaining the precipitation with which tonellis latest inamorata returned his love  though indeed why should a lady of thirty and from an obscure country town hesitate to be enamored of any eligible suitor who presented himself in venice it is not my duty to enter upon a detail or summary of carlottas character or condition or to do more than indicate that while she did not greatly excel in youth good looks or worldly gear she had yet a little property and was of that soft prettiness which is often more effective than downright beauty there was indeed something very charming about her and if she was a blonde i have no reason to think she was as fickle as the venetian proverb paints that complexion of woman or that she had not every quality which would have excused any one but tonelli for thinking of marrying her  after their first mute interview in the piazza the two lost no time in making each others acquaintance but though the affair was vigorously conducted no one could say that it was not perfectly in order tonelli on the following day which chanced to be sunday repaired to st marks at the hour of the fashionable mass where he gazed steadfastly at the lady during her orisons and whence at a discreet distance he followed her home to the house of the friends whom she was visiting somewhat to his discomfiture at first these proved to be old acquaintances of his and when he came at night to walk up and down under their balconies as bound in true love to do they made nothing of asking him indoors and presenting him to his lady but the pair were not to be entirely balked of their romance and they still arranged stolen interviews at church where one furtively whispered word had the value of whole hours of unrestricted converse under the roof of their friends they quite refused to take advantage of their anomalously easy relations beyond inquiry on his part as to the amount of the ladys dower and on hers as to the permanence of tonellis employment he in due form had pennellini to his confidant and carlotta unbosomed herself to her hostess and the affair was thus conducted with such secrecy that not more than two thirds of tonellis acquaintance knew anything about it when their engagement was announced  there were now no circumstances to prevent their early union yet the happy conclusion was one to which tonelli urged himself after many secret and bitter displeasures of spirit i am persuaded that his love for carlotta must have been most ardent and sincere for there was everything in his history and reason against marriage he could not disown that he had hitherto led a joyous and careless life or that he was exactly fitted for the modest delights the discreet variety of his present statefor his daily routine at the notarys his dinner at the bronze horses or the cookshop his hour at the caff√® his walks and excursions for his holiday banquet with the cenarotti and his formal promenade with the ladies of that family upon the molo he had a good employment with a salary that held him above want and afforded him the small luxuries already named and he had fixed habits of work and of relaxation which made both a blessing he had his chosen circle of intimate equals who regarded him for his goodheartedness and wit and foibles and his little following of humble admirers who looked upon him as a gifted man in disgrace with fortune his friendships were as old as they were secure and cordial he was established in the kindliness of all who knew him and he was flattered by the dependence of the paronsina and her mother even when it was troublesome to him he had his past of sentiment and war his present of storytelling and romance he was quite independent his sins if he had any began and ended in himself for none was united to him so closely as to be hurt by them and he was far too imprudent a man to be taken for an example by any one he came and went as he listed he did this or that without question with no heart chosen yet from the world of womans love he was still a young man with hopes and affections as pliable as a boys he had in a word that reputation of goodfellow which in venice gives a man the title of buon diavolo but on which he does not anywhere turn his back with impunity either from his own consciousness or from public opinion there never was such a thing in the world as both good devil and good husband and even with his betrothal tonelli felt that his old careless merry life of the hour ended and that he had tacitly recognized a future while he was yet unable to cut the past if one has for twenty years made a jest of women however amiably and insincerely one does not propose to marry a woman without making a jest of ones self the avenging remembrance of elderly people whose late matrimony had furnished food for tonellis wit now rose up to torment him and in his morbid fancy the merriment he had caused was echoed back in his own derision  it shocked him to find how quickly his secret took wing and it annoyed him that all his acquaintances were so prompt to felicitate him he imagined a latent mockery in their speeches and he took them with an argumentative solemnity he reasoned separately with his friends to all who spoke to him of his marriage he presented elaborate proofs that it was the wisest thing he could possibly do and tried to give the affair a cold air of prudence you see i am getting old that is to say i am tired of this bachelor life in which i have no one to take care of me if i fall sick and to watch that the doctors do not put me to death my pay is very little but with carlottas dower well invested we shall both together live better than either of us lives alone she is a careful woman and will keep me neat and comfortable she is not so young as some women i had thought to marryno but so much the better nobody will think her half so charming as i do and at my time of life that is a great point gained she is good and has an admirable disposition she is not spoiled by venice but as innocent as a dove o i shall find myself very well with her  this was the speech which with slight modification tonelli made over and over again to all his friends but pennellini to him he unmasked and said boldly that at last he was really in love and being gently discouraged in what seemed his folly and incredulously laughed at he grew angry and gave such proofs of his sincerity that pennellini was convinced and owned to himself this madman is actually enamoredenamoredlike a cat patience what will ever those cenarotti say  in a little while poor tonelli lost the philosophic mind with which he had at first received the congratulations of his friends and from reasoning with them fell to resenting their good wishes very little things irritated him and pleasantries which he had taken in excellent part time out of mind now raised his anger his barber had for many years been in the habit of saying as he applied the stick of fixature to tonellis mustache and gave it a jaunty upward curl now we will bestow that little dash of youthfulness and it both amazed and hurt him to have tonelli respond with a fierce tsit and say that this jest was proper in its antiquity to the times of romulus rather than our own period and so go out of the shop without that adieu old fellow which he had never failed to give in twenty years capperi said the barber when he emerged from a profound revery into which this outbreak had plunged him and in which he had remained holding the nose of his next customer and tweaking it to and fro in the violence of his emotions regardless of those mumbled maledictions which the lather would not permit the victim to articulate if tonelli is so savage in his betrothal we must wait for his marriage to tame him i am sorry he was always such a good devil  but if many things annoyed tonelli there were some that deeply wounded him and chiefly the fact that his betrothal seemed to have fixed an impassable gulf of years between him and all those young men whose company he loved so well he had really a boys heart and he had consorted with them because he felt himself nearer their age than his own hitherto they had in no wise found his presence a restraint they had always laughed and told their loves and spoken their young mens thoughts and made their young mens jokes without fear or shame before the merryhearted sage who never offered good advice if indeed he ever dreamed that there was a wiser philosophy than theirs it had been as if he were the youngest among them but now in spite of all that he or they could do he seemed suddenly and irretrievably aged they looked at him strangely as if for the first time they saw that his mustache was gray that his brow was not smooth like theirs that there were crowsfeet at the corners of his kindly eyes they could not phrase the vague feeling that haunted their hearts or they would have said that tonelli in offering to marry had voluntarily turned his back upon his youth that love which would only have brought a richer bloom to their age had breathed away forever the autumnal blossom of his  something of this made itself felt in tonellis own consciousness whenever he met them and he soon grew to avoid these comrades of his youth it was therefore after a purely accidental encounter with one of them and as he was passing into the campo sant angelo head down and supporting himself with an inexplicable sense of infirmity upon the cane he was wont so jauntily to flourish that he heard himself addressed with i say master he looked up and beheld the fat madman who patrols that campo and who has the license of his affliction to utter insolences to whomsoever he will leaning against the door of a tobacconists shop with his arms folded and a lazy mischievous smile loitering down on his greasy face as he caught tonellis eye he nodded eh i have heard master while the idlers of that neighborhood who relished and repeated his incoherent pleasantries like the mots of some great dinerout gathered near with expectant grins had tonelli been altogether himself as in other days he would have been far too wise to answer what hast thou heard poor animal  that you are going to take a mate when most birds think of flying away said the madman because it has been summer a long time with you master you think it will never be winter look out the wolf doesnt eat the season  the poor fool in these words seemed to utter a public voice of disapprobation and derision and as the pitiless bystanders who had many a time laughed with tonelli now laughed at him joining in the applause which the madman himself led off the miserable good devil walked away with a shiver as if the weather had actually turned cold it was not till he found himself in carlottas presence that the long summer appeared to return to him indeed in her tenderness and his real love for her he won back all his youth again and he found it of a truer and sweeter quality than he had known even when his years were few while the gay oldbachelor life he had long led seemed to him a period of miserable loneliness and decrepitude mirrored in her fond eyes he saw himself alert and handsome and since for the time being they were to each other all the world we may be sure there was nothing in the world then to vex or shame tonelli the promises of the future too seemed not improbable of fulfilment for they were not extravagant promises these peoples castle in the air was a house furnished from carlottas modest portion and situated in a quarter of the city not too far from the piazza and convenient to a decent caff√® from which they could order a lemonade or a cup of coffee for visitors tonellis stipend was to pay the housekeeping as well as the minute wage of a servantgirl from the country and it was believed that they could save enough from that and a little of carlottas money at interest to go sometimes to the malibran theatre or the marionette or even make an excursion to the mainland upon a holiday but if they could not it was certainly better italianism to stay at home and at least they could always walk to the public gardens at one time religious differences threatened to cloud this blissful vision of the future but it was finally agreed that carlotta should go to mass and confession as often as she liked and should not tease tonelli about his soul while he on his part was not to speak ill of the pope except as a temporal prince or of any of the priesthood except of the jesuits when in company in order to show that marriage had not made him a codino for the like reason no change was to be made in his custom of praising garibaldi and reviling the accursed germans upon all safe occasions  as tonelli had nothing in the world but his salary and his slender wardrobe carlotta eagerly accepted the idea of a loss of family property during the revolution of tonellis scar she was as proud as tonelli himself  when she came to speak of the acquaintance of all those young men it seemed again like a breath from the north to her betrothed and he answered with a sigh that this was an affair that had already finished itself i have long thought them too boyish for me he said and i shall keep none of them but pennellini who is even older than iwho i believe was never born but created middleaged out of the dust of the earth like adam he is not a good devil but he has every good quality  while he thus praised his friend tonelli was meditating a service which when he asked it of pennellini had almost the effect to destroy their ancient amity this was no less than the composition of those weddingverses without which printed and exposed to view in all the shopwindows no one in venice feels himself adequately and truly married pennellini had never willingly made a verse in his life and it was long before he understood tonelli when he urged the delicate request then in vain he protested recalcitrated it was all an offence to tonellis morbid soul already irritated by his friends obtuseness and eager to turn even the reluctance of nature into insult he took his refusal for a sign that he too deserted him and must be called back after bidding pennellini adieu to hear the only condition on which the accursed sonnet would be furnished namely that it should not be signed pennellini but an affectionate friend never was sonnet cost poet so great anguish as this pennellini went at it conscientiously as if it were a problem in mathematics he refreshed his prosody he turned over carrer he toiled a whole night and in due time appeared as tonellis affectionate friend in all the butchers and bakers windows but it had been too much to ask of him and for a while he felt the shock of tonellis unreason and excess so much that there was a decided coolness between them  this important particular arranged little remained for tonelli to do but to come to that open understanding with the paronsina and her mother which he had long dreaded and avoided he could not conceal from himself that his marriage was a kind of desertion of the two dear friends so dependent upon his singleness and he considered the case of the paronsina with a real remorse if his meditated act sometimes appeared to him a gross inconsistency and a satire upon all his former life he had still consoled himself with the truth of his passion and had found love its own apology and comfort but in its relation to these lonely women his love itself had no fairer aspect than that of treason and he shrank from owning it before them with a sense of guilt some wild dreams of reconciling his future with his past occasionally haunted him but in his saner moments he perceived their folly carlotta he knew was good and patient but she was nevertheless a woman and she would never consent that he should be to the cenarotti all that he had been these ladies also were very kind and reasonable but they too were women and incapable of accepting a less perfect devotion indeed was not his proposed marriage too much like taking her only son from the signora and giving the paronsina a stepmother it was worse and so the ladies of the notarys family viewed it cherishing a resentment that grew with tonellis delay to deal frankly with them while carlotta on her part was wounded that these old friends should ignore his future wife so utterly on both sides evil was stored up  when tonelli would still make a show of fidelity to the paronsina and her mother they accepted his awkward advances the latter with a cold visage the former with a sarcastic face and tongue he had managed particularly ill with the paronsina who having no romance of her own would possibly have come to enjoy the autumnal poetry of his love if he had permitted but when she first approached him on the subject of those rumors she had heard and treated them with a natural derision as involving the most absurd and preposterous ideas he instead of suffering her jests and then turning her interest to his favor resented them and closed his heart and its secret against her what could she do thereafter but feign to avoid the subject and adroitly touch it with constant invisible stings alas it did not need that she should ever speak to tonelli with the wicked intent she did at this time he would have taken ill whatever most innocent thing she said when friends are to be estranged they do not require a cause they have but to doubt one another and no forced forbearance or kindness between them can do aught but confirm their alienation this is on the whole fortunate for in this manner neither feels to blame for the broken friendship and each can declare with perfect truth that he did all he could to maintain it tonelli said to himself if the paronsina had treated the affair properly at first and the paronsina thought if he had told me frankly about it to begin with both had a latent heartache over their trouble and both a sense of loss the more bitter because it was of loss still unacknowledged  as the day fixed for tonellis wedding drew near the rumor of it came to the cenarotti from all their acquaintance but when people spoke to them of it as of something they must be fully and particularly informed of the signora answered coldly it seems that we have not merited tonellis confidence and the paronsina received the gossip with an air of clearly affected surprise and a davvero that at least discomfited the talebearers  the consciousness of the unworthy part he was acting toward these ladies had come at last to poison the pleasure of tonellis wooing even in carlottas presence yet i suppose he would still have let his weddingday come and go and been married beyond hope of atonement so loath was he to inflict upon himself and them the pain of an explanation if one day within a week of that time the notary had not bade his clerk dine with him on the morrow it was a holiday and as carlotta was at home making ready for the marriage tonelli consented to take his place at the table from which he had been a long time absent but it turned out such a frigid and melancholy banquet as never was known before the old notary to whom all things came dimly finally missed the accustomed warmth of tonellis fun and said with a little shiver why what ails you tonelli you are as moody as a man in love  the notary had been told several times of tonellis affair but it was his characteristic not to remember any gossip later than that of fortyeight  the paronsina burst into a laugh full of the cruelty and insult of a womans longsmothered sense of injury caro nonno she screamed into her grandfathers dull ear he is really in despair how to support his happiness he is shy even of his old friendshe has had so little experience it is the first love of a young man bisogna compatire la giovent√π caro nonno and her tongue being finally loosed the paronsina broke into incoherent mockeries that hurt more from their purpose than their point and gave no one greater pain than herself  tonelli sat sad and perfectly mute under the infliction but he said in his heart i have merited worse  at first the signora remained quite aghast but when she collected herself she called out peremptorily madamigella you push the affair a little beyond cease  the paronsina having said all she desired ceased panting  the old notary for whose slow sense all but her first words had been too quick though all had been spoken at him said dryly turning to tonelli i imagine that my deafness is not always a misfortune  it was by an inexplicable but hardly less inevitable violence to the inclinations of each that after this miserable dinner the signora the paronsina and tonelli should go forth together for their wonted promenade on the molo use which is the second is also very often the stronger nature and so these parted friends made a last show of union and harmony in nothing had their amity been more fatally broken than in this careful homage to its forms and now as they walked up and down in the moonlight they were of the saddest kind of apparitionsnot mere disembodied spirits which however are bad enough but disanimated bodies which are far worse and of which people are not more afraid only because they go about in society so commonly as on many and many another night of summers past the moon came up and stood over the lido striking far across the glittering lagoon and everywhere winning the flattered eye to the dark masses of shadow upon the water to the trees of the gardens to the trees and towers and domes of the cloistered and templed isles scene of pensive and incomparable loveliness giving even to the stranger in some faint and most unequal fashion a sense of the awful meaning of exile to the venetian who in all other lands in the world is doubly an alien from their unutterable unlikeness to his sole and beautiful city the prospect had that pathetic unreality to the friends which natural things always assume to people playing a part and i imagine that they saw it not more substantial than it appears to the exile in his dreams in their promenade they met again and again the unknown wonted faces they even encountered some acquaintances whom they greeted and with whom they chatted for a while and when at nine the bronze giants beat the hour upon their bellwith as remote effect as if they were giants of the times before the floodthey were aware of pennellini promptly appearing like an exact and methodical spectre  but tonight the paronsina who had made the scene no compliments did not insist as usual upon the ice at florians and pennellini took his formal leave of the friends under the arch of the clock tower and they walked silently homeward through the echoing merceria  at the notarys gate tonelli would have said goodnight but the signora made him enter with them and then abruptly left him standing with the paronsina in the gallery while she was heard hurrying away to her own apartment she reappeared extending toward tonelli both hands upon which glittered and glittered manifold skeins of the delicate chain of venice  she had a very stately and impressive bearing as she stood there in the moonlight and addressed him with a collected voice tonelli she said i think you have treated your oldest and best friends very cruelly was it not enough that you should take yourself from us but you must also forbid our hearts to follow you even in sympathy and good wishes i had almost thought to say adieu forever tonight but she continued with a breaking utterance and passing tenderly to the familiar form of address i cannot part so with thee thou hast been too like a son to me too like a brother to my poor clarice maybe thou no longer lovest us yet i think thou wilt not disdain this gift for thy wife take it tonelli if not for our sake perhaps then for the sake of sorrows that in times past we have shared together in this unhappy venice  here the signora ended perforce the speech which had been long for her and the paronsina burst into a passion of weepingnot more at her mammas words than out of selfpity and from the national sensibility  tonelli took the chain and reverently kissed it and the hands that gave it he had a helpless sense of the injustice the signoras words and the paronsinas tears did him he knew that they put him with feminine excess further in the wrong than even his own weakness had but he tried to express nothing of thisit was but part of the miserable maze in which his life was involved with what courage he might he owned his error but protested his faithful friendship and poured out all his troubleshis love for carlotta his regret for them his shame and remorse for himself they forgave him and there was everything in their words and will to restore their old friendship and keep it and when the gate with a loud clang closed upon tonelli going from them they all felt that it had irrevocably perished  i do not say that there was not always a decent and affectionate bearing on the part of the paronsina and her mother towards tonelli and his wife i acknowledge that it was but too careful and faultless a tenderness ever conscious of its own fragility far more natural was the satisfaction they took in the delayed fruitfulness of tonellis marriage and then in the fact that his child was a girl and not a boy it was but human that they should doubt his happiness and that the signora should always say when hard pressed with questions upon the matter yes tonelli is married but if it were to do again i think he would do it tomorrow rather than today   the end
