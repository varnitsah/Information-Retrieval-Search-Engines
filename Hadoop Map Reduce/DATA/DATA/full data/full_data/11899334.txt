11899334	a wonderbook for girls and boys                       by nathaniel hawthorne                        the miraculous pitcher    contents    the hillsideintroductory to the miraculous pitcher   the miraculous pitcher   the hillsideafter the story    introductory to the miraculous pitcher  and when and where do you think we find the children next  no longer in the wintertime but in the merry month of may  no longer in tanglewood playroom or at tanglewood fireside but more than halfway up a monstrous hill or a mountain as perhaps it would be better pleased to have us call it  they had set out from home with the mighty purpose of climbing this high hill even to the very tiptop of its bald head  to be sure it was not quite so high as  chimborazo or mont blanc and was even a good deal lower than old graylock  but at any rate it was  higher than a thousand anthillocks or a million of mole hills and when measured by the short strides of little children might be reckoned a very respectable mountain  and was cousin eustace with the party  of that you may be certain else how could the book go on a step further  he was now in the middle of the spring vacation and looked pretty much as we saw him four or five months ago except that if you gazed quite closely at his upper lip you could discern the funniest little bit of a mustache upon it setting aside this mark of mature manhood you might have considered cousin eustace just as much a boy as when you first became acquainted with him  he was as merry as playful as goodhumored as light of foot and of spirits and equally a favorite with the little folks as he had always been  this expedition up the mountain was entirely of his contrivance  all the way up the steep ascent he had encouraged the elder children with his cheerful voice and when dandelion cowslip and squashblossom grew weary he had lugged them along alternately on his back  in this manner they had passed through the orchards and pastures on the lower part of the hill and had reached the wood which extends thence towards its bare summit  the month of may thus far had been more amiable than it often is and this was as sweet and genial a day as the heart of man or child could wish  in their progress up the hill the small people had found enough of violets blue and white and some that were as golden as if they had the touch of midas on them  that sociablest of flowers the little housatonia was very abundant  it is a flower that never lives alone but which loves its own kind and is always fond of dwelling with a great many friends and relatives around it  sometimes you see a family of them covering a space no bigger than the palm of your hand and sometimes a large community whitening a whole tract of pasture and all keeping one another in cheerful heart and life  within the verge of the wood there were columbines looking more pale than red because they were so modest and had thought proper to seclude themselves too anxiously from the sun  there were wild geraniums too and a thousand white blossoms of the strawberry  the trailing arbutus was not yet quite out of bloom but it hid its precious flowers under the last years withered forestleaves as carefully as a motherbird hides its little young ones  it knew i suppose how beautiful and sweetscented they were  so cunning was their concealment that the children sometimes smelt the delicate richness of their perfume before they knew whence it proceeded  amid so much new life it was strange and truly pitiful to behold here and there in the fields and pastures the hoary periwig of dandelions that had already gone to seed  they had done with summer before the summer came  within those small globes of winged seeds it was autumn now  well but we must not waste our valuable pages with any more talk about the springtime and wild flowers  there is something we hope more interesting to be talked about  if you look at the group of children you may see them all gathered around eustace bright who sitting on the stump of a tree seems to be just beginning a story  the fact is the younger part of the troop have found out that it takes rather too many of their short strides to measure the long ascent of the hill  cousin eustace therefore has decided to leave sweet fern cowslip squashblossom and dandelion at this point midway up until the return of the rest of the party from the summit  and because they complain a little and do not quite like to stay behind he gives them some apples out of his pocket and proposes to tell them a very pretty story hereupon they brighten up and change their grieved looks into the broadest kind of smiles  as for the story i was there to hear it hidden behind a bush and shall tell it over to you in the pages that come next    the miraculous pitcher  one evening in times long ago old philemon and his old wife baucis sat at their cottagedoor enjoying the cahn and beautiful sunset  they had already eaten their frugal supper and intended now to spend a quiet hour or two before bedtime  so they talked together about their garden and their cow and their bees and their grapevine which clambered over the cottagewall and on which the grapes were beginning to turn purple but the rude shouts of children and the fierce barking of dogs in the village near at hand grew louder and louder until at last it was hardly possible for baucis and philemon to hear each other speak  ah wife  cried philemon i fear some poor traveller is seeking hospitality among our neighbors yonder and instead of giving him food and lodging they have set their dogs at him as their custom is  welladay answered old baucis i do wish our neighbors felt a little more kindness for their fellowcreatures  and only think of bringing up their children in this naughty way and patting them on the head when they fling stones at strangers  those children will never come to any good said philemon shaking his white head  to tell you the truth wife i should not wonder if some terrible thing were to happen to all the people in the village unless they mend their manners  but as for you and me so long as providence affords us a crust of bread let us be ready to give half to any poor homeless stranger that may come along and need it  that s right husband said baucis  so we will  these old folks you must know were quite poor and had to work pretty hard for a living  old philemon toiled diligently in his garden while baucis was always busy with her distaff or making a little butter and cheese with their cows milk or doing one thing and another about the cottage  their food was seldom anything but bread milk and vegetables with sometimes a portion of honey from their beehive and now and then a bunch of grapes that had ripened against the cottagewall but they were two of the kindest old people in the world and would cheerfully have gone without their dinners any day rather than refuse a slice of their brown loaf a cup of new milk and a spoonful of honey to the weary traveller who might pause before their door  they felt as if such guests had a sort of holiness and that they ought therefore to treat them better and more bountifully than their own selves  their cottage stood on a rising ground at some short distance from a village which lay in a hollow valley that was about half a mile in breadth  this valley in past ages when the world was new had probably been the bed of a lake  there fishes had glided to and fro in the depths and waterweeds had grown along the margin and trees and hills had seen their reflected images in the broad and peaceful mirror but as the waters subsided men had cultivated the soil and built houses on it so that it was now a fertile spot and bore no traces of the ancient lake except a very small brook which meandered through the midst of the village and supplied the inhabitants with water  the valley had been dry land so long that oaks had sprung up and grown great and high and perished with old age and been succeeded by others as tall and stately as the first  never was there a prettier or more fruitful valley  the very sight of the plenty around them should have made the inhabitants kind and gentle and ready to show their gratitude to providence by doing good to their fellowcreatures  but we are sorry to say the people of this lovely village were not worthy to dwell in a spot on which heaven had smiled so beneficently they were a very selfish and hardhearted people and had no pity for the poor nor sympathy with the homeless  they would only have laughed had anybody told them that human beings owe a debt of love to one another because there is no other method of paying the debt of love and care which all of us owe to providence  you will hardly believe what i am going to tell you  these naughty people taught their children to be no better than themselves and used to clap their hands by way of encouragement when they saw the little boys and girls run after some poor stranger shouting at his heels and pelting hum with stones  they kept large and fierce dogs and whenever a traveller ventured to show himself in the village street this pack of disagreeable curs scampered to meet him barking snarling and showing their teeth  then they would seize him by his leg or by his clothes just as it happened and if he were ragged when he came he was generally a pitiable object before he had time to run away  this was a very terrible thing to poor travellers as you may suppose especially when they chanced to be sick or feeble or lame or old  such persons if they once knew how badly these unkind people and their unkind children and curs were in the habit of behaving would go miles and miles out of their way rather than try to pass through the village again  what made the matter seem worse if possible was that when rich persons came in their chariots or riding on beautiful horses with their servants in rich liveries attending on them nobody could be more civil and obsequious than the inhabitants of the village  they would take off their hats and make the humblest bows you ever saw  if the children were rude they were pretty certain to get their ears boxed and as for the dogs if a single cur in the pack presumed to yelp his master instantly beat him with a club and tied him up without any supper this would have been all very well only it proved that the villagers cared much about the money that a stranger had in his pocket and nothing whatever for the human soul which lives equally in the beggar and the prince  so now you can understand why old philemon spoke so sorrowfully when he heard the shouts of the children and the barking of the dogs at the farther extremity of the village street  there was a confused din which lasted a good while and seemed to pass quite through the breadth of the valley  i never heard the dogs so loud observed the good old man  nor the children so rude answered his good old wife  they sat shaking their heads one to another while the noise came nearer and nearer until at the foot of the little eminence on which their cottage stood they saw two travellers approaching on foot  close behind them came the fierce dogs snarling at their very heels  a little farther off ran a crowd of children who sent up shrill cries and flung stones at the two strangers with all their might  once or twice the younger of the two men he was a slender and very active figure turned about and drove back the dogs with a staff which he carried in his hand  his companion who was a very tall person walked calmly along as if disdaining to notice either the naughty children or the pack of curs whose manners the children seemed to imitate  both of the travellers were very humbly clad and looked as if they might not have money enough in their pockets to pay for a nights lodging  and this i am afraid was the reason why the villagers had allowed their children and dogs to treat them so rudely  come wife said philemon to baucis let us go and meet these poor people  no doubt they feel almost too heavyhearted to climb the hill  go you and meet them answered baucis while i make haste within doors and see whether we can get them anything for supper  a comfortable bowl of bread and milk would do wonders towards raising their spirits  accordingly she hastened into the cottage  philemon on his part went forward and extended his hand with so hospitable an aspect that there was no need of saying what nevertheless he did say in the heartiest tone imaginable  welcome strangers welcome  thank you replied the younger of the two in a lively kind of way notwithstanding his weariness and trouble  this is quite another greeting than we have met with yonder in the village  pray why do you live in such a bad neighborhood  ah observed old philemon with a quiet and benign smile providence put me here i hope among other reasons in order that i may make you what amends i can for the inhospitality of my neighbors  well said old father cried the traveller laughing and if the truth must be told my companion and myself need some amends  those children the little rascals have bespattered us finely with their mudball and one of the curs has torn my cloak which was ragged enough already  but i took him across the muzzle with my staff and i think you may have heard him yelp even thus far off  philemon was glad to see him in such good spirits nor indeed would you have fancied by the travellers look and manner that he was weary with a long days journey besides being disheartened by rough treatment at the end of it  he was dressed in rather an odd way with a sort of cap on his head the brim of which stuck out over both ears  though it was a summer evening he wore a cloak which he kept wrapt closely about him perhaps because his under garments were shabby  philemen perceived too that he had on a singular pair of shoes but as it was now growing dusk and as the old mans eyesight was none the sharpest he could not precisely tell in what the strangeness consisted  one thing certainly seemed queer  the traveller was so wonderfully light and active that it appeared as if his feet sometimes rose from the ground of their own accord or could only be kept down by an effort  i used to be lightfooted in my youth said philemen to the traveller  but i always found my feet grow heavier towards nightfall  there is nothing like a good staff to help one along answered the stranger and i happen to have an excellent one as you see  this staff in fact was the oddestlooking staff that philemon had ever beheld  it was made of olivewood and had something like a little pair of wings near the top  two snakes carved in the wood were represented as twining themselves about the staff and were so very skilfully executed that old philemon whose eyes you know were getting rather dim almost thought them alive and that he could see them wriggling and twisting  a curious piece of work sure enough said he  a staff with wings it would be an excellent kind of stick for a little boy to ride astride of  by this time philemon and his two guests had reached the cottagedoor  friends said the old man sit down and rest yourselves here on this bench  my good wife baucis has gone to see what you can have for supper  we are poor folks but you shall be welcome to whatever we have in the cupboard  the younger stranger threw himself carelessly on the bench letting his staff fall as he did so  and here happened something rather marvellous though trifling enough too  the staff seemed to get up from the ground of its own accord and spreading its little pair of wings it half hopt half flew and leaned itself against the wall of the cottage  there it stood quite still except that the snakes continued to wriggle  but in my private opinion old philemons eyesight had been playing him tricks again  before he could ask any questions the elder stranger drew his attention from the wonderful staff by speaking to him  was there not asked the stranger in a remarkably deep tone of voice a lake in very ancient times covering the spot where now stands yonder village  not in my day friend answered philemon and yet i am an old man as you see  there were always the fields and meadows just as they are now and the old trees and the little stream murmuring through the midst of the valley  my father nor his father before him ever saw it otherwise so far as i know and doubtless it will still be the same when old philemon shall be gone and forgotten  that is more than can be safely foretold observed the stranger and there was something very stern in his deep voice  he shook his head too so that his dark and heavy curls were shaken with the movement since the inhabitants of yonder village have forgotten the affections and sympathies of their nature it were better that the lake should be rippling over their dwellings again  the traveller looked so stern that philemon was really almost frightened the more so that at his frown the twilight seemed suddenly to grow darker and that when he shook his head there was a roll as of thunder in the air  but in a moment afterwards the strangers face became so kindly and mild that the old man quite forgot his terror  nevertheless he could not help feeling that this elder traveller must be no ordinary personage although he happened now to be attired so humbly and to be journeying on foot  not that philemon fancied him a prince in disguise or any character of that sort but rather some exceedingly wise man who went about the world in this poor garb despising wealth and all worldly objects and seeking everywhere to add a mite to his wisdom  this idea appeared the more probable because when philemon raised his eyes to the strangers face he seemed to see more thought there in one look than he could have studied out in a lifetime  while baucis was getting the supper the travellers both began to talk very sociably with philemon  the younger indeed was extremely loquacious and made such shrewd and witty remarks that the good old man continually burst out alaughing and pronounced him the merriest fellow whom he had seen for many a day  pray my young friend said he as they grew familiar together what may i call your name  why i am very nimble as you see answered the traveller  so if you call me quicksilver the name will fit tolerably well  quicksilver  quicksilver repeated philemon looking in the travellers face to see if he were making fun of him  it is a very odd name  and your companion there  has he as strange a one  you must ask the thunder to tell it you replied quicksilver putting on a mysterious look  no other voice is loud enough  this remark whether it were serious or in jest might have caused philemon to conceive a very great awe of the elder stranger if on venturing to gaze at him he had not beheld so much beneficence in his visage but undoubtedly here was the grandest figure that ever sat so humbly beside a cottagedoor  when the stranger conversed it was with gravity and in such a way that philemon felt irresistibly moved to tell him everything which he had most at heart  this is always the feeling that people have when they meet with any one wise enough to comprehend all their good and evil and to despise not a tittle of it  but philemon simple and kindhearted old man that he was had not many secrets to disclose  he talked however quite garrulously about the events of his past life in the whole course of which he had never been a score of miles from this very spot  his wife baucis and himself had dwelt in the cottage from their youth upward earning their bread by honest labor always poor but still contented  he told what excellent butter and cheese baucis made and how nice were the vegetables which he raised in his garden  he said too that because they loved one another so very much it was the wish of both that death might not separate them but that they should die as they had lived together  as the stranger listened a smile beamed over his countenance and made its expression as sweet as it was grand  you are a good old man said he to philemon and you have a good old wife to be your helpmeet  it is fit that your wish be granted  and it seemed to philemon just then as if the sunset clouds threw up a bright flash from the west and kindled a sudden light in the sky  baucis had now got supper ready and coming to the door began to make apologies for the poor fare which she was forced to set before her guests  had we known you were coming said she my good man and myself would have gone without a morsel rather than you should lack a better supper but i took the most part of todays milk to make cheese and our last loaf is already half eaten  ah me  i never feel the sorrow of being poor save when a poor traveller knocks at our door  all will be very well do not trouble yourself my good dame replied the elder stranger kindly  an honest hearty welcome to a guest works miracles with the fare and is capable of turning the coarsest food to nectar and ambrosia  a welcome you shall have cried baucis and likewise a little honey that we happen to have left and a bunch of purple grapes besides  why mother baucis it is a feast exclaimed quicksilver laughing an absolute feast and you shall see how bravely i will play my part at it  i think i never felt hungrier in my life  mercy on us whispered baucis to her husband  if the young man has such a terrible appetite i am afraid there will not be half enough supper  they all went into the cottage  and now my little auditors shall i tell you something that will make you open your eyes very wide  it is really one of the oddest circumstances in the whole story  quicksilvers staff you recollect had set itself up against the wall of the cottage  well when its master entered the door leaving this wonderful staff behind what should it do but immediately spread its little wings and go hopping and fluttering up the doorsteps  tap tap went the staff on the kitchen floor nor did it rest until it had stood itself on end with the greatest gravity and decorum beside quicksilvers chair  old philemon however as well as his wife was so taken up in attending to their guests that no notice was given to what the staff had been about  as baucis had said there was but a scanty supper for two hungry travellers  in the middle of the table was the remnant of a brown loaf with a piece of cheese on one side of it and a dish of honeycomb on the other  there was a pretty good bunch of grapes for each of the guests a moderately sized earthen pitcher nearly full of milk stood at a corner of the board and when hands had filled two bowls and set them before the strangers only a little milk remained in the bottom of the pitcher  alas it is a very sad business when a bountiful heart finds itself pinched and squeezed among narrow circumstances  poor baucis kept wishing that she might starve for a week to come if it were possible by so doing to provide these hungry folks a more plentiful supper  and since the supper was so exceedingly small she could not help wishing that their appetites had not been quite so large  why at their very first sitting down the travellers both drank off all the milk in their two bowls at a draught  a little more milk kind mother baucis if you please said quicksilver  the day has been hot and i am very much athirst  now my dear people answered baucis in great confusion i am so sorry and ashamed  but the truth is there is hardly a drop more milk in the pitcher  o husband husband why did nt we go without our supper  why it appears to me cried quicksilver starting up from table and taking the pitcher by the handle it really appears to me that matters are not quite so bad as you represent them  here is certainly more milk in the pitcher  so saying and to the vast astonishment of baucis he proceeded to fill not only his own bowl but his companions likewise from the pitcher that was supposed to be almost empty  the good woman could scarcely believe her eyes  she had certainly poured out nearly all the milk and had peeped in afterwards and seen the bottom of the pitcher as she set it down upon the table  but i am old thought baucis to herself and apt to be forgetful  i suppose i must have made a mistake  at all events the pitcher cannot help being empty now after filling the bowls twice over  what excellent milk observed quicksilver after quaffing the contents of the second bowl  excuse me my kind hostess but i must really ask you for a little more  now baucis had seen as plainly as she could see anything that quicksilver had turned the pitcher upside down and consequently had poured out every drop of milk in filling the last bowl  of course there could not possibly be any left  however in order to let him know precisely how the case was she lifted the pitcher and made a gesture as if pouring milk into quicksilvers bowl but without the remotest idea that any milk would stream forth  what was her surprise therefore when such an abundant cascade fell bubbling into the bowl that it was immediately filled to the brim and overflowed upon the table  the two snakes that were twisted about quicksilvers staff but neither baucis nor philemon happened to observe this circumstance stretched out their heads and began to lap up the spilt milk  and then what a delicious fragrance the milk had  it seemed as if philemons only cow must have pastured that day on the richest herbage that could be found anywhere in the world  i only wish that each of you my beloved little souls could have a bowl of such nice milk at suppertime  and now a slice of your brown loaf mother baucis said quicksilver and a little of that honey  baucis cut him a slice accordingly and though the loaf when she and her husband ate of it had been rather too dry and crusty to be palatable it was now as light and moist as if but a few hours out of the oven  tasting a crumb which had fallen on the table she found it more delicious than bread ever was before and could hardly believe that it was a loaf of her own kneading and baking  yet what other loaf could it possibly be  but oh the honey  i may just as well let it alone without trying to describe how exquisitely it smelt and looked  its color was that of the purest and most transparent gold and it had the odor of a thousand flowers but of such flowers as never grew in an earthly garden and to seek which the bees must have flown high above the clouds  the wonder is that after alighting on a flowerbed of so delicious fragrance and immortal bloom they should have been content to fly down again to their hive in philemons garden  never was such honey tasted seen or smelt the perfume floated around the kitchen and made it so delightful that had you closed your eyes you would instantly have forgotten the low ceiling and smoky walls and have fancied yourself in an arbor with celestial honeysuckles creeping over it  although good mother baucis was a simple old dame she could not but think that there was something rather out of the common way in all that had been going on  so after helping the guests to bread and honey and laying a bunch of grapes by each of their plates she sat down by philemon and told him what she had seen in a whisper  did you ever hear the like asked she  no i never did answered philemon with a smile  and i rather think my dear old wife you have been walking about in a sort of a dream  if i had poured out the milk i should have seen through the business at once  there happened to be a little more in the pitcher than you thoughtthat is all  ah husband said baucis say what you will these are very uncommon people  well well replied philemon still smiling perhaps they are  they certainly do look as if they had seen better days and i am heartily glad to see them making so comfortable a supper  each of the guests had now taken his bunch of grapes upon his plate baucis who rubbed her eyes in order to see the more clearly was of opinion that the clusters had grown larger and richer and that each separate grape seemed to be on the point of bursting with ripe juice it was entirely a mystery to her how such grapes could ever have been produced from the old stunted vine that climbed against the cottagewall  very admirable grapes these observed quicksilver as he swallowed one after another without apparently diminishing his cluster  pray my good host whence did you gather them  from my own vine answered philemon  you may see one of its branches twisting across the window yonder  but wife and i never thought the grapes very fine ones  i never tasted better said the guest  another cup of this delicious milk if you please and i shall then have supped better than a prince  this time old philemon bestirred himself and took up the pitcher for he was curious to discover whether there was any reality in the marvels which baucis had whispered to him  he knew that his good old wife was incapable of falsehood and that she was seldom mistaken in what she supposed to be true but this was so very singular a case that he wanted to see into it with his own eyes  on taking up the pitcher therefore he slyly peeped into it and was fully satisfied that it contained not so much as a single drop  all at once however he beheld a little white fountain which gushed up from the bottom of the pitcher and speedily filled it to the brim with foaming and deliciously fragrant milk  it was lucky that philemon in his surprise did not drop the miraculous pitcher from his hand  who are ye wonderworking strangers cried he even more bewildered than his wife had been  your guests my good philemon and your friends replied the elder traveller in his mild deep voice that had something at once sweet and aweinspiring in it  give me likewise a cup of the milk and may your pitcher never be empty for kind baucis and yourself any more than for the needy wayfarer  the supper being now over the strangers requested to be shown to their place of repose  the old people would gladly have talked with them a little longer and have expressed the wonder which they felt and their delight at finding the poor and meagre supper prove so much better and more abundant than they hoped  but the elder traveller had inspired them with such reverence that they dared not ask him any questions and when philemon drew quicksilver aside and inquired how under the sun a fountain of milk could have got into air old earthen pitcher this latter personage pointed to his staff  there is the whole mystery of the affair quoth quicksilver and if you can make it out ill thank you to let me know  i cant tell what to make of my staff  it is always playing such odd tricks as this sometimes getting me a supper and quite as often stealing it away if i had any faith in such nonsense i should say the stick was bewitched  he said no more but looked so slyly in their faces that they rather fancied he was laughing at them  the magic staff went hopping at his heels as quicksilver quitted the room  when left alone the good old couple spent some little time in conversation about the events of the evening and then lay down on the floor and fell fast asleep  they had given up their sleepingroom to the guests and had no other bed for themselves save these planks which i wish had been as soft as their own hearts  the old man and his wife were stirring betimes in the morning and the strangers likewise arose with the sun and made their preparations to depart  philemon hospitably entreated them to remain a little longer until baucis could milk the cow and bake a cake upon the hearth and perhaps find them a few fresh eggs for breakfast  the guests however seemed to think it better to accomplish a good part of their journey before the heat of the day should come on  they therefore persisted in setting out immediately but asked philemon and baucis to walk forth with them a short distance and show them the road which they were to take  so they all four issued from the cottage chatting together like old friends  it was very remarkable indeed how familiar the old couple insensibly grew with the elder traveller and how their good and simple spirits melted into his even as two drops of water would melt into the illimitable ocean  and as for quicksilver with his keen quick laughing wits he appeared to discover every little thought that but peeped into their minds before they suspected it themselves  they sometimes wished it is true that he had not been quite so quickwitted and also that he would fling away his staff which looked so mysteriously mischievous with the snakes always writhing about it but then again quicksilver showed himself so very goodhumored that they would have been rejoiced to keep him in their cottage staff snakes and all every day and the whole day long  ah me  welladay exclaimed philemon when they had walked a little way from their door  if our neighbors only knew what a blessed thing it is to show hospitality to strangers they would tie up all their dogs and never allow their children to fling another stone  it is a sin and shame for them to behave sothat it is cried good old baucis vehemently  and i mean to go this very day and tell some of then what naughty people they are  i fear remarked quicksilver slyly smiling that you will find none of them at home  the elder travellers brow just then assumed such a grave stern and awful grandeur yet serene withal that neither baucis nor philemon dared to speak a word  they gazed reverently into his face as if they had been gazing at the sky  when men do not feel towards the humblest stranger as if he were a brother said the traveller in tones so deep that they sounded like those of an organ they are unworthy to exist on earth which was created as the abode of a great human brotherhood  and by the by my dear old people cried quicksilver with the liveliest look of fun and mischief in his eyes where is this same village that you talk about  on which side of us does it lie  methinks i do not see it hereabouts  philemon and his wife turned towards the valley where at sunset only the day before they had seen the meadows the houses the gardens the clumps of trees the wide greenmargined street with children playing in it and all the tokens of business enjoyment and prosperity  but what was their astonishment  there was no longer any appearance of a village  even the fertile vale in the hollow of which it lay had ceased to have existence  in its stead they beheld the broad blue surface of a lake which filled the great basin of the valley from brim to brim and reflected the surrounding bills in its bosom with as tranquil an image as if it had been there ever since the creation of the world  for an instant the lake remained perfectly smooth  then a little breeze sprang up and caused the water to dance glitter and sparkle in the early sunbeams and to dash with a pleasant rippling murmur against the hither shore  the lake seemed so strangely familiar that the old couple were greatly perplexed and felt as if they could only have been dreaming about a village having lain there  but the next moment they remembered the vanished dwellings and the faces and characters of the inhabitants far too distinctly for a dream  the village had been there yesterday and now was gone  alas cried these kindhearted old people what has become of our poor neighbors  they exist no longer as men and women said the elder traveller in his grand and deep voice while a roll of thunder seemed to echo it at a distance  there was neither use nor beauty in such a life as theirs for they never softened or sweetened the hard lot of mortality by the exercise of kindly affections between man and man  they retained no image of the better life in their bosoms therefore the lake that was of old has spread itself forth again to reflect the sky  and as for those foolish people said quicksilver with his mischievous smile they are all transformed to fishes  there needed but little change for they were already a scaly set of rascals and the coldestblooded beings in existence  so kind mother baucis whenever you or your husband have an appetite for a dish of broiled trout he can throw in a line and pull out half a dozen of your old neighbors  ah cried baucis shuddering i would not for the world put one of them on the gridiron  no added philemon making a wry face we could never relish them  as for you good philemon continued the elder travellerand you kind baucisyou with your scanty means have mingled so much heartfelt hospitality with your entertainment of the homeless stranger that the milk became an inexhaustible fount of nectar and the brown loaf and the honey were ambrosia  thus the divinities have feasted at your board off the same viands that supply their banquets on olympus you have done well my dear old friends  wherefore request whatever favor you have most at heart and it is granted  philemon and baucis looked at one another and theni know not which of the two it was who spoke but that one uttered the desire of both their hearts  let us live together while we live and leave the world at the same instant when we die  for we have always loved one another  be it so replied the stranger with majestic kindness  now look towards your cottage  they did so  but what was their surprise on beholding a tall edifice of white marble with a wideopen portal occupying the spot where their humble residence had so lately stood  there is your home said the stranger beneficently smiling on them both  exercise your hospitality in yonder palace as freely as in the poor hovel to which you welcomed us last evening  the old folks fell on their knees to thank him but behold neither he nor quicksilver was there  so philemon and baucis took up their residence in the marble palace and spent their time with vast satisfaction to themselves in making everybody jolly and comfortable who happened to pass that way  the milkpitcher i must not forget to say retained its marvellous quality of being never empty when it was desirable to have it full  whenever an honest goodhumored and freehearted guest took a draught from this pitcher he invariably found it the sweetest and most invigorating fluid that ever ran down his throat  but if a cross and disagreeable curmudgeon happened to sip he was pretty certain to twist his visage into a hard knot and pronounce it a pitcher of sour milk  thus the old couple lived in their palace a great great while and grew older and older and very old indeed  at length however there came a summer morning when philemon and baucis failed to make their appearance as on other mornings with one hospitable smile overspreading both their pleasant faces to invite the guests of overnight to breakfast  the guests searched everywhere from top to bottom of the spacious palace and all to no purpose  but after a great deal of perplexity they espied in front of the portal two venerable trees which nobody could remember to have seen there the day before  yet there they stood with their roots fastened deep into the soil and a huge breadth of foliage overshadowing the whole front of the edifice  one was an oak and the other a lindentree  their boughs it was strange and beautiful to seewere intertwined together and embraced one another so that each tree seemed to live in the other trees bosom much more than in its own  while the guests were marvelling how these trees that must have required at least a century to grow could have come to be so tall and venerable in a single night a breeze sprang up and set their intermingled boughs astir  and then there was a deep broad murmur in the air as if the two mysterious trees were speaking  i am old philemon murmured the oak  i am old baucis murmured the lindentree  but as the breeze grew stronger the trees both spoke at oncephilemon baucis  baucis  philemonas if one were both and both were one and talking together in the depths of their mutual heart  it was plain enough to perceive that the good old couple had renewed their age and were now to spend a quiet and delightful hundred years or so philemon as an oak and baucis as a lindentree  and oh what a hospitable shade did they fling around them  whenever a wayfarer paused beneath it he heard a pleasant whisper of the leaves above his head and wondered how the sound should so much resemble words like these  welcome welcome dear traveller welcome  and some kind soul that knew what would have pleased old baucis and old philemon best built a circular seat around both their trunks where for a great while afterwards the weary and the hungry and the thirsty used to repose themselves and quaff milk abundantly out of the miraculous pitcher  and i wish for all our sakes that we had the pitcher here now    the hillside  after the story  how much did the pitcher hold asked sweet fern  it did not hold quite a quart answered the student but you might keep pouring milk out of it till you should fill a hogshead if you pleased  the truth is it would run on forever and not be dry even at midsummerwhich is more than can be said of yonder rill that goes babbling down the hillside  and what has become of the pitcher now  inquired the little boy  it was broken i am sorry to say about twentyfive thousand years ago replied cousin eustace  the people mended it as well as they could but though it would hold milk pretty well it was never afterwards known to fill itself of its own accord  so you see it was no better than any other cracked earthen pitcher  what a pity cried all the children at once  the respectable dog ben had accompanied the party as did likewise a halfgrown newfoundland puppy who went by the name of bruin because he was just as black as a bear  ben being elderly and of very circumspect habits was respectfully requested by cousin eustace to stay behind with the four little children in order to keep them out of mischief  as for black bruin who was himself nothing but a child the student thought it best to take him along lest in his rude play with the other children he should trip them up and send them rolling and tumbling down the bill  advising cowslip sweet fern dandelion and squashblossom to sit pretty still in the spot where he left them the student with primrose and the elder children began to ascend and were soon out of sight among the trees
