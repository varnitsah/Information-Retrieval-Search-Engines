59611388	twice told tales                        little annies ramble                        by nathaniel hawthorne    dingdong  dingdong  dingdong  the town crier has rung his bell at a distant corner and little annie stands on her fathers doorsteps trying to hear what the man with the loud voice is talking about  let me listen too  o he is telling the people that an elephant and a lion and a royal tiger and a horse with horns and other strange beasts from foreign countries have come to town and will receive all visitors who choose to wait upon them perhaps little annie would like to go  yes and i can see that the pretty child is weary of this wide and pleasant street with the green trees flinging their shade across the quiet sunshine and the pavements and the sidewalks all as clean as if the housemaid had just swept them with her broom  she feels that impulse to go strolling awaythat longing after the mystery of the great worldwhich many children feel and which i felt in my childhood  little annie shall take a ramble with me  see  i do but hold out my hand and like some bright bird in the sunny air with her blue silk frock fluttering upwards from her white pantalets she comes bounding on tiptoe across the street  smooth back your brown curls annie and let me tie on your bonnet and we will set forth  what a strange couple to go on their rambles together  one walks in black attire with a measured step and a heavy brow and his thoughtful eyes bent down while the gay little girl trips lightly along as if she were forced to keep hold of my hand lest her feet should dance away from the earth  yet there is sympathy between us if i pride myself on anything it is because i have a smile that children love and on the other hand there are few grown ladies that could entice me from the side of little annie for i delight to let my mind go hand in hand with the mind of a sinless child  so come annie but if i moralize as we go do not listen to me only look about you and be merry  now we turn the corner  here are hacks with two horses and stagecoaches with four thundering to meet each other and trucks and carts moving at a slower pace being heavily laden with barrels from the wharves and here are rattling gigs which perhaps will be smashed to pieces before our eyes  hitherward also comes a man trundling a wheelbarrow along the pavement  is not little annie afraid of such a tumult  no she does not even shrink closer to my side but passes on with fearless confidence a happy child amidst a great throng of grown people who pay the same reverence to her infancy that they would to extreme old age  nobody jostles her all turn aside to make way for little annie and what is most singular she appears conscious of her claim to such respect  now her eyes brighten with pleasure  a streetmusician has seated himself on the steps of yonder church and pours forth his strains to the busy town a melody that has gone astray among the tramp of footsteps the buzz of voices and the war of passing wheels  who heeds the poor organgrinder  none but myself and little annie whose feet begin to move in unison with the lively tune as if she were loath that music should be wasted without a dance  but where would annie find a partner  some have the gout in their toes or the rheumatism in their joints some are stiff with age some feeble with disease some are so lean that their bones would rattle and others of such ponderous size that their agility would crack the flagstones but many many have leaden feet because their hearts are far heavier than lead  it is a sad thought that i have chanced upon  what a company of dancers should we be  for i too am a gentleman of sober footsteps and therefore little annie let us walk sedately on  it is a question with me whether this giddy child or my sage self have most pleasure in looking at the shopwindows  we love the silks of sunny hue that glow within the darkened premises of the spruce drygoods men we are pleasantly dazzled by the burnished silver and the chased gold the rings of wedlock and the costly loveornaments glistening at the window of the jeweller but annie more than i seeks for a glimpse of her passing figure in the dusty lookingglasses at the hardware stores all that is bright and gay attracts us both  here is a shop to which the recollections of my boyhood as well as present partialities give a peculiar magic  how delightful to let the fancy revel on the dainties of a confectioner those pies with such white and flaky paste their contents being a mystery whether rich mince with whole plums intermixed or piquant apple delicately roseflavored those cakes heartshaped or round piled in a lofty pyramid those sweet little circlets sweetly named kisses those dark majestic masses fit to be bridalloaves at the wedding of an heiress mountains in size their summits deeply snowcovered with sugar  then the mighty treasures of sugarplums white and crimson and yellow in large glass vases and candy of all varieties and those little cockles or whatever they are called much prized by children for their sweetness and more for the mottoes which they enclose by lovesick maids and bachelors  o my mouth waters little annie and so doth yours but we will not be tempted except to an imaginary feast so let us hasten onward devouring the vision of a plumcake  here are pleasures as some people would say of a more exalted kind in the window of a bookseller  is annie a literary lady  yes she is deeply read in peter parleys tomes and has an increasing love for fairytales though seldom met with nowadays and she will subscribe next year to the juvenile miscellany  but truth to tell she is apt to turn away from the printed page and keep gazing at the pretty pictures such as the gaycolored ones which make this shopwindow the continual loiteringplace of children  what would annie think if in the book which i mean to send her on new years day she should find her sweet little self bound up in silk or morocco with gilt edges there to remain till she become a woman grown with children of her own to read about their mothers childhood  that would be very queer  little annie is weary of pictures and pulls me onward by the hand till suddenly we pause at the most wondrous shop in all the town  o my stars  is this a toyshop or is it fairyland  for here are gilded chariots in which the king and queen of the fairies might ride side by side while their courtiers on these small horses should gallop in triumphal procession before and behind the royal pair  here too are dishes of chinaware fit to be the dining set of those same princely personages when they make a regal banquet in the stateliest ball of their palace full five feet high and behold their nobles feasting adown the long perspective of the table  betwixt the king and queen should sit my little annie the prettiest fairy of them all  here stands a turbaned turk threatening us with his sabre like an ugly heathen as he is  and next a chinese mandarin who nods his head at annie and myself  here we may review a whole army of horse and foot in red and blue uniforms with drums fifes trumpets and all kinds of noiseless music they have halted on the shelf of this window after their weary march from liliput but what cares annie for soldiers  no conquering queen is she neither a semiramis nor a catharine her whole heart is set upon that doll who gazes at us with such a fashionable stare  this is the little girls true plaything  though made of wood a doll is a visionary and ethereal personage endowed by childish fancy with a peculiar life the mimic lady is a heroine of romance an actor and a sufferer in a thousand shadowy scenes the chief inhabitant of that wild world with which children ape the real one  little annie does not understand what i am saying but looks wishfully at the proud lady in the window  we will invite her home with us as we return  meantime good by dame doll  a toy yourself you look forth from your window upon many ladies that are also toys though they walk and speak and upon a crowd in pursuit of toys though they wear grave visages  o with your neverclosing eyes had you but an intellect to moralize on all that flits before them what a wise doll would you be  come little annie we shall find toys enough go where we may  now we elbow our way among the throng again  it is curious in the most crowded part of a town to meet with living creatures that had their birthplace in some far solitude but have acquired a second nature in the wilderness of men  look up annie at that canarybird hanging out of the window in his cage  poor little fellow  his golden feathers are all tarnished in this smoky sunshine he would have glistened twice as brightly among the summer islands but still he has become a citizen in all his tastes and habits and would not sing half so well without the uproar that drowns his music  what a pity that he does not know how miserable he is  there is a parrot too calling out pretty poll pretty poll as we pass by  foolish bird to be talking about her prettiness to strangers especially as she is not a pretty poll though gaudily dressed in green and yellow  if she had said pretty annie there would have been some sense in it  see that gray squirrel at the door of the fruitshop whirling round and round so merrily within his wire wheel  being condemned to the treadmill he makes it an amusement admirable philosophy  here comes a big rough dog a countrymans dog in search of his master smelling at everybodys heels and touching little annies hand with his cold nose but hurrying away though she would fain have patted him success to your search fidelity  and there sits a great yellow cat upon a windowsill a very corpulent and comfortable cat gazing at this transitory world with owls eyes and making pithy comments doubtless or what appear such to the silly beast  o sage puss make room for me beside you and we will be a pair of philosophers  here we see something to remind us of the town crier and his dingdong bell  look look at that great cloth spread out in the air pictured all over with wild beasts as if they had met together to choose a king according to their custom in the days of aesop  but they are choosing neither a king nor a president else we should hear a most horrible snarling  they have come from the deep woods and the wild mountains and the desert sands and the polar snows only to do homage to my little annie  as we enter among them the great elephant makes us a bow in the best style of elephantine courtesy bending lowly down his mountain bulk with trunk abased and leg thrust out behind  annie returns the salute much to the gratification of the elephant who is certainly the bestbred monster in the caravan  the lion and the lioness are busy with two beefbones  the royal tiger the beautiful the untamable keeps pacing his narrow cage with a haughty step unmindful of the spectators or recalling the fierce deeds of his former life when he was wont to leap forth upon such inferior animals from the jungles of bengal here we see the very same wolfdo not go near him anniethe selfsame wolf that devoured little red riding hood and her grandmother in the next cage a hyena from egypt who has doubtless howled around the pyramids and a black bear from our own forests are fellowprisoners and most excellent friends  are there any two living creatures who have so few sympathies that they cannot possibly be friends  here sits a great white bear whom common observers would call a very stupid beast though i perceive him to be only absorbed in contemplation he is thinking of his voyages on an iceberg and of his comfortable home in the vicinity of the north pole and of the little cubs whom he left rolling in the eternal snows  in fact he is a bear of sentiment  but o those unsentimental monkeys the ugly grinning aping chattering illnatured mischievous and queer little brutes  annie does not love the monkeys their ugliness shocks her pure instinctive delicacy of taste and makes her mind unquiet because it bears a wild and dark resemblance to humanity but here is a little pony just big enough for annie to ride and round and round he gallops in a circle keeping time with his trampling hoofs to a band of music  and herewith a laced coat and a cocked hat and a riding whip in his handhere comes a little gentleman small enough to be king of the fairies and ugly enough to be king of the gnomes and takes a flying leap into the saddle  merrily merrily plays the music and merrily gallops the pony and merrily rides the little old gentleman  come annie into the street again perchance we may see monkeys on horseback there  mercy on us what a noisy world we quiet people live in  did annie ever read the cries of london city with what lusty lungs doth yonder man proclaim that his wheelbarrow is full of lobsters  here comes another mounted on a cart and blowing a hoarse and dreadful blast from a tin horn as much as to say fresh fish  and hark a voice on high like that of a muezzin from the summit of a mosque announcing that some chimneysweeper has emerged from smoke and soot and darksome caverns into the upper air  what cares the world for that  but welladay we hear a shrill voice of affliction the scream of a little child rising louder with every repetition of that smart sharp slapping sound produced by an open hand on tender flesh annie sympathizes though without experience of such direful woe  lo the town crier again with some new secret for the public ear  will he tell us of an auction or of a lost pocketbook or a show of beautiful wax figures or of some monstrous beast more horrible than any in the caravan  i guess the latter  see how he uplifts the bell in his right hand and shakes it slowly at first then with a hurried motion till the clapper seems to strike both sides at once and the sounds are scattered forth in quick succession far and near  dingdong  dingdong  dingdong  now he raises his clear loud voice above all the din of the town it drowns the buzzing talk of many tongues and draws each mans mind from his own business it rolls up and down the echoing street and ascends to the hushed chamber of the sick and penetrates downward to the cellar kitchen where the hot cook turns from the fire to listen  who of all that address the public ear whether in church or courthouse or hall of state has such an attentive audience as the town crier  what saith the peoples orator  strayed from her home a little girl of five years old in a blue silk frock and white pantalets with brown curling hair and hazel eyes whoever will bring her back to her afflicted mother  stop stop town crier  the lost is found  o my pretty annie we forgot to tell your mother of our ramble and she is in despair and has sent the town crier to bellow up and down the streets afrighting old and young for the loss of a little girl who has not once let go my hand well let us hasten homeward and as we go forget not to thank heaven my annie that after wandering a little way into the world you may return at the first summons with an untainted and unwearied heart and be a happy child again  but i have gone too far astray for the town crier to call me back  sweet has been the charm of childhood on my spirit throughout my ramble with little annie  say not that it has been a waste of precious moments an idle matter a babble of childish talk and a revery of childish imaginations about topics unworthy of a grown mans notice  has it been merely this  not so not so  they are not truly wise who would affirm it  as the pure breath of children revives the life of aged men so is our moral nature revived by their free and simple thoughts their native feeling their airy mirth for little cause or none their grief soon roused and soon allayed  their influence on us is at least reciprocal with ours on them  when our infancy is almost forgotten and our boyhood long departed though it seems but as yesterday when life settles darkly down upon us and we doubt whether to call ourselves young any more then it is good to steal away from the society of bearded men and even of gentler woman and spend an hour or two with children  after drinking from those fountains of still fresh existence we shall return into the crowd as i do now to struggle onward and do our part in life perhaps as fervently as ever but for a time with a kinder and purer heart and a spirit more lightly wise  all this by thy sweet magic dear little annie
