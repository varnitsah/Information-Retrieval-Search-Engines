wounded there and like to drown   while days rush wave after wave on its lair  an invisible woe unseals   the flood so it passes beyond all bounds the great old city recumbent roars as it feels   the foamy paw of the pond reach from immensity  but all that it can do   now as the tide rises is to listen and hear the grim waves crash like thunder through   the splintered streets hear noises roll

eyes   and a glint of coloured iris brings   such as lies along the folded wings of the bee before he flies  who with a ruffling careful breath   has opened the wings of the wild young sprite   has fluttered her spirit to stumbling flight in her eyes as a young bee stumbleth  love makes the burden of her voice   the hum of his heavy staggering wings   sets quivering with wisdom the common

the new red houses spring like plants       in level rows of reddish herbage that bristles and slants       its square shadows  the pink young houses show one side bright       flatly assuming the sun and one side shadow half in sight       halfhiding the pavementrun  where hastening creatures pass intent       on their level way threading like ants that can never relent       and have nothing to say  bare stems of streetlamps stiffly stand       at random desolate twigs to testify to a blight on the land       that has stripped their sprigs    thief in the night  last night a thief came to me   and struck at me with something dark i cried but no one could hear me   i lay dumb and stark  when i awoke this morning   i could find no trace perhaps twas a dream of warning   for ive lost my

aglance with fire as it guards the wild north cloudcoasts      redfire seas running through the rocks where ravens flying to windward melt      as a wellshot lance  you should be out by the orchard where violets      secretly darken the earth or there in the woods of the twilight with      northern windflowers shaken astir think of me here in the library trying and trying      a song that is

wind that is caught up high in      the mesh of the budding trees a sudden car goes sweeping past and i strain my      soul to hear the voice of the furtive triumphant engine as it      rushes past like a breeze to hear on its mocking triumphance unwitting      the afterecho of fear   suburbs on a hazy day  o stiffly shapen houses that change not   what conjurors cloth was thrown across you      and raised to show you thus transfigured changed   your stuff all gone your menace almost rased  such resolute shapes so harshly set   in hollow blocks and cubes deformed and heaped in void and null profusion how is this   in what strong aqua regia now are you steeped  that you lose the brickstuff out of you   and hover like a presentment fading faint and vanquished evaporate away   to leave but only the merest possible taint   hyde park at night before the war  clerks  we have shut the doors behind us and the velvet     flowers of night lean about us scattering their pollen grains of     golden light  now at last we lift our faces and our faces come     aflower to the night that takes us willing liberates us to the     hour  now at last the ink and dudgeon passes from our     fervent eyes and out of the chambered weariness wanders a     spirit abroad on its enterprise      not too near and not too far     out of the stress of the crowd     music screams as elephants scream     when they lift their trunks and scream aloud     for joy of the night when masters are            asleep and adream      so here i hide in the shalimar     with a wanton princess slender and proud

signals each one    dreadful you would not turn and answer me the night is wonderful  even you if you knew how this darkness soaks me through and through    and infuses unholy fear in my vapour you would pause to dis    tinguish what hurts from what amuses  for i tell you beneath this powerful tree my whole souls fluid oozes away from me as a sacrifice steam at the knife of a druid  again i tell you i bleed i am bound with withies my life runs out i tell you my blood runs out on the floor of this oak gout upon gout  above me springs the bloodborn mistletoe in the shady smoke but who are you twittering to and fro beneath the oak  what thing better are you what worse what have you to do with the mysteries of this ancient place of my ancient curse what place have you in my histories   sigh no more  the cuckoo and the coodoves ceaseless calling                calling of a meaningless monotony is palling all my mornings pleasure in the sunfleckscattered      wood mayblossom and blue birdseye flowers falling                falling in a litter through the elmtree shade are scrawling messages of truelove down the dust of the high      road i do not like to hear the gentle grieving                grieving of the shedove in the blossom still believing love will yet again return to her and make all good  when i know that there must ever be deceiving                deceiving of the mournful constant heart that while shes      weaving her woes her lover woos and sings within another      wood  oh boisterous the cuckoo shouts forestalling                stalling a progress down the intricate enthralling bypaths where the wantonheaded flowers doff      their hood  and like a laughter leads me onward heaving                heaving a sigh among the shadows thus retrieving a

west wind rapping are torn away and a splash of red goes down the billowing air  still hangs the hawk with the whole sky moving past himonly a wingbeat proving the will that holds him there  the daisies in the grass are bending the hawk has dropped the wind is spending all the roses and unending rustle of leaves washes out the rending cry of a bird  a red rose goes on the windascending the hawk his windswept way is wending easily down the sky the daisies sending strange white signals seem intending to show the place whence the scream was heard  but oh my heart what birds are piping a silver wind is hastily wiping the face of the youngest rose  and oh my heart cease apprehending the hawk is gone a rose is tapping the windowsash as the westwind blows  knock knock tis no more than a red rose rapping and fear is a plash of wings what then if a scarlet rose goes flapping down the brightgrey ruin of things   parliament hill in the evening  the houses fade in a melt of mist   blotching the thick soiled air with reddish places that still resist   the nights slow care  the hopeless wintry twilight fades   the city corrodes out of sight as the body corrodes when death invades   that citadel of delight  now verdigris smoulderings softly spread   through the shroud of the town as slow nightlights hither and thither shed   their ghastly glow   piccadilly circus at night  streetwalkers  when into the night the yellow light is roused like    dust above the towns or like a mist the moon has kissed from off a pool in    the midst of the downs  our faces flower for a little hour pale and uncertain    along the street daisies that waken all mistaken whitespread in ex    pectancy to meet  the luminous mist which the poor things wist was    dawn arriving across the sky when dawn is far behind the star the dustlit town    has driven so high  all the birds are folded in a silent ball of sleep    all the flowers are faded from the asphalt isle in       the sea only

and the cyprians pavementroses are gone and       now it is we flowers of illusion who shine in our gauds make a       paradise    on the shores of this ceaseless ocean gay birds of       the towndark sea   tarantella  sad as he sits on the white seastone and the suave sea chuckles and turns to the moon and the moon significant smiles at the cliffs and    the boulders he sits like a shade by the flood alone while i dance a tarantella on the rocks and the    croon of my mockery mocks at him over the waves    bright shoulders  what can i do but dance alone dance to the sliding sea and the moon for the moon on my breast and the air on my limbs    and the foam on my feet for surely this earnest man has none of the night in his soul and none of the tune of the waters within him only the worlds old    wisdom to bleat  i wish a wild seafellow would come down the    glittering shingle a soulless neckar with winking seas in his eyes and falling waves in his arms and the lost souls kiss on his lips i long to be soulless i tingle to touch the sea in the last surprise of fiery coldness to be gone in a lost souls bliss   in church  in the choir the boys are singing the hymn         the morning light on their lips moves in silvermoist flashes in musical trim  sudden outside the high window one crow         hangs in the air and lights on a withered oaktrees top of woe  one bird one blot

sabbath suffusing our sacred day   piano  softly in the dusk a woman is singing to me taking me back down the vista of years till i see a child sitting under the piano in the boom of the     tingling strings and pressing the small poised feet of a mother who     smiles as she sings  in spite of myself the insidious mastery of song betrays me back till the heart of me weeps to belong to the old sunday evenings at home with winter     outside and hymns in the cosy parlour the tinkling piano     our guide  so now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamour with the great black piano

river in the black wet night as the furtive rain slinks     down dropping and starting from sleep alone on a seat a woman crouches  i must go back to her  i want to give her some money her hand slips out of the breast of     her gown asleep my fingers creep carefully over the sweet thumbmound into the palms deep pouches  so the gift  god how she starts and looks at me and looks in the palm of her hand and again at me i turn and run down the embankment run for my life  but whywhy  because of my hearts beating like sobs i come to myself and stand in the street spilled over splendidly with wet flat lights what ive done i know not my soul is in strife  the touch was on the quick i want to forget   phantasmagoria  rigid sleeps the house in darkness i alone like a thing unwarrantable cross the hall and climb the stairs to find the group of doors standing angelstern and tall  i want my own rooms shelter but what is this throng of startled beings suddenly thrown in confusion against my entry is it only the trees large shadows from the outside street lamp blown  phantom to phantom leaning strange women weep aloud suddenly on my mind startling a fear unspeakable as the shuddering wind breaks and sobs in the blind  so like to women tall strange women weeping why continually do they cross the bed why does my soul contract with unnatural fear i am listening is anything said  ever the long black figures swoop by the bed they seem to be beckoning rushing away and     beckoning whither then whither what is it say what is the reckoning  tall black bacchae of midnight why then why do you rush to assail me do i intrude on your rites nocturnal what should it avail me  is there some great iacchos of these slopes suburban dismal have i profaned some female mystery orgies black and

against me why am i in hell   palimpsest of twilight  darkness comes out of the earth   and swallows dip into the pallor of the west from the hay comes the clamour of childrens      mirth wanes the old palimpsest  the nightstock oozes scent   and a moonblue moth goes flittering by all that the worldly day has meant   wastes like a lie  the children have forsaken their play   a single star in a veil of light glimmers litter of day   is gone from sight   embankment at night before the war  outcasts  the night rain dripping unseen comes endlessly kissing my face and my hands  the river slipping between lamps is rayed with golden bands half way down its heaving sides revealed where it hides  under the bridge great electric cars sing through and each with a floorlight racing     along at its side far off oh midge after midge drifts over the gulf that bars the night with silence crossing the lamptouched     tide  at charing cross here beneath the bridge sleep in a row the outcasts packed in a line with their heads against the wall their feet in a broken ridge stretch out on the way and a lout casts a look as he stands on the edge of this naked stall  beasts that sleep will cover their faces in their flank so these have huddled rags or limbs on the naked sleep save as the tramcars hover past with the noise of a breeze and gleam as of sunshine crossing the low black heap  two naked faces are seen bare and asleep two pale clots swept and swept by the light of the     cars foamclots showing between the long low tidalheap the mudweed opening two pale shadowless stars  over the pallor of only two faces passes the gallivant beam of the trams shows in only two sad places the white bare bone of our shams  a little bearded man pale peaked in sleeping with a face like a chickweed flower and a heavy woman sleeping still keeping callous and dour  over the pallor of only two places tossed on the low black ruffled heap passes the light of the tram as it races out of the deep  eloquent limbs in disarray sleepsuave limbs of a youth with long smooth     thighs hutched up for warmth the muddy rims of trousers fray on the thin bare shins of a man who uneasily lies  the balls of five red toes as red and dirty bare young birds forsaken and left in a nest of mud newspaper sheets enclose some limbs like parcels and tear when the sleeper stirs or turns on the ebb of the     flood  one heaped mound of a womans knees as she thrusts them upward under the ruffled skirt and a curious dearth of sound in the presence of these wastrels that sleep on the flagstones without any     hurt  over two shadowless shameless faces stark on the heap travels the light as it tilts in its paces gone in one leap  at the feet of the sleepers watching stand those that wait for a place to lie down and still as they stand     they sleep wearily catching the floods slow gait like men who are drowned but float erect in the     deep  oh the singing mansions goldenlighted tall trams that pass blown ruddily down the night the bridge on its stanchions stoops like a pall to this human blight  on the outer pavement slowly theatre people pass holding aloft their umbrellas that flash and are     bright like flowers of infernal moly over nocturnal grass wetly bobbing and drifting away on our sight  and still by the rotten row of shattered feet outcasts keep guard forgotten forgetting till fate shall delete one from the ward  the factories on the surrey side are beautifully laid in black on a goldgrey sky the rivers invisible tide threads and thrills like ore that is wealth to the eye  and great gold midges cross the chasm at the bridges above intertwined plasm   winter in the boulevard  the frost has settled down upon the trees and ruthlessly strangled off the fantasies of leaves that have gone unnoticed swept like old romantic stories now no more to be told  the trees down the boulevard stand naked in     thought their abundant summery wordage silenced caught in the grim undertow naked the trees confront implacable winters long crossquestioning brunt  has some hand balanced more leaves in the depths     of the twigs some dim little efforts placed in the threads of the     birch it is only the sparrows like dead black leaves on     the sprigs sitting huddled against the cerulean one flesh with     their perch  the clear cold sky coldly bethinks itself like vivid thought the air spins bright and all trees birds and earth arrested in the afterthought awaiting the sentence out from the welkin brought   school on the outskirts  how different in the middle of snows the great      school rises red   a red rock silent and shadowless clung round      with clusters of shouting lads some few darkcleaving the doorway souls that      cling as the souls of the dead   in stupor persist at the gates of life obstinate      dark monads  this new red rock in a waste of white rises against      the day   with shelter now and with blandishment since      the winds have had their way and laid the desert horrific of silence and snow on      the world of mankind   school now is the rock in this weary land the winter      burns and makes blind   sickness  waving slowly before me pushed into the dark unseen my hands explore the silence drawing the     bark of my body slowly behind  nothing to meet my fingers but the fleece of night invisible blinding my face and my eyes what if     in their flight my hands should touch the door  what if i suddenly stumble and push the door open and a great grey dawn swirls over my feet     before i can draw back  what if unwitting i set the door of eternity wide and am swept away in the horrible dawn am gone     down the tide of eternal hereafter  catch my hands my darling between your breasts take them away from their venture before fate     wrests the meaning out of them   everlasting flowers  who do you think stands watching   the snowtops shining rosy in heaven now that the darkness   takes all but the tallest posy  who then sees the twowinged   boat down there all alone and asleep on the snows last shadow   like a moth on a stone  the oliveleaves light as gadflies   have all gone dark gone black and now in the dark my soul to you   turns back  to you my little darling   to you out of italy for what is loveliness my love   save you have it with me  so theres an oxen wagon   comes darkly into sight a man with a lantern swinging   a little light  what does he see my darling   here by the darkened lake here in the sloping shadow   the mountains make  he says not a word but passes   staring at what he sees what ghost of us both do you think he saw   under the olive trees  all the things that are lovely   the things you never knew i wanted to gather them one by one   and bring them to you  but never now my darling   can i gather the mountaintips from the twilight like halfshut lilies   to hold to your lips  and never the twowinged vessel   that sleeps below on the lake can i catch like a moth between my hands   for you to take  but hush i am not regretting   it is far more perfect now ill whisper the ghostly truth to the world   and tell them how  i know you here in the darkness   how you sit in the throne of my eyes at peace and look out of the windows   in glad surprise   the north country  in another country black poplars shake them     selves over a pond and rooks and the rising smokewaves scatter and     wheel from the works beyond the air is dark with north and with sulphur the     grass is a darker green and people darkly invested with purple move    palpable through the scene  soundlessly down across the counties out of the     resonant gloom that wraps the north in stupor and purple travels     the deep slow boom of the manlife northimprisoned shut in the hum     of the purpled steel as it spins to sleep on its motion drugged dense in     the sleep of the wheel  out of the sleep from the gloom of motion sound     lessly somnambule moans and booms the soul of a people imprisoned     asleep in the rule of the strong machine that runs mesmeric booming     the spell of its word upon them and moving them helpless mechanic     their will to its will deferred  yet all the while comes the droning inaudible out     of the violet air the moaning of sleepbound beings in travail that     toil and are willless there in the spellbound north convulsive now with a     dream near morning strong with violent achings heaving to burst the sleep     that is now not long   bitterness of death  i  ah stern cold man how can you lie so relentless hard while i wash you with weeping water do you set your face against the daughter of life can you never discard your curt prides ban  you masquerader how can you shame to act this part of unswerving indifference to me you want at last ah me to break my heart evader  you know your mouth was always sooner to soften even than your eyes now shut it lies relentless however often i kiss it in drouth  it has no breath nor any relaxing where where are you what have you done what is this mouth of stone how did you dare take cover in death  ii  once you could see the white moon show like a breast revealed by the slipping shawl of stars could see the small stars tremble as the heart beneath did wield systole diastole  all the lovely macrocosm was woman once to you bride to your groom no tree in bloom but it leaned you a new white bosom  and always and ever soft as a summering tree unfolds from the sky for your good unfolded womanhood shedding you down as a tree sheds its flowers on a river  i saw your brows set like rocks beside a sea of gloom and i shed my very soul down into your    thought like flowers i fell to be caught on the comforted pool like bloom that leaves the boughs  iii  oh masquerader with a hard face whiteenamelled what are you now do you care no longer how my heart is trammelled evader  is this you after all metallic obdurate with bowels of steel did you never feel cold insensate mechanical  ah noyou multiform you that i loved you wonderful you who darkened and shone you were many men in one but never this null this neverwarm  is this the sum of you is it all nought cold metalcold are you all told here ironwrought is this whats become of you   seven seals  since this is the last night i keep you home come i will consecrate you for the journey  rather i had you would not go nay come i will not again reproach you lie back and let me love you a long time ere you go for you are sullenhearted still and lack the will to love me but even so i will set a seal upon you from my lip will set a guard of honour at each door seal up each channel out of which might slip your love for me                   i kiss your mouth ah love could i but seal its ruddy shining spring of passion parch it up destroy remove its softlystirring crimson wellingup of kisses oh help me god here at the source id lie for ever drinking and drawing in your fountains as heaven drinks from out their     course the floods                   i close your ears with kisses and seal your nostrils and round your neck youll     wear nay let me worka delicate chain of kisses like beads they go around and not one misses to touch its fellow on either side                   and there full midbetween the champaign of your breast i place a great and burning seal of love like a dark rose a mystery of rest on the slow bubbling of your rhythmic heart  nay i persist and very faith shall keep you integral to me each door each mystic port of egress from you i will seal and steep in perfect chrism           now it is done the mort will sound in heaven before it is undone  but let me finish what i have begun and shirt you now invulnerable in the mail of iron kisses kisses linked like steel put greaves upon your thighs and knees and frail webbing of steel on your feet so you shall feel ensheathed invulnerable with me with seven great seals upon your outgoings and woven chain of my mystic will wrapped perfectly upon you wrapped in indomitable me   reading a letter  she sits on the recreation ground   under an oak whose yellow buds dot the pale      blue sky the young grass twinkles in the wind and the sound   of the wind in the knotted buds in a canopy  so sitting under the knotted canopy   of the wind she is lifted and carried away as in     a balloon across the insensible void till she stoops to see   the sandy desert beneath her the dreary platoon  she knows the waste all dry beneath her in one      place   stirring with earthcoloured life ever turning and      stirring but never the motion has a human face   nor sound save intermittent machinery whirring  and so again on the recreation ground   she alights a stranger wondering unused to the      scene suffering at sight of the children playing around   hurt at the chalkcoloured tulips and the even      inggreen   twenty years ago  round the house were lilacs and strawberries   and foalfoots spangling the paths and far away on the sandhills dewberries   caught dust from the seas long swaths  up the wolds the woods were walking   and nuts fell out of their hair at the gate the nets hung balking   the starlit rush of a hare  in the autumn fields the stubble   tinkled the music of gleaning at a mothers knees the trouble   lost all its meaning  yea what good beginnings   to this sad end have we had our innings   god forfend   intime  returning i find her just the same at just the same old delicate game  still she says nay loose no flame to lick me up and do me harm be all yourselffor oh the charm of your heart of fire in which i look oh better there than in any book glow and enact the dramas and dreams i love for everthere it seems you are lovelier than life itself till desire comes licking through the bars of your lips and over my face the stray fire slips leaving a burn and an ugly smart that will have the oil of illusion oh heart of fire and beauty loose no more your reptile flames of lust ah store your passion in the basket of your soul be all yourself one bonny burning coal that stays with steady joy of its own fire but do not seek to take me by desire oh do not seek to thrust on me your fire for in the firing all my porcelain of flesh does crackle and shiver and break in pain my ivory and marble black with stain my veil of sensitive mystery rent in twain my altars sullied i bereft remain a priestess execrable taken in vain                           so the refrain sings itself over and so the game restarts itself wherein i am kept like a glowing brazier faintly blue of flame so that the delicate loveadept can warm her hands and invite her soul sprinkling incense and salt of words and kisses pale and sipping the toll of incensesmoke that rises like birds  yet ive forgotten in playing this game things i have known that shall have no name forgetting the place from which i came i watch her ward away the flame yet warm herself at the firethen blame me that i flicker in the basket me that i glow not with content to have my substance so subtly spent me that i interrupt her game i ought to be proud that she should ask it of me to be her fireopal                           it is well since i am here for so short a spell not to interrupt herwhy should i break in by making any reply   two wives  i  into the shadowwhite chamber silts the white flux of another dawn the wind that all night long has waited restless suddenly wafts a whirl like snow from the plumtrees and the pear till petals heaped between the windowshafts             in a drift die there  a nurse in white at the dawning flowerfoamed    pane draws down the blinds whose shadows scarcely    stain the white rugs on the floor nor the silent bed that rides the room like a frozen berg its crest finally ridged with the austere line of the dead             stretched out at rest  less than a year the fourfold feet had pressed the peaceful floor when fell the sword on their rest yet soon too soon she had him home again with wounds between them and suffering like a    guest that will not go now suddenly going the pain             leaves an empty breast  ii  a tall woman with her long white gown aflow as she strode her limbs amongst it once more she hastened towards the room did she know as she listened in silence outside the silent door entering she saw him in outline raised on a pyre             awaiting the fire  upraised on the bed with feet erect as a bow like the prow of a boat his head laid back like the    stern of a ship that stands in a shadowy sea of snow with frozen rigging she saw him she drooped like    a fern refolding she slipped to the floor as a ghostwhite    peony slips             when the thread clips  soft she lay as a shed flower fallen nor heard the ominous entry nor saw the other love the dark the graveeyed mistress who thus dared at such an hour to lay her claim above a stricken wife so sunk in oblivion bowed             with misery no more proud  iii  the strangers hair was shorn like a lads dark poll and pale her ivory face her eyes would fail in silence when she looked for all the whole darkness of failure was in them without avail dark in indomitable failure she who had lost             now claimed the host  she softly passed the sorrowful flower shed in blonde and white on the floor nor even turned her head aside but straight towards the bed moved with slow feet and her eyes flame steadily    burned she looked at him as he lay with banded cheek             and she started to speak  softly i knew it would come to this she said i knew that some day soon i should find you thus so i did not fight you you went your way instead of coming mineand of the two of us i died the first i in the afterlife             am now your wife  iv  twas i whose fingers did draw up the young plant of your body to me you looked eer sprung the secret of the moon within your eyes my mouth you met before your fine red mouth was set to songand never your song denies             my love till you went south  twas i who placed the bloom of manhood on your youthful smoothness i fleeced where fleece    was none your fervent limbs with flickers and tendrils of new knowledge i set your heart to its stronger beat i put my strength upon you and i threw             my life at your feet  but i whom the years had reared to be your bride who for years was sun for your shivering shade for    your sweat who for one strange year was as a bride to youyou    set me aside with all the old sweet things of our youthand    never yet have i ceased to grieve that i was not great enough             to defeat your baser stuff  v  but you are given back again to me who have kept intact for you your virginity who for the rest of life walk out of care indifferent here of myself since i am gone where you are gone and you and i out there             walk now as one  your widow am i and only i i dream god bows his head and grants me this supreme pure look of your last dead face whence now is gone the mobility the panthers gambolling and all your being is given to me so none             can mock my struggling  and now at last i kiss your perfect face perfecting now our unfinished first embrace your young hushed look that then saw god ablaze in every bush is given you back and we are met at length to finish our rest of days             in a unity   heimweh  faroff the lilystatues stand whiteranked in the     garden at home would god they were shattered quickly the cattle     would tread them out in the loam i wish the elder trees in flower could suddenly heave     and burst the walls of the house and nettles puff out from     the hearth at which i was nursed  it stands so still in the hush composed of trees and     inviolate peace the home of my fathers the place that is mine my     fate and my old increase and now that the skies are falling the world is     spouting in fountains of dirt i would give my soul for the homestead to fall with     me go with me both in one hurt   debacle  the trees in trouble because of autumn   and scarlet berries falling from the bush and all the myriad houseless seeds   loosing hold in the winds insistent push  moan softly with autumnal parturition   poor obscure fruits extruded out of light into the world of shadow carried down   between the bitter knees of the afternight  bushed in an uncouth ardour coiled at core   with a knot of life that only bliss can unravel fall all the fruits most bitterly into earth   bitterly into corrosion bitterly travel  what is it internecine that is locked   by very fierceness into a quiescence within the rage we shall not know till it burst   out of corrosion into new florescence  nay but how tortured is the frightful seed   the spark intense within it all without mordant corrosion gnashing and champing hard   for ruin on the naked small redoubt  bitter to fold the issue and make no sally   to have the mystery but not go forth to bear but retaliate nothing given to save   the spark in storms of corrosion as seeds from      the north  the sharper more horrid the pressure the harder      the heart   that saves the blue grain of eternal fire within its quick committed to hold and wait   and suffer unheeding only forbidden to expire   narcissus  where the minnows trace a glinting web quick hid in the gloom of the brook when i think of the place and remember the small lad lying intent to look through the shadowy face at the little fish threadthreading the watery nook  it seems to me the woman you are should be nixie there is a pool where we ought to be you undineclear and pearly soullessly cool and waterly the pool for my limbs to fathom my souls last     school  narcissus ventured so long ago in the deeps of reflection illyssus broke the bounds and beyonddim recollection of fishes soundlessly moving in heavens other direction  be undine towards the waters moving back for me a pool put off the soul youve got oh lack your human self immortal take the watery track   autumn sunshine  the sun sets out the autumn crocuses   and fills them up a pouring measure   of deathproducing wine till treasure runs waste down their chalices  all all persephones pale cups of mould   are on the board are overfilled   the portion to the gods is spilled now mortals all take hold  the time is now the winecup full and full   of lambent heaven a pledgingcup   let now all mortal men take up the drink and a long strong pull  out of the hellqueens cup the heavens pale wine   drink then invisible heroes drink   lips to the vessels never shrink throats to the heavens incline  and take within the wine the gods great oath   by heaven and earth and hellish stream   to break this sick and nauseous dream we writhe and lust in both  swear in the pale wine poured from the cups of the        queen   of hell to wake and be free   from this nightmare we writhe in break out of this foul hasbeen   on that day     on that day i shall put roses on roses and cover your grave with multitude of white roses and since you were       brave    one bright red ray     so people passing under the ashtrees of the valleyroad will raise their eyes and look at the grave on the hill in       wonder    wondering mount and put the flowers asunder     to see whose praise is blazoned here so white and so bloodily red then they will say tis long since she is dead    who has remembered her after many days     and standing there they will consider how you went your ways unnoticed among them a still queen lost in the       maze    of this earthly affair     a queen theyll say has slept unnoticed on a forgotten hill sleeps on unknown unnoticed there until    dawns my insurgent day
