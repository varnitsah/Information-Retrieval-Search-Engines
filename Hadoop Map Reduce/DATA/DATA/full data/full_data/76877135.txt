76877135	the devils paw  by e phillips oppenheim     chapter i    the two men sole occupants of the somewhat shabby cottage parlour lingered over their port not so much with the air of wine lovers but rather as human beings and intimates perfectly content with their surroundings and company outside the wind was howling over the marshes and occasional bursts of rain came streaming against the window panes inside at any rate was comfort triumphing over varying conditions the cloth upon the plain deal table was of fine linen the decanter and glasses were beautifully cut there were walnuts and in a far corner cigars of a wellknown brand and cigarettes from a famous tobacconist beyond that little oasis however were all the evidences of a hired abode a hole in the closely drawn curtains was fastened together by a safety pin the horsehair easychairs bore disfiguring antimacassars the photographs which adorned the walls were grotesque but typical of village ideals the carpet was threadbare the closed door secured by a latch instead of the usual knob one side of the room was littered with golf clubs a huge game bag and several boxes of cartridges two shotguns lay upon the remains of a sofa it scarcely needed the costume of miles furley the host to demonstrate the fact that this was the temporary abode of a visitor to the blakeney marshes in search of sport  furley broadshouldered florid with tanned skin and grizzled hair was still wearing the high sea boots and jersey of the duck shooter his companion on the other hand a tall slim man with high forehead clear eyes stubborn jaw and straight yet sensitive mouth wore the ordinary dinner clothes of civilisation the contrast between the two men might indeed have afforded some ground for speculation as to the nature of their intimacy furley a son of the people had the air of cultivating even clinging to a certain plebeian strain never so apparent as when he spoke or in his gestures he was a member of parliament for a labour constituency a shrewd and valuable exponent of the gospel of the working man what he lacked in the higher qualities of oratory he made up in sturdy common sense the willothewisp socialism of the moment with its many attendant isms and theories received scant favour at his hands he represented the solid element in british labour politics and it was well known that he had refused a seat in the cabinet in order to preserve an absolute independence he had a remarkable gift of taciturnity which in a man of his class made for strength and it was concerning him that the prime minister had made his famous epigram that furley was the labour man whom he feared the most and dreaded the least  julian orden with an exterior more promising in many respects than that of his friend could boast of no similar distinctions he was the youngest son of a particularly fatuous peer resident in the neighbourhood had started life as a barrister in which profession he had attained a moderate success had enjoyed a brief but not inglorious spell of soldiering from which he had retired slightly lamed for life and had filled up the intervening period in the harmless occupation of censoring his friendship with furley appeared on the surface too singular to be anything else but accidental probably no one save the two men themselves understood it and they both possessed the gift of silence  whats all this peace talk mean julian orden asked fingering the stem of his wineglass  who knows furley grunted the newspapers must have their daily sensation  i have a theory that it is being engineered  bolo business eh  julian orden moved in his place a little uneasily his long nervous fingers played with the stick which stood always by the side of his chair  you dont believe in it do you he asked quietly  furley looked straight ahead of him his eyes seemed caught by the glitter of the lamplight upon the cutglass decanter  you know my opinion of war julian he said its a filthy intolerable heritage from generations of autocratic government no democracy ever wanted war every democracy needs and desires peace  one moment julian interrupted you must remember that a democracy seldom possesses the imperialistic spirit and a great empire can scarcely survive without it  arrant nonsense was the vigorous reply a great empire from hemisphere to hemisphere can be kept together a good deal better by democratic control force is always the arriere pensee of the individual and the autocrat  these are generalities julian declared i want to know your opinion about a peace at the present moment  not having any thanks youre a dilettante journalist by your own confession julian and i am not going to be drawn  there is something in it then  maybe was the careless admission youre a visitor worth having julian 70 port and homegrown walnuts a nice little addition to my simple fare must you go back tomorrow  julian nodded  weve another batch of visitors comingstenson amongst them by the bye  furley nodded his eyes narrowed and little lines appeared at their corners  i cant imagine he confessed what brings stenson down to maltenby i should have thought that your governor and he could scarcely spend ten minutes together without quarrelling  they never do spend ten minutes together alone julian replied drily i see to that then my mother you know has the knack of getting interesting people together the bishop is coming amongst others and furley i wanted to ask youdo you know anything of a young womanshe is half russian i believewho calls herself miss catherine abbeway  yes i know her was the brief rejoinder  she lived in russia for some years it seems julian continued her mother was russiana great writer on social subjects  furley nodded  miss abbeway is rather that way herself he remarked ive heard her lecture in the east end she has got hold of the womans side of the labour question as well as any one i ever came across  she is a most remarkably attractive young person julian declared pensively  yes shes goodlooking a countess in her own right they tell me but she keeps her title secret for fear of losing influence with the working classes she did a lot of good down poplar way shouldnt have thought shed have been your sort julian  why  too serious  julian smiledrather a peculiar introspective smile  i too can be serious sometimes he said  his friend thrust his hands into his trousers pocket and leaning back in his chair looked steadfastly at his guest  i believe you can julian he admitted sometimes i am not quite sure that i understand you thats the worst of a man with the gift for silence  youre not a great talker yourself the younger man reminded his host  when you get me going on my own subject furley remarked i find it hard to stop and you are a wonderful listener have you got any views of your own i never hear them  julian drew the box of cigarettes towards him  oh yes ive views of my own he confessed some day perhaps you shall know what they are  a man of mystery his friend jeered goodnaturedly  julian lit his cigarette and watched the smoke curl upward  lets talk about the duck he suggested  the two men sat in silence for some minutes outside the storm seemed to have increased in violence furley rose threw a log on to the fire and resumed his place  geese flew high he remarked  too high for me julian confessed  you got one more than i did  sheer luck the outside bird dipped down to me  furley filled his guests glass and then his own  what on earth have you kept your shooting kit on for the latter asked with lazy curiosity  furley glanced down at his incongruous attire and seemed for a moment ill at ease  ive got to go out presently he announced  julian raised his eyebrows  got to go out he repeated on a night like this why my dear fellow  he paused abruptly he was a man of quick perceptions and he realised his hosts embarrassment nevertheless there was an awkward pause in the conversation furley rose to his feet and frowned he fetched a jar of tobacco from a shelf and filled his pouch deliberately  sorry to seem mysterious old chap he said ive just a bit of a job to do it doesnt amount to anything butwell its the sort of affair we dont talk about much  well youre welcome to all the amusement youll get out of it a night like this  furley laid down his pipe readyfilled and drank off his port  there isnt much amusement left in the world is there just now he remarked gravely  very little indeed its three years since i handled a shotgun before tonight  youve really chucked the censoring  last week ive had a solid year at it  fed up  not exactly that my own work accumulated so  briefs coming along eh  im a sort of hack journalist as well as you reminded me just now julian explained a little evasively  i wonder you stuck at the censoring so long isnt it terribly tedious  sometimes now and then we come across interesting things though for instance i discovered a most original cipher the other day  did it lead to anything furley asked curiously  not at present i discovered it studying a telegram from norway it was addressed to a perfectly respectable firm of english timber merchants who have an office in the city this was the original fir planks too narrow by half sounds harmless enough doesnt it  absolutely whats the hidden meaning  there i am still at a loss julian confessed but treated with the cipher it comes out as thirtyeight steeple on barn  furley stared for a moment then he lit his pipe  well of the two he declared i should prefer the first rendering for intelligibility  so would most people julian assented smiling yet i am sure there is something in itsome meaning of course that needs a context to grasp it  have you interviewed the firm of timber merchants  not personally that doesnt come into my department the name of the man who manages the london office though is fennnicholas fenn  furley withdrew the pipe from his mouth his eyebrows had come together in a slight frown  nicholas fenn the labour mp  thats the fellow you know him of course  yes i know him furley replied thoughtfully he is secretary of the timber trades union and got in for one of the divisions of hull last year  i understand that there is nothing whatever against him personally julian continued although as a politician he is of course beneath contempt he started life as a village schoolmaster and has worked his way up most creditably he professed to understand the cable as it appeared in its original form all the same its very odd that treated by a cipher which i got on the track of a few days previously this same message should work out as i told you  of course furley observed ciphers can lead you  he stopped short julian who had been leaning over towards the cigarette bog glanced around at his friend there was a frown on furleys forehead he withdrew his pipe from between his teeth  what did you say you made of it he demanded  thirtyeight steeple on barn  thirtyeight thats queer  why is it queer  there was a moments silence furley glanced at the little clock upon the mantelpiece it was five and twenty minutes past nine  i dont know whether you have ever heard julian he said that our enemies on the other side of the north sea are supposed to have divided the whole of the eastern coast of great britain into small rectangular districts each about a couple of miles square one of our secret service chaps got hold of a map some time ago  no i never heard this julian acknowledged well  its only a coincidence of course furley went on but number thirtyeight happens to be the twomile block of seacoast of which this cottage is just about the centre it stretches to cley on one side and salthouse on the other and inland as far as dutchmans common i am not suggesting that there is any real connection between your cable and this fact but that you should mention it at this particular momentwell as i said its a coincidence  why  furley had risen to his feet he threw open the door and listened for a moment in the passage when he came back he was carrying some oilskins  julian he said i know you area bit of a cynic about espionage and that sort of thing of course there has been a terrible lot of exaggeration and heaps of fellows go gassing about secret service jobs all the way up the coast from here to scotland who havent the least idea what the thing means but there is a little bit of it done and in my humble way they find me an occasional job or two down here i wont say that anything ever comes of our effortswere rather like the special constables of the secret servicebut just occasionally we come across something suspicious  so thats why youre going out again tonight is it  furley nodded  this is my last night i am off up to town on monday and shant be able to get down again this season  had any adventures  not the ghost of one i dont mind admitting that ive had a good many wettings and a few scares on that stretch of marshland but ive never seen or heard anything yet to send in a report about it just happens though that tonight theres a special vigilance whip out  what does that mean julian enquired curiously  something supposed to be up was the dubious reply weve a very imaginative chief i might tell you  but what sort of thing could happen julian persisted what are you out to prevent anyway  furley relit his pipe thrust a flask into his pocket and picked up a thick stick from a corner of the room  cant tell he replied laconically theres an idea of course that communications are carried on with the enemy from somewhere down this coast sorry to leave you old fellow he added dont sit up i never fasten the door here remember to look after your fire upstairs and the whisky is on the sideboard here  i shall be all right thanks julian assured his host no use my offering to come with you i suppose  not allowed was the brief response  thank heavens julian exclaimed piously as a storm of rain blew in through the halfopen door good night and good luck old chap  furleys reply was drowned in the roar of wind julian secured the door underneath which a little stream of rain was creeping in then he returned to the sitting room threw a log upon the fire and drew one of the ancient easychairs close up to the blaze     chapter ii   julian notwithstanding his deliberate intention of abandoning himself to an hours complete repose became after the first few minutes of solitude conscious of a peculiar and increasing sense of restlessness with the help of a rubbershod stick which leaned against his chair he rose presently to his feet and moved about the room revealing a lameness which had the appearance of permanency in the small whiteceilinged apartment his height became more than ever noticeable also the squareness of his shoulders and the lean vigour of his frame he handled his gun for a moment and laid it down glanced at the card stuck in the cheap looking glass which announced that david grice let lodgings and conducted shooting parties turned with a shiver from the contemplation of two atrocious oleographs a church calendar pinned upon the wall and a battered map of the neighbourhood back to the table at which he had been seated he selected a cigarette and lit it presently he began to talk to himself a habit which had grown upon him during the latter years of a life whose secret had entailed a certain amount of solitude  perhaps he murmured i am psychic nevertheless i am convinced that something is happening something not far away  he stood for a while listening intently the cigarette burning away between his fingers then stooping a little he passed out into the narrow passage and opened the door into the kitchen behind from which the woman who came to minister to their wants had some time ago departed everything was in order here and spotlessly neat he climbed the narrow staircase looked in at furleys room and his own and at the third apartment in which had been rigged up a temporary bath the result was unilluminating he turned and descended the stairs  either he went on with a very slight frown i am not psychic or whatever may be happening is happening out of doors  he raised the latch of the door under which a little pool of water was now standing and leaned out there seemed to be a curious cessation of immediate sounds from somewhere straight ahead of him on the other side of that black velvet curtain of darkness came the dull booming of the wind tearing across the face of the marshes and beyond it beating time in a rhythmical sullen roar the rise and fall of the sea upon the shingle but near at hand for some reason there was almost silence the rain had ceased the gale for a moment had spent itself the strong salty moisture was doubly refreshing after the closeness of the small lamplit room julian lingered there for several moments  nothing like fresh air he muttered for driving away fancies  then he suddenly stiffened he leaned forward into the dark listening this time there was no mistake a cry faint and pitiful though it was reached his ears distinctly  julian julian  coming old chap he shouted wait until i get a torch  he stepped quickly back into the sitting room drew an electric torch from the drawer of the homely little chiffonier and regardless of regulations stepped once more out into the darkness now pierced for him by that single brilliant ray the door opened on to a country road filled with gleaming puddles on the other side of the way was a strip of grass sloping downwards then a broad dyke across which hung the remains of a footbridge the voice came from the water fainter now but still eager julian hurried forward fell on his knees by the side of the dyke and passing his hands under his friends shoulders dragged him out of the black sluggish water  my god he exclaimed what happened miles did you slip  the bridge gave way when i was half across was the muttered response i think my legs broken i fell in and couldnt get clearjust managed to raise my head out of the water and cling to the rail  hold tight julian enjoined im going to drag you across the road its the best i can do  they reached the threshold of the sitting room  sorry old chap faltered furleyand fainted  he came to himself in front of the sittingroom fire to find his lips wet with brandy and his rescuer leaning over him his first action was to feel his leg  thats all right julian assured him it isnt broken ive been over it carefully if youre quite comfortable ill step down to the village and fetch the medico it isnt a mile away  dont bother about the doctor for a moment furley begged listen to me take your torchgo out and examine that bridge come back and tell me whats wrong with it  what the dickens does that matter julian objected its the doctor we want the dykes flooded and i expect the supports gave way  do as i ask furley insisted i have a reason  julian rose to his feet walked cautiously to the edge of the dyke turned on his light and looked downwards one part of the bridge remained the other was caught in the weeds a few yards down and the single plank which formed its foundation was sawn through clean and straight he gazed at it for a moment in astonishment then he turned back towards the cottage to receive another shock about forty yards up the lane drawn in close to a straggling hedge was a small motorcar revealed to him by a careless swing of his torch he turned sharply towards it keeping his torch as much concealed as possible it was emptya small coupe of pearlgreya powerful twoseater with deep cushioned seats and luxuriously fitted body he flashed his torch on to the makers name and returned thoughtfully to his friend  miles he confessed as he entered the sitting room there are some things i will never make fun of again have you a personal enemy here  not one replied furley the soldiers who are all decent fellows the old farmer at the back and your father and mother are the only people with whom i have the slightest acquaintance in these parts  the bridge has been deliberately sawn through julian announced gravely  furley nodded he seemed prepared for the news  there is something doing in this section then he muttered julian will you take my job on  like a bird was the prompt response tell me exactly what to do  furley sat up still nursing his leg  put on your sea boots and your oilskins over your clothes he directed you will want your own stick so take that revolver and an electric torch you cant get across the remains of the bridge but about fifty yards down to the left as you leave the door the waters only about a foot deep walk through it scramble up the other side and come back again along the edge of the dyke until you come to the place where one lands from the broken bridge is that clear  entirely  after that you go perfectly straight along a sort of cart track until you come to a gate when you have passed through it you must climb a bank on your lefthand side and walk along the top its a beastly path and there are dykes on either side of you  pooh julian exclaimed you forget that i am a native of this part of the world  you come to a sort of stile at the end of about three hundred yards furley continued you get over that and the bank breaks up into two you keep to the left and it leads you right down into the marsh turn seaward it will be a nasty scramble but there will only be about fifty yards of it then you get to a bit of rough grounda bank of grassgrown sand below that there is the shingle and the sea that is where you take up your post  can i use my torch julian enquired and what am i to look out for  heaven knows replied furley except that theres a general suggestion of communications between some person on land and some person approaching from the sea i dont mind confessing that ive done this job on and off whenever ive been down here for a couple of years and ive never seen or heard a suspicious thing yet we are never told a word in our instructions either or given any advice however what i should do would be to lie flat down on the top of that bank and listen if you hear anything peculiar then you must use your discretion about the torch its a nasty job to make over to a pal julian but i know youre keen on anything that looks like an adventure  all over it was the ready reply what about leaving you alone though miles  you put the whisky and soda where i can get at it furley directed and i shall be all right im feeling stronger every moment i expect your sea boots are in the scullery and hurry up theres a good fellow were twenty minutes behind time as it is  julian started on his adventure without any particular enthusiasm he found the crossing returned along the side of the bank trudged along the cart track until he arrived at the gate and climbed up on the dyke without misadventure from here he made his way more cautiously using his stick with his right hand his torch with his thumb upon the knob in his left the lull in the storm seemed to be at an end black lowhanging clouds were closing in upon him away to the right where the line of marshes was unbroken the boom of the wind grew louder a gust very nearly blew him down the bank he was compelled to shelter for a moment on its lee side whilst a scud of snow and sleet passed like an icy whirlwind the roar of the sea was full in his ears now and though he must still have been fully two hundred yards away from it little ghostly specks of white spray were dashed every now and then into his face from here he made his way with great care almost crawling until he came to the stile in the marshes he was twice in salt water over his knees but he scrambled out until he reached the grassgrown sand bank which furley had indicated obeying orders he lay down and listened intently for any fainter sounds mingled with the tumult of nature after a few minutes it was astonishing how his eyes found themselves able to penetrate the darkness which at first had seemed like a black wall some distance to the right he could make out the outline of a deserted barn once used as a coastguard station and now only a depository for the storing of life belts in front of him he could trace the bank of shingle and the line of the sea and presently the outline of some dark object lying just out of reach of the breaking waves attracted his attention he watched it steadily for some time it was as motionless as the log he presumed it to be then without any warning it hunched itself up and drew a little farther back there was no longer any doubt it was a human being lying on its stomach with its head turned to the sea  julian who had entered upon his adventure with the supercilious incredulity of a staunch unbeliever invited to a spiritualists seance was conscious for a moment of an absolutely new sensation a person of acute psychological instincts he found himself analysing that sensation almost as soon as it was conceived  there is no doubt he confessed under his breath that i am afraid  his heart was beating with unaccustomed vigour he was conscious of an acute tingling in all his senses then still lying on his stomach almost holding his breath he saw the thin line of light from an electric torch steal out along the surface of the sea obviously from the hand of his fellow watcher almost at that same moment the undefined agitation which had assailed him passed he set his teeth and watched that line of light it moved slowly sideways along the surface of the sea as though searching for something julian drew himself cautiously inch by inch to the extremity of the sand hummock his brain was working with a new clearness an inspiration flashed in upon him during those few seconds he knew the geography of the place wellthe corner of the barn the steeple beyond and the watcher lying in a direct line his cipher was explained  perfectly cool now julian thought with some regret of the revolver which he had scorned to bring he occupied himself during these seconds of watching by considering with care what his next action was to be if he even set his foot upon the shingle the watcher below would take alarm and if he once ran away pursuit was hopeless the figure so far as he could distinguish it was more like that of a boy than a man julian began to calculate coolly the chances of an immediate intervention then things happened and for a moment he held his breath  the line of light had shot out once more and this time it seemed to reveal something something which rose out of the water and which looked like nothing so much as a long strip of zinc piping the watcher at the edge of the sea threw down his torch and gripped the end of it and julian carried away with excitement yielded to an instant and overpowering temptation he flashed on his own torch and watched while the eager figure seemed by some means to unscrew the top of the coil and drew from it a dark rolledup packet even at that supreme moment the slim figure upon the beach seemed to become conscious of the illumination of which he was the centre he swung roundand that was just as far as julian orden got in his adventure after a lapse of time during which he seemed to live in a whirl of blackness where a thousand men were beating at a thousand anvils filling the world with sparks with the sound of every one of their blows reverberating in his ears he opened his eyes to find himself lying on his back with one leg in a pool of salt water which was being dashed industriously into his face by an unseen hand by his side he was conscious of the presence of a thickset man in a fishermans costume of brown oilskins and a southwester pulled down as though to hide his features obviously the man who had dealt him the blow then he heard a very soft quiet voice behind him  he will do now come  the man by his side grunted  i am going to make sure of him he said thickly again he heard that clear voice from behind this time a little raised the words failed to reach his brain but the tone was one of cold and angry dissent followed by an imperative order then once more his senses seemed to be leaving him he passed into the world which seemed to consist only of himself and a youth in fishermans oilskins who was sometimes furley sometimes his own sister sometimes the figure of a person who for the last twentyfour hours had been continually in his thoughts who seemed at one moment to be sympathising with him and at another to be playing upon his face with a garden hose then it all faded away and a sort of numbness crept over him he made a desperate struggle for consciousness there was something cold resting against his cheek his fingers stole towards it it was the flask drawn from his own pocket and placed there by some unseen hand the top already unscrewed and the reviving odour stealing into his nostrils he guided it to his lips with trembling fingers a pleasant sense of warmth crept over him his head fell back  when he opened his eyes again he first turned around for the tea by his bedside then stared in front of him wondering if these things which he saw were indeed displayed through an upraised blind there was the marsha picture of still lifewinding belts of sea creeping serpentlike away from him towards the land with broad pools in whose bosom here and there were flashes of a feeble sunlight there were the clumps of wild lavender he had so often admired the patches of deep meadow green and beating the air with their wings as they passed came a flight of duck over his head very stiff and dazed he staggered to his feet there was the village to his right redtiled familiar the snug farmhouses with their brown fields and belts of trees the curve of the white road  and then with a single flash of memory it all came back to him he felt the top of his head still sore looked down at the stretch of shingle empty now of any reminiscences and finally leaning heavily on his stick he plodded back to the cottage noticing as he drew near the absence of the motorcar from its place of shelter miles furley was seated in his armchair with a cup of tea in his hand and mrs west fussing over him as julian raised the latch and dragged himself into the sitting room they both turned around at his entrance furley dropped his teaspoon and mrs west raised her hands above her head and shrieked julian sank into the nearest chair  melodrama has come to me at last he murmured give me some teaa whole teapotful mrs westand get a hot bath ready  he waited until their temporary housekeeper had bustled out of the room then he concluded his sentence  i have been sandbagged he announced impressively and proceeded to relate the nights adventure to his host  this declared julian about a couple of hours later as he helped himself for the second time to bacon and eggs is a wonderful tribute to the soundness of our constitutions miles it is evident that you and i have led righteous lives  being sandbagged seems to have given you an appetite furley observed  and a game leg seems to have done the same for you julian rejoined did the doctor ask you how you did it  furley nodded  i just said that i slipped on the marshes one doesnt talk of such little adventures as you and i experienced last night  by the bye what does one do about them julian enquired i feel a little dazed about it all even now living in an unreal atmosphere and that sort of thing you know it seems to me that we ought to have out the bloodhounds and search for an engaging youth and a particularly disagreeable bully of a man both dressed in brown oilskins and  oh chuck it furley intervened the intelligence department in charge of this bit of coast doesnt do things like that what you want to remember julian is to keep your mouth shut i shall have a chap over to see me this afternoon and i shall make a report to him  all the same persisted julian weor rather iwas without a doubt a witness to an act of treason by some subtle means connected with what seemed to be a piece of gas pipe i have seen communication with the enemy established  you dont know that it was the enemy at all furley grunted  for us others julian replied there exists the post office the telegraph office and the telephone i decline to believe that any reasonable person would put out upon the sea in weather like last nights for the sake of delivering a letter to any harmless inhabitant of these regions i will have my sensation you see furley i have sufferedthank heavens mine is a thick skulland i will not be cheated of my compensations  well keep your mouth shut theres a good fellow until after i have made my report to the intelligence officer furley begged hell be here about four you dont mind being about  not in the least julian promised so long as i am home for dinner my people will be satisfied  i dont know how youll amuse yourself this morning furley observed and im afraid i shant be able to get out for the flighting this evening  dont worry about me julian begged remember that i am practically at home its only three miles to the hall from here so you mustnt look upon me as an ordinary guest i am going for a tramp in a few minutes  lucky chap furley declared enviously sunshine like this makes one feel as though one were on the riviera instead of in norfolk shall you visit the scene of your adventure  i may julian answered thoughtfully the instinct of the sleuthhound is beginning to stir in me there is no telling how far it may lead  julian started on his tramp about half an hour later he paused first at a bend in the road about fifty yards down and stepped up close to the hedge  the instinct of the sleuthhound he said to himself is all very well but why on earth havent i told furley about the car  he paused to consider the matter conscious only of the fact that each time he had opened his lips to mention it he had felt a marked but purposeless disinclination to do so he consoled himself now with the reflection that the information would be more or less valueless until the afternoon and he forthwith proceeded upon the investigation which he had planned out  the road was still muddy and the track of the tyres which were of somewhat peculiar pattern clearly visible he followed it along the road for a matter of a mile and a half then he came to a standstill before a plain oak gate and was conscious of a distinct shock on the top bar of the gate was painted in white letters                             maltenby hall                          tradesmens entrance  and it needed only the most cursory examination to establish the fact that the car whose track he had been following had turned in here he held up his hand and stopped a luggage trolley which had just turned the bend in the avenue the man pulled up and touched his hat  where are you off to fellowes julian enquired  i am going to holt station sir the man replied after some luggage  are there any guests at the hall who motored here do you know julian asked  only the young lady sir the man replied miss abbeway she came in a little coupe panhard  julian frowned thoughtfully  has she been out in it this morning he asked  the man shook his head  she broke down in it yesterday afternoon sir he answered about halfway up to the hall here  broke down julian repeated anything serious couldnt you put it right for her  she wouldnt let me touch it sir the man explained she said she had two cracked sparking plugs and she wanted to replace them herself she has had some lessons and i think she wanted a bit of practice  i see then the car is in the avenue now  about half a mile up on the lefthand side sir just by the big elm miss abbeway said she was coming down this afternoon to put new plugs in  then its been there all the time since yesterday afternoon julian persisted  the young lady wished it left there sir i could have put a couple of plugs in in five minutes and brought her up to the house but she wouldnt hear of it  i see fellowes  any luck with the geese last night sir the man asked i heard there was a pack of them on stiffkey marshes  i got one they came badly for us julian replied  he made his way up the avenue at exactly the spot indicated by the chauffeur a little coupe car was standing drawn on to the turf he glanced at the name of the maker and looked once more at the tracks upon the drive finally he decided that his investigations were leading him in a most undesirable direction  he turned back walked across the marshes where he found nothing to disturb him and lunched with furley whose leg was now so much better that he was able to put it to the ground  what about this visitor of yours julian asked as they sat smoking afterwards i must be back at the hall in time to dine tonight you know my people made rather a point of it  furley nodded  youll be all right he replied as a matter of fact he isnt coming  not coming julian repeated jove i should have thought youd have had intelligence officers by the dozen down here  for some reason or other furley confided the affair has been handed over to the military authorities i have had a man down to see me this morning and he has taken full particulars i dont know that theyll even worry you at alluntil later on at any rate  jove that seems queer  last nights happening was queer for that matter furley continued their only chance i suppose of getting to the bottom of it is to lie doggo as far as possible it isnt like a police affair you see they dont want witnesses and a court of justice one mans word and a rifle barrel does the trick  julian sighed  i suppose he observed that if i do my duty as a loyal subject i shall drop the curtain on last night seems a pity to have had an adventure like that and not be able to open ones mouth about it  furley grunted  you dont want to join the noble army of gas bags he said much better make up your mind that it was a dream  there are times julian confided when i am not quite sure that it wasnt     chapter iii   julian entered the drawingroom at maltenby hall a few minutes before dinner time that evening his mother who was alone and for a wonder resting held out her hand for him to kiss and welcomed him with a charming smile notwithstanding her grey hair she was still a remarkably younglooking woman with a great reputation as a hostess  my dear julian she exclaimed you look like a ghost dont tell me that you had to sit up all night to shoot those wretched duck  julian drew a chair to his mothers side and seated himself with a little air of relief  never have i been more conscious of the inroads of age he confided i can remember when ten or fifteen years ago i used to steal out of the house in the darkness and bicycle down to the marsh with a twentybore gun on the chance of an odd shot  and i suppose his mother went on after spending half the night wading about in the salt water you spent the other half talking to that terrible mr furley  quite right we got cold and wet through in the evening we sat up talking till the small hours we got cold and wet again this morningand here i am  a converted sportsman his mother observed i wish you could convert your friend mr furley theres a perfectly terrible article of his in the national this month i cant understand a word of it but it reads like sheer anarchy  so long as the world exists julian remarked there must be socialists and furley is at least honest  my dear julian his mother protested how can a socialist be honest their attitude with regard to the war too is simply disgraceful i am sure that in any other country that man fenn for instance would be shot  what about your house party julian enquired with bland irrelevance  all arrived i suppose theyll be down directly mr hannaway wells is here  good old wells julian murmured how does he look since he became a cabinet minister  portentous lady maltenby replied with a smile he doesnt look as though he would ever unbend then the shervintons are here and the princess torskiyour friend miss abbeways aunt  the princess torski julian repeated who on earth is she  she was english his mother explained a cousin of the abbeways she married in russia and is on her way now to france to meet her husband who is in command of a russian battalion there she seems quite a pleasant person but not in the least like her niece  miss abbeway is still here of course  naturally i asked her for a week and i think she means to stay we talked for an hour after tea this afternoon and i found her most interesting she has been living in england for years it seems down in chelsea studying sculpture  she is a remarkably clever young woman julian said thoughtfully but a little incomprehensible if the princess torski is her aunt who were her parents  her father the countess replied was colonel richard abbeway who seems to have been military attache at st petersburg years ago he married a sister of the princess torskis husband and from her this young woman inherited a title which she wont use and a large fortune colonel abbeway was killed accidentally in the russojapanese war and her mother died a few years ago  no german blood or anything of that sort then  my dear boy what an idea his mother exclaimed reprovingly on the contrary the torskis are one of the most aristocratic families in russia and you know what the abbeways are the girl is excellently bred and i think her charming in every way whatever made you suggest that she might have german blood in her  no idea anyhow i am glad she hasnt who else  the bishop his mother continued looking very tired poor dear doctor george lennard from oxford two young soldiers from norwich whom charlie asked us to be civil toand the great man himself  tell me about the great man i dont think ive seen him to speak to since he became prime minister  he declares that this is his first holiday this year he is looking rather tired but he has had an hours shooting since he arrived and seemed to enjoy it heres your father  the earl of maltenby who entered a moment later was depressingly typical he was as tall as his youngest son with whom he shook hands absently and whom he resembled in no other way he had the conventionally aristocratic features thin lips and steely blue eyes he was apparently a little annoyed  anything wrong dear lady maltenby asked  her husband took up his position on the hearthrug  i am annoyed with stenson he declared  the countess shook her head  its too bad of you henry she expostulated youve been trying to talk politics with him you know that the poor man was only longing for fortyeight hours during which he could forget that he was prime minister of england  precisely my dear lord maltenby agreed i can assure you that i have not transgressed in any way a remark escaped me referring to the impossibility of providing beaters nowadays and to the fact that out of my seven keepers five are fighting i consider mr stensons comment was most improper coming from one to whom the destinies of this country are confided  what did he say the countess asked meekly  something about wondering whether any man would be allowed to have seven keepers after the war her husband replied with an angry light in his eyes if a man like stenson is going to encourage these socialistic ideas i beg your pardonthe bishop my dear  the remaining guests drifted in within the next few momentsthe bishop julians godfather a curious blend of the fashionable and the devout the anchorite and the man of the people lord and lady shervinton elderly connections of the nondescript variety mr hannaway wells reserved yet urbane a wonderful type of the supreme success of mediocrity a couple of young soldiers lighthearted and out for a good time of whom julian took charge an oxford don who had once been lord maltenbys tutor and last of all the homely very pleasantlooking middleaged lady princess torski followed by her niece there were a few introductions still to be effected  whilst lady maltenby was engaged in this task which she performed at all times with the unfailing tact of a great hostess julian broke off in his conversation with the two soldiers and looked steadfastly across the room at catherine abbeway as though anxious to revise or complete his earlier impressions of her she was of medium height not unreasonably slim with a deliberate but noticeably graceful carriage her complexion was inclined to be pale she had large soft brown eyes and hair of an unusual shade of chestnut brown arranged with remarkably effective simplicity she wore a long string of green beads around her neck a black tulle gown without any relief of colour but a little daring in its cut her voice and laugh as she stood talking to the bishop were delightful and neither her gestures nor her accent betrayed the slightest trace of foreign blood she was without a doubt extraordinarily attractive gracious almost to freedom in her manner and yet with that peculiar quality of aloofness only recognisable in the electa very appreciable charm julian found his undoubted admiration only increased by his closer scrutiny nevertheless as he watched her there was a slightly puzzled frown upon his forehead a sense of something like bewilderment mingled with those other feelings his mother who had turned to speak to the object of his attentions beckoned him and he crossed the room at once to their side  julian is going to take you in to dinner miss abbeway the countess announced and i hope you will be kind to him for hes been out all night and a good part of the morning too shooting ducks and talking nonsense with a terrible socialist  lady maltenby passed on julian leaning on his stick looked down with a new interest into the face which had seldom been out of his thoughts since their first meeting a few weeks ago  tell me mr orden she asked which did you find the more exhaustingtramping the marshes for sport or discussing sociology with your friend  as a matter of fact he replied we didnt tramp the marshes we stood still and got uncommonly wet and i shot a goose which made me very happy  then it must have been the conversation she declared is your friend a prophet or only one of the multitude  a prophet most decidedly he is a mr miles furley of whom you must have heard  she started a little  miles furley she repeated i had no idea that he lived in this part of the world  he has a small country house somewhere in norfolk julian told her and he takes a cottage down here at odd times for the wildfowl shooting  will you take me to see him tomorrow she asked  with pleasure so long as you promise not to talk socialism with him  i will promise that readily out of consideration to my escort i wonder how it is she went on looking up at him a little thoughtfully that you dislike serious subjects so much  a frivolous turn of mind i suppose he replied i certainly prefer to talk art with you  but nowadays she protested it is altogether the fashion down at chelsea to discard art and talk politics  its a fashion i shouldnt follow he advised i should stick to art if i were you  well that depends upon how you define politics of course i dont mean party politics i mean the science of living as a whole not as a unit  the princess ambled up to them  i dont know what your political views are mr orden she said but you must look out for shocks if you discuss social questions with my niece in the old days they would never have allowed her to live in russia even now i consider some of her doctrines the most pernicious i ever heard  isnt that terrible from an affectionate aunt  catherine laughed as the princess passed on tell me some more about your adventures last night  she looked up into his face and julian was suddenly conscious from whence had come that faint sense of mysterious trouble which had been with him during the last few minutes the slight quiver of her lips brought it all back to him her mouth beyond a doubt with its half tender half mocking curve was the mouth which he had seen in that tangled dream of his when he had lain fighting for consciousness upon the marshes     chapter iv   julian absorbed for the first few minutes of dinner by the crystallisation of this new idea which had now taken a definite place in his brain found his conversational powers somewhat at a discount catherine very soon however asserted her claim upon his attention  please do your duty and tell me about things she begged remember that i am cinderella from bohemia and i scarcely know a soul here  well there arent many to find out about are there he replied of course you know stenson  i have been gazing at him with dilated eyes she confided is that not the proper thing to do he seems to me very ordinary and very hungry  well then there is the bishop  i knew him at once from his photographs he must spend the whole of the time when he isnt in church visiting the photographer however i like him he is talking to my aunt quite amiably nothing does aunt so much good as to sit next a bishop  the shervintons you know all about dont you he went on the soldiers are just young men from the norwich barracks doctor lennard was my fathers tutor at oxford and mr hannaway wells is our latest cabinet minister  he still has the novices smirk she remarked a moment ago i heard him tell his neighbour that he preferred not to discuss the war he probably thinks that there is a spy under the table  well there we aresuch as we are julian concluded there is no one left except me  then tell me all about yourself she suggested really when i come to think of it considering the length of our conversations you have been remarkably reticent you are the youngest of the family are you not how many brothers are there  there were four he told her henry was killed at ypres last year guy is out there still richard is a brigadier  and you  i am a barrister by profession but i went out with the first inns of court lot for a little amateur soldiering and lost part of my foot at mons since then i have been indulging in the unremunerative and highly monotonous occupation of censoring  monotonous indeed i should imagine she agreed you spend your time reading other peoples letters do you not just to be sure that there are no communications from the enemy  precisely he assented we discover ciphers and all sorts of things  what brainy people you must be  we are most of us  do you do anything else  well ive given up censoring for the present he confided i am going back to my profession  as a barrister  just so i might add that i do a little hack journalism  how modest she murmured i suppose you write the leading articles for the times  for a very young lady julian observed impressively you have marvellous insight how did you guess my secret  i am better at guessing secrets than you are she retorted a little insolently  he was silent for some moments the faint curve of her lips had again given him almost a shock  have you a brother he asked abruptly  no why  because i met some one quite latelywithin the last few hours as a matter of factwith a mouth exactly like yours  but what a horrible thing she exclaimed drawing out a little mirror from the bag by her side and gazing into it how unpleasant to have any one else going about with a mouth exactly like ones own no i never had a brother mr orden or a sister and as you may have heard i am an enfant mechante i live in london i model very well and i talk very bad sociology as i think i told you i know your anarchist friend miles furley  i shouldnt call furley an anarchist protested julian  well he is a socialist i admit that we are rather lax in our definitions you see there is just one subject of late years which has brought together the socialists and the labour men the syndicalists and the communists the nationalists and the internationalists all those who work for freedom are learning breadth if they ever find a leader i think that this dear smug country of yours may have to face the greatest surprise of its existence  julian looked at her curiously  you have ideas miss abbeway  so unusual in a woman she mocked do you notice how every one is trying to avoid the subject of the war i give them another halfcourse dont you i am sure they cannot keep it up  they wont go the distance julian whispered listen  the question to be considered lord shervinton pronounced is not so much when the war will be over as what there is to stop it that is a point which i think we can discuss without inviting official indiscretions  if other means fail declared the bishop christianity will stop it the conscience of the world is already being stirred  our enemies the earl pronounced confidently from his place at the head of the table are already a broken race they are on the point of exhaustion austria is if possible in a worse plight that is what will end the warthe exhaustion of our opponents  the deciding factor mr hannaway wells put in with a very noncommittal air will probably be america she will bring her full strength into the struggle just at the crucial moment she will probably do what we farther north have as yet failed to do she will pierce the line and place the german armies in flanders in peril  the cabinet ministers views were popular there was a little murmur of approval something which sounded almost like a purr of content it was just one more expression of that strangely discreditable yet almost universal failingthe overreliance upon others the quiet remark of the man who suddenly saw fit to join in the discussion struck a chilling and a disturbing note  there is one thing which could end the war at any moment mr stenson said leaning a little forward and that is the will of the people  there was perplexity as well as discomfiture in the minds of his hearers  the people lord shervinton repeated but surely the people speak through the mouths of their rulers  they have been content to up to the present the prime minister agreed but europe may still see strange and dramatic events before many years are out  do go on please the countess begged  mr stenson shook his head  even as a private individual i have said more than i intended he replied i have only one thing to say about the war in public and that is that we are winning that we must win that our national existence depends upon winning and that we shall go on until we do win the obstacles between us and victory which may remain in our minds are not to be spoken of  there was a brief and somewhat uncomfortable pause it was understood that the subject was to be abandoned julian addressed a question to the bishop across the table lord maltenby consulted doctor lennard as to the date of the first punic war mr stenson admired the flowers catherine who had been sitting with her eyes riveted upon the prime minister turned to her neighbour  tell me about your amateur journalism mr orden she begged i have an idea that it ought to be interesting  deadly dull i can assure you  you write about politics or perhaps you are an art critic i ought to be on my best behaviour in case  i know little about art he assured her my chief interest in lifeoutside my profession of courselies in sociology  his little confession had been impulsive she raised her eyebrows  you are in earnest i believe she exclaimed have i really found an englishman who is in earnest  i plead guilty it is incorrect philosophy but a distinct stimulus to life  what a pity she sighed that you are so handicapped by birth sociology cannot mean anything very serious for you your perspective is naturally distorted  what about yourself he asked pertinently  the vanity of us women she murmured i have grown to look upon myself as being an exception i forget that there might be others you might even be one of our prophetsa paul fiske in disguise  his eyes narrowed a little as he looked at her closely from across the table the bishop broke off an interesting discussion on the subject of his addresses to the working classes and the earl set down his wineglass with an impatient gesture  does no one really know mr stenson asked who paul fiske is  no one sir mr hannaway wells replied i thought it wise a short time ago to set on foot the most searching enquiries but they were absolutely fruitless  the bishop coughed  i must plead guilty he confessed to having visited the offices of the monthly review with the same object i left a note for him there in charge of the editor inviting him to a conference at my house i received no reply his anonymity seems to be impregnable  whoever he may be the earl declared he ought to be muzzled he is a traitor to his country  i cannot agree with you lord maltenby the bishop said firmly the very danger of the mans doctrines lies in their clarity of thought their extraordinary proximity to the fundamental truths of life  the man is at any rate doctor lennard interposed the most brilliant anonymous writer since the days of swift and the letters of junius  mr stenson for a moment hesitated he seemed uncertain whether or no to join in the conversation finally impulse swayed him  let us all be thankful he said that paul fiske is content with the written word if the democracy of england found themselves today with such a leader it is he who would be ruling the country and not i  the man is a pacifist the earl protested  so we all are the bishop declared warmly we are all pacifists in the sense that we are lovers of peace there is not one of us who does not deplore the horrors of today there is not one of us who is not passionately seeking for the master mind which can lead us out of it  there is only one way out the earl insisted and that is to beat the enemy  it is the only obvious way julian intervened joining in the conversation for the first time but meanwhile with every tick of the clock a fellow creature dies  it is a question mr hannaway wells reflected whether the present generation is not inclined to be mawkish with regard to human life history has shown us the marvellous benefits which have accrued to the greatest nations through the lessening of population by means of warfare  history has also shown us doctor lennard observed that the last resource of force is force no brain has ever yet devised a logical scheme for international arbitration  human nature i am afraid has changed extraordinarily little since the days of the philistines the bishop confessed  julian turned to his companion  well theyve all settled it amongst themselves havent they he murmured here you may sit and listen to what may be called the modern voice  yet there is one thing wanting she whispered what do you suppose if he were here at this moment paul fiske would say do you think that he would be content to listen to these brazen voices and accept their verdict  without irreverence julian answered or comparison would jesus christ  with the same proviso she retorted i might reply that jesus christ from all we know of him might reign wonderfully in the kingdom of heaven but he certainly wouldnt be able to keep together a cabinet in downing street still i am beginning to believe in your sincerity do you think that paul fiske is sincere  i believe julian replied that he sees the truth and struggles to express it  the women were leaving the table she leaned towards him  please do not be long she whispered you must admit that i have been an admirable dinner companion i have talked to you all the time on your own subject you must come and talk to me presently about art  julian with his hand on the back of his chair watched the women pass out of the soft halo of the electric lights into the gloomier shadows of the high vaulted room catherine a little slimmer than most of the others and with a strange grace of slow movement which must have come to her from some russian ancestor her last words lingered in his mind he was to talk to her about art a fleeting vision of the youth in the yellow oilskins mocked him he remembered his mornings tramp and the brokendown motorcar under the trees the significance of these things was beginning to take shape in his mind he resumed his seat a little dazed     chapter v   maltenby was one of those oldfashioned houses where the port is served as a lay sacrament and the call of the drawingroom is responded to tardily after the departure of the women doctor lennard drew his chair up to julians  an interesting face your dinner companions he remarked they tell me that she is a very brilliant young lady  she certainly has gifts acknowledged julian  i watched her whilst she was talking to you the oxford don continued she is one of those rare young women whose undoubted beauty is put into the background by their general attractiveness lady maltenby was telling me fragments of her history it appears that she is thinking of giving up her artistic career for some sort of sociological work  it is curious julian reflected how the cause of the people has always appealed to gifted russians england for instance produces no real democrats of genius russia seems to claim a monopoly of them  there is nothing so stimulating as a sense of injustice for bringing the best out of a man or woman doctor lennard pointed out russia of course for many years has been shamefully misgoverned  the conversation owing to the intervention of other of the guests became general and platitudinal soon after mr stenson rose and excused himself his secretary who had been at the telephone desired a short conference there was a brief silence after his departure  stenson the oxonian observed is beginning to show signs of strain  why not lord shervinton pointed out he came into office full of the most wonderful enthusiasm his speeches rang through the world like a clarion note he converted waverers he lit fires which still burn but he is a man of movement this present stagnation is terribly irksome to him i heard him speak last week and i was disappointed he seems to have lost his inspiration what he needs is a stimulus of some sort even of disaster  i wonder the bishop reflected if he is really afraid of the people  i consider his remark concerning them most illadvised lord maltenby declared pompously  i know the people the bishop continued and i love them i think too that they trust me yet i am not sure that i cannot see a glimmering of what is at the back of stensons mind there are a good many millions in the country who honestly believe that war is primarily an affair of the politicians who believe too that victory means a great deal more to what they term the upper classes than it does to them yet in every sense of the word they are bearing an equal portion of the fight because when it comes down to human life the life of the farm labourers son is of the same intrinsic value as the life of the peers  lord maltenby moved a little in his chair there was a slight frown upon his aristocratic forehead he disagreed entirely with the speaker with whom he feared however to cross swords mr hannaway wells who had been waiting for his opportunity took charge of the conversation he spoke in a reserved manner his fingers playing with the stem of his wineglass  i must confess he said that i feel the deepest interest in what the bishop has just said i could not talk to you about the military situation even if i knew more than you do which is not the case but i think it is clear that we have reached something like a temporary impasse there certainly seems to be no cause for alarm upon any front yet not only in london but in paris and even rome there is a curious uneasiness afoot for which no one can account which no one can bring home to any definite cause in the same connection we have confidential information that a new spirit of hopefulness is abroad in germany it has been reported to us that sober clearthinking menand there are a few of them even in germanyhave predicted peace before a month is out  the assumption is doctor lennard interpolated that germany has something up her sleeve  that is not only the assumption the cabinet minister replied but it is also i believe the truth  one could apprehend and fear a great possible danger lord shervinton observed if the labour party in germany were as strong as ours or if our own labour party were entirely united the present conditions however seem to me to give no cause for alarm  that is where i think you are wrong hannaway wells declared if the labour party in germany were as strong as ours they would be strong enough to overthrow the hohenzollern clique to stamp out the militarism against which we are at war to lay the foundations of a great german republic with whom we could make the sort of peace for which every englishman hopes the danger the real danger which we have to face would lie in an amalgamation of the labour party the socialists and the syndicalists in this country and in their insisting upon treating with the weak labour party in germany  i agree with the bishop julian pronounced the unclassified democracy of our country may believe itself hardly treated but individually it is intensely patriotic i do not believe that its leaders would force the hand of the country towards peace unless they received full assurance that their confreres in germany were able to assume a dominant place in the government of that countrya place at least equal to the influence of the democracy here  doctor lennard glanced at the speaker a little curiously he had known julian since he was a boy but had never regarded him as anything but a dilettante  you may not know it he said but you are practically expounding the views of that extraordinary writer of whom we were speakingpaul fiske  i have been told the bishop remarked cracking a walnut that paul fiske is the pseudonym of a cabinet minister  and i hannaway wells retorted have been informed most credibly that he is a church of england clergyman  the last rumour i heard lord shervinton put in was that he is a grocer in a small way of business at wigan  dear me doctor lennard remarked the gossips have covered enough ground a man at a bohemian club of which i am a memberthe savage club in factassured me that he was an opium drugged journalist kept alive by the charity of a few friends a human wreck who was once the editor of an important london paper  you have some slight connection with journalism have you not julian the earl asked his son condescendingly have you heard no reports  many julian replied but none which i have been disposed to credit i should imagine myself that paul fiske is a man who believes having created a public that his written words find an added value from the fact that he obviously desires neither reward nor recognition just in the same way as the really earnest democrats of twenty years ago scoffed at the idea of a seat in parliament or of breaking bread in any way with the enemy  it was a fine spirit that the bishop declared i am not sure that we are not all of us a little overinclined towards compromises the sapping away of conscience is so easy  the diningroom door was thrown open and the butler announced a visitor  colonel henderson your lordship  they all turned around in their places the colonel a fine militarylooking figure of a man shook hands with lord maltenby  my most profound apologies sir he said as he accepted a chair the countess was kind enough to say that if i were not able to get away in time for dinner i might come up afterwards  you are sure that you have dined  i had something at mess thank you  a glass of port then  the colonel helped himself from the decanter which was passed towards him and exchanged greetings with several of the guests to whom his host introduced him  no raids or invasions i hope colonel the latter asked  nothing quite so serious as that i am glad to say we have had a little excitement of another sort though one of my men caught a spy this morning  every one was interested even after three years of war there was still something fascinating about the word  dear me lord maltenby exclaimed i should scarcely have considered our outoftheway part of the world sufficiently important to attract attentions of that sort  it was a matter of communication the colonel confided there was an enemy submarine off here last night and we have reason to believe that a message was landed we caught one fellow just at dawn  what did you do with him the bishop asked  we shot him an hour ago was the cool reply  are there any others at large julian enquired leaning forward  one other the colonel acknowledged sipping his wine appreciatively my military police here however are very intelligent and i should think it very doubtful whether he can escape  was the man who was shot a foreigner the earl asked i trust that he was not one of my tenants  he was a stranger was the prompt assurance  and his companion julian ventured  his companion is believed to have been quite a youth there is a suggestion that he escaped in a motorcar but he is probably hiding in the neighbourhood  lord maltenby frowned there seemed to him something incongruous in the fact that a deed of this sort should have been committed in his domain without his knowledge he rose to his feet  the countess is probably relying upon some of us for bridge he said i hope colonel that you will take a hand  the men rose and filed slowly out of the room the colonel however detained his host and julian also lingered  i hope lord maltenby the former said that you will excuse my men but they tell me that they find it necessary to search your garage for a car which has been seen in the neighbourhood  search my garage lord maltenby repeated frowning  there is no doubt the colonel explained that a car was made use of last night by the man who is still at large and it is very possible that it was stolen you will understand i am sure that any enquiries which my men may feel it their duty to make are actuated entirely by military necessity  quite so the earl acceded still a little puzzled you will find my head chauffeur a most responsible man he will i am sure give them every possible information so far as i am aware however there is no strange car in the garage do you know of any julian  only miss abbeways his son replied her little panhard was out in the avenue all night waiting for her to put some plugs in every one else seems to have come by train  the colonel raised his eyebrows very slightly and moved slowly towards the door  the matter is in the hands of my police he said but if you could excuse me for half a moment lord maltenby i should like to speak to your head chauffeur  by all means the earl replied i will take you round to the garage myself     chapter vi   julian entered the drawingroom hurriedly a few minutes later he glanced around quickly conscious of a distinct feeling of disappointment his mother who was arranging a bridge table called him over to her side  you have the air my dear boy of missing some one she remarked with a smile  i want particularly to speak to miss abbeway he confided  lady maltenby smiled tolerantly  after nearly two hours of conversation at dinner well i wont keep you in suspense she wanted a quiet place to write some letters so i sent her into the boudoir  julian hastened off with a word of thanks the boudoir was a small room opening from the suite which had been given to the princess and her niece a quaint almost circular apartment hung with faded blue chinese silk and furnished with fragments of the louis seize perioda rosewood cabinet in particular which had come from versailles and which was always associated in julians mind with the faint fragrance of two sevres jars of dried rose leaves the door opened almost noiselessly  catherine who was seated before a small ebony writing table turned her head at his entrance  you she exclaimed  julian listened for a moment and then closed the door she sat watching him with the pen still in her fingers  miss abbeway he said have you heard any news this evening  the pen with which she had been tapping the table was suddenly motionless she turned a little farther around  news she repeated no is there any  a man was caught upon the marshes this morning and shot an hour ago they say that he was a spy  she sat as though turned to stone  well  the military police are still hunting for his companion they are now searching the garage here to see if they can find a small grey coupe car  this time she remained speechless but all those illdefined fears which had gathered in his heart seemed suddenly to come to a head her appearance had changed curiously during the last hour there was a hunted almost a desperate gleam in her eyes a drawn look about her mouth as she sat looking at him  how do you know this she asked  the colonel of the regiment stationed here has just arrived he is down in the garage now with my father  shot she murmured most dieu  i want to help you he continued  her eyes questioned him almost fiercely  you are sure  i am sure  you know what it means  i do  how did you guess the truth  i remembered your mouth he told her i saw your car last night and i traced it up the avenue this morning  a mouth isnt much to go by she observed with a very wan smile  it happens to be your mouth he replied  she rose to her feet and stood for a moment as though listening then she thrust her hand down into the bosom of her gown and produced a small roll of paper wrapped in a sheet of oilskin he took it from her at once and slipped it into the breast pocket of his coat  you understand what you are doing she persisted  perfectly he replied  she crossed the room towards the hearthrug and stood there for a moment leaning against the mantelpiece  is there anything else i can do he asked  she turned around there was a wonderful change in her face  no one saw me she said i do not think that there is any one but you who could positively identify the car neither my aunt nor the maid who is with us has any idea that i left my room last night  your clothes  absolutely destroyed she assured him with a smile some day i hope ill find courage to ask you whether you thought them becoming  some day he retorted a little grimly i am going to have a very serious talk with you miss abbeway  shall you be very stern  he made no response to her lighter mood the appeal in her eyes left him colder than ever  i wish to save your life he declared and i mean to do it at the same time i cannot forget your crime or my complicity in it  if you feel like that then she said a little defiantly tell the truth i knew the risk i was running i am not afraid even now you can give me back those papers if you like i can assure you that the person on whom they are found will undoubtedly be shot  then i shall certainly retain possession of them he decided  you are very chivalrous sir she ventured smiling  i happen to be only selfish julian replied i even despise myself for what i am doing i am turning traitor myself simply because i could not bear the thought of what might happen to you if you were discovered  you like me then a little mr orden she asked  twentyfour hours ago he sighed i had hoped to answer that question before it was asked  this is very tantalising she murmured you are going to save my life then and afterwards treat me as though i were a leper  i shall hope he said that you may have explanationsthat i may find  she held out her hand and stopped him once more for a moment her eyes were distended her form was tense she was listening intently  there is some one coming she whisperedtwo or three men i think what fools we have been we ought to have decidedabout the car  her teeth came together for a moment it was her supreme effort at selfcontrol then she laughed almost naturally lit a cigarette and seated herself upon the arm of an easychair  you are interfering shockingly with my correspondence she declared and i am sure that they want you for bridge here comes lord maltenby to tell you so she added glancing towards the door  lord maltenby was very pompous very stiff and yet apologetic he considered the whole affair in which he had become involved ridiculous  miss abbeway he said i beg to present to you colonel henderson an unfortunate occurrence took place here last night which it has become the duty ofercolonel henderson to clear up he wishes to ask you a question concerningera motorcar  colonel henderson frowned he stepped a little forward with the air of wishing to exclude the earl from further speech  may i ask miss abbeway he began whether the small coupe car standing about a hundred yards down the back avenue is yours  it is she assented with a little sigh it wont go  it wont go the colonel repeated  i thought you might know something about cars she explained they tell me that two of the sparking plugs are cracked i am thinking of replacing them tomorrow morning if i can get mr orden to help me  how long has the car been there in its present condition then the colonel enquired  since about five oclock yesterday afternoon she replied  you dont think it possible that it could have been out on the road anywhere last night then  out on the road she laughed why i couldnt get it up to the garage you go and look at it colonel if you understand cars fellowes the chauffeur here had a look at the plugs when i brought it in and youll find that they havent been touched  i trust the earl intervened that my chauffeur offered to do what was necessary  certainly he did lord maltenby she assured him i am trying hard to be my own mechanic though and i have set my mind on changing those plugs myself tomorrow morning  you are your own chauffeur then miss abbeway her inquisitor asked  absolutely  you can change a wheel perhaps  theoretically i can but as a matter of fact i have never had to do it  your tyres colonel henderson continued are of somewhat unusual pattern  they are russian she told him i bought them for that reason as a matter of fact they are very good tyres  miss abbeway the colonel said i dont know whether you are aware that my police are in search of a spy who is reported to have escaped from the marshes last night in a small motorcar which was left at a certain spot in the salthouse road i do not believe that there are two tyres such as yours in norfolk how do you account for their imprint being clearly visible along the road to a certain spot near salthouse my police have taken tracings of them this morning  catherine remained perfectly speechless a slow smile of triumph dawned upon her accusers lips lord maltenbys eyebrows were upraised as though in horror  perhaps julian interposed i can explain the tyre marks upon the road miss abbeway drove me down to furleys cottage where i spent the night late in the afternoon the marks were still there when i returned this morning because i noticed them  the same marks the colonel asked frowning  without a doubt the same marks julian replied in one place where we skidded a little i recognized them  colonel henderson smiled a little more naturally  i begin to have hopes he acknowledged frankly that i have been drawn into another mares nest nevertheless i am bound to ask you this question miss abbeway did you leave your room at all during last night  not unless i walked in my sleep she answered but you had better make enquiries of my aunt and parkins our maid they sleep one on either side of me  you would not object the colonel continued more cheerfully still if my people thought well to have your things searched  not in the least catherine replied coolly only if you unpack my trunks i beg that you will allow my maid to fold and unfold my clothes  i do not think colonel henderson said to lord maltenby that i have any more questions to ask miss abbeway at present  in which case we will return to the drawingroom the earl suggested a little stiffly miss abbeway you will i trust accept my apologies for our intrusion upon you i regret that any guest of mine should have been subjected to a suspicion so outrageous  catherine laughed softly  not outrageous really dear lord maltenby she said i do not quite know of what i have been suspected but i am sure colonel henderson would not have asked me these questions if it had not been his duty  if you had not been a guest in this house miss abbeway the colonel assured her with some dignity i should have had you arrested first and questioned afterwards  you come of a race of men colonel henderson who win wars she declared graciously you know your own mind  you will be joining us presently i hope lord maltenby enquired from the door  in a very few minutes she promised  the door closed behind them catherine waited for a moment then she sank a little hysterically into a chair  i cannot avoid a touch of melodrama you see she confessed it goes with my character and nationality but seriously now that that is over i do not consider myself in the slightest danger the poor fellow who was shot this morning belongs to a different order of people he has been a spy over here since the beginning of the war  and what are you he asked bluntly  she laughed up in his face  a quite attractive young woman she declaredat least i feel sure you will think so when you know me better     chapter vii   it was about halfpast ten on the following morning when julian obeying a stentorian invitation to enter walked into miles furleys sitting room furley was stretched upon the couch smoking a pipe and reading the paper  good man was his hearty greeting i hoped youd look me up this morning  julian dragged up the other dilapidatedlooking easychair to the log fire and commenced to fill his pipe from the open jar  hows the leg he enquired  pretty nearly all right again furley answered cheerfully seems to me i was frightened before i was hurt what about your head  no inconvenience at all julian declared stretching himself out i suppose i must have a pretty tough skull  any news  news enough of a sort if you havent heard it they caught the man who sandbagged me and who i presume sawed your plank through and shot him last night  the devil they did furley exclaimed taking his pipe from his mouth shot him who the mischief was he then  it appears julian replied that he was a german hairdresser who escaped from an internment camp two years ago and has been at large ever since keeping in touch somehow or other with his friends on the other side he must have known the game was up as soon as he was caught he didnt even attempt any defence  shot eh furley repeated relighting his pipe serves him damned well right  you think so do you julian remarked pensively  who wouldnt i hate espionage so does every englishman thats why we are such duffers at the game i suppose  julian watched his friend with a slight frown  how in thunder did you get mixed up with this affair furley he asked quietly  furleys bewilderment was too natural to be assumed he removed his pipe from his teeth and stared at his friend  what the devil are you driving at julian he demanded i can assure you that i went out the night before last simply to make one of the rounds which falls to my lot when i am in this part of the world and nominated for duty there are eleven of us between here and sheringham special constables of a humble branch of the secret service if you like to put it so we are a wellknown institution amongst the initiated ive plodded these marshes sometimes from midnight till daybreak and although ones always hearing rumours until last night i have never seen or heard of a single unusual incident  you had no idea then julian persisted what it was that you were on the lookout for the night before last you had no idea say from any source whatever that there was going to be an attempt on the part of the enemy to communicate with friends on this side  good god no even to have known it would have been treason  you admit that  furley drew himself stiffly up in his chair his mass of brown hair seemed more unkempt than usual his hard face sterner than ever by reason of its disfiguring frown  what the hell do you mean julian  i mean julian replied that i have reason to suspect you furley of holding or attempting to hold secret communication with an enemy country  the pipestem which he was holding snapped in furleys fingers his eyes were filled with fury  damn you julian he exclaimed if i could stand on two legs id break your head how dare you come here and talk such rubbish  isnt there some truth in what i have just said julian asked sternly  not a word  julian was silent for a moment furley was sitting upright upon the sofa his keen eyes aglint with anger  i am waiting for an explanation julian he announced  you shall have it was the prompt reply the companion of the man who was shot for whom the police are searching at this moment is a guest in my fathers house i have had to go to the extent of lying to save her from detection  her furley gasped  yes the youth in fishermans oilskins into whose hands that message passed last night is miss catherine abbeway the young lady has referred me to you for some explanation as to its being in her possession  furley remained absolutely speechless for several moments his first expression was one of dazed bewilderment then the light broke in upon him he began to understand when he spoke all the vigour had left his tone  youll have to let me think about this for a moment julian he said  take your own time i only want an explanation  furley recovered himself slowly he stretched out his hand towards the pipe rack filled another pipe and lit it then he began  julian he said every word that i have spoken to you about the night before last is the truth there is a further confession however which under the circumstances i have to make i belong to a body of men who are in touch with a similar association in germany but i have no share in any of the practical doingsthe machinery i might call itof our organisation i have known that communications have passed back and forth but i imagined that this was done through neutral countries i went out the night before last as an ordinary british citizen to do my duty i had not the faintest idea that there was to be any attempt to land a communication here referring to the matters in which i am interested i should imagine that the proof of my words lies in the fact that efforts were made to prevent my reaching my beat and that you my substitute whom i deliberately sent to take my place were attacked  i accept your word so far julian said please go on  i am an englishman and a patriot furley continued just as much as you are although you are a son of the earl of maltenby and you fought in the war you must listen to me without prejudice there are thoughtful men in england patriots to the backbone trying to grope their way to the truth about this bloody sacrifice there are thoughtful men in germany on the same tack if for the betterment of the world we should seek to come into touch with one another i do not consider that treason or communicating with an enemy country in the ordinary sense of the word  i see julian muttered what you are prepared to plead guilty to is holding communication with members of the labour and socialist party in germany  i plead guilty to nothing furley answered with a touch of his old fierceness dont talk like your father and his class julian get away from it be yourself your ministers cant end the war your government cant they opened their mouth too wide at first they made too many commitments ask stenson hell tell you that im speaking the truth so it goes on and day by day it costs the world a few hundred or a few thousand human lives and god knows how much of mans labour and brains annihilated wasted blown into the air somehow or other the war has got to stop julian if the politicians wont do it the people must  the people julian repeated a little sadly rienzi once trusted in the people  theres a difference furley protested today the people are all right but the rienzi isnt heremy god  he broke off suddenly pursuing another train of thought he leaned forward  look here he said well talk about the fate of that communication later what about miss abbeway  miss abbeway julian told him was in imminent danger last night of arrest as a spy against my principles and all my convictions i have done my best to protect her against the consequences of her ridiculous and inexcusable conduct i dont know anything about your association furley but i consider you a lot of rotters to allow a girl to take on a job like this  furleys eyes flashed in sympathy  it was a cowardly action julian he agreed im hot with shame when i think of it but dont for heavens sake think i had anything to do with the affair we have a secret service branch which arranges for those things its that skunk fenn whos responsible damn him  nicholas fenn the pacifist julian exclaimed so you take vermin like that into your councils  you cant call him too hard a name for me at this moment furley muttered  nicholas fenn julian repeated with a new light in his eyes why the cable i censored was to him so hes the arch traitor  nicholas fenn is in it furley admitted although i deny that theres any treason whatever in the affair  dont talk nonsense julian replied what about your german hairdresser who was shot this morning  it was a mistake to make use of him furley confessed fenn has deceived us all as to the method of our communications but listen julian youll be able to get miss abbeway out of this  if i dont julian replied i shall be in it myself for ive lied myself black in the face already  youre a man for all the starch in you julian furley declared if anything were to happen to that girl id wring fenns neck  i think shes safe for the present julian pronounced you see she isnt in possession of the incriminating document i took it from her when she was in danger of arrest  what are you going to do with it  you cant have much doubt about that was the composed reply i shall go to town tomorrow and hand it over to the proper authorities  julian rose to his feet as he spoke furley looked at him helplessly  how in heavens name man he groaned shall i be able to make you see the truth  a touch of the winter sunlight was upon julians face which curiously enough at that moment resembled his fathers in its cold patrician lines the mention of nicholas fenns name seemed to have transformed him  if i were you furley he advised for the sake of our friendship i wouldnt try there is no consideration in the world which would alter my intentions  there was the sound of the lifting of the outer latch a knock at the door the incoming visitors stood upon no ceremony mr stenson and catherine showed themselves upon the threshold  mr stenson waved aside all ceremony and at once checked furleys attempt to rise to his feet  pray dont get up furley he begged shaking hands with him i hope youll forgive such an informal visit i met miss abbeway on my way down to the sea and when she told me that she was coming to call on you i asked leave to accompany her  youre very welcome sir was the cordial response its an honour which i scarcely expected  julian found chairs for every one and mr stenson recognising intuitively a certain state of tension continued his goodhumoured remarks  miss abbeway and i he said have been having a most interesting conversation or rather argument i find that she is entirely of your way of thinking furley you both belong to the order of what i call puffball politicians  catherine laughed heartily at the simile  mr stenson is a glaring example she pointed out of those who do not know their own friends mr furley and i both believe that some time or other our views will appeal to the whole of the intellectual and unselfish world  its a terrible job to get people to think furley observed they are nearly always busy doing something else  and these aristocrats catherine continued smiling at julian you spoil them so in england you know eton and oxford are simply terrible in their narrowing effect upon your young men its like putting your raw material into a sausage machine  miss abbeway is very severe this morning stenson declared with unabated good humour she has been attacking my policy and my principles during the whole of our walk bad luck about your accident furley i suppose we should have met whilst i am down here if you hadnt developed too adventurous a spirit  furley glanced at julian and smiled  i am not so sure about that sir he said your host doesnt approve of me very much  do political prejudices exist so far from their home mr stenson asked  i am afraid my father is rather oldfashioned julian confessed  you are all oldfashionedand stiff with prejudice furley declared even orden he went on turning to catherine only tolerates me because we ate dinners off the same board when we were both making up our minds to be lord high chancellor  our friend furley julian confided as he leaned across the table and took a cigarette has no tact and many prejudices he does write such rubbish about the aristocracy i remember an article of his not very long ago entitled out with our peers its all very well for a younger son like me to take it lying down but you could scarcely expect my father to approve besides i believe the fellows a renegade i have an idea that he was born in the narrower circles himself  thats where youre wrong then furley grunted with satisfaction my father was a boot manufacturer in a country village of leicestershire i went in for the bar because he left me pots of money most of which by the bye i seem to have dissipated  chiefly in utopian schemes for the betterment of his betters julian observed drily  i certainly had an idea furley confessed of an asylum for incapable younger sons  i call a truce julian proposed it isnt polite to spar before miss abbeway  to me mr stenson declared this is a veritable temple of peace i arrived here literally on all fours miss abbeway has proved to me quite conclusively that as a democratic leader i have missed my vocation  she looked at him reproachfully nevertheless his words seemed to have brought back to her mind the thrill of their brief but stimulating conversation a flash of genuine earnestness transformed her face just as a gleam of wintry sunshine which had found its way in through the open window seemed to discover threads of gold in her tightly braided and luxuriant brown hair her eyes filled with an almost inspired light  mr stenson is scarcely fair to me she complained i did not presume to criticise his statesmanship only there are some things here which seem pitiful england should be the ideal democracy of the world your laws admit of it your government admits of it neither birth nor money are indispensable to success the way is open for the working man to pass even to the cabinet and you are nothing of the sort the cause of the people is not in any country so shamefully and badly represented you have a bourgeoisie which maintains itself in almost feudal luxury by means of the labour which it employs and that labour is content to squeak and open its mouth for worms when it should have the finest fruits of the world and all this is for want of leadership up you come you david sands you phineas crosses you nicholas fenns you thomas evanses you each think that you represent labour but you dont you represent tradethe workers at one trade how they laugh at you the men who like to keep the government of this country in their own possession they stretch down a hand to the one who has climbed the highest they pull him up into the government and after that labour is well quit of him he has found his place with the gods perhaps they will make him a sir and his wife a lady but for him it is all over with the cause and so another ten years is wasted while another man grows up to take his place  shes right enough furley confessed gloomily there is something about the atmosphere of the inner life of politics which has proved fatal to every labour man who has ever climbed paul fiske wrote the same thing only a few weeks ago he thought that it was the social atmosphere which we still preserve around our politics we no sooner catch a clever man born of the people than we dress him up like a mummy and put him down at dinner parties and garden parties to do things hes not accustomed to and expect him to hold his own amongst people who are not his people there is something poisonous about it  arent you all rather assuming stenson suggested drily that the labour party is the only party in politics worth considering  if they knew their own strength catherine declared they would be the predominant party should you like to go to the polls today and fight for your seats against them  heaven forbid mr stenson exclaimed but then weve made up our mind to one thingno general election during the war afterwards i shouldnt be at all surprised if unionists and liberals and even radicals didnt amalgamate and make one party  to fight labour furley said grimly  to keep england great mr stenson replied you must remember that so far as any scheme or program which the labour party has yet disclosed in this country or any other they are preeminently selfish england has mighty interests across the seas a parishcouncil form of government would very soon bring disaster  julian glanced at the clock and rose to his feet  i dont want to hurry any one he said but my father is rather a martinet about luncheon  they all rose mr stenson turned to julian  will you go on with miss abbeway he begged i will catch up with you on the marshes i want to have just a word with furley  julian and his companion crossed the country road and passed through the gate opposite on to the rude track which led down almost to the sea  you are very interested in english labour questions miss abbeway he remarked considering that you are only half an englishwoman  it isnt only the english labouring classes in whom i am interested she replied impatiently it is the cause of the people throughout the whole of the world which in my small way i preach  your own country he continued a little diffidently is scarcely a good advertisement for the cause of social reform  her tone trembled with indignation as she answered him  my own country she said has suffered for so many centuries from such terrible oppression that the reaction was bound in its first stages to produce nothing but chaos automatically all that seems to you unreasonable wicked even in a way horriblewill in the course of time disappear russia will find herself in twenty years time her democracy will have solved the great problem and russia be the foremost republic of the world  meanwhile he remarked she is letting us down pretty badly  but you are selfish you english she exclaimed you see one of the greatest nations in the world going through its hour of agony and you think nothing but how you yourselves will be affected every thinking person in russia regrets that this thing should have come to pass at such a time yet it is best for you english to look the truth in the face it wasnt the russian people who were pledged to you with whom you were bound in alliance it was that accursed trick all european politicians have of making secret treaties and secret understandings building up buffer states trying to whittle away a piece of the map for yourselves trying all the time to be dishonest under the shadow of what is called diplomacy that is what brought the war about it was never the will of the people it was the hohenzollerns and the romanoffs the firebrands of the french cabinet and your own clumsy thickheaded efforts to get the best of everybody and yet keep your nonconformist conscience the people did not make this war but it is the people who are going to end it  they walked in silence for some minutes he apparently pondering over her last words she with the cloud passing from her face as with her head a little thrown back and her eyes halfclosed she sniffed the strong salty air with an almost voluptuous expression of content she was perfectly dressed for the country from her squaretoed shoes which still seemed to maintain some distinction of shape the perfectly tailored coat and skirt to the smart little felt hat with its single quill she walked with the free grace of an athlete unembarrassed with the difficulties of the way or the gusts which swept across the marshy places yet not even the strengthening breeze which as they reached the sea line became almost a gale seemed to have power to bring even the faintest flush of colour to her cheeks they reached the long headland and stood looking out at the sea before she spoke again  you were very kind to me last night mr orden she said a little abruptly  i paid a debt he reminded her  i suppose there is something in that she admitted i really believe that that exceedingly unpleasant person with whom i was brought into temporary association would have killed you if i had allowed it  i am inclined to agree with you he assented i saw him very hazily but a more criminal type of countenance i never beheld  so that we are quits she ventured  with a little debt on my side still to be paid  well there is no telling what demands i may make upon our acquaintance  acquaintance he protested  would you like to call it friendship  a very short time ago he said deliberately even friendship would not have satisfied me  and now  i dislike mysteries  poor me she sighed however you can rid yourself of the shadow of one as soon as you like after luncheon it would be quite safe now i think for me to take back that packet  yes he assented slowly i suppose that it would  she looked up into his face something that she saw there brought her own delicate eyebrows together in a slight frown  you will give it me after lunch she proposed  i think not was the quiet reply  you were only entrusted with it for a time she reminded him with ominous calm it belongs to me  a document received in this surreptitious fashion he pronounced is presumably a treasonable document i have no intention of returning it to you  she walked by his side for a few moments in silence glancing down into her face julian was almost startled there were none of the ordinary signs of anger there but an intense white passion the control of which was obviously costing her a prodigious effort she touched his fingers with her ungloved hand as she stepped over a stile and he found them icy cold all the joy of that unexpectedly sunny morning seemed to have passed  i am sorry miss abbeway he said almost humbly that you take my decision so hardly i ask you to remember that i am just an ordinary typical englishman and that i have already lied for your sake will you put yourself in my place  they had climbed the little ridge of grassgrown sand and stood looking out seaward suddenly all the anger seemed to pass from her face she lifted her head her soft brown eyes flashed into his the little curl of her lips seemed to transform her whole expression she was no longer the gravely minded prophetess of a great cause the scheming woman furious at the prospect of failure she was suddenly wholly feminine seductive a coquette  if you were just an ordinary stupid stolid englishman she whispered why did you risk your honour and your safety for my sake will you tell me that dear man of steel  julian leaned even closer over her she was smiling now frankly into his face refusing the warning of his burning eyes then suddenly silently he held her to him and kissed her unresisting upon the lips she made no protest he even fancied afterwards when he tried to rebuild in his mind that queer passionate interlude that her lips had returned what his had given it was he who released hernot she who struggled yet he understood he knew that this was a tragedy  stensons voice reached them from the other side of the ridge  come and show me the way across this wretched bit of marsh orden i dont like these deceptive green grasses  pitfalls for the politician or look before you leap julian muttered aimlessly quite right to avoid that spot sir just follow where i am pointing  stenson made his laborious way to their side  this may be a short cut back to the hall he exclaimed but except for the view of the sea and this gorgeous air i think i should have preferred the main road help me up orden isnt it somewhere near here that that little affair happened the other night  this very spot julian assented miss abbeway and i were just speaking of it  they both glanced towards her she was standing with her back to them looking out seawards she did not move even at the mention of her name  a dreary spot at night i dare say the prime minister remarked without overmuch interest how do we get home from here orden i havent forgotten your warning about luncheon and this air is giving me a most lively appetite  straight along the top of this ridge for about three quarters of a mile sir to the entrance of the harbour there  and then  i have a petrol launch julian explained and i shall land you practically in the dining room in another ten minutes  let us proceed mr stenson suggested briskly what a queer fellow miles furley is quite a friend of yours isnt he miss abbeway  i have seen a good deal of him lately she answered walking on and making room for stenson to fall into step by her side but still keeping her face a little averted a man of many but confused ideas a man i should think who stands an evil chance of muddling his career away  we offered him a post in the government stenson ruminated  he had just sense enough to refuse that i suppose she observed moving slowly to the right and thereby preventing julian from taking a place by her side yet she went on i find in him the fault of so many englishmen the fault that prevents their becoming great statesmen great soldiers or even she added coolly successful lovers  and what is that julian demanded  she remained silent it was as though she had heard nothing she caught mr stensons arm and pointed to a huge white seagull drifting down the wind above their heads  to think she said with that model we intellectuals have waited nearly two thousand years for the aeroplane     chapter viii   according to plans made earlier in the day a small shooting party left the hall immediately after luncheon and did not return until late in the afternoon julian therefore saw nothing more of catherine until she came into the drawingroom a few minutes before the announcement of dinner wearing a wonderful toilette of pale blue silk with magnificent pearls around her neck and threaded in her russian headdress as is the way with all women of genius catherines complete change of toilette indicated a parallel change in her demeanour her interesting but somewhat subdued manner of the previous evening seemed to have vanished at the dinner table she dominated the conversation she displayed an intimate acquaintance with every capital of europe and with countless personages of importance she exchanged personal reminiscences with lord shervinton who had once been attached to the embassy at rome and with mr hannaway wells who had been first secretary at vienna she spoke amusingly of munich at which place it appeared she had first studied art but dilated with all the artists fervour on her travellings in spain on the soft yet wonderfully vivid colouring of the southern cities she seemed to have escaped altogether from the gravity of which she had displayed traces on the previous evening she was no longer the serious young woman with a purpose from the chrysalis she had changed into the butterfly the brilliant and cosmopolitan young queen of fashion ruling easily not with the arrogance of rank but with the actual gifts of charm and wit julian himself derived little benefit from being her neighbour for the conversation that evening from first to last was general even after she had left the room the atmosphere which she had created seemed to linger behind her  i have never rightly understood miss abbeway the bishop declared she is a most extraordinarily brilliant young woman  lord shervinton assented  tonight you have catherine abbeway he expounded as she might have been but for these queer alternating crazes of hersart and socialism her brain was developed a little too early and she was unfortunately almost in her girlhood thrown in with a little clique of brilliant young russians who attained a great influence over her most of them are in siberia or have disappeared by now one anna katinskiwas brought back from tobolsk like a royal princess on the first day of the revolution  it is strange the earl pronounced didactically that a young lady of miss abbeways birth and gifts should espouse the cause of this labour rabble a party already cursed with too many leaders  a woman when she takes up a cause mr hannaway wells observed always seeks either for the picturesque or for something which appeals to the emotions so long as she doesnt mix with them the cause of the people has a great deal to recommend it one can use beautiful phrases can idealise with a certain amount of logic and can actually achieve things  julian shrugged his shoulders  i think we are all a little blind he remarked to the danger in which we stand through the great prosperity of labour today  the bishop leaned across the table  you have been reading fiske this week  did i quote julian asked carelessly i have a wretched memory i should never dare to become a politician i should always be passing off other peoples phrases as my own  fiske is quite right in his main contention mr stenson interposed the war is rapidly creating a new class of bourgeoisie the very differences in the earning of skilled labourers will bring trouble before longthe miner with his fifty or sixty shillings and the munition worker with his seven or eight poundsmen drawn from the same class  england declared the earl indulging in his favourite speech was never so contented as when wages were at their lowest  those days will never come again mr hannaway wells foretold grimly the working man has tasted blood he has begun to understand his power our ministers have been asleep for a generation the first of these modern trades unions should have been treated like a secret society in italy look at them now and what they represent fancy what it will mean when they have all learnt to combinewhen labour produces real leaders  can any one explain the german democracy lord shervinton enquired  the ubiquitous fiske was trying to last week in one of the reviews mr stenson replied his argument was that germany alone of all the nations in the world possessed an extra quality or an extra sensei forget which he called itthe sense of discipline its born in their blood generations of military service are responsible for it discipline and combinationthat might be their motto individual thought has been drilled into grooves just as all individual effort is specialised the germans obey because it is their nature to obey the only question is whether they will stand this the roughest test they have ever hadwhether theyll see the thing through  personally i think they will hannaway wells pronounced but if i should be wrongif they shouldntthe french revolution would be a picnic compared with the german one it takes a great deal to drive a national idea out of the german mind but if ever they should understand precisely and exactly how they have been duped for the glorification of their masterswell i should pity the junkers  do your essays in journalism the bishop asked politely ever lead you to touch upon labour subjects julian  once or twice in a very mild way was the somewhat diffident reply  i had an interesting talk with furley this morning the prime minister observed he tells me that they are thinking of making an appeal to this man paul fiske to declare himself they want a leaderthey want one very badlyand thank heavens they dont know where to look for him  but surely julian protested they dont expect necessarily to find a leader of men in an anonymous contributor to the reviews fiske when they have found him may be a septuagenarian or a man of academic turn of mind who never leaves his study paul fiske may even be the pseudonym of a woman  the earl rose from his place  this afternoon he announced i read the latest article of this paul fiske in my opinion he is an exceedingly mischievous person without the slightest comprehension of the forces which really count in government  the bishops eyes twinkled as he left the room with his hand on his godsons arm  it would be interesting he whispered to hear this man fiskes opinion of your fathers last speech in the house of lords upon land interests  it was not until the close of a particularly unsatisfactory evening of uninspiring bridge that julian saw anything more of catherine she came in from the picture gallery breathless followed by four or five of the young soldiers to whom she had been showing the steps of a new dance and turning to julian with an impulsiveness which surprised him laid her fingers imperatively upon his arm  take me somewhere please where we can sit down and talk she begged and give me something to drink  he led the way into the billiard room and rang the bell  you have been overtiring yourself he said looking down at her curiously  have i she answered i dont think so i used to dance all through the night in paris and rome a few years ago these young men are so clumsy thoughand i think that i am nervous  she lay back in her chair and half closed her eyes a servant brought in the evian water for which she had asked and a whisky and soda for julian she drank thirstily and seemed in a few moments to have overcome her fatigue she turned to her companion with an air of determination  i must speak to you about that packet mr orden she insisted  again  i cannot help it you forget that with me it is a matter of life or death you must realise that you were only entrusted with it you are a man of honour give it to me  i cannot  what are you thinking of doing with it then  i shall take it to london with me tomorrow he replied and hand it over to a friend of mine at the foreign office  would nothing that i could do or say she asked passionately influence your decision  everything that you do or say interests and affects me he answered simply but so far as regards this matter my duty is clear you have nothing to fear from my account of how it came into my possession it would be impossible for me to denounce you for what i fear you are on the other hand i cannot allow you the fruits of your enterprise  you consider me i suppose she observed after a moments pause an enemy spy  you have proved it he reminded her  of overmanmy confederate she admitted that was true of me it is not i am an honest intermediary between the honest people of germany and england  there can be no communication between the two countries during wartime except through official channels he declared  her eyes flashed she seemed in the throes of one of those little bursts of tempestuous passion which sometimes assailed her  you talkwell as you might be supposed to talk she exclaimed breaking off with an effort what have official channels done to end this war i am not here to help either side i represent simply humanity if you destroy or hand over to the government that packet you will do your country an evil turn  he shook his head  i am relieved to hear all that you say he told her and i am heartily glad to think that you do not look upon yourself as overmans associate on the other hand you must know that any movement towards peace except through the authorised channels is treason to the country  if only you were not the honourable julian orden the son of an english peer she groaned if only you had not been to eton and to oxford if only you were a man a man of the people who could understand  neither my birth nor my education he assured her have affected my present outlook upon life  pooh she scoffed you talk like a stiffened sheet of foolscap i am to leave here tomorrow then without my packet  you must certainly leavewhen you do leavewithout that he assented there is one thing however which i very sincerely hope that you will leave behind you  and that  your forgiveness  my forgiveness for what she asked after a moments pause  for my rashness this morning  her eyes grew a little larger  because you kissed me she observed without flinching i have nothing to forgive in fact she went on i think that i should have had more to forgive if you had not  he was puzzled and yet encouraged she was always bewildering him by her sudden changes from the woman of sober thoughtfulness to the woman of feeling the woman eager to give eager to receive at that moment it seemed as though her sex possessed her to the exclusion of everything outside her eyes were soft and filled with the desire of love her lips sweet and tremulous she had suddenly created a new atmosphere around her an atmosphere of bewildering and passionate femininity  wont you tell me please what you mean he begged  isnt it clear she answered very softly but with a suspicion of scorn in her low tones you kissed me because i deliberately invited it i know that quite well my angerand i have been angry about itis with myself  he was a little taken aback her perfect naturalness was disarming a little confusing  you certainly did seem provocative he confessed but i ought to have remembered  you are very stupid she sighed i deliberately invited your embrace your withholding it would simply have added to my humiliation i am furious with myself simply because although i have lived a great part of my life with men on equal terms with them working with them playing with them seeing more of them at all times than of my own sex such a thing has never happened to me before  i felt that he said simply  for a moment her face shone there was a look of gratitude in her eyes her impulsive grasp of his hand left his fingers tingling  i am glad that you understood she murmured perhaps that will help me just a little for the rest if you wish to be very kind you will forget  if i cannot do that he promised i will at least turn the key upon my memories  do more than that she begged throw the key into the sea or whatever oblivion you choose to conjure up moments such as those have no place in my life there is one purpose there more intense than anything else that very purpose which by some grim irony of fate it seems to be within your power to destroy  he remained silent ordinary expressions of regret seemed too inadequate besides the charm of the moment was passing the other side of her was reasserting itself  i suppose she went on a little drearily that even if i told you upon my honour of my certain knowledge that the due delivery of that packet might save the lives of thousands of your countrymen might save hearts from breaking homes from becoming destituteeven if i told you all this would it help me in my prayer  nothing could help you he assured her but your whole confidence and even then i fear that the result would be the same  oh but you are very hard she murmured my confidence belongs to others it is not mine alone to give you  you see he explained i know beforehand that you are speaking the truth as you see it i know beforehand that any scheme in which you are engaged is for the benefit of our fellow creatures and not for their harm but alas you make yourself the judge of these things and there are times when individual effort is the most dangerous thing in life  if you were any one else she sighed  why be prejudiced about me he protested believe me i am not a frivolous person i too think of life and its problems you yourself are an aristocrat why should not i as well as you have sympathy and feeling for those who suffer  i am a russian she reminded him and in russia it is different besides i am no longer an aristocrat i am a citizeness of the world i have eschewed everything in life except one thing and for that i have worked with all my heart and strength as for you what have you done what is your record  insignificant i fear he admitted you see a very promising start at the bar was somewhat interfered with by my brief period of soldiering  at the present moment you have no definite career she declared you have even been wasting your time censoring  i am returning now to my profession  your profession she scoffed that means you will spend your time wrangling with a number of other bewigged and narrowminded people about uninteresting legal technicalities which lead nowhere and which no one cares about  there is my journalism  you have damned it with your own phrase hack journalism  i may enter parliament  yes to preserve your rights she retorted  i am afraid he sighed that you havent a very high opinion of me  it is within your power to make me look upon you as the bravest the kindest the most farseeing of men she declared  he shook his head  i decline to think that you would think any the better of me for committing a dishonourable action for your sake  try me she begged her hand resting once more upon his if you want my kind feelings my everlasting gratitude they are yours give me that packet  that is impossible he declared uncompromisingly if you wish to alter my attitude with regard to it you must tell me exactly from whom it comes what it contains and to whom it goes  you ask more than is possible you make me almost sorry  sorry for what  sorry that i saved your life she said boldly why should i not be there are many who will suffer many who will lose their lives because of your obstinacy  if you believe that confide in me  she shook her head sadly  if only you were different  i am a human being he protested i have sympathies and heart i would give my life willingly to save any carnage  i could never make you understand she murmured hopelessly i shall not try i dare not risk failure is this room hot or is it my fancy could we have a window open  by all means  he crossed the room and lifted the blind from before one of the high windows which opened seawards in the panel of the wall between the window to which he addressed himself and the next one was a tall gilt mirror relic of the days some hundreds of years ago when the apartment had been used as a drawingroom julian by the merest accident for the pleasure of a stolen glance at catherine happened to look in it as he leaned over towards the window fastening for a single moment he stood rigid catherine had risen to her feet and without the slightest evidence of any fatigue was leaning tense and alert over the tray on which his untouched whisky and soda was placed her hand was outstretched he saw a little stream of white powder fall into the tumbler an intense and sickening feeling of disappointment almost brought a groan to his lips he conquered himself with an effort however opened the window a few inches and returned to his place catherine was lying back her eyes halfclosed her arms hanging listlessly on either side of her chair  is that better he enquired  very much she assured him still i think that if you do not mind i will go to bed i am troubled with a very rare attack of nerves drink your whisky and soda and then will you take me into the drawingroom  he played with his tumbler thoughtfully his first impulse was to drop it intervention however was at hand the door opened and the princess entered with lord shervinton  at last the former exclaimed i have been looking for you everywhere child i am sure that you are quite tired out and i insist upon your going to bed  finish your whisky and soda catherine begged julian and i will lean on your arm as far as the staircase  fate stretched out her right hand to help him the princess took possession of her niece  i shall look after you myself she insisted mr orden is wanted to play billiards lord shervinton is anxious for a game  i shall be delighted julian answered promptly  he moved to the door and held it open catherine gave him her fingers and a little halfdoubtful smile  if only you were not so cruelly obstinate she sighed  he found no words with which to answer her the shock of his discovery was still upon him  youll give me thirty in a hundred julian lord shervinton called out cheerfully and shut that door as soon as you can theres a good fellow theres a most confounded draught   chapter ix   it was at some nameless hour in the early morning when julians vigil came to an end when the handle of his door was slowly turned and the door itself pushed open and closed again julian lying stretched upon his bed only half prepared for the night with a dressing gown wrapped around him continued to breathe heavily his eyes halfclosed listening intently to the fluttering of light garments the soft almost noiseless footfall of light feet he heard her shake out his dinner coat try the pockets heard the stealthy opening and closing of the drawers in his wardrobe presently the footsteps drew near to his bed for a moment he was obliged to set his teeth a little waft of peculiar unanalysable perfume halffascinating halfrepellent came to him with a sense of disturbing familiarity she paused by his bedside he felt her hand steal under the pillow which his head scarcely touched search the pockets of his dressing gown search even the bed he listened to her soft breathing the consciousness of her close and intimate presence affected him in an inexplicable manner presently to his intense relief she glided away from his immediate neighbourhood and the moment for which he had waited came he heard her retreating footsteps pass through the communicating door into his little sitting room where he had purposely left a light burning he slipped softly from the bed and followed her she was bending over an open desk as he crossed the threshold he closed the door and stood with his back to it  much warmer he said only you see it isnt there  she started violently at the sound of his voice but she did not immediately turn around when she did so her demeanour was almost a shock to him there was no sign of nervousness or apology in her manner her eyes flashed at him angrily she wore a loose red wrap trimmed with white fur a dishabille unusually and provokingly attractive  so you were shamming sleep she exclaimed indignantly  entirely he admitted  neither spoke for a moment her eyes fell upon a tumbler of whisky and soda which stood on a round table drawn up by the side of his easychair  i have not come to bed thirsty he assured her i had another one downstairsto which i helped myself this one i brought up to try if i could remember sufficient of my chemistry to determine its contents i have been able to decide to my great relief that your intention was probably to content yourself with plunging me into only temporary slumber  i wanted you out of the way whilst i searched your rooms she told him coolly if you were not such an obstinate pigheaded unkind prejudiced person it would not have been necessary  dear me he murmured am i all that wont you sit down  for a moment she looked as though she were about to strike him with the electric torch which she was carrying with a great effort of selfcontrol however she changed her mind and threw herself into his easychair with a little gesture of recklessness julian seated himself opposite to her although she kept her face as far as possible averted he realised more than ever in those few moments that she was really an extraordinarily beautiful person her very attitude was full of an angry grace the quivering of her lips was the only sign of weakness her eyes were filled with cold resentment  well she said i am your prisoner i listen  you are after that packet i suppose  what sagacity she scoffed i trusted you with it and you behaved like a brute you kept it it has nothing to do with you you have no right to it  let us understand one another once and for all he suggested i will not even discuss the question of rightful or wrongful possession i have the packet and i am going to keep it you cannot cajole it put of me you cannot steal it from me tomorrow i shall take it to london and deliver it to my friend at the foreign office nothing could induce me to change my mind  she seemed suddenly to be caught up in the vortex of a new emotion all the bitterness passed from her expression she fell on her knees by his side sought his hands and lifted her face full of passionate entreaty to his her eyes were dimmed with tears her voice piteous  do not be so cruel so hard she begged i swear before heaven that there is no treason in those papers that they are the one necessary link in a great humanitarian scheme be generous mr orden julian give it back to me it is mine i swear  his hands gripped her shoulders she was conscious that he was looking past her and that there was horror in his eyes the words died away on her lips she too turned her head the door of the sitting room had been opened from outside lord maltenby was standing there in his dressing gown his hand stretched out behind him as though to keep some one from following him  julian he demanded sternly what is the meaning of this  for a moment julian was speechless bereft of words or sense of movement catherine still knelt there trembling then lord maltenby was pushed unceremoniously to one side it was the princess who entered  catherine she screamed catherine  the girl rose slowly to her feet the princess was leaning on the back of a chair dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief and sobbing hysterically lord shervintons voice was heard outside  what the devil is all this commotion he demanded  he too crossed the threshold and remained transfixed the earl closed the door firmly and stood with his back against it  come he said we will have no more spectators to this disgraceful scene julian kindly remember you are not in your bachelor apartments you are in the house over which your mother presides have you any reason to offer or excuse to urge why i should not ask this young woman to leave at daybreak  i have no excuse sir julian answered i certainly have a reason  name it  because you would be putting an affront upon the lady who has promised to become my wife i am quite aware that her presence in my sitting room is unusual but under the circumstances i do not feel called upon to offer a general explanation i shall say nothing beyond the fact that a single censorious remark will be considered by me as an insult to my affianced wife  the princess abandoned her chorus of mournful sounds and dried her eyes lord waltenby was speechless  but why all this mystery the princess asked pitifully it is a great event this why did you not tell me catherine when you came to my room  there has been some little misunderstanding julian explained it is now removed it brought us he added very near tragedy after what i have told you i beg whatever may seem unusual to you in this visit with which catherine has honoured me will be forgotten  lord maltenby drew a little breath of relief fortunately he missed that slight note of theatricality in julians demeanour which might have left the situation still dubious  very well then julian he decided there is nothing more to be said upon the matter miss abbeway you will allow me to escort you to your room such further explanations as you may choose to offer us can be very well left now until the morning  you will find that the whole blame for this unconventional happening devolves upon me julian declared  it was entirely my fault catherine murmured repentantly i am so sorry to have given any one cause for distress i do not know even now  she turned towards julian he leaned forward and raised her fingers to his lips  catherine he said every one is a little overwrought our misunderstanding is finished princess i shall try to win your forgiveness tomorrow  the princess smiled faintly  catherine is so unusual she complained  julian held open the door and they all filed away down the corridor from which lord shervinton had long since beat a hurried retreat he stood there until they reached the bend catherine who was leaning on his fathers arm turned around she waved her hand a little irresolutely she was too far off for him to catch her expression but there was something pathetic in her slow listless walk from which all the eager grace of a few hours ago seemed to have departed   it was not until they were nearing london on the following afternoon that catherine awoke from a lethargy during which she had spent the greater portion of the journey from her place in the corner seat of the compartment in which they had been undisturbed since leaving wells she studied her companion through halfclosed eyes julian was reading an article in one of the reviews and remained entirely unconscious of her scrutiny his forehead was puckered his mouth a little contemptuous it was obvious that he did not wholly approve of what he was reading  catherine during those few hours of solitude was conscious of a subtle slowly growing change in her mental attitude towards her companion until the advent of those dramatic hours at maltenby she had regarded him as a pleasant even a charming acquaintance but as belonging to a type with which she was entirely and fundamentally out of sympathy the cold chivalry of his behaviour on the preceding night and the result of her own reflections as she sat there studying him made her inclined to doubt the complete accuracy of her first judgment she found something unexpectedly intellectual and forceful in his present concentrationin the high pale forehead the deepset but alert eyes his long loose frame was yet far from ungainly his grey tweed suit and wellworn brown shoes the careless attire of a man who has no need to rely on his tailor for distinction his hands too were strong and capable she found herself suddenly wishing that the man himself were different that he belonged to some other and more congenial type  julian in course of time laid down the review which he had been studying and looked out of the window  we shall be in london in three quarters of an hour he announced politely  she sat up and yawned produced her vanity case peered into the mirror and used her powder puff with the somewhat piquant assurance of the foreigner then she closed her dressing case with a snap pulled down her veil and looked across at him  and how she asked demurely does my fiance propose to entertain me this evening  he raised his eyebrows  with the exception of one halfhour he replied unexpectedly i am wholly at your service  i am exacting she declared i demand that halfhour also  i am afraid that i could not allow anything to interfere with one brief call which i must pay  in downing street  precisely  you go to visit your friend at the foreign office  immediately i have called at my rooms  she looked away from him out of the window beneath her veil her eyes were a little misty she saw nothing of the trimly partitioned fields the rolling pastoral country before her vision tragedies seemed to passthe bloodstained paraphernalia of the battlefield the empty stricken homes the sobbing women in black striving to comfort their children whilst their own hearts were breaking when she turned away from the window her face was hardened once more she found herself almost hating the man who was her companion whatever might come afterwards at that moment she had the sensations of a murderess  you may know when you sleep tonight she exclaimed that you will be the bloodguiltiest man in the world  i would not dispute the title he observed politely with your friend the hohenzollern  he is not my friend she retorted her tone vibrating with passion i am a traitress in your eyes because i have received a communication from germany from whom does it come do you think from the court from the chancellor or one of his myrmidons fool it comes from those who hate the whole military party it comes from the germany whose people have been befooled and strangled throughout the war it comes from the people whom your politicians have sought to reach and failed  the suggestion is interesting he remarked coldly but improbable  do you know she said leaning a little forward and looking at him fixedly if i were really your fianceeworse if i were really your wifei think that before long i should be a murderess  do you dislike me as much as all that  i hate you i think you are the most pigheaded obstinate selfsatisfied ignorant creature who ever ruined a great cause  he accepted the lash of her words without any sign of offenceseemed indeed inclined to treat them reflectively  come he protested you have wasted a lot of breath in abusing me why not justify it tell me the story of yourself and those who are associated with you in this secret correspondence with germany if you are working for a good end let me know of it you blame me for judging you for maintaining a certain definite poise you are not reasonable you know  i blame you for being what you are she answered breathlessly if you were a person who understood who felt the great stir of humanity outside your own little circle who could look across your seas and realise that nationality is accidental and that the brotherhood of man throughout the world is the only real fact worthy of considerationah if you could realise these things i could talk i could explain  you judge me in somewhat arbitrary fashion  i judge you from your life your prejudices even the views which you have expressed  there are some of us he reminded her to whom reticence is a national gift i like what you said just now why should you take it for granted that i am a narrow squireen why shouldnt you believe that i too may feel the horror of these days  you feel it personally but not impersonally she cried you feel it intellectually but not with your heart you cannot see that a kindred soul lives in the russian peasant and the german labourer the british toiler and the french artificer they are all pouring out their blood for the sake of their dream a politicians dream freedom isnt won by wars it must be won if ever by moral sacrifice and not with blood  then explain to me he begged exactly what you are doing what your reason is for being in communication with the german government remember that the dispatch i intercepted came from no private person in germany it came from those in authority  that again is not true she replied i would ask for permission to explain all these things to you if it were not so hopeless  the case of your friends will probably be more hopeless still he reminded her after tonight  she shrugged her shoulders  we shall see she said solemnly the russian revolution surprised no one perhaps an english revolution would shake even your selfconfidence  he made no reply her blood tingled and she could have struck him for the faint smile almost of amusement which for a moment parted his lips he was already on his feet collecting their belongings  can you help me he asked with reference to the explanations which it will be necessary to make to your aunt and to my own people we left this morning if you remember in order that you might visit the russian embassy and announce our betrothal you are i believe under an engagement to return and stay with my mother  i cannot think about those things today she replied you may take it that i am tired and that you had business you know my address may i be favoured with yours  he handed her a card and scribbled a telephone number upon it they were in the station now and their baggage in the hands of separate porters she walked slowly down the platform by his side  will you allow me to say he ventured how sorry i amfor all this  the slight uncertainty of his speech pleased her she looked up at him with infinite regret as they neared the barrier she held out her hand  i too am more sorry than i can tell you she said a little tremulously whatever may come that is how i feel myself i am sorry  they separated almost upon the words catherine was accosted by a man at whom julian glanced for a moment in surprise a man whose dress and bearing confident though it was clearly indicated some other status in life he glanced at julian with displeasure a displeasure which seemed to have something of jealousy in its composition then he grasped catherine warmly by the hand  welcome back to london miss abbeway your news  her reply was inaudible julian quickened his pace and passed out of the station ahead of them     chapter x   the bishop and the prime minister met one afternoon a few days later at the corner of horse guards avenue the latter was looking brown and well distinctly the better for his brief holiday the bishop on the contrary was pale and appeared harassed they shook hands and exchanged for a moment the usual inanities  tell me mr stenson the bishop asked earnestly what is the meaning of all this press talk about peace next month i have heard a hint that it was inspired  you are wrong was the firm reply i have sent my private secretary around to a few of the newspapers this morning it just happens to be the sensation of the moment and its fed all the time from the other side  there is nothing in it then really  nothing whatever believe me bishopand there is no one feeling the strain more than i amthe time has not yet come for peace  you politicians the bishop sighed do you sometimes forget i wonder that even the pawns you move are human  i can honestly say that i at any rate have never forgotten it mr stenson answered gravely there isnt a man in my government who has a single personal feeling in favour of or a single benefit to gain by the continuance of this ghastly war on the other hand there is scarcely one who does not realise that the end is not yet we have pledged our word the word of the english nation to a peace based only upon certain contingencies those contingencies the enemy is not at present prepared to accept there is no immediate reason why he should  but are you sure of that the bishop ventured doubtfully when you speak of germany you speak of william of hohenzollern and his clan is that germany is theirs the voice of the people  i would be happy to believe that it was not mr stenson replied but if that is the case let them give us a sign of it  that sign declared the bishop with a gleam of hopefulness in his tone may come and before long  the two men were on the point of parting mr stenson turned and walked a yard or two with his companion  by the bye bishop he enquired have you heard any rumours concerning the sudden disappearance of our young friend julian orden  the bishop for a moment was silent a passerby glanced at the two men sympathetically of the two he thought it was the man in spiritual charge of a suffering people who showed more sign of the strain  i have heard rumours the bishop acknowledged tell me what you know  singularly little mr stenson replied he left maltenby with miss abbeway the day after their engagement and according to the stories which i have heard arranged to dine with her that night she came to call for him and found that he had disappeared according to his servant he simply walked out in morning clothes soon after six oclock without leaving any message and never returned on the top of that though there followed as i expect you have heard some very insistent police enquiries as to ordens doings on the night he spent with his friend miles furley there is no doubt that a german submarine was close to blakeney harbour that night and that a communication of some sort was landed  it seems absurd to connect julian with any idea of treasonable communication with germany the bishop said slowly a more typical young englishman of his class i never met  up to a certain point i agree with you mr stenson confessed but there are some further rumours to which i cannot allude concerning julian orden which are to say the least of it surprising  the two men came to a standstill once more  stenson laid his hand upon his companions shoulder come he went on i know what is the matter with you my friend your heart is too big the cry of the widow and the children lingers too long in your ears remember some of your earlier sermons at the beginning of the war remember how wonderfully you spoke one morning at st pauls upon the spirituality to be developed by suffering by sacrifice the hand which chastises also purifies wasnt that what you said you probably didnt know that i was one of your listeners eveni myself in those days scarcely looked upon the war as i do now i remember crawling in at the side door of the cathedral and sitting unrecognised on a hard chair it was a great congregation and i was far away in the background but i heard i remember the rustle too the little moaning indrawn breath of emotion when the people rose to their feet take heart bishop i will remind you once more of your own words these are the days of purification  the two men separated the bishop walked thoughtfully towards the strand his hands clasped behind his back the echo of those quoted words of his still in his ear as he came to the busy crossing he raised his head and looked around him  perhaps he murmured my eyes have been closed perhaps there are things to be seen  he called a taxicab and giving the man some muttered directions was driven slowly down the strand looking eagerly first on one side of the way and then on the other it was approaching the luncheon hour and the streets were thronged here seemed to be the meeting place of the colonial troopslong sinewy men many of them with bronzed faces and awkward gait they elbowed their way along side by side with the queerest collection of people in the world they stopped and talked in little knots they entered and left the public houses stood about outside the restaurants here and there they walked arm in arm with women taxicabs were turning in at the savoy taxicabs and private cars young ladies of the stage sometimes alone very often escorted were everywhere in evidence the life of london was flowing on in very much the same channels there were few if any signs of that thing for which he sought the taxicab turned westwards crossed piccadilly circus and proceeded along piccadilly its solitary occupant still gazing into the faces of the people with that same consuming interest it was all the same over againthe smiling throngs entering and leaving the restaurants the smug promenaders the stream of gaily dressed women and girls bond street was even more crowded with shoppers and loiterers the shop windows were as full as ever the toilettes of the women as wonderful mankind though khakiclad was plentiful the narrow thoroughfare was so crowded that his taxicab went only at a snails crawl and occasionally he heard scraps of conversation two pretty girls were talking to two young men in uniform  what a rag last night i didnt get home till three  dick never got home at all still missing  evie and i are worn out with shopping everythings twice as expensive but one simply cant do without  i shouldnt do without anything these days one never knows how long it may last  the taxicab moved on and the bishops eyes for a moment were halfclosed the voices followed him however two women leading curled and pampered toy dogs were talking at the corner of the street  sugar my dear one was saying why i laid in nearly a hundredweight and i can always get what i want now the shopkeepers know that they have to have your custom after the war its only the people who cant afford to buy much at a time who are really inconvenienced  of course its awfully sad about the war and all that but one has to think of oneself harry told me last night that after paying all the income tax he couldnt get out of and excess profits he is still  the voices dropped to a whisper the bishop thrust his head out of the window  drive me to tothill street westminster he directed as quickly as possible please  the man turned up a side street and drove off still the bishop watched only by now the hopefulness had gone from his face he had sought for something of which there had been no sign  he dismissed his taxicab in front of a large and newly finished block of buildings in the vicinity of westminster a lift man conducted him to the seventh floor and a commissionaire ushered him into an already crowded waiting room a youth however who had noticed the bishops entrance took him in charge and conducting him through two other crowded rooms knocked reverently at the door of an apartment at the far end of the suite the door was opened after a brief delay by a young man of unpleasant appearance who gazed suspiciously at the distinguished visitor through heavy spectacles  the bishop wishes to see mr fenn his guide announced  show him in at once a voice from the middle of the room directed you can go and have your lunch johnson  the bishop found himself alone with the man whom he had come to visita moderately tall thin figure badlydressed with a drooping moustache bright eyes and good forehead but peevish expression he stood up while he shook hands with the bishop and motioned him to a chair  first time youve honoured us bishop he remarked with the air of one straining after an equality which he was far from feeling  i felt an unconquerable impulse to talk with you the bishop admitted tell me your news  everything progresses nicholas fenn declared confidently the last eleven days have seen a social movement in this country conducted with absolute secrecy equivalent in its portentous issues to the greatest revolution of modern times for the first time in history bishop the united voice of the people has a chance of making itself heard  mr fenn the bishop said you have accomplished a wonderful work now comes the moment when we must pause and think we must be absolutely and entirely certain that the first time that voice is heard it is heard in a righteous cause  is there a more righteous cause in the world than the cause of peace fenn asked sharply  not if that peace be just and reasonable the bishop replied not if that peace can bring to an end this horrible and bloody struggle  we shall see to that fenn declared with a selfsatisfied air  you have by now i suppose the terms proposed by youryour kindred body in germany  nicholas fenn stroked his moustache there was a frown upon his forehead  i expect to have them at any moment he said but to tell you the truth at the present moment they are not available  but i thought  just so the other interrupted the document however was not where we expected to find it  surely that is a very serious complication  it will mean a certain delay if we dont succeed in getting hold of it fenn admitted we intend to be firm about the matter though  the bishops expression was troubled  julian orden he said is my godson  necessity knows neither friendship nor relationship fenn pronounced didactically better ask no questions sir these details do not concern you  they concern my conscience was the grave reply ours is an earnest spiritual effort for peace a taking away from the hands of the politicians of a great human question which they have proved themselves unable to handle we should look therefore with peculiar care to the means we adopt  nicholas fenn nodded he lit a very pungent cigarette from a paper packet by his side  you and i bishop he said are pacifists in the broadest meaning of the word but that does not mean that we may not sometimes have to use force to attain our object we have a department which alone is concerned with the dealing of such matters it is that department which has undertaken the forwarding and receipt of all communications between ourselves and our friends across the north sea its operations are entirely secret even from the rest of the council it will deal with julian orden it is best for you not to interfere or even to have cognisance of what is going on  i cannot agree the bishop protested an act of unchristian violence would be a flaw in the whole superstructure which we are trying to build up  let us discuss some other subject fenn proposed  pardon me was the firm reply i have come here to discuss this one  nicholas fenn looked down at the table his expression was not altogether pleasant  your position with us sir he said although much appreciated does not warrant your interference in executive details  nevertheless the bishop insisted you must please treat me reasonably in this matter mr fenn remember i am not altogether extinct as a force amongst your followers i have three mass meetings to address this week and there is the sermon next sunday at westminster abbey at which it has been agreed that i shall strike the first note of warning i am a helper i believe worth considering and there is no man amongst you who risks what i risk  exactly what are you asking from me fenn demanded after a moments deliberation  i wish to know the whereabouts and condition of julian orden  the matter is one which is being dealt with by our secret service department fenn replied but i see no reason why i should not give you all reasonable information the young man in question asked for trouble and to a certain extent he has found it  i understand the bishop reminded his companion that he has very nearly if not altogether compromised himself in his efforts to shield miss abbeway  that may be so fenn admitted but it doesnt alter the fact that he refuses to return to her the packet which she entrusted to his care  and he is still obdurate  up to now absolutely so perhaps fenn added with a slightly malicious smile you would like to try what you can do with him yourself  the bishop hesitated  julian orden he said is a young man of peculiarly stubborn type but if i thought that my exhortations would be of any benefit i would not shrink from trying them whatever it might cost me  better have a try then fenn suggested if we do not succeed within the next twentyfour hours i shall give you an order to see him i dont mind confessing he went on confidentially that the need for the production of that document is urgent apart from the risk we run of having our plans forestalled if it should fall into the hands of the government  i presume that miss abbeway has already done her best  she has worn herself out with persuasions  has he himself been told the truth  fenn shook his head  from your own knowledge of the young man do you think that it would be of any use even miss abbeway is forced to admit that any one less likely to sympathise with our aims it would be impossible to find at the same time if we do arrange an interview for you use any arguments you can think of to tell you the truth our whole calculations have been upset by not discovering the packet upon his person he was on his way to downing street when our agents intervened and we never doubted that he would have it with him when will it be convenient for you to pay your visit  at any time you send for me the bishop replied meanwhile mr fenn before i leave i want to remind you once more of the original purpose of my call upon you  fenn frowned a little peevishly as he rose to usher his visitor out  miss abbeway has already extorted a foolish promise from us he said the young mans safety for the present is not in question  the bishop more from custom than from any appetite walked across the park to the athenaeum mr hannaway wells accosted him in the hall  this is a world of rumours he remarked with a smile i have just heard that julian orden of all men in the world has been shot as a german spy  the bishop smiled with dignity  you may take it from me he said gravely that the rumour is untrue     chapter xi   nicholas fenn although civilisation had laid a heavy hand upon him during the last few years was certainly not a man whose outward appearance denoted any advance in either culture or taste his morning clothes although he had recently abandoned the habit of dealing at a readymade emporium were neither well chosen nor well worn his evening attire was if possible worse he met catherine that evening in the lobby of what he believed to be a fashionable grillroom in a swallowtailed coat a badly fitting shirt with a single studhole a black tie a collar which encircled his neck like a clerical band and ordinary walking boots she repressed a little shiver as she shook hands and tried to remember that this was not only the man whom several millions of toilers had chosen to be their representative but also the duly appointed secretary of the most momentous assemblage of human beings in the worlds history  i hope i am not late she said i really do not care much about dining out these days but your message was so insistent  one must have relaxation he declared the weight of affairs all day long is a terrible strain shall we go in  they entered the room and stood looking aimlessly about them fenn having naturally enough failed to realise the necessity of securing a table a maitre dhotel however recognised catherine and hastened to their rescue she conversed with the man for a few minutes in french while her companion listened admiringly and finally at his solicitation herself ordered the dinner  the news please mr fenn she asked as soon as the man had withdrawn  news he repeated oh lets leave it alone for a time one gets sick of shop  she raised her eyebrows a little discouragingly she was dressed with extraordinary simplicity but the difference in caste between the two supplied a problem for many curious observers  why should we talk of trifles she demanded when we both have such a great interest in the most wonderful subject in the world  what is the most wonderful subject in the world he asked impressively  our cause of course she answered firmly the cause of all the peoplespeace  one labours the whole day long for that he grumbled when the hour for rest comes surely one may drop it for a time  do you feel like that she remarked indifferently for myself during these days i have but one thought there is nothing else in my life and you with all those thousands and millions of your fellow creatures toiling watching and waiting for a sign from youoh i cant imagine how your thoughts can ever wander from them for a moment how you can ever remember that self even exists i should like to be trusted mr fenn as you are trusted  my work he said complacently has i hope justified that trust  naturally she assented and yet the greatest part of it is to come tell me about mr orden  there is no change in the fellows attitude i dont imagine there will be until the last moment he is just a pigheaded insufferably conceited englishman full of class prejudices to his finger tips  he is nevertheless a man she said thoughtfully i heard only yesterday that he earned considerable distinction even in his brief soldiering  no doubt fenn remarked without enthusiasm he has the bravery of an animal by the bye the bishop dropped in to see me this morning  really she asked what did he want  just a personal call was the elaborately careless reply he likes to look in for a chat now and then he spoke about orden too i persuaded him that if we dont succeed within the next twenty four hours it will be his duty to see what he can do  oh but that was too bad she declared you know how he feels his position poor man he will simply loathe having to tell julianmr orden i mean that he is connected with  well with what miss abbeway  with anything in the nature of a conspiracy of course mr orden wouldnt understand how could he i think it was cruel to bring the bishop into the matter at all  nothing fenn pronounced is cruel that helps the cause what will you drink miss abbeway youll have some champagne wont you  what a horrible idea she exclaimed smiling at him nevertheless fancy a great labour leader suggesting such a thing no ill have some light french wine thank you  fenn passed the order on to the waiter a little crestfallen  i dont often drink anything myself he said but this seemed to me to be something of an occasion  you have some news then  not at all i meant dining with you  she raised her eyebrows  oh that she murmured that is simply a matter of routine i thought you had some news or some work  isnt it possible miss abbeway he pleaded that we might have some interests outside our work  i shouldnt think so she answered with an insolence which was above his head  there is no reason why we shouldnt have he persisted  you must tell me your tastes she suggested are you fond of grand opera for instance i adore it parsifalthe ring  i dont know much about music he admitted my sister who used to live with me plays the piano  well drop music then she said hastily books but i remember you once told me that you had never read anything except detective novels and that you didnt care for poetry sports i adore tennis and i am rather good at golf  i have never wasted a single moment of my life in games he declared proudly  she shrugged her shoulders  well you see that leaves us rather a long way apart outside our work doesnt it  even if i were prepared to admit that which i am not he replied our work itself is surely enough to make up for all other things  you are quite right she confessed there is nothing else worth thinking about worth talking about tell meyou had an inner council this afternoonis anything decided yet about the leadership  he sighed a little  if ever there was a great cause in the world he said which stands some chance of missing complete success through senseless and lowminded jealousy it is ours  mr fenn she exclaimed  i mean it he assured her as you know a chairman must be elected this week and that chairman of course will hold more power in his hand than any emperor of the past or any sovereign of the present that leader is going to stop the war he is going to bring peace to the world it is a mighty post miss abbeway  it is indeed she agreed  yet would you believe he went on leaning across the table and neglecting for a moment his dinner would you believe miss abbeway that out of the twenty representatives chosen from the trades unions governing the principal industries of great britain there is not a single one who does not consider himself eligible for the post  catherine found herself suddenly laughing while fenn looked at her in astonishment  i cannot help it she apologised please forgive me do not think that i am irreverent it is not that at all but for a moment the absurdity of the thing overcame me i have met some of them you knowmr cross of northumberland mr evans of south wales  evans is one of the worst fenn interrupted with some excitement theres a man who has only worn a collar for the last few years of his life who evaded the boardschool because he was a pitmans lad who doesnt even know the names of the countries of europe but who still believes that he is a possible candidate and cross too well he washes when he comes to london but he sleeps in his clothes and they look like it  he is very eloquent catherine observed  eloquent fenn exclaimed scornfully he may be but who can understand him he speaks in broad northumbrian what is needed in the leader whom they are to elect this week miss abbeway is a man of some culture and some appearance remember that to him is to be confided the greatest task ever given to man a certain amount of personality he must havepersonality and dignity i should say to uphold the position  there is mr miles furley she said thoughtfully he is an educated man is he not  for that very reason unsuitable fenn explained eagerly he represents no great body of toilers he is in reality only an honorary member of the council like yourself and the bishop there on account of his outside services  i remember only a few nights ago she reflected i was staying at a country houselord maltenbys by the byemr ordens father the prime minister was there and another cabinet minister they spoke of the labour party and its leaderless state they had no idea of course of the great council which was already secretly formed but they were unanimous about the necessity for a strong leader two people made the same remark almost with apprehension if ever paul fiske should materialise the problem would be solved  fenn assented without enthusiasm  after all though he reminded her a clever writer does not always make a great speaker nor has he always that personality and distinction which is required in this case he would come amongst us a stranger tooa stranger personally that is to say  not in the broadest sense of the word catherine objected paul fiske is more than an ordinary literary man his heart is in tune with what he writes those are not merely eloquent words which he offers there is a note of something above and beyond just phrasemakinga note of sympathetic understanding which amounts to genius  her companion stroked his moustache for a moment  fiske goes right to the spot he admitted but the question of the leadership so far as he is concerned doesnt come into the sphere of practical politics it has been suggested miss abbeway by one or two of the more influential delegates suggested too by a vast number of letters and telegrams which have poured in upon us during the last few days that i should be elected to this vacant post  you she exclaimed a little blankly  can you think of a more suitable person he asked with a faint note of truculence in his tone you have seen us all together i dont wish to flatter myself but as regards education service to the cause familiarity with public speaking and the number of those i represent  yes yes i see she interrupted taking the twenty labour representatives only mr fenn i can see nothing against your selection but i fancied somehow that some one outsidethe bishop for instance  absolutely out of the question fenn declared the people would lose faith in the whole thing in a minute the person who throws down the gage to the prime minister must have the direct mandate of the people  they finished dinner presently fenn looked with admiration at the gold coroneted case from which catherine helped herself to one of her tiny cigarettes he himself lit an american cigarette  i had meant miss abbeway he confided leaning towards her to suggest a theatre to you tonightin fact i looked at some dress circle seats at the gaiety with a view to purchasing another matter has cropped up however there is a little business for us to do  business catherine repeated  he produced a folded paper from his pocket and passed it across the table catherine read it with a slight frown  an order entitling the bearer to search julian ordens apartments she exclaimed we dont want to search them do we besides what authority have we  the best he answered tapping with his discoloured forefinger the signature at the foot of the strip of paper  she examined it with a doubtful frown  but how did this come into your possession she asked  he smiled at her in superior fashion  by asking for it he replied bluntly and between you and me miss abbeway there isnt much we might ask for that theyd care to refuse us just now  but the police have already searched mr ordens rooms she reminded him  the police have been known to overlook things of course what i am hoping is that amongst mr ordens papers there may be some indication as to where he has deposited our property  but this has nothing to do with me she protested i do not like to be concerned in such affairs  but i particularly wish you to accompany me he urged you are the only one who has seen the packet it would be better therefore if we conducted the search in company  catherine made a little grimace but she objected no further she objected very strongly however when fenn tried to take her arm on leaving the place and she withdrew into her own corner of the taxi immediately they had taken their seats  you must forgive my prejudices mr fenn she saidmy foreign bringing up perhapsbut i hate being touched  oh come he remonstrated no need to be so standoffish  he tried to hold her hand an attempt which she skilfully frustrated  really she insisted earnestly this sort of thing does not amuse me i avoid it even amongst my own friends  am i not a friend he demanded  so far as regards our work you certainly are she admitted outside it i do not think that we could ever have much to say to one another  why not he objected a little sharply were as close together in our work and aims as any two people could be perhaps he went on after a moments hesitation and a careful glance around i ought to take you into my confidence as regards my personal position  i am not inviting anything of the sort she observed with faint but wasted sarcasm  you know me of course he went on only as the late manager of a firm of timber merchants and the present elected representative of the allied timber and shipbuilding trades unions what you do not knowa queer note of triumph stealing into his tone is that i am a wealthy man  she raised her eyebrows  i imagined she remarked that all labour leaders were like the apostlestook no thought for such things  one must always keep ones eye on the main chance miss abbeway he protested or how would things be when one came to think of marriage for instance  where did your money come from she asked bluntly  her question was framed simply to direct him from a repulsive subject his embarrassment however afforded her food for future thought  i have saved money all my life he confided eagerly an uncle left me a little lately i have speculatedsuccessfully i dont want to dwell on this i only wanted you to understand that if i chose i could cut a very different figurethat my wife wouldnt have to live in a suburb  i really do not see was the cold response how this concerns me in the least  you call yourself a socialist dont you miss abbeway he demanded youre not allowing the fact that youre an aristocrat and that i am a selfmade man to weigh with you  the accident of birth counts for nothing she replied you must know that those are my principlesbut it sometimes happens that birth and environment give one tastes which it is impossible to ignore please do not let us pursue this conversation any further mr fenn we have had a very pleasant dinner for which i thank youand here we are at mr ordens flat  her companion handed her out a little sulkily and they ascended in the lift to the fifth floor the door was opened to them by julians servant he recognised catherine and greeted her respectfully fenn produced his authority which the man accepted without comment  no news of your master yet catherine asked him  none at all madam was the somewhat depressed admission i am afraid that something must have happened to him he was not the kind of gentleman to go away like this and leave no word behind him  still she advised cheerfully i shouldnt despair more wonderful things have happened than that your master should return home tomorrow or the next day with a perfectly simple explanation of his absence  i should be very glad to see him madam the man replied as he backed towards the door if i can be of any assistance perhaps you will ring  the valet departed closing the door behind him catherine looked around the room into which they had been ushered with a little frown it was essentially a mans sitting room but it was well and tastefully furnished and she was astonished at the immense number of books pamphlets and reviews which crowded the walls and every available space the derby desk still stood open there was a typewriter on a special stand and a pile of manuscript paper  what on earth she murmured could mr orden have wanted with a typewriter i thought journalism was generally done in the offices of a newspaperthe sort of journalism that he used to undertake  nice little crib isnt it fenn remarked glancing around cosy little place i call it  something in the mans expression as he advanced towards her brought all the iciness back to her tone and manner  it is a pleasant apartment she said but i am not at all sure that i like being here and i certainly dislike our errand it does not seem credible that if the police have already searched we should find the packet here  the police dont know what to look for he reminded her we do  there was apparently very little delicacy about mr fenn he drew a chair to the desk and began to look through a pile of papers making running comments as he did so  hm our friend seems to have been quite a collector of old books i expect secondhand booksellers found him rather a mark some fellow here thanking him for a loan and heres a tailors bill by jove miss abbeway just listen to this one dress suitfourteen guineas thats the way these fellows who dont know any better chuck their money about he added swinging around in his chair towards her the clothes i have on cost me exactly four pounds fifteen cash and i guarantee his were no better  catherine frowned impatiently  we did not come here did we mr fenn to discuss mr ordens tailors bill i can see no object at all in going through his correspondence in this way what you have to search for is a packet wrapped up in thin yellow oilskin with number 17 on the outside in black ink  oh he might have slipped it in anywhere fenn pointed out besides theres always a chance that one of his letters may give us a clue as to where he has hidden the document come and sit down by the side of me wont you miss abbeway do  i would rather stand thank you she replied you seem to find your present occupation to your taste i should loathe it  never think of my own feelings fenn said briskly when theres a job to be done i wish youd be a bit more friendly though miss abbeway let me pull that chair up by the side of mine i like to have you near you know ive been a bachelor for a good many years he went on impressively but a little homey place like this always makes me think of things ive nothing against marriage if only a man can be lucky enough to get the right sort of girl and although advanced thinkers like you and me and some of the others are looking at things differently nowadays i wouldnt mind much which way it was he confided dropping his voice a little and laying his hand upon her arm if you could make up your mind  she snatched her arm away and this time even he could not mistake the anger which blazed in her eyes  mr fenn she exclaimed why is it so difficult to make you understand i detest such liberties as you are permitting yourself and for the rest my affections are already engaged  sounds a bit oldfashioned that he remarked scowling a little of course i dont expect  never mind what you expect she interrupted please go on with this search if you are going to make one at all the vulgarity of the whole thing annoys me and i do not for a moment suppose that the packet is here  it wasnt on orden he reminded her sullenly  then he must have sent it somewhere for safe keeping she replied i had already given him cause to do so  if he has then amongst his correspondence there may be some indication as to where he sent it fenn pointed out with unabated illtemper if you dont like the job and you wont be friendly youd better take the easychair and wait till im through  she sat down watching him with angry eyes uncomfortable unhappy humiliated she seemed to have dropped in a few hours from the realms of rarefied and splendid thought to a world of petty deeds not one of her companions actions was lost upon her she watched him study with illconcealed reverence a ducal invitation saw him read through without hesitation a letter which she felt sure was from julians mother and then  the change in the man was so startling his muttered exclamationso natural that its profanity never even grated his eyes seemed to be starting out of his head his lips were drawn back from his teeth blank unutterable surprise held him dumb and spellbound as he stared at a halfsheet of type written notepaper she herself amazed at his transformed appearance found words for the moment impossible then a queer change came into his expression his eyebrows drew closer together his lips turned malevolently he pushed the paper underneath a pile of others and turned his head towards her their eyes met there was something like fear in his  what is it that you have found she cried breathlessly  nothing he answered nothing of any importance  she rose slowly to her feet and came towards him  i am your partner in this hateful enterprise she reminded him show me that paper which you have just concealed  he laid his hand on the lid of the desk but she caught it and held it open  i insist upon seeing it she said firmly  he turned and faced her there was a most unpleasant light in his eyes  and i say that you shall not he declared  there was a brief intense silence each seemed to be measuring the others strength of the two catherine was the more composed fenns face was still white and strained his lips were twitching his manner nervous and jerky he made a desperate effort to reestablish ordinary relations  look here miss abbeway he said we dont need to quarrel about this that paper i came across has a special interest for me personally i want to think about it before i say anything to a soul in the world  you can consult with me she persisted our aims are the same we are here for the same purpose  not altogether he objected i brought you here as my assistant  did you  well have the truth then he exclaimed i brought you here to be alone with you because i hoped that i might find you a little kinder  i am afraid you have been disappointed havent you she asked sweetly  i have he answered with unpleasant meaning in his tone but we are not out of here yet  you cannot frighten me she assured him of course you are a manof a sortand i am a woman but i do not fancy that you would find if it came to force that you would have much of an advantage however we are wandering from the point i claim an equal right with you to see anything which you may discover in mr ordens papers i might indeed if i chose claim a prior right  indeed he answered with an ugly scowl on his face mr julian orden is by way of being a particular friend eh  as a matter of fact catherine told him we are engaged to be married it isnt a serious engagement it was entered into by him in a most chivalrous manner to save me from the consequences of a very clumsy attempt on my part to get back that packet but there it is every one down at his home believes at the present moment that we are engaged and that i have come up to london to see our ambassador  if you are engaged fenn sneered why hasnt he told you more of his secrets  secrets she repeated a little scornfully i shouldnt think he has any i should imagine his daily life could be investigated without the least fear  youd imagine wrong then  but how interesting you excite my curiosity and must you continue to hold my wrist  let me pull down the top of this desk then  no  why not  i intend to examine those papers  with a quick movement he gained a momentary advantage and shut the desk down the key however disturbed by the jerk fell on to the carpet and catherine possessed herself of it she sprang lightly back from him and pressed the bell  dn you what are you going to do now he demanded  you will see she replied dont come any nearer or you may find that i can be unpleasant  he shrugged his shoulders and waited she turned towards the servant who presently appeared  robert she said will you telephone for me  certainly madam the man answered  telephone to 1884 westminster say that you are speaking for miss abbeway and ask mr furley mr cross or whoever is there to come at once to this address  look here theres no sense in that fenn interrupted  will you do as i ask please robert she persisted  the man bowed and left the room fenn strode sulkily back to the desk  very well then he conceded i give in give me the key and ill show you the letter  you intend to keep your word  i do he assured her  she held out the key he took it opened the desk searched amongst the little pile of papers drew out the halfsheet of notepaper and handed it to her  there you are he said although if you are really engaged to marry mr julian orden he added with disagreeable emphasis i am surprised that he should have kept such a secret from you  she ignored him and started to read the letter glancing first at the address at the top it was from the british review and was dated a few days back  my dear orden  i think it best to let you know in case you havent seen it yourself that there is a reward of 100 pounds offered by some busybody for the name of the author of the paul fiske articles your anonymity has been splendidly preserved up till now but i feel compelled to warn you that a disclosure is imminent take my advice and accept it with a good grace you have established yourself so irrevocably now that the value of your work will not be lessened by the discovery of the fact that you yourself do not belong to the class of whom you have written so brilliantly  i hope to see you in a few days  sincerely  m halkin  even after she had concluded the letter she still stared at it she read again the one conclusive sentenceyour anonymity has been splendidly preserved up till now then she suddenly broke into a laugh which was almost hysterical  so this is his hack journalism she exclaimed julian ordenpaul fiske  i dont wonder youre surprised fenn observed fourteen guineas for a dress suit and he thinks he understands the working man  she turned her head slowly and looked at him there was a strange repressed fire in her eyes you are a very foolish person she said your parents i suppose were small shopkeepers or something of the sort and you were brought up at a boardschool and julian orden at eton and oxford and yet he understands and you do not you see heart counts and sympathy and the flair for understanding i doubt whether these things are really found where you come from  he caught up his hat his face was very white his tone shook with anger  this is our own fault he exclaimed angrily for having ever permitted an aristocrat to hold any place in our counsels before we move a step further well purge them of such helpers as you and such false friends as julian orden  you very foolish person she repeated stop though why all this mystery why did you try to keep that letter from me  i conceived it to be for the benefit of our cause he said didactically that the anonymityof paul fiske should be preserved  rubbish she scoffed you were afraid of him why what fools we are we will tell him the whole truth we will tell him of our great scheme we will tell him what we have been working for these many months the bishop shall tell him and you and i and miles furley and cross he shall hear all about it he is with us he must be with us you shall put him on the council why there is your great difficulty solved she went on in growing excitement there is not a working man in the country who would not rally under paul fiskes banner there you have your leader it is he who shall deliver your ultimatum  im damned if it is fenn declared suddenly throwing his hat down and coming towards her furiously im  the door opened robert stood there  the message madam he beganand then stopped short she crossed the room towards him  robert she said i think i have found the way to bring your master back to you will you take me downstairs please and fetch me a taxi  certainly madam  she looked back from the threshold  i shall telephone to westminster in a few minutes mr fenn she said i hope i shall be in time to stop the others from coming perhaps you had better wait here in case they have already started  he made no reply to catherine the world had become so wonderful that his existence scarcely counted     chapter xii   catherine notwithstanding her own excitement found genuine pleasure in the bewildered enthusiasm with which the bishop received her astounding news she found him alone in the great gloomy house which he usually inhabited when in london at work in a dreary library to which she was admitted after a few minutes delay naturally he received her tidings at first almost with incredulity a heartfelt joy however followed upon conviction  i always liked julian he declared i always believed that he had capacity dear me though he went on with a whimsical little smile what a blow for the earl  catherine laughed  do you remember the evening we all talked about the labour question time seems to have moved so rapidly lately but it was scarcely a week ago  i remember the bishop acknowledged and my dear young lady he went on warmly now indeed i feel that i can offer you congratulations which come from my heart  she turned a little away  dont she begged you would have known very soon in any casemy engagement to julian orden was only a pretence  a pretence  i was desperate she explained i felt i must have that packet back at any price i went to his rooms to try and steal it well i was found there he invented our engagement to help me out  but you went off to london together the neat day the bishop reminded her  it was all part of the game she sighed what a fool he must have thought me however i am glad i am riotously madly glad i am glad for the cause i am glad for all our sakes we have a great recruit bishop the greatest we could have and think when he knows the truth there will be no more trouble he will hand us over the packet we shall know just where we stand we shall know at once whether we dare to strike the great blow  i was down at westminster this afternoon the bishop told her the whole mechanism of the council of labour seems to be complete twenty men control industrial england they have absolute power they are waiting only for the missing word and fancy he went on tomorrow i was to have visited julian i was to have used my persuasions  but we must go tonight catherine exclaimed there is no reason why we should waste a single second  i shall be only too pleased he assented gladly where is he  catherines face fell  i havent the least idea she confessed dont you know  the bishop shook his head  they were going to send some one with me tomorrow he replied but in any case fenn knows we can get at him  she made a little wry face  i do not like mr fenn she said slowly i have disagreed with him but that does not matter perhaps we had better go to the council rooms we shall find some of them there and probably fenn i have a taxi waiting  they drove presently to westminster the ground floor of the great building which was wholly occupied now by the offices of the different labour men was mostly in darkness but on the top floor was a big room used as a club and restaurant and also for informal meetings six or seven of the twentythree were there but not fenn cross a great brawny northumbrian was playing a game of chess with furley others were writing letters they all turned around at catherines entrance she held out her hands to them  great news my friends she exclaimed light up the committee room i want to talk to you  those who were entitled to followed her into the room across the passage one or two secretaries and a visitor remained outside six of them seated themselves at the long tablephineas cross the northumbrian pitman miles furley david sands representative of a million yorkshire millhands thomas evans the south wales miner  we got a message from you miss abbeway a little time ago furley remarked it was countermanded though just as we were ready to start  yes she assented i am sorry i telephoned from julian ordens rooms it was there we made the great discovery listen all of you i have discovered the identity of paul fiske  there was a little clamour of voices the interest was indescribable paul fiske was their cult their master their undeniable prophet it was he who had set down in letters of fire the truths which had been struggling for imperfect expression in these mens minds it was paul fiske who had fired them with enthusiasm for the cause which at first had been very much like a matter of bread and cheese to them it was paul fiske who had formed their minds who had put the great arguments into their brains who had armed them from head to foot with potent reasonings four very ordinary men of varying types sincere men all of plebeian extraction all with their faults yet all united in one purpose were animated by that same fire of excitement they hung over the table towards her she might have been the croupier and they the gamblers who had thrown upon the table their last stake  in julian ordens rooms she said i found a letter from the editor of the british review warning him that his anonymity could not be preserved much longerthat before many weeks had passed the world would know that he was paul fiske here is the letter  she passed it around they studied it one by one they were all a little stunned  julian furley exclaimed in blank amazement why hes been pulling my leg for more than a year  the son of an earl cross gasped  never mind about that he is a democrat and honest to the backbone catherine declared the bishop will tell you so he has known him all his life think julian orden has no purpose to serve no selfish interest to further he has nothing to gain everything to lose if he were not sincere if those words of his which we all remember did not come from his heart where could be the excuse the reason for what he stands for think what it means to us  he is the man isnt he sands asked mysteriously whom they are looking after down yonder  i dont know where down yonder is catherine replied but you have him in your power somewhere he left his rooms last thursday at about a quarter past six to take that packet to the foreign office or to make arrangements for its being received there he never reached the foreign office he hasnt been heard of since some of you know where he is the bishop and i want to go and find him at once  fenn and bright know cross declared its brights job  why is bright in it catherine asked impatiently  cross frowned and puckered up his lips an odd trick of his when he was displeased  bright represents the workers in chemical factories he explained they say that there isnt a poison in liquid solid or gas form that he doesnt know all about chap who gives me kind of shivers whenever he comes near he and fenn run the secret service branch of the council  if he knows where mr orden is couldnt we send for him at once catherine suggested  ill go furley volunteered  he was back in a few minutes  fenn and bright are both out he announced and their rooms locked up i rang up fenns house but he hasnt been back  catherine stamped her foot she was on fire with impatience  doesnt it seem too bad she exclaimed if we could only get hold of julian orden tonight if the bishop and i could talk to him for five minutes we could have this message for which we have been waiting so long  the door was suddenly opened fenn entered and received a little chorus of welcome he was wearing a rough black overcoat over his evening clothes and a black bowler hat he advanced to the table with a little familiar swagger  mr fenn the bishop said we have been awaiting your arrival anxiously tell us please where we can find mr julian orden  fenn gave vent to a halfchoked ironical laugh  if youd asked me an hour ago he said i should have told you to try iris villa acacia road hampstead i have just come from there  you saw him the bishop enquired  thats just what i did not fenn replied  why not catherine demanded  because he wasnt there hasnt been since three oclock this afternoon  youve moved him furley asked eagerly  hes moved himself was the grim reply hes escaped  during the brief spellbound silence which followed his announcement fenn advanced slowly into the room it chanced that during their informal discussion the chair at the head of the table had been left unoccupied the newcomer hesitated for a single second then removed his hat laid it on the floor by his side and sank into the vacant seat he glanced somewhat defiantly towards catherine he seemed to know quite well from whence the challenge of his words would come  you tell us catherine said mastering her emotion with an effort that julian orden whom we now know to be paul fiske has escaped just what do you mean  i can scarcely reduce my statement to plainer words fenn replied but i will try the danger in which we stood through the miscarriage of that packet was appreciated by every one of the council discretionary powers were handed to the small secret service branch which is controlled by bright and myself orden was prevented from reaching the foreign office and was rendered for a time incapable the consideration of our further action with regard to him was to depend upon his attitude owing no doubt to some slight error in brights treatment orden has escaped from the place of safety in which he had been placed he is now at large and his story together with the packet will probably be in the hands of the foreign office some time tonight  giving them cross remarked grimly the chance to get in the first blowwarrants for high treason eh against the twentythree of us  i dont fear that fenn asserted not if we behave like sensible men my proposal is that we anticipate that one of us sees the prime minister tomorrow morning and lays the whole position before him  without the terms furley observed  i know exactly what they will be fenn pointed out the trouble of course is that the missing packet contains the signature of the three guarantors the packet no doubt will be in the hands of the foreign office by tomorrow the prime minister can verify our statements we present our ultimatum a little sooner than we intended but we get our blow in first and we are ready  the bishop leaned forward in his place  forgive me if i intervene for one moment he begged you say that julian orden has escaped are we to understand that he is absolutely at liberty and in a normal state of health  fenn hesitated for a single second  i have no reason to believe the contrary he said  still it is possible the bishop persisted that julian orden may not be in a position to forward that document to the foreign office for the present if that is so i am inclined to think that the prime minister would consider your visit a bluff certainly you would have no argument weighty enough to induce him to propose the armistice no man could act upon your word alone he would want to see these wonderful proposals in writing even if he were convinced of the justice of your arguments  there was a little murmur of approval fenn leaned forward  you drive me to a further disclosure he declared after a moments hesitation one perhaps which i ought already to have made i have arranged for a duplicate of that packet to be prepared and forwarded i set this matter on foot the moment we heard from miss abbeway here of her mishap the duplicate may reach us at any moment  then i propose the bishop said that we postpone our decision until those papers be received remember that up to the present moment the council have not pledged themselves to take action until they have perused that document  and supposing fenn objected that tomorrow morning at eight oclock twentythree of us are marched off to the tower our whole cause may be paralysed all that we have worked for all these months will be in vain and this accursed and bloody war may be dragged on until our politicians see fit to make a peace of words  i know mr stenson well the bishop declared and i am perfectly convinced that he is too saneminded a man to dream of taking such a step as you suggest he at any rate if others in his cabinet are not so prescient knows what labour means  i agree with the bishop for many reasons furley pronounced  and i cross echoed  the sense of the meeting was obvious fenns unpleasant looking teeth flashed for a moment and his mouth came together with a little snap  this is entirely an informal gathering he said i shall summon the council to come together tomorrow at midday  i think that we may sleep in our beds tonight without fear of molestation the bishop remarked although if it had been the wish of the meeting i would have broached the matter to mr stenson  you are an honorary member of the council fenn declared rudely we dont wish interference this is a national and international labour movement  i am a member of the labour party of christ the bishop said quietly  and an honoured member of this executive council cross intervened youre a bit too glib with your tongue tonight fenn  i think of those whom i represent was the curt reply they are toilers and they want the toilers to show their power they dont want help from the church ill go even so far he added as to say that they dont want help from literature its their own job theyve begun it and they want to finish it  tomorrows meeting furley observed will show how far you are right in your views i consider my position and the bishops as members of the labour party on a par with your own i will go further and say that the very soul of our council is embodied in the teachings and the writings of paul fiske or as we now know him to be julian orden  fenn rose to his feet he was trembling with passion  this informal meeting is adjourned he announced harshly  cross himself did not move  adjourned or not it may be mr fenn he said but its no place of yours to speak for it youve thrust yourself into that chair but that dont make you chairman now or at any other time  fenn choked down the words which had seemed to tremble on his lips his enemies he knew but there were others here who might yet be neutral  if i have assumed more than i should have done i am sorry he said i brought you news which i was in a hurry to deliver the rest followed  the little company rose to their feet and moved towards the door exchanging whispered comments concerning the news which catherine had brought she herself crossed the room and confronted fenn  there is still something to be said about that news she declared  fenns attempt at complete candour was only partially convincing  there is not the slightest reason he declared why anything concerning julian orden should be concealed from any member of the council who desires information if you will follow me into my private room miss abbeway and you furley i shall be glad to tell you our exact position and if the bishop will accompany you he added turning to the latter i shall be honoured  furley made no reply but whispering something in catherines ear took up his hat and left the room the other two however took fenn at his word followed him into his room accepted the chairs which he placed for them and waited while he spoke through a telephone to the private exchange situated in the building  they tell me he announced as he laid down the instrument that bright has this moment returned and is now on his way upstairs  catherine shivered  is mr bright that awfullooking person who came to the last council meeting  he is probably the person you mean fenn assented he takes very little interest in our executive work but he is one of the most brilliant scientists of this or any other generation the government has already given him three laboratories for his experiments and nearly every gas that is being used at the front has been prepared according to his formula  a master of horrors the bishop murmured  he looks it catherine whispered under her breath  there was a knock at the door a moment or two later and bright entered he was a little over medium height with long and lanky figure a pronounced stoop and black curly hair of coarse quality his head which was thrust a little forward perhaps owing to his shortsightedness was long his forehead narrow his complexion a sort of olivegreen he wore huge disfiguring spectacles and he had the protuberant lips of a negro he greeted catherine and the bishop absently and seemed to have a grievance against fenn  what is it you want nicholas he asked impatiently i have some experiments going on in the country and can only spare a minute  the council has rescinded its instructions with regard to julian orden fenn announced and is anxious to have him brought before them at once as you know we are for the moment powerless in the matter will you please explain to miss abbeway and the bishop here just what has been done  it seems a waste of time bright replied illnaturedly but here is the story julian orden left his rooms at a quarter to six on thursday evening he walked down to st jamess street and turned into the park just as he passed the side door of marlborough house he was attacked by a sudden faintness  for which i suppose the bishop interrupted you were responsible  i or my deputy bright replied it doesnt matter which he was fortunate enough to be able to hail a passing taxicab and was driven to my house in hampstead he has spent the intervening period until three oclock this afternoon in a small laboratory attached to the premises  a compulsory stay i presume the bishop ventured  a compulsory stay arranged for under instructions from the council bright assented in his hard rasping voice he has been most of the time under the influence of some new form of anaesthetic gas with which i have been experimenting tonight however i must have made a mistake in my calculations instead of remaining in a state of coma until midnight he recovered during my absence and appears to have walked out of the place  you have no idea where he is at the present moment then catherine asked  not the slightest bright assured her i only know that he left the place without hat gloves or walking stick otherwise he was fully dressed and no doubt had plenty of money in his pocket  is he likely to have any return of the indisposition from which owing to your efforts he has been suffering the bishop enquired  i should say not was the curt answer he may find his memory somewhat affected temporarily he ought to be able to find his way home though if not i suppose youll hear of him through the police courts or a hospital nothing that we have done he added after a moments pause is likely to affect his health permanently in the slightest degree  you now know all that there is to be known miss abbeway fenn said i agree with you that it is highly desirable that mr orden should be found at once and if you can suggest any way in which i might be of assistance in discovering his present whereabouts i shall be only too glad to help for instance would you like me to telephone to his rooms  catherine rose to her feet  thank you mr fenn she said i dont think that we will trouble you mr furley is making enquiries both at mr ordens rooms and at his clubs  you are perfectly satisfied so far as i am concerned i trust he persisted as he opened the door for them  perfectly satisfied catherine replied looking him in the face that you have told us as much as you choose to for the present  fenn closed the door behind catherine and the bishop and turned back into the room bright laughed at him unpleasantly  love affair not going so strong eh  fenn threw himself into his chair took a cigarette from a paper packet and lit it  blast julian orden he muttered  no objection his friend yawned whats wrong now  havent you heard the news it seems hes the fellow who has been writing those articles on socialism and labour signing them paul fiske idealistic rubbish but of course the bishop and his lot are raving about him  ive read some of his stuff bright admitted himself lighting a cigarette good in its way but oldfashioned im out for something a little more than that  stick to the point fenn enjoined morosely now theyve found out who julian orden is they want him produced they want to elect him on the council make him chairman over all our heads let him reap the reward of the scheme which our brains have conceived  they want him eh thats awkward  awkward for us fenn muttered  theyd better have him i suppose bright said with slow and evil emphasis yes theyd better have him well take off our hats and assure him that it was a mistake  too late ive told miss abbeway and the bishop that he is at large you backed me up  bright thrust his long unpleasant knobby fingers into his pocket and produced a crumpled cigarette which he lit from the end of his companions  well he demanded what do you want  i have come to the conclusion fenn decided that it is not in the interests of our cause that orden should become associated with it in any way  weve a good deal of power bright ruminated but it seems to me youre inclined to stretch it i gather that the others want him delivered up we cant act against them  not if they know fenn answered significantly  bright came over to the mantelpiece leaned his elbow upon it and hung his extraordinarily unattractive face down towards his companions  nicholas he said i dont blame you for fencing but i like plain words youve done well out of this new party i havent youve no hobby except saving your money i have my last two experiments notwithstanding the government allowance have left me drained i need money as you others need bread i can live without food or drink but i cant be without the means to keep my laboratories going do you understand me  i do fenn assented taking up his hat come ill drive towards bermondsey with you well talk on the way     chapter xiii   julian raised himself slightly from his recumbent position at the sound of the opening of the door he watched fenn with dull incurious eyes as the latter crossed the uncarpeted floor of the bare wooden shed threw off his overcoat and advanced towards the side of the couch  sit up a little the newcomer directed  julian shook his head  no strength he muttered if i had i should wring your damned neck  fenn looked down at him for a moment in silence  you take this thing very hardly mr orden he said i think that you had better give up this obstinacy your friends are getting anxious about you for many reasons it would be better for you to reappear  there will be a little anxiety on the part of your friends about you julian retorted grimly if ever i do get out of this accursed place  you bear malice i fear mr orden  julian made no reply his eyes were fixed upon the door he turned away with a shudder bright had entered in his hand he was carrying two gas masks he came over to the side of the couch and looking down at julian lifted his hand and felt his pulse then with an abrupt movement he handed one of the masks to fenn  look out for yourself he advised i am going to give him an antidote  bright stepped back and adjusted his own gas mask while fenn followed suit then the former drew from his pocket what seemed to be a small tube with perforated holes at the top he leaned over julian and pressed it a little cloud of faint mist rushed through the holes a queer aromatic perfume growing stronger every moment seemed to creep into the farthest corners of the room in less than ten seconds julian opened his eyes in half a minute he was sitting up his eyes were bright once more there was colour in his cheeks bright spoke to him warningly  mr orden he enjoined sit where you are remember i have the other tube in my left hand  you infernal scoundrel julian exclaimed  mr bright fenn asserted is nothing of the sort neither am i we are both honest men faced with a colossal situation there is nothing personal in our treatment of you we have no enmity towards you you are simply a person who has committed a theft  what puzzles me julian muttered is what you expect i am going to do about you if ever i do escape from your clutches  if you do escape fenn said quietly you will view the matter differently you will find as a matter of fact that you are powerless to do anything you will find a new law and a new order prevailing  german law julian sneered  you misjudge us fenn continued both bright and i are patriotic englishmen we are engaged at the present moment in a desperate effort to save our country you are the man who stands in the way  i never thought said julian that i should smile in this place but you are beginning to amuse me why not be more explicit why not prove what you say i might become amenable i suppose your way of saving the country is to hand it over to the germans eh  our way of saving the country fenn declared is to establish peace  julian laughed scornfully  i know a little about you mr fenn he said i know the sort of peace you would establish the sort of peace any man would propose who conducts a secret correspondence with germany  fenn who had lifted his mask for a moment slowly rearranged it  mr orden he said we are not going to waste words upon you you are hopelessly and intolerably prejudiced will you tell us where you have concealed the packet you intercepted  arent you almost tired of asking me that question im tired of hearing it julian replied i will not  will you let me try to prove to you fenn begged that by the retention of that packet you are doing your country an evil service  if you talked till doomsday julian assured him i should not believe a word you said  in that case fenn began slowly with an evil glitter in his eyes  well for heavens sake finish the thing this time julian interrupted im sick of playing the laboratory rabbit for you if you are out for murder finish the job and have done with it  bright was playing with another tube which he had withdrawn from his pocket  it is my duty to warn you mr orden he said that the contents of this little tube of gas which will reach you with a touch of my fingers may possibly be fatal and will certainly incapacitate you for life  why warn me julian scoffed you know very well that i havent the strength of a cat or i should wring your neck  we feel ourselves bright continued unctuously justified in using this tube because its first results will be to throw you into a delirium in the course of which we trust that you will divulge the hiding place of the stolen packet we use this means in the interests of the country and such risk as there may be lies on your own head  youre a canting hypocrite julian declared try your delirium that packet happens to be in the one place where neither you nor one of your tribe could get at it  it is a serious moment this mr orden fenn reminded him you are in the prime of life and there is a scandal connected with your present position which your permanent disappearance would certainly not dissipate remember  he stopped short a whistle in the corner of the room was blowing bright moved towards it but at that moment there was the sound of flying footsteps on the wooden stairs outside and the door was flung open catherine breathless with haste paused for a moment on the threshold then came forward with a little cry  julian she exclaimed  he gazed at her speechless but with a sudden light in his eyes she came across the room and dropped on her knees by his couch the two men fell back fenn slipped back between her and the door they both removed their masks but they held them ready  oh how dared they she went on the beasts tell me are you ill  weak as a kitten he faltered theyve poisoned me with their beastly gases  catherine rose to her feet she faced the two men her eyes flashing with anger  the council will require an explanation of this mr fenn she declared passionately barely an hour ago you told us that mr orden had escaped from hampstead  julian orden fenn replied has been handed over to our secret service by the unanimous vote of the council we have absolute liberty to deal with him as we think fit  have you liberty to tell lies as to his whereabouts catherine demanded you deliberately told the council he had escaped yet entirely owing to mr furley i find you down here at bermondsey with him what were you going to do with him when i came in  persuade him to restore the packet if we could fenn answered sullenly  rubbish catherine retorted you know very well that he is our friend you have only to tell him the truth and your task with him is at an end  steady julian muttered dont imagine that i have any sympathy with your little nest of conspirators  that is only because you do not understand catherine assured him listen and you shall hear the whole truth i will tell you what is inside that packet and whose signatures you will find there  julian gripped her wrist suddenly his eyes were filled with a new fear he was watching the two men who were whispering together  catherine he exclaimed warningly look out these men mean mischief that devil bright invents a new poisonous gas every day look at fenn buckling on his mask quick get out if you can  catherines hand touched her bosom bright sprang towards her but he was too late she raised a little gold whistle to her lips and its pealing summons rang through the room fenn dropped his mask and glanced towards bright his face was livid  whos outside he demanded  the bishop and mr furley great though my confidence is in you both i scarcely ventured to come here alone  the approaching footsteps were plainly audible fenn shrugged his shoulders with a desperate attempt at carelessness  i dont know what is in your mind miss abbeway he said you can scarcely believe that you at any rate were in danger at our hands  i would not trust you a yard she replied fiercely in any case it is better that the others should come mr orden might not believe me he will at least believe the bishop  believe whom julian demanded  the door was opened the bishop and miles furley came hastily in catherine stepped forward to meet them  i was obliged to whistle she explained a little hysterically i do not trust either of these men that fiend bright has a poisonous gas with him in a pocket cylinder i am convinced that they meant to murder julian  the two newcomers turned towards the couch and exchanged amazed greetings with julian fenn threw his mask on to the table with an uneasy laugh  miss abbeway he protested is inclined to be melodramatic the gas which bright has in that cylinder is simply one which would produce a little temporary unconsciousness we might have used itwe may still use itbut if you others are able to persuade mr orden to restore the packet our task with him is at an end we are not his gaolersor perhaps he would say his torturersfor pleasure the council has ordered that we should extort from him the papers you know of and has given us carte blanche as to the means if you others can persuade him to restore them peaceably why do it we are prepared to wait  julian was still staring from one to the other of his visitors his expression of blank astonishment had scarcely decreased  bishop he said at last unless you want to see me go insane before your eyes please explain it cant be possible that you have anything in common with this nest of conspirators  the bishop smiled a little wanly he laid his hand upon his godsons shoulder  believe me i have been no party to your incarceration julian he declared but if you will listen to me i will tell you why i think it would be better for you to restore that packet to miss abbeway  tell that blackguard to give me another sniff of his restorative gas julian begged these shocks are almost too much for me  the bishop turned interrogatively towards bright who once more leaned over julian with the tube in his hand again the little mist the pungent odour julian rose to his feet and sat down again  i am listening he said  first of all began the bishop earnestly as he seated himself at the end of the couch on which julian had been lying let me try to remove some of your misconceptions miss abbeway is in no sense of the word a german spy she and i mr furley here mr fenn and mr bright all belong to an organisation leagued together for one purposewe are determined to end the war  pacifists julian muttered  an idle word the bishop protested because at heart we are all pacifists there is not one of us who would wilfully choose war instead of peace the only question is the price we are prepared to pay  why not leave that to the government  the government the bishop replied are the agents of the people the people in this case wish to deal direct  again why julian demanded  because the government is composed wholly of politicians politicians who in far too many speeches have pledged themselves to too many definite things still the government will have its chance  explain to me julian asked why if you are a patriotic society you are in secret and illegal communication with germany  the germany with whom we are in communication the bishop assured his questioner is the germany who thinks as we do  then you are on a wildgoose chase julian declared because the germans who think as you do are in a hopeless minority  the bishops forefinger was thrust out  i have you julian he said that very belief which you have just expressed is our justification because it is the common belief throughout the country i can prove to you that you are mistakencan prove it with the help of that very packet which is responsible for your incarceration here  explain julian begged  that packet the bishop declared contains the peace terms formulated by the socialist and labour parties of germany  worth precisely the paper it is written on julian scoffed  and ratified the bishop continued emphatically by the three great men of germany whose signatures are attached to that documentthe kaiser the chancellor and hindenburg  julian was electrified  do you seriously mean he asked that those signatures are attached to proposals of peace formulated by the socialist and labour parties of germany  i do indeed was the confident reply if the terms are not what we have been led to expect or if the signatures are not there the whole affair is at an end  you are telling me wonderful things sir julian confessed after a brief pause  i am telling what you will discover yourself to be the truth the bishop insisted and julian i am appealing to you not only for the return of that packet but for your sympathy your help your partisanship you can guess now what has happened your anonymity has come to an end the newly formed council of labour to which we all belong is eager and anxious to welcome you  has any one given me away julian asked  catherine shook her head  the truth was discovered this evening when your rooms were searched she explained  what is the constitution of this council of labour julian enquired a little dazed by this revelation  it is the very body of men which you yourself foreshadowed the bishop replied eagerly twenty of the members are elected by the trades unions and represent the great industries of the empire and there are three outsidersmiss abbeway miles furley and myself if you julian had not been so successful in concealing your identity you would have been the first man to whom the council would have turned for help now that the truth is known your duty is clear the glory of ending this war will belong to the people and it is partly owing to you that the people have grown to realise their strength  my own position at the present moment julian began a little grimly  you have no one to blame for that but yourself catherine interrupted if we had known who you were do you suppose that we should have allowed these men to deal with you in such a manner do you suppose that i should not have told you the truth about that packet however that is over you know the truth now we five are all members of the council who are sitting practically night and day waitingyou know what for do not keep us in suspense any longer than you can help tell us where to find this letter  julian passed his hand over his forehead a little wearily  i am confused he admitted i must think after all you are engaged in a conspiracy stensons cabinet may not be the strongest on earth or the most capable but stenson himself has carried the burden of this war bravely  if the terms offered the bishop pointed out are anything like what we expect they are better than any which the politicians could ever have mooted even after years more of bloodshed it is my opinion that stenson will welcome them and that the country generally speaking will be entirely in favour of their acceptance  supposing julian asked that you think them reasonable that you make your demand to the prime minister and he refuses what then  that fenn intervened with the officious air of one who has been left out of the conversation far too long is where we come in at our word every coal pit in england would cease work every furnace fire would go out every factory would stand empty the trains would remain on their sidings or wherever they might chance to be when the edict was pronounced the same with the buses and cabs the same with the underground not a ship would leave any port in the united kingdom not a ship would be docked fortyeight hours of this would do more harm than a years civil war fortyeight hours must procure from the prime minister absolute submission to our demands ours is the greatest power the world has ever evolved we shall use it for the greatest cause the world has ever knownthe cause of peace  this in a way was inevitable julian observed you remember the conversation bishop he added down at maltenby  very well indeed the latter acquiesced  the country went into slavery julian pronounced in august 1915 that slavery may or may not be good for them to be frank i think it depends entirely upon the constitution of your council it is so much to the good bishop that you are there  our council such as it is fenn remarked acidly consists of men elected to their position by the votes of a good many millions of their fellow toilers  the people may have chosen wisely was the grave reply or they may have made mistakes such things have been known by the bye i suppose that my durance is at an end  it is at an end whichever way you decide catherine declared now that you know everything though you will not hesitate to give up the packet  you shall have it he agreed i will give it back into your hands  the sooner the better fenn exclaimed eagerly and mr orden one word  julian was standing amongst them now very drawn and pale in the dim halo of light thrown down from the hanging lamp his answering monosyllable was cold and restrained  well  i trust you will understand fenn continued that bright and i were simply carrying out orders to us you were an enemy you had betrayed the trust of one of our members the prompt delivery of that packet meant the salvation of thousands of lives it meant a cessation of this ghastly world tragedy we were harsh perhaps but we acted according to orders  julian glanced at the hand which fenn had half extended but made no movement to take it he leaned a little upon the bishops arm  help me out of this place sir will you he begged as for fenn and that other brute what i have to say about them will keep     chapter xiv   it was a little more than half an hour later when julian ascended the steps of his club in pall mall and asked the hall porter for letters except that he was a little paler than usual and was leaning more heavily upon his stick there was nothing about his appearance to denote several days of intense strain there was a shade of curiosity mingled with surprise in the commissionaires respectful greeting  there have been a good many enquiries for you the last few days sir he observed  i dare say julian replied i was obliged to go out of town unexpectedly  he ran through the little pile of letters and selected a bulky envelope addressed to himself in his own handwriting with this he returned to the taxicab in which the bishop and catherine were seated they gazed with fascinated eyes at the packet which he was carrying and which he at once displayed  you see he remarked as he leaned back there is nothing so impenetrable in the world as a club of good standing it beats combination safes hollow it would have taken all scotland yard to have dragged this letter from the rack  that is reallyit catherine demanded breathlessly  it is the packet he assured her which you handed to me for safe keeping at maltenby  they drove almost in silence to the bishops house where it had been arranged that julian should spend the night the bishop left the two together before the fire in his library while he personally superintended the arrangement of a guest room catherine came over and knelt by the side of julians chair  shall i beg forgiveness for the past she whispered or may i not talk of the future the glorious future  is it to be glorious he asked a little doubtfully  it can be made so she answered with fervour by you more than by anybody else living i defy youyou paul fisketo impugn our scheme our aims the goal towards which we strive all that we needed was a leader who could lift us up above the localness the narrow visions of these men they are in deadly earnest but they cant see far enough and each sees along his own groove it is true that at the end the same sun shines but no assembly of people can move together along a dozen different ways and keep the same goal in view  he touched the packet  we do not yet know the written word here he reminded her  i do she insisted my heart tells me besides i have had many hints there are people in london whose position forces them to remain silent who understand and know  foreigners julian asked suspiciously  neutrals of course but neutrals of discretion are very useful people the military party in germany is making a brave show still but it is beaten notwithstanding its victories the people are gathering together in their millions their voice is already being heard here we have the proof of it  but even if these proposed terms are as favourable as you say julian objected how can you force them upon the english cabinet there is americafrance yours is purely a home demand a government has other things to think of and consider  france is warweary to the bone she declared france will follow england especially when she knows the contents of that packet as for america she came into this after the great sacrifices had been made she demands nothing more than is to be yielded up it is not for the sake of visionary ideas not for diplomatic precedence that the humanitarians of the world are going to hesitate about ending this brutal slaughter  he studied her curiously in the firelight her face seemed to him almost strangely beautiful she was uplifted by the fervour of her thoughts the depth in her soft brown eyes was immeasurable the quiver of her lips so soft and yet so spiritual was almost inspiring her hand was resting upon his shoulder she seemed to dwell upon his expression to listen eagerly for his words yet he realised that in all this there was no personal note she was the disciple of a holy cause aflame with purpose  it will mean a revolution he said thoughtfully  a revolution was established two years ago she pointed out and the people have held their power ever since i will tell you what i believe today she went on passionately i believe that the very class who was standing the firmest whose fingers grasp most tightly the sword of warfare will be most grateful to the people who will wrest the initiative from them and show them the way to an honourable inevitable peace  when do you propose to break those seals he enquired  tomorrow evening she replied there will be a full meeting of the council the terms will be read then you shall decide  what am i to decide  whether you will accept the post of spokesmanwhether you will be the ambassador who shall approach the government  but they may not elect me he objected  they will she replied confidently it was you who showed them their power it is you whose inspiration has carried them along it is you who shall be their representative dont you realise she went on that it is the very association of such men as yourself and miles furley and the bishop with this movement which will endow it with reality in the eyes of the bourgeoisie of the country and parliament  their host returned followed by his butler carrying a tray with refreshments and the burden of serious things fell away from them it was only after catherine had departed and the two men lingered for a moment near the fire before retiring that either of them reverted to the great subject which dominated their thoughts  you understand julian the bishop said with a shade of anxiety in his tone that i am in the same position as yourself so far as regards the proposals which may lie within that envelope i have joined this movementor conspiracy as i suppose it would be calledon the one condition that the terms pronounced there are such as a christian and a lawloving country whose children have already made great sacrifices in the cause of freedom may honourably accept if they are otherwise all the weight and influence i may have with the people go into the other scale i take it that it is so with you  entirely julian acquiesced to be frank with you he added my doubts are not so much concerning the terms of peace themselves as the power of the german democracy to enforce them  we have relied a good deal the bishop admitted upon reports from neutrals  julian smiled a little grimly  we have wasted a good many epithets criticising german diplomacy he observed but she seems to know how to hold most of the neutrals in the hollow of her hand you know what that frenchman said scratch a neutral and you find a german propaganda agent  the bishop led the way upstairs outside the door of julians room he laid his hand affectionately upon the young mans shoulder  my godson he said as yet we have scarcely spoken of this great surprise which you have given usof paul fiske all that i shall say now is this i am very proud to know that he is my guest tonight i am very happy to think that from tomorrow we shall be fellow workers   catherine while she waited for her tea in the carlton lounge on the following afternoon gazed through the drooping palms which sheltered the somewhat secluded table at which she was seated upon a very brilliant scene it was just five oclock and a packed crowd of fashionable londoners was listening to the strains of a popular band or as much of it as could be heard above the din of conversation  this is all rather amazing is it not she remarked to her companion  the latter an attache at a neutral embassy dropped his eyeglass and polished it with a silk handkerchief in the corner of which was embroidered a somewhat conspicuous coronet  it makes an interesting study he declared berlin now is madly gay paris decorous and sober it remains with london to be normallondon because its hide is the thickest its sensibility the least acute its selfishness the most profound  catherine reflected for a moment  i think she said that a philosophical history of the war will some day for those who come after us be extraordinarily interesting i mean the study of the national temperaments as they were before as they are now during the war and as they will be afterwards there is one thing which will always be noted and that is the intense dislike which you perhaps i certainly the majority of neutrals feel towards england  it is true the young man assented solemnly one finds it everywhere  before the war catherine went on it was germany who was hated everywhere she pushed her way into the best places at hotels watering placesmonte carlo for instance and the famous spas today all that accumulated dislike seems to be turned upon england i am not myself a great admirer of this country and yet i ask myself why  england is smug the young man pronounced she is callous she is without meaning to be hypocritical she works herself into a terrible state of indignation about the misdeeds of her neighbours and she does not realise her own faults the germans are overbearing but one realises that and expects it englishmen are irritating it is certainly true that amongst us remaining neutrals he added dropping his voice a little and looking around to be sure of their isolation the sympathy remains with the central powers  i have some dear friends in this country too catherine sighed  naturallyamongst those of your own order but then there is very little difference between the aristocracies of every race in the world it is the bourgeoisie which tells which sets its stamp upon a nations character  their tea had arrived and for a few moments the conversation travelled in lighter channels the young man who was a person of some consequence in his own country spoke easily of the theatres of mutual friends of some sport in which he had been engaged catherine relapsed into the role which had been her first in lifethe young woman of fashion as such they attracted no attention save a few admiring glances on the part of passersby towards catherine as the people around them thinned out a little their conversation became more intimate  i shall always feel the young man said thoughtfully that in these days i have lived very near great things i have seen and realised what the historians will relate at secondhand the greatest events move like straws in the wind a month ago it seemed as though the central powers would lose the war  i suppose she observed it depends very much upon what you mean by winning it the terms of peace are scarcely the terms of victory are they  the terms of peace he repeated thoughtfully  we happen to know what they are do we not she continued speaking almost under her breath the basic terms at any rate  you mean he said slowly the terms put forward by the socialist party of germany to ensure the granting of an armistice  and acceded to she reminded him by the kaiser and the two greatest german statesmen  he toyed with his teacup drew a gold cigarette case from his pocket selected a cigarette and lit it  you would try to make me believe he remarked smiling at his companion that today you are not in your most intelligent mood  explain if you please she begged earnestly  he smoked stolidly for several moments  i imagine he said that you preserve with me something of that very skilfully assumed ignorance which is the true mask of the diplomatist but is it worth while i wonder  she caught at her breath  you are too clever she murmured looking at him covertly  you have seen he continued how germany who needs peace sorely has striven to use the most despised power in her country for her own advantagei mean the socialist party from being treated with scorn and ignominy they were suddenly at the time of the proposed stockholm conference judged worthy of notice from the all highest himself he suddenly saw how wonderful a use might be made of them it was a very clever trap which was baited and it was not owing to any foresight or any cleverness on the part of this country that the allies did not walk straight into it i say again he went on that it was a mere fluke which prevented the allies from being represented at that conference and the driving in of the thin end of the wedge  you are quite right catherine agreed  german diplomacy he proceeded may sometimes be obtuse but it is at least persistent their next move will certainly rank in history as the most astute the most cunning of any put forward since the war commenced of course the young man went on fitting his cigarette into a long amber holder we who are not germans can only guess but even the guessing is fascinating  go on please dear baron she begged it is when you talk like this and show me your mind that i seem to be listening to a second bismarck  you flatter me countess the young man said but indeed these events are interesting trace their course for yourself after the failure of stockholm the kaiser has established certain relations with the socialist party once more he turns towards them he affects a war weariness he does not feel he puts it into their heads that they shall approach without molestation certain men in england who have a great labour following the plot is started you know quite well how it has progressed  naturally catherine assented but after all tell me where does the wonderful diplomacy come in the terms of peace are not the terms of a conqueror germany is to engage herself to give up what she has sworn to hold even to pay indemnities to restore all conquered countries and to retire her armies behind the rhine  the young man looked at his companion steadfastly for several seconds  in the idiom of this country countess he said i raise my hat to you you preserve your mask of ignorance to the end so much so indeed that i find myself asking do you really believe that germany intends to do this  but you forget she reminded him i was one of those present at the discussion of the preliminaries the confirmation of the agreed terms with the signatures has arrived and is to be placed before the labour council at six oclock this evening  the young man for a moment seemed puzzled then he glanced at a little gold watch upon his wrist knocked the cigarette from its holder and carefully replaced the latter in its case  that is very interesting countess he said for the moment i had forgotten your official position amongst the english socialists  she leaned forward and touched his coat sleeve  you had forgotten nothing she declared eagerly there is something in your mind of which you have not spoken  no he replied i have spoken a great deal of my mindtoo much perhaps considering that we are seated in this very fashionable lounge with many people around us we must talk of these serious matters on another occasion countess i shall pay my respects to your aunt if i may within the next few days  why do you fence with me she persisted drawing on her gloves you and i both know so far as regards those peace terms that  if we both know he interrupted let us keep each our own knowledge words are sometimes very dangerous and great events are looming so countess you have perhaps a car or may i have the pleasure of escorting you to your destination  i am going to westminster she told him rising to her feet  in that case he observed as they made their way down the room perhaps i had better not offer my escort although i should very much like to be there in person you are amongst those today who will make history  come and see me soon she begged dropping her voice a little and i will confide in you as much as i dare  it is tempting he admitted i should like to know what passes at that meeting  you can if you will dine with us tomorrow night she invited at halfpast eight my aunt will be delighted to see you i forget whether we have people coming or not but you will be very welcome  the young man bowed low as he handed his charge into a taxicab  dear countess he murmured i shall be charmed     chapter xv   for a gathering of men upon whose decision hung such momentous issues the council which met that evening at westminster seemed alike unambitious in tone and uninspired in appearance some short time was spent in one of the anterooms where julian was introduced to many of the delegates the disclosure of his identity although it aroused immense interest was scarcely an unmixed joy to the majority of them those who were in earnestand they mostly were in grim and deadly earnesthad hoped to find him a man nearer their own class fenn and bright had their own reasons for standing apart and the extreme pacifists took note of the fact that he had been a soldier his coming however was an event the importance of which nobody attempted to conceal  the bishop was voted into the chair when the little company trooped into the apartment which had been set aside for their more important meetings his election had been proposed by miles furley and as it was announced that under no circumstances would he become a candidate for the permanent leadership of the party was agreed to without comment a few notes for his guidance had been jotted down earlier in the day the great subject of discussion was of course the recently received communication from an affiliated body of their friends in germany copies of which had been distributed amongst the members  i am asked to explain the bishop announced in opening the proceedings that this document which we all recognise as being of surpassing importance has been copied by mr fenn himself and that since copies have been distributed amongst the members the front door of the building has been closed and the telephones placed under surveillance it is not of course possible that any of you could be mistrusted but it is of the highest importance that neither the press the government nor the people should have any indication of what is transpiring until the delegate whom you choose takes the initial step it is proposed that until after his interview with the prime minister no delegate shall leave the place the question now arises what of the terms themselves i will ask each one of you to state his views commencing with miss abbeway  every one of the twentythreeor twentyfour now including julianhad a few words to say and the tenor of their remarks was identical for a basis of peace terms the proposals were entirely reasonable nor did they appear in any case to be capable of misconstruction they were laid down in eight clauses  1 the complete evacuation of northern france and belgium with full compensation for all damage done  2 alsace and lorraine to determine their position by vote of the entire population  3 servia and roumania to be reestablished as independent kingdoms with such rectifications and modifications of frontier as a joint committee should decide upon  4 the german colonies to be restored  5 the conquered parts of mesopotamia to remain under the protection of the british government  6 poland to be declared an independent kingdom  7 trieste and certain portions of the adriatic seaboard to be ceded to italy  8 a world committee to be at once elected for the purpose of working out a scheme of international disarmament  we must remember miles furley pointed out that the present government is practically pledged not to enter into peace negotiations with a hohenzollern  that i contend the bishop observed is a declaration which should never have been made whatever may be our own feelings with regard to the government of germany the kaiser has held the nation together and is at the present moment its responsible head if he has had the good sense to yield to the demands of his people as is proved by this document then it is very certain that the declaration must be forgotten i have reason to believe however that even if the negotiations have been commenced in the name of the kaiser an immediate change is likely to take place in the constitution of germany  germanys new form of government i understand fenn intervened will be modelled upon our own which after the abolition of the house of lords and the abnegation of the kings prerogative will be as near the ideal democracy as is possible that change will be in itself our most potent guarantee against all future wars no democracy ever encouraged bloodshed it is to my mind a clearly proved fact that all wars are the result of court intrigue there will be no more of that the passing of monarchical rule in germany will mean the doom of all autocracies  there was a little sympathetic murmur julian to whom catherine had been whispering next asked a question  i suppose he said that no doubt can be cast upon the authenticity of the three signatures attached to this document  thats been in my own mind mr fiskeleastwise mr orden phineas cross the northumbrian remarked from the other side of the table theyre up to any mortal dodge these germans are we to accept it as beyond all doubt that this document is entirely genuine  how can we do otherwise fenn demanded freistner who is responsible for it has been in unofficial correspondence with us since the commencement of the war we know his handwriting we know his character weve had a hundred different occasions to test his earnestness and trustworthiness this document is in his own writing and accompanied by remarks and references to previous correspondence which render its authenticity indisputable  granted that the proposals themselves are genuine there still remain the three signatures julian observed  why should we doubt them fenn protested freistner guarantees them and freistner is our friend the friend and champion of labour throughout the world to attempt to deceive us would be to cover himself with eternal obloquy  yet these terms julian pointed out differ fundamentally from anything which germany has yet allowed to be made public  there are two factors here which may be considered miles furley intervened the first is that the economic condition of germany is far worse than she has allowed us to know the second which is even more interesting to us is the rapid growth in influence power and numbers of the socialist and labour party in that country  of both these factors the bishop reminded them we have had very frequent hints from our friends the neutrals let me tell you all what i think i think that those terms are as much as we have the right to expect even if our armies had reached the rhine it is possible that we might obtain some slight modifications if we continued the war but would those modifications be worth the loss of a few more hundred thousands of human lives of a few more months of this hideous pagan slaughter and defilement of gods beautiful world  there was a murmur of approval a lank rawboned yorkshiremandavid sandsa wesleyan enthusiast a local preacher leaned across the table his voice shaking with earnestness  its true he exclaimed its the word of god its for us to stop the war if we stop it tonight instead of tomorrow a thousand lives may be saved human lives lives of our fellow creatures our fellow labourers in germany have given us the chance dont let us delay five minutes let the one of us you may select see the prime minister tonight and deliver the peoples message  theres no cause for delay that i can see cross approved  there is none fenn assented heartily i propose that we proceed to the election of our representative that having elected him we send him to the prime minister with our message and that we remain here in the building until we have his report  you are unanimously resolved then the bishop asked to take this last step  there was a little chorus of assent fenn leaned forward in his place  everything is ready he announced our machinery is perfect our agents in every city await the mandate  but do you imagine that those last means will be necessary the bishop enquired anxiously  most surely i do fenn replied remember that if the people make peace for the country it is the people who will expect to govern the country it will be a notice to the politicians to quit they know that it is my belief that they will resist tooth and nail  bright glanced at his watch  the prime minister he announced will be at downing street until nine oclock it is now seven oclock i propose that we proceed without any further delay to the election of our representative  the voting cards fenn pointed out are before each person every one has two votes which must be for two different representatives the cards should then be folded and i propose that the bishop who is not a candidate collect them as i read the unwritten rules of this congress every one here is eligible except the bishop miss abbeway mr orden and mr furley  there was a little murmur phineas cross leaned forward in his place  here whats that he exclaimed the bishop and miss abbeway we all know are outside the running mr furley too represents the educated socialists and though he is with us in this he is not really labour but mr ordenpaul fiske eh thats a different matter isnt it  mr orden fenn pronounced slowly is a literary man he is a sympathiser with our cause but he is not of it  if any man has read the message which paul fiske has written with a pen of gold for us phineas cross declared and can still say that he is not one of us why he must be beside himself i say that mr orden is the brains and the soul of our movement he brought life and encouragement into the north of england with the first article he ever wrote since then there has not been a man whom the labour party that i know anything of has looked up to and worshipped as they have done him  its true david sands broke in every word of it theres no one has written for labour like him if he isnt labour then we none of us are i dont care whether he is the son of an earl or a plasterers apprentice as i was hes the right stuff he has the gift of putting the words together and his hearts where it should be  there is no one penn said his voice trembling a little who has a greater admiration for paul fiskes writings than i have but i still contend that he is not labour  sit down lad cross enjoined well have a vote on that im for saying that mr julian orden here who has written them articles under the name of paul fiske is a full member of our council and eligible to act as our messenger to the prime minister i ask the bishop to put it to the meeting  eighteen were unanimous in agreeing with the motion fenn sat down speechless his cheeks were pallid his hands which rested upon the table were twitching he seemed like a man lost in thought and only remembered to fill up his card when the bishop asked him for it there was a brief silence whilst the latter assisted by cross and sands counted the votes then the bishop rose to his feet  mr julian orden he announced better known to you all under the name of paul fiske has been chosen by a large majority as your representative to take the peoples message to the prime minister  i protest fenn exclaimed passionately this is mr ordens first visit amongst us he is a stranger i repeat that he is not one of us where is his power he has none can he do what any one of us canstop the pulse of the nation can he still its furnace fires can he empty the shipyards and factories hold the trains upon their lines bring the miners up from under the earth can he  he can do all these things phineas cross interrupted because he speaks for us our duly elected representative sit thee down fenn if you wanted the job well you havent got it and thats all there is about it and though youre as glib with your tongue as any here and though youve as many at your back perchance as i have i tell you id never have voted for you if there hadnt been another man here so put that in your pipe and smoke it lad  all further discussion the bishop ruled is out of order julian orden do you accept this mission  julian rose to his feet he leaned heavily upon his stick his expression was strangely disturbed  bishop he said and you my friends this has all come very suddenly i do not agree with mr fenn i consider that i am one with you i think that for the last ten years i have seen the place which labour should hold in the political conduct of the world i have seen the danger of letting the voice of the people remain unheard too long russia today is a practical and terrible example of that danger england is in her way a free country and our government a good one but in the worlds history there arrive sometimes crises with which no stereotyped form of government can cope when the one thing that is desired is the plain honest mandate of those who count for most in the world those who in their simplicity and in their absence from all political ties and precedents and liaisons see the truth that is why i have appealed with my pen to labour to end this war that is why i shall go willingly as your representative to the prime minister tonight  the bishop held out his hand there was a little reverent hush for his words were in the nature of a benediction  and may god be with you our messenger he said solemnly     chapter xvi   julian duly embarked upon his mission was kept waiting an unexpectedly short time in the large but gloomy apartment into which mr stensons butler had somewhat doubtfully ushered him the prime minister entered with an air of slight hurry he was also somewhat surprised  my dear orden he exclaimed holding out his hand what can i do for you  a great deal julian replied gravely first of all though i have an explanation to make  i am afraid mr stenson regretted that i am too much engaged this evening to enter into any personal matters i am expecting a messenger here on very important official business  i am that messenger julian announced  mr stenson started his visitors tone was serious and convincing  i fear that we are at loggerheads it is an envoy from the labour party whom i am expecting  i am that envoy  you mr stenson exclaimed in blank bewilderment  i ought to explain a little further perhaps i have been writing on labour questions for some time under the pseudonym of paul fiske  paul fiske mr stenson gasped youpaul fiske  julian nodded assent  you are amazed of course he proceeded but it is nevertheless the truth the fact has just come to light and i have been invited to join this new emergency council composed of one or two socialists and writers amongst them a very distinguished prelate labour members of parliament and representatives of the various trades unions a body of men which you doubtless know all about i attended a meeting at westminster an hour ago and i was entrusted with this commission to you  mr stenson sat down suddenly  god bless my soul he exclaimed youjulian orden  there was a moments silence mr stenson however was a man of immense recuperative powers he assimilated the new situation without further protest  you have given me the surprise of my life orden he confessed that however is a personal matter hannaway wells is in the study you have no objection i suppose to his being present  none whatever  mr stenson rang the bell and in a few minutes they were joined by his colleague the former wasted no time in explanations  you will doubtless be as astonished as i was wells he said to learn that our friend julian orden comes here as the representative of the new labour council his qualifications amongst others are that under the pseudonym of paul fiske he is the writer of those wonderful articles which have been the beacon light and the inspiration of the labour party for the last year  mr hannaway wells prided himself upon never being surprised this time the only way he could preserve his reputation was by holding his tongue  we are now prepared to hear your mission mr stenson continued turning to his visitor  i imagine julian began that you know something about this new labour council  what little we do know mr stenson answered we have learnt with great difficulty through our secret service i gather that a small league of men has been formed within a mile of the houses of parliament who whatever their motives may be have been guilty of treasonable and traitorous communication with the enemy  strictly speaking you are without doubt perfectly right julian acknowledged  mr stenson switched on an electric light  sit down orden he invited there is no need for us to stand glaring at one another there is enough of real importance in the nature of our interview without making melodrama of it  the prime minister threw himself into an easy chair julian with a little sigh of relief selected a highbacked oak chair and rested his foot upon a hassock hannaway wells remained standing upon the hearthrug  straight into the heart of it please orden mr stenson begged let us know how far this accursed conspiracy has gone  it has gone to very great lengths julian declared certain members of this newlyformed council of labour have been in communication for some months with the socialist party in germany from these latter they have received a definite and authentic proposal of peace countersigned by the three most important men in germany that proposal of peace i am here to lay before you with the request that you act upon it without delay  julian produced his roll of papers the two men remained motionless the great issue had been reached with almost paralysing rapidity  my advice mr hannaway wells said bluntly is that you sirturning to his chiefrefuse to discuss or consider these proposals or to examine that document i submit that you are the head of his majestys government and any communication emanating from a foreign country should be addressed to you if you ever consider this matter and discuss it with mr orden here you associate yourself with a traitorous breach of the law  mr stenson made no immediate reply he looked towards julian as though to hear what he had to say  mr hannaway wellss advice is without doubt technically correct julian admitted but the whole subject is too great and the issues involved too awful for etiquette or even propriety to count it is for you sir to decide what is best for the country you commit yourself to nothing by reading the proposals and i suggest that you do so  we will read them mr stenson decided  julian passed over the papers the two men crossed the room and leaned over the prime ministers writing table mr stenson drew down the electric light and they remained there in close confabulation for about a quarter of an hour julian sat with his back turned towards them and his ears closed in this atmosphere of government his own position seemed to him weird and fantastic a sense of unreality cumbered his thoughts even this brief pause in the actual negotiations filled him with doubts he could scarcely believe that it was he who was to dictate terms to the man who was responsible for the government of the country that it was he who was to force a decision pregnant with farreaching consequences to the entire world the figures of fenn and bright loomed up ominously before him however hard he tried to push them into the background was it the mandate of such men as these that he was carrying  presently the two ministers returned to their places julian had heard their voices for the last few minutes without being able to distinguish a word of their actual conversation  we have considered the document you have brought orden the prime minister said and we frankly admit that we find its contents surprising the terms of peace suggested form a perfectly possible basis for negotiations at the same time you are probably aware that it has not been in the mind of his majestys ministers to discuss terms of peace at all with the present administration of germany  these terms julian reminded him are dictated not by the kaiser and his advisers but by the socialist and labour party  it is strange mr stenson pointed out that we have heard so little of that party it is even astonishing that we should find them in a position to be able to dictate terms of peace to the hohenzollerns  you do not dispute the authenticity of the document julian asked  i will not go so far as that mr stenson replied cautiously our secret service informed us some time ago that freistner the head of the german socialists was in communication with certain people in this country i have no doubt whatever that these are the proposals of the authorised socialist party of germany what i do not understand is how they have suddenly acquired the strength to induce proposals of peace such as these  it has been suggested julian said that even the hohenzollerns even the military clique of germany see before them now the impossibility of reaping the rewards of their successful campaigns peace is becoming a necessity to them they would prefer therefore to seem to yield to the demands of their own socialists rather than to foreign pressure  that may be so mr stenson admitted let us proceed the first part of your duty orden is finished what else have you to say  i am instructed julian announced to appeal to you to sue at once through the spanish ambassador for an armistice while these terms are considered and arrangements made for discussing them  and if i refuse  i will not evade even that question of the twentythree members of the new council of labour twenty represent the trades unions of the great industries of the kingdom those twenty will unanimously proclaim a general strike if you should refuse the proposed armistice  in other words mr stenson observed drily they will scuttle the ship themselves do you approve of these tactics  i decline to answer that question julian said but i would point out to you that when you acknowledged yourself defeated by the miners of south wales you pointed the way to some such crisis as this  that may be true mr stenson acknowledged i have only at this moment however to deal with the present condition of affairs do you seriously believe that if i make the only answer which at present seems to me possible the council of labour as they call themselves will adopt the measures they threaten  i believe that they will julian declared gravely i believe that the country looks upon any continuation of this war as a continuation of unnecessary and ghastly slaughter to appreciably change the military situation would mean the sacrifice of millions more lives would mean the continuation of the war for another two years i believe that the people of germany who count are of the same opinion i believe that the inevitable change of government in germany will show us a nation freed from this hideous lust for conquest a nation with whom when she is purged of the poison of these last years we can exist fraternally and with mutual benefit  you are a very sanguine man mr orden hannaway wells remarked  i have never found julian replied that the pessimist walks with his head turned towards the truth  how long have i the prime minister asked after a brief pause for my reply  twentyfour hours julian told him during which time it is hoped that you will communicate with our allies and pave the way for a further understanding the council of labour asks you for no pledge as to their safety we know quite well that all of us are legally speaking guilty of treason on the other hand a single step towards the curtailment of our liberties will mean the paralysis of every industry in the united kingdom  i realise the position perfectly mr stenson observed drily i do not exactly know what to say to you personally orden he added perhaps it is as well for us that the council should have chosen an ambassador with whom discussion at any rate is possible nevertheless i feel bound to remind you that you have taken upon your shoulders considering your birth and education one of the most perilous loads which any man could carry  i have weighed the consequences julian replied with a sudden and curious sadness in his tone i know how the name of pacifist stinks in the nostrils i know how far we are committed as a nation to a peace won by force of arms i know how our british blood boils at the thought of leaving a foreign country with as many military advantages as germany has acquired but i feel too that there is the other side i have brought you evidence that it is not the german nation against whom we fight man against man human being against human being it is my belief that autocracy and the dynasty of the hohenzollerns will crumble into ruin as a result of todays negotiations just as surely as though we sacrificed god knows how many more lives to achieve a greater measure of military triumph  the prime minister rang the bell  you are an honest man julian orden he said and a decent emissary you will reply that we take the twentyfour hours for reflection that means that we shall meet at nine oclock tomorrow evening  he held out his hand in farewell an action which somehow sent julian away a happier man     chapter xvii   julian on the morning following his visit to the prime minister was afflicted with a curious and persistent unrest he travelled down to the temple land found miles furley in a room hung with tobacco smoke and redolent of a late night  miles julian declared as the two men shook hands i cant rest  i am in the same fix furley admitted i sat here till four oclock phineas cross came around and halfadozen of the others i felt i must talk to them i must keep on hammering it out were right julian we must be right  its a ghastly responsibility i wonder what history will have to say  thats the worst of it furley groaned theyll have a birdseye view of the whole affair those people who write our requiem or our eulogy you noticed the press this morning theyre all hinting at some great move in the west its about in the clubs why i even heard last night that we were in ostend its all a rig of course stenson wants to gain time  who opened these negotiations with freistner julian asked  fenn he met him at the geneva conference the year before the war i met him too but i didnt see so much of him hes a fine fellow julianas unlike the typical german as any man you ever met  hes honest i suppose  as the day itself was the confident reply he has been in prison twice you know for plain speaking he is the one man in germany who has fought the war tooth and nail from the start  julian caught his friend by the shoulder  miles he saidstraight from the bottom of your heart mindyou do believe we are justified  i have never doubted it  you know that we have practically created a revolutionthat we have established a dictatorship stenson must obey or face anarchy  it is the voice of the people furley declared i am convinced that we are justified i am convinced of the inutility of the prolongation of this war  julian drew a little sigh of relief  dont think i am weakening he said remember i am new to this thing in practice even though i may be responsible for some of the theory  it is the people who are the soundest directors of a nations policy furley pronounced high politics becomes too much like a game of chess hedged all around with etiquette and precedent its human life we want to save julian people dont stop to realise the horrible tragedy of even one mans deathone man with his little circle of relatives and friends in the game of war one forgets human beingsmen from the toilers bench the carpenters bench from behind the counter from the land from the minedon khaki become soldiers and there seems something different about them so many human lives gone every day just soldiers just the toll we have to pay for a slight advance or a costly retreat and my god every one of them underneath their khaki is a human being the politicians dont grasp it julian thats our justification the day that armistice is signed several hundred lives at leastperhaps thousandswill be saved for several hundred women the sun will continue to shine parents sweethearts childrenall of themthink what they will be spared  i am a man again julian declared come along round to westminster there are many things i want to ask about the executive  they drove round to the great building which had been taken over by the different members of the labour council the representative of each trades union had his own office staff of clerks and private telephone fenn who greeted the two men with a rather excessive cordiality constituted himself their cicerone he took them from room to room and waited while julian exchanged remarks with some of the delegates whom he had not met personally  every one of our members fenn pointed out is in direct communication with the local secretary of each town in which his industry is represented you see these  he paused and laid his hand on a little heap of telegraph forms on which one word was typed  these he continued are all ready to be dispatched the second that we hear from mr stenson that is to say if we should hear unfavourably they are divided into batches and each batch will be sent from a different postoffice so that there shall be no delay we calculate that in seven hours at the most the industrial pulse of the country will have ceased to beat  how long has your organisation taken to build up julian enquired  exactly three months david sands observed turning around in his swing chair from the desk at which he had been writing the scheme was started a few days after your article in the british review we took your motto as our text coordination and cooperation  they found their way into the clubroom and at luncheon later on julian strove to improve his acquaintance with the men who were seated around him some of them were members of parliament with wellknown names others were intensely local but all seemed earnest and clearsighted phineas cross commenced to talk about war generally he had just returned from a visit with other labour members to the front although it is doubtful whether the result had been exactly in accordance with the intentions of the powers who had invited him  ill tell you something about war he said which contradicts most every other experience theres scarcely a great subject in the world which you dont have to take as a whole and from the biggest point of view to appreciate it thoroughly its exactly different with war if you want to understand more than the platitudes you want to just take in one section of the fighting say there are fifty englishmen decent fellows been dragged from their posts as commercial travellers or small tradesmen or labourers or whatnot and they get mixed up with a similar number of germans those germans aint the fiends we read about theyre not bubbling over with militarism they dont want to lord it over all the world theyve exactly the same tastes the same outlook upon life as the fifty englishmen whom an iron hand has been forcing to do their best to kill those english chaps didnt want to kill anybody any more than the germans did they had to do it too simply because it was part of the game there was a handful of german prisoners i saw talking with their guard and exchanging smokes one was a barber in a country town the man who had him in tow was an english barber bless you they were talking like one oclock that german barber didnt want anything in life except plenty to eat and drink to be a good husband and good father and to save enough money to buy a little house of his own the englishman was just the same hed as soon have had that german for a pal for a days fishing or a walk in the country as any one else theyd neither of them got anything against the other where the hell is this spirit of hatred you go down the line mile after mile and most little groups of men facing one another are just the same here and there theres some bitter feeling through some fighting thats seemed unfair but thats nothing the fact remains that those millions of men dont hate one another that theyve got nothing to hate one another about and theyre being driven to slaughter one another like savage beasts for what mr stenson might supply an answer your great editors might your great generals could be glib about it they could spout volumes of words but theres no substance about them i say that in this generation theres no call for fighting and there didnt ought to be any  you are not only right but you are splendidly right mr cross julian declared its human talk that    its just a plain mans words and thoughts was the simple reply  and yet fenn complained in his thin voice if i talk like that they call me a pacifist a lot of rowdies get up and sing rule britannia and try to chivy me out of the hall where im speaking  you see theres a difference lad cross pointed out setting down the tankard of beer from which he had been drinking you talk sometimes that whitelivered stuff about not hitting a man back if he wants to hit you and you drag in your conscience and prate about all men being brothers and that sort of twaddle a fullblooded englishman dont like it because we are all of us out to protect what weve got any way and anyhow but that doesnt alter the fact that theres something wrong in the world when were driven to do this protecting business wholesale and being forced into murdering on a scale which only devils could have thought out and imagined its the men at the top that are responsible for this war and when people come to reckon up theyll say that there was blame up at the top in the government of every power thats fighting but there was a damned sight more blame amongst the germans than any of the others and thats why many a hundred thousand of our young men whove loathed the war and felt about it as i do have gone and done their bit and kept their mouths shut  you cannot deny fenn argued that war is contrary to christianity  i dunno lad cross replied winking across the table at julian seems to me there was a powerful lot of fighting in the old testament and the lord was generally on one side or the other but you and i aint going to bicker mr fenn the first decision this council came to when it embraced more than a dozen of us of very opposite ways of thinking was to keep our mouths shut about our own ideas and stick to business so give me a fill of baccy from your pipe and well have a cup of coffee together  julians pouch was first upon the table and the northumbrian filled his pipe in leisurely fashion  good stuff sir he declared approvingly as he passed it back after dinner i am mostly a man of peaceeven when fenn comes yapping around he added looking after the disappearing figure of the secretary but i make no secret of this i tumbled to it from the first that this was a great proposition this amalgamation of labour it makes a power of us even though it may as you mr orden said in one of your articles bring us to the gates of revolution but it was all i could do to bring myself to sit down at the same table with penn and his friend bright you see he explained there may be times when you are forced into doing a thing that fundamentally you disapprove of and you know is wrong i disapprove of this war and i know its wrongits a foul mess that weve been got into by those who should have known betterbut i aint like fenn about it were in it and weve got to get out of it not like cowards but like englishmen and if fighting had been the only way through then i should have been for fighting to the last gasp fortunately weve got into touch with the sensible folk on the other side if we hadntwell ill say no more but that ive got two boys fighting and one buried at ypres and ive another though hes over young doing his drill  mr cross julian said youve done me more good than any one ive talked to since the war began  thats right lad cross replied you get straight words from one and not only that you get the words of another million behind me who feel as i do but he added glancing across the room and lowering his voice keep your eye on that artful devil fenn he doesnt bear you any particular good will  he wasnt exactly a hospitable gaoler julian reminiscently observed  im not speaking of that only cross went on there wasnt one of us who didnt vote for squeezing that document out of you one way or the other and if it had been necessary to screw your neck off for it i dont know as one of us would have hesitated for you were standing between us and the big thing but he and that little skunk bright aint to be trusted in my mind and it seems to me theyve got a down on you fenn counted on being heart of this council for one thing and theres a matter of a young woman eh for another  a young woman julian repeated  cross nodded  the russian young personmiss abbeway she calls herself fenns been her lapdog round heretakes her out to dine and that its just a word of warning thats all youre new amongst us mr orden and you might think us all honest men well we aint thats all there is to it  julian recovered from a momentary fit of astonishment  i am much obliged to you for your candour mr cross he said  and never you mind about the mr sir the northumbrian begged  nor you about the sir julian retorted with a smile  middle stump cross acknowledged and since we are on the subject my new friend let me tell you this to feel perfectly happy about this council theres just three as i should like to see out of itfenn brightand the young lady  why the young lady julian asked quickly  you might as well ask me why fenn and bright the other replied i shouldnt make no answer were superstitious you know we north country folk and we are all for instincts all i can say to you is that there isnt one of those three id trust around the corner  miss abbeway is surely above suspicion julian protested she has given up a great position and devoted the greater part of her fortune towards the causes which you and i and all of us are working for  thered be plenty of work for her in russia just now cross observed  no person of noble birth julian reminded him has the slightest chance of working effectively in russia today besides miss abbeway is half english failing russia she would naturally select this as the country in which she could do most good  some retort seemed to fade away upon the others lips his shaggy eyebrows were drawn a little closer together as he glanced towards the door julian followed the direction of his gaze catherine had entered and was looking around as though in search of some one  catherine was more heavily veiled than usual her dress and hat were of sombre black and her manner nervous and disturbed she came slowly towards their end of the table although she was obviously in search of some one else  do you happen to know where mr fenn is she enquired  julian raised his eyebrows  fenn was here a few minutes ago he replied but he left us abruptly i fancy that he rather disapproved of our conversation  he has gone to his room perhaps she said i will go upstairs  she turned away julian however followed her to the door  shall i see you again before you leave he asked  of courseif you wish to  there was a moments perceptible pause  wont you come upstairs with me to mr fenns room she continued  not if your business is in any way private  she began to ascend the stairs  it isnt private she said but i particularly want mr fenn to tell me something and as you know he is peculiar perhaps if you dont mind it would be better if you waited for me downstairs  julians response was a little vague she left him however without appearing to notice his reluctance and knocked at the door of fenns room she found him seated behind a desk dictating some letters to a stenographer whom he waved away at her entrance  delighted to see you miss abbeway he declared impressively delighted come and sit down please and talk to me we have had a tremendous morning even though the machine is all ready to start it needs a watchful hand all the time  she sank into the chair from which he had swept a pile of papers and raised her veil  mr fenn she confessed i came to you because i have been very worried  he withdrew a little into himself his eyes narrowed his manner became more cautious  worried he repeated well  i want to ask you this have you heard anything from freistner during the last day or two  fenns face was immovable he still showed no signs of discomposurehis voice only was not altogether natural  last day or two he repeated reflectively no i cant say that i have miss abbeway i neednt remind you that we dont risk communications except when they are necessary  will you try and get into touch with him at once she begged  why fenn asked glancing at her searchingly  one of our russian writers she said once wrote that there are a thousand eddies in the winds of chance one of those has blown my way todayor rather yesterday freistner is above all suspicion is he not  far above was the confident reply i am not the only one who knows him ask the others  do you think it possible that he himself can have been deceived she persisted  in what manner  in his own strengththe strength of his own party she proceeded eagerly do you think it possible that the imperialists have pretended to recognise in him a far greater factor in the situation than he really is have pretended to acquiesce in these terms of peace with the intention of repudiating them when we have once gone too far  fenn seemed for a moment to have shrunk in his chair his eyes had fallen before her passionate gaze the penholder which he was grasping snapped in his fingers nevertheless his voice still performed its office  my dear miss abbeway he protested who or what has been putting these ideas into your head  a veritable chance she replied brought me yesterday afternoon into contact with a mana neutralwho is supposed to be very intimately acquainted with what goes on in germany  what did he tell you fenn demanded feverishly  he told me nothing she admitted i have no more to go on than an uplifted eyebrow all the same i came away feeling uneasy i have felt wretched ever since i am wretched now i beg you to get at once into touch with freistner you can do that now without any risk simply ask him for a confirmation of the existing situation  that is quite easy fenn promised i will do it without delay but in the meantime he added moistening his dry lips cant you possibly get to know what this manthis neutralis driving at  i fear not she replied but i shall try i have invited him to dine tonight  if you discover anything when shall you let us know  immediately she promised i shall telephone for mr orden  for a moment he lost control of himself  why mr orden he demanded passionately he is the youngest member of the council he knows nothing of our negotiations with freistner surely i am the person with whom you should communicate  it will be very late tonight she reminded him and mr orden is my personal friendoutside the council  and am i not he asked fiercely i want to be i have tried to be  she appeared to find his agitation disconcerting and she withdrew a little from the yellowstained fingers which had crept out towards hers  we are all friends she said evasively perhapsif there is anything important theni will come or send for you  he rose to his feet less it seemed as an act of courtesy in view of her departure than with the intention of some further movement he suddenly reseated himself however his fingers grasped at the air he became ghastly pale  are you ill mr fenn she exclaimed  he poured himself out a glass of water with trembling fingers and drank it unsteadily  nerves i suppose he said ive had to carry the whole burden of these negotiations upon my shoulders with very little help from any one with none of the sympathy that counts  a momentary impulse of kindness did battle with her invincible dislike of the man  you must remember she urged that yours is a glorious work that our thoughts and gratitude are with you  but are they he demanded with another little burst of passion gratitude indeed if the council feel that why was i not selected to approach the prime minister instead of julian orden sympathy if you the one person from whom i desire it have any to offer why can you not be kinder why can you not respond ever so little to what i feel for you  she hesitated for a moment seeking for the words which would hurt him least tactless as ever he misunderstood her  i may have had one small check in my career he continued eagerly but the game is not finished believe me i have still great cards up my sleeve i know that you have been used to wealth and luxury miss abbeway he went on his voice dropping to a hoarse whisper i was not boasting the other night i have saved money i have speculated fortunatelyi  the look in her eyes stifled his eloquence he broke off in his speechbecame dumb and voiceless  mr fenn she said once and for all this sort of conversation is distasteful to me a great deal of what you say i do not understand what i do understand i dislike  she left him with an inscrutable look he made no effort to open the door for her he simply stood listening to her departing footsteps listened to the shrill summons of the liftbell listened to the lift itself go clanging downwards then he resumed his seat at his desk with his hands clasped nervously together an ink smear upon his cheek his mouth slightly open disclosing his irregular and discoloured teeth he was not by any means a pleasant looking object  he blew down a tube by his side and gave a muttered order in a few minutes bright presented himself  i am busy the latter observed curtly as he closed the door behind him  youve got to be busier in a few minutes was the harsh reply theres a screw loose somewhere  bright stood motionless  any one been disagreeable he asked after a moments pause  get down to your office at once fenn directed briefly have miss abbeway followed i want reports of her movements every hour i shall be here all night  bright grinned unpleasantly  another samson eh  go to hell and do as youre told was the fierce reply put your best men on the job i must know for all our sakes the name of the neutral whom miss abbeway sees tonight and with whom she is exchanging confidences  bright left the room with a shrug of the shoulders nicholas fenn turned up the electric light pulled out a bank book from the drawer of his desk and throwing it on to the fire watched it until it was consumed     chapter xviii   the baron hellman comfortably seated at the brilliantly decorated round dining table between catherine on one side and a lady to whom he had not been introduced contemplated the menu through his immovable eyeglass with satisfaction unfolded his napkin and continued the conversation with his hostess a few places away which the announcement of dinner had interrupted  you are quite right princess he admitted  the position of neutrals especially in the diplomatic world becomes in the case of a war like this most difficult and sometimes embarrassing to preserve a correct attitude is often a severe strain upon ones selfrestraint  the princess nodded sympathetically  a very charming young man the baron she confided to the general who had taken her in to dinner i knew his father and his uncle quite well in those happy days before the war when one used to move from country to country  diplomatic type of features the general remarked who hated all foreigners its rather bad luck on them he went on with bland insularity that the men of the european neutralsdutch danish norwegians or swedesall resemble germans so much more than englishmen  the baron turned towards catherine and ventured upon a whispered compliment she was wearing a wonderful prewar dress of black velvet closefitting yet nowhere cramping her naturally delightful figure a rope of pearls hung from her neckher only ornament  it is permitted countess to express ones appreciation of your toilette he ventured  in england it is not usual she reminded him with a smile but as you are such an old friend of the family we will call it permissible it is as a matter of fact the last gown i had from paris nowadays one thinks of other things  you are one of the few women he observed who mix in the great affairs and yet remain intensely feminine  just now she sighed the great affairs do not please me  yet they are interesting he replied the atmosphere at the present moment is electric charged with all manner of strange possibilities but we talk too seriously will you not let me know the names of some of your guests with general crossley i am already acquainted  they really dont count for very much she said a little carelessly this is entirely aunts friday night gathering and they are all her friends that is lady maltenby opposite you and her husband on the other side of my aunt  maltenby he repeated ah yes there is one son a brigadier is there not and another one sees sometimes about towna mr julian orden  he is the youngest son  am i exceeding the privileges of friendship countess the baron continued if i enquire whether there was not a rumour of an engagement between yourself and mr orden a few days ago  it is in the air she admitted but at present nothing is settled mr orden has peculiar habits he disappeared from society altogether a few days ago and has only just returned  a censor was he not  something of the sort catherine assented he went out to france though and did extremely well he lost his foot there  i have noticed that he uses a stick the baron remarked i always find him a young man of pleasant and distinguished appearance  well catherine continued that is mr braithwaiter the playwright a little to the leftthe man with the smooth grey hair and eyeglass mrs hamilton beardsmore you know of course her husband is commanding his regiment in egypt  the lady on my left  lady grayson she comes up from the country once a month to buy food you neednt mind her she is stone deaf and prefers dining to talking  i am relieved the baron confessed with a little sigh i addressed her as we sat down and she made no reply i began to wonder if i had offended  the man next me she went on is mr millson gray he is an american millionaire over here to study our ymca methods he can talk of nothing else in the world but ymca huts and american investments and he is very hungry  the conditions the baron observed seem favourable for a teteatete  catherine smiled up into his imperturbable face the wine had brought a faint colour to her cheeks and the young man sighed regretfully at the idea of her prospective engagement he had always been one of catherines most pronounced admirers  but what are we to talk about she asked on the really interesting subjects your lips are always closed you are a marvel of discretion you know baroneven to me  that is perhaps because you hide your real personality under so many aliases  i must think that over she murmured  you he continued are an aristocrat of the aristocrats i can quite conceive that you found your position in russia incompatible with modern ideas the russian aristocracy if you will forgive my saying so is in for a bad time which it has done its best to thoroughly deserve but in england your position is scarcely so comprehensible here you come to a sanely governed country which is to all effects and purposes a country governed by the people for the people yet here within two years you have made yourself one of the champions of democracy why the people are not illtreated on the contrary i should call them pampered  you do not understand she explained earnestly in russia it was the aristocracy who oppressed the people shamefully and malevolently in england it is the bourgeoisie who rule the country and stand in the light of labour it is the middleman the profiteer the new capitalist here who has become an ugly and a dominant power labour has the means by which to assert itself and to claim its rights but has never possessed the leaders or the training that has been the subject of my lectures over here from the beginning i want to teach the people how to crush the middleman i want to show them how to discover and to utilise their strength  is not that a little dangerous he enquired you might easily produce a state of chaos  for a time perhaps she admitted but never for long you see the british have one transcendental quality they possess common sense they are not idealists like the russians the men with whom i mix neither walk with their heads turned to the clouds nor do they grope about amongst the mud they just look straight ahead of them and they ask for what they see in the path  i see he murmured and now having reached just this stage in our conversation let me ask you this you read the newspapers  diligently she assured him  are you aware of a very curious note of unrest during the last few dayshints at a crisis in the war which nothing in the military situation seems to justifyvague but rather gloomy suggestions of an early peace  every one is talking about it she agreed i think that you and i have some idea as to what it means  have we he asked quietly  and somehow she went on dropping her voice a little i believe that your knowledge goes farther than mine  he gave no sign made no answer some question from across the table with reference to the action of one of his countrys ministers was referred to him he replied to it and drifted quite naturally into a general conversation without any evident effort he seemed to desire to bring his teteatete with catherine to a close she showed no sign of disappointment indeed she fell into his humour and made vigorous efforts to attack the subject of ymca huts with her neighbour on the right the rest of the meal passed in this manner and it was not until they met an hour later in the princess famous reception room that they exchanged more than a casual word the princess liked to entertain her guests in a fashion of her own the long apartment with its many recesses and deep windows an apartment which took up the whole of one side of the large house had all the dignity and even splendour of a drawingroom and yet with its little palm court its cosy divans its bridge tables and roulette board encouraged an air of freedom which made it eminently habitable  i wonder baron she asked what time you are leaving and whether i could rely upon your escort to the lawsons dance dont hesitate to say if you have an engagement as it only means my telephoning to some friends  i am entirely at your service countess he answered promptly as a matter of fact i have already promised to appear there myself for an hour  you would like to play bridge now perhaps she asked  the princess was kind enough to invite me he replied but i ventured to excuse myself i saw that the numbers were even without me and i hoped for a little more conversation with you  they seated themselves in an exceedingly comfortable corner a footman brought them coffee and a butler offered strange liqueurs catherine leaned back with a little sigh of relief  every one calls this room of my aunts the hotel lounge she remarked personally i love it  to me also it is the ideal apartment he confessed here we are alone and i may ask you a question which was on my lips when we had tea together at the carlton and which but for our environment i should certainly have asked you at dinner time  you may ask me anything she assured him with a little smile i am feeling happy and loquacious dont tempt me to talk or i shall give away all my lifes secrets  i will only ask you for one just now he promised is it true that you have today had some disagreement withshall i say a small congress of men who have their meetings down at westminster and with whom you have been in close touch for some time  her start was unmistakable  how on earth do you know anything about that  he shrugged his shoulders  these are the days he said when if one is to succeed in my profession one must know everything  she did not speak for a moment his question had been rather a shock to her in a moment or two however she found herself wondering how to use it for her own advantage  it is true she admitted  he looked intently at the point of his patent shoe  is this not a case countess he ventured in which you and i might perhaps come a little closer together  if you have anything to suggest i am ready to listen she said  i wonder he went on if i am right in some of my ideas i shall test them you have taken up your abode in england that was natural for domestic reasons you have shown a great interest in a certain section of the british public it is my theory that your interest in england is for that section only that as a country you are no more an admirer of her characteristics than i am  you are perfectly right she answered coolly  your interest he proceeded is in the men and women toilers of the world the people who carry on their shoulders the whole burden of life and whose position you are continually desiring to ameliorate i take it that your sympathy is international  it is she assented  people of this order insaygermany excite your sympathy in the same degree  absolutely  therefore he propounded you are working for the betterment of the least considered class whether it be german austrian british or french  that also is true she agreed  i pursue my theory then the issue of this war leaves you indifferent so long as the people come to their own  my work for the last few weeks amongst those men of whom you have been speaking she pointed out should prove that  we are through the wood and in the open then he declared with a little sigh of relief now i am prepared to trade secrets with you i am not a friend of this country neither my chief nor my government have the slightest desire to see england win the war  that i knew she acknowledged  now i ask you for information he continued tell me this your pseudofriends have presented the supposed german terms of peace to mr stenson what was the result  he is taking twentyfour hours to consider them  and what will happen if he refuses the baron asked leaning a little towards her will they use their mighty weapon will they really go the whole way or will they compromise  they will not compromise she assured him the telegrams to the secretaries of the various trades unions are already written out they will be despatched five minutes after mr stensons refusal to sue for an armistice has been announced  you know that he persisted  i know it beyond any shadow of doubt  he nodded slowly  your information he admitted is valuable to me well though i am served i cannot penetrate into the inner circles of the council itself your news is good  and now she said i expect the most amazing revelations from you  you shall have them with pleasure he replied freistner has been in a german fortress for some weeks and may be shot at any moment the supposed strength of the socialist party in germany is an utter sham the signatures attached to the document which was handed to your council some days ago will be repudiated the whole scheme of coming into touch with your labour classes has been fostered and developed by the german war cabinet england will be placed in the most humiliating and ridiculous position it will mean the end of the war  and germany she gasped  germany the baron pronounced calmly will have taken the first great step up the ladder in her climb towards the dominance of the world     chapter xix   there were one or two amongst those present in the council room at westminster that evening who noted and never forgot a certain indefinable dignity which seemed to come to stensons aid and enabled him to face what must have been an unwelcome and anxious ordeal without discomposure or disquiet he entered the room accompanied by julian and phineas cross and he had very much the air of a man who has come to pay a business visit concerning the final issue of which there could be no possible doubt he shook hands with the bishop gravely but courteously nodded to the others with whom he was acquainted asked the names of the few strangers present and made a careful mental note of what industries and districts they represented he then accepted a chair by the side of the bishop who immediately opened the proceedings  my friends the latter began as i sent word to you a little time ago mr stenson has preferred to bring you his answer himself our ambassadormr julian ordenwaited upon him at downing street at the hour arranged upon and in accordance with his wish to meet you all mr stenson is paying us this visit  the bishop hesitated and the prime minister promptly drew his chair a little farther into the circle  gentlemen he said the issue which you have raised is so tremendous and its results may well be so catastrophic that i thought it my duty to beg mr orden to arrange for me to come and speak to you all to explain to you face to face why on behalf of his majestys government i cannot do your bidding  you dont want peace then one of the delegates from the other side of the table asked bluntly  we do not was the quiet reply we are not ready for it  the country is fenn declared firmly we are  so your ambassador has told me was the calm reply in point of numbers you may be said perhaps to represent the nation in point of intellect of knowledgeof inner knowledge mindi claim that i represent it i tell you that a peace now even on the terms which your socialist allies in germany have suggested would be for us a peace of dishonour  will you tell us why the bishop begged  because it is not the peace we promised our dead or our living heroes mr stenson said slowly we set out to fight for democracyyour cause that fight would be a failure if we allowed the proudest the most autocratic the most conscienceless despot who ever sat upon a throne to remain in his place  but that is just what we shall not do fenn interrupted freistner has assured us of that the peace is not the kaisers peace it is the peace of the socialist party in germany and the day the terms are proclaimed democracy there will score its first triumph  i find neither in the european press nor in the reports of our secret service agents the slightest warrant for any such supposition mr stenson pronounced with emphasis  you have read freistners letter fenn asked  every word of it the prime minister replied i believe that freistner is an honest man as honest as any of you but i think that he is mistaken i do not believe that the german people are with him i am content to believe that those signatures are genuine i will even believe that germany would welcome those terms of peace although she would never allow them to proceed from her own cabinet but i do not believe that the clash and turmoil which would follow their publication would lead to the overthrow of the german dynasty you give me no proof of it gentlemen you have none yourselves and therefore i say that you propose to work in the dark and it seems to me that your work may lead to an evil end i want you to listen to me for one moment he went on his face lighting up with a flash of terrible earnestness i am not going to cast about in my mind for flowery phrases or epigrams we are plain men here together with our countrys fate in the balance for gods sake realise your responsibilities i want peace i ache for it but there will be no peace for europe while germany remains an undefeated autocracy weve promised our dead and our living to oust that corrupt monster from his throne weve promised it to france our glorious allies weve shaken hands about it with america whose ships are already crowding the seas and whose young manhood has taken the oath which ours has taken this isnt the time for peace i am not speaking in the dark when i tell you that we have a great movement pending in the west which may completely alter the whole military situation give us a chance if you carry out your threat you plunge this country into revolution you dishonour us in the face of our allies you will go through the rest of your lives every one of you with a guilt upon your souls a stain upon your consciences which nothing will ever obliterate you see i have kept my wordi havent said much i cannot ask for the armistice you suggest if you take this step you threateni do not deny its significance you will probably stop the war one of you will come in and take my place there will be turmoil confusion very likely bloodshed i know what the issue will be and yet i know my duty there is not one member of my cabinet who is not with me we refuse your appeal  every one at the table seemed to be talking at the same time to every one else then crosss voice rose above the others he rose to his feet to ensure attention  bishop he said there is one point in what mr stenson has been saying which i think we might and ought to consider a little more fully and that is what guarantees have we that freistner really has the people at the back of him that hell be able to cleanse that rat pit at berlin of the hohenzollern and his clan of junkersthe most accursed type of politician who ever breathed we ought to be very sure about this fenns our man what about it fenn  freistners letters for weeks fenn answered have spoken of the wonderful wave of socialistic feeling throughout the country he is an honest man and he does not exaggerate he assures us that half the nation is pledged  one man david sands remarked thoughtfully if there is a weak point about this business which i am not prepared wholly to admit it is that the entire job on that side seems to be run by one man theres a score of us i should like to hear of more on the other side  it is strange mr stenson pointed out that so little news of this gain of strength on the part of the socialists has been allowed to escape from germany however rigid their censorship copies of german newspapers reach us every day from neutral countries i cannot believe that socialism has made the advance freistner claims for it and i agree with our friends mr cross and mr sands here that you ought to be very sure that freistner is not deceived before you take this extreme measure  we are content to trust to our brothers in germany fenn declared  i am not convinced that we should be wise to do so julian intervened i am in favour of our taking a few more days to consider this matter  and i am against any delay fenn objected hotly i am for immediate action  let me explain where i think we have been a little hasty julian continued earnestly i gather that the whole correspondence between this body and the socialist party in germany has been carried on by mr fenn and freistner there are other wellknown socialists in germany but from not one of these have we received any direct communication furthermoreand i say this without wishing to impugn in any way the care with which i am sure our secretary has transcribed these lettersat a time like this i am forced to remember that i have seen nothing but copies  fenn was on his feet in a moment white with passion  do you mean to insinuate that i have altered or forged the letters he shouted  i have made no insinuations julian replied at the same time before we proceed to extremities i propose that we spend half an hour studying the originals  thats common sense cross declared theres no one can object to that im none so much in favour of these typewritten slips myself  fenn turned to whisper to bright mr stenson rose to his feet the glare of the unshaded lamp fell upon his strained face he seemed to have grown older and thinner since his entrance into the room  i can neither better nor weaken my cause by remaining he said only let this be my parting word to you upon my soul as an englishman i believe that if you send out those telegrams tonight if you use your hideous and deadly weapon against me and the government i believe that you will be guilty of this countrys ruin as you certainly will of her dishonour you have the example of russia before you and i will tell you this too which take into your hearts there isnt one of those men who are marching perhaps tonight perhaps tomorrow to a possible death who would thank you for trying to save their lives or bodies at the expense of englands honour those about to die would be your sternest critics i can say no more  julian walked with the premier towards the door  mr stenson he declared you have said just what could be said from your point of view and god knows even now who is in the right you are looking at the future with a very full knowledge of many things of which we are all ignorant you have quite naturally too the politicians hatred of the methods these people propose i myself am inclined to think that they are a little hasty  orden mr stenson replied sternly i did not come to you tonight as a politician i have spoken as a man and an englishman as i speak to you now for the love of your country and her honour use your influence with these people stop those telegrams work for delay at any cost theres something inexplicable sinister about the whole business freistner may be an honest man but ill swear that he hasnt the influence or the position that these people have been led to believe and as for nicholas fenn  the prime minister paused julian waited anxiously  it is my belief the former concluded deliberately that thirty seconds in the courtyard of the tower with his back to the light would about meet his case  they parted at the door and julian returned to his seat uneasy and perplexed around the council table voices were raised in anger fenn who was sitting moodily with folded arms his chair drawn a little back from the table scowled at him as he took his place furley who had been whispering to the bishop turned towards julian  it seems he announced that the originals of most of freistners communications have been destroyed  and why not fenn demanded passionately why should i keep letters which would lay a rope around my neck any day they were found you all know as well as i do that weve been expecting the police to raid the place ever since we took it  i am a late comer julian observed but surely some of you others have seen the original communications  thomas evans spoke up from the other end of the tablea small sturdily built man a great power in south wales  to be frank he said i dont like these insinuations fenns been our secretary from the first he opened the negotiations and hes carried them through we either trust him or we dont i trust him  and im not saying youre not right lad cross declared im for being cautious but its more with the idea that our german friends themselves may be a little too sanguine  i will pledge my word fenn pronounced fiercely to the truth of all the facts i have laid before you whatever my work may have been today it is completed i have brought you a peoples peace from germany this very council was formed for the purpose of imposing that peace upon the government are you going to back out now because a dilettante writer an aristocrat who never did a stroke of work in his life casts sneering doubts upon my honesty ive done the work you gave me to do its up to you to finish it i represent a million working men so does david sands there evans and cross and you others what does orden represent nobody and nothing miles furley a little band of socialists who live in their gardens and keep bees my lord bishop just his congregation from week to week yet its these outsiders whove come in and disturbed us ive had enough of it and them weve wasted the night but i propose that the telegrams go out at eight oclock tomorrow morning hands up for it  it was a counterattack which swept everything before it every hand in the room except the bishops furleys crosss and julians was raised fenn led the way towards the door  weve our work to do chaps he said well leave the others to talk till daylight if they want to     chapter xx   julian and furley left the place together they looked for the bishop but found that he had slipped away  to downing street i believe furley remarked he has some vague idea of suggesting a compromise  compromise julian repeated a little drearily how can there be any such thing there might be delay i think we ought to have given stenson a weektime to communicate with america and send a mission to france  we are like all theorists furley declared moodily stopping to relight his pipe we create and destroy on palter with amazing facility when it comes to practice we are funks  are you funking this julian asked bluntly  how can any one help it theoretically we are righti am sure of it if we leave it to the politicians this war will go dragging on for god knows how long its the people who are paying its the people who ought to make the peace the only thing that bothers me is whether we are doing it the right way is freistner honest could he be selfdeceived is there any chance that he could be playing into the hands of the pangermans  fenn is the man who has had most to do with him julian remarked i wouldnt trust fenn a yard but i believe in freistner  so do i furley assented but is fenns report of his promises and the strength of his followers entirely honest  thats the part of the whole thing i dont like julian acknowledged fenns practically the corner stone of this affair it was he who met freistner in amsterdam and started these negotiations and im damned if i like fenn or trust him did you see the way he looked at stenson out of the corners of his eyes like a little ferret stenson was at his best too i never admired the man more  he certainly kept his head furley agreed his few straight words were to the point too  it wasnt the occasion for eloquence julian declared thatll come next week i suppose hell try and break the trades unions what a chance for an edmund burke its all right i suppose but i wonder why im feeling so damned miserable  the fact is furley confided you and i and the bishop and miss abbeway are all to a certain extent out of place on that council we ought to have contented ourselves with having supplied the ideas when it comes to the practical side our other instincts revolt after all if we believed that by continuing the war we could beat germany from a military point of view i suppose we should forget a lot of this admirable reasoning of ours and let it go on  it doesnt seem a fair bargain though julian sighed its the lives of our men today for the freedom of their descendants if that isnt frittered away by another race of politicians it isnt good enough miles  then lets be thankful its going to stop furley declared weve pinned our colours to the mast julian i dont like fenn any more than you do nor do i trust him but i cant see in this instance that he has anything to gain by not running straight besides he cant have faked the terms and thats the only document that counts and so good night and to bed he added pausing at the street corner where they parted  there was something curiously different about the demeanour of julians trusted servant as he took his masters coat and hat even julian engrossed as he was in the happenings of the evening could scarcely fail to notice it  you seem out of sorts tonight robert he remarked  the latter whose manners were usually suave and excellent answered almost harshly  i have enough to make me so sirmore than enough i wish to give a weeks notice  been drinking robert his master enquired  the man smiled mirthlessly  i am quite sober sir he answered but i should be glad to go at once it would be better for both of us  what have you against me julian asked puzzled  the lives of my two boys was the fierce reply freds gone nowdied in hospital last night it was you who talked them into soldiering  julians manner changed at once and his tone became kinder  you are very foolish to blame anybody robert your sons did their duty if they hadnt joined up when they did they would have had to join as conscripts later on  their duty robert repeated with smothered scorn their duty to a squirming nest of cowardly politiciansbegging your pardon sir why the whole government isnt worth the blood of one of them  i am sorry about fred julian said sympathetically all the same robert you must try and pull yourself together  the man groaned  pull myself together he said angrily mr orden sir im trying to keep respectful but its a hard thing ive been reading the evening papers theres an article signed paul fiske in the pall mall they tell me that youre paul fiske youre for peace it seemsfor peace with the german emperor and his bloody crew  i am in favour of peace on certain terms at the earliest possible moment julian admitted  thats where youve sold us thensold us all robert declared fiercely my boys died believing they were fighting for men who would keep their word the war was to go on till victory was won they died happily believing that those who had spoken for england would keep their word youre very softhearted in that article sir about the living did you think when you sat down to write it about the deadabout that wilderness of white crosses out in france youre proposing in cold blood to let those devils stay on their own dunghill  it is a very large question robert julian reminded him the war is fast reaching a period of mutual exhaustion  the man threw all restraint to the winds  claptrap was his angry reply you wealthy people want your fleshpots again weve a few more million men havent we america has a few more millions  your own loss robert has made youand quite naturally toovery bitter his master said gently you must let those who have thought this matter out come to a decision upon it beyond a certain point the manhood of the world must be conserved  that sounds just like fine talk to me sir and no more the sort of stuff thats printed in articles and that no one takes much stock of words were plain enough when we started out to fight this war we were going to crush the german military spirit and not leave off fighting until wed done it there was nothing said then about conserving millions of men it was to be fought out to the end whatever it cost  and you were once a pacifist  pacifist the man repeated passionately every human being with common sense was a pacifist when the war started  but the war was forced upon us julian reminded him you cant deny that  no one wishes to sir it was forced upon us all right but who made it necessary why our rotten government for the last twenty years our politicians mr julian that are prating now of peace before their jobs done do you think that if wed paid our insurance like men and been prepared this war would ever have come not it we asked for trouble and we got it in the neck if we make peace now well be a german colony in twenty years thanks to mr stenson and you and the rest of them a man can be a pacifist all right until his head has been punched afterwards theres another name for him is there anything more i can get you tonight before i leave sir  nothing thanks im sorry about fred  julian conscious of an intense weariness undressed and went to bed very soon after the mans departure he was already in his first doze when he awoke suddenly with a start he sat up and listened the sound which had disturbed him was repeateda quiet but insistent ringing of the frontdoor bell he glanced at his watch it was barely midnight but unusually late for a visitor once more the bell rang and this time he remembered that robert slept out and that he was alone in the flat he thrust his feet into slippers wrapped his dressing gown around him and made his way to the front door  julians only idea had been that this might be some messenger from the council to his amazement he found himself confronted by catherine  close the door she begged come into your sitting room  she pushed past him and he obeyed still dumb with surprise and the shock of his sudden awakening catherine herself seemed unaware of his unusual costume reckless of the hour and the strangeness of her visit she wore a long chinchilla coat covering her from head to foot and a mantilla veil about her head which partially obscured her features as soon as she raised it he knew that great things had happened her cheeks were the colour of ivory and her eyes unnaturally distended her tone was steady but full of repressed passion  julian she cried we have been deceivedtricked i have come to you for help are the telegrams sent out yet  they go at eight oclock in the morning he replied  thank god we are in time to stop them  julian looked at her for a moment utterly incredulous  stop them he repeated but how can we stenson has declared war  thank heaven for that she exclaimed her voice trembling julian the whole thing is an accursed plot the german socialists have never increased their strength except in their own imaginations they are absolutely powerless this is the most cunning scheme of the whole war freistner has simply been the tool of the militarists they encouraged him to put forward these proposals and to communicate with nicholas fenn when the armistice has been declared and negotiations begun the three signatures will be repudiated the peace they mean to impose is one of their own dictation and in the meantime we shall have created a cataclysm here the war will never start again all the allies will be at a discord  how have you found this out julian gasped  from one of germanys chief friends in england he is high up in the diplomatic service ofof a neutral country but he has been working for germany ever since the commencement of the war he has been helping in this he has seen me often with nicholas fenn and he believes that i am behind the scenes too he believes that i know the truth and that i am working for germany he is absolutely to be relied upon every word that i am telling you is the truth  what about fenn julian demanded breathlessly  nicholas fenn has had a hundred thousand pounds of german money within the last few months she replied he is one of the foulest traitors who ever breathed freistners first few letters were genuine enough but for the last six weeks he has been imprisoned in a german fortressand fenn knows it  have you any proof of all this julian asked remember we have the council to face and they are all girt for battle  yes i have proof she answered indirect but damning enough this man has sometimes forwarded and collected for me letters from connections of mine in germany he handed me one tonight from a distant cousin you know him by name general geroldberg the first two pages are personal read what he says towards the end she added passing it on to julian  julian turned up the lamp and read the few lines to which she pointed  by the bye dear cousin if you should receive a shock within the next few days by hearing that our three great men have agreed to an absurd peace do not worry their signatures have been obtained for some document which we do not regard seriously and it is their intention to repudiate them as soon as a certain muchlooked for event takes place when the peace comes believe me it will be a glorious one for us what we have won by the sword we shall hold and what has been wrested from us by cunning and treachery we shall regain  that man catherine declared is one of the kaisers intimates he is one of the twelve iron men of germany now i will tell you the name of the man with whom i have spent the evening it is baron hellman believe me he knows and he has told me the truth he has had this letter by him for a fortnight as he told me frankly that he thought it too compromising to hand over tonight he changed his mind  julian stood speechless for a moment his fists clenched his eyes ablaze  catherine threw herself into his easychair and loosened her coat  oh i am tired she moaned give me some water please or some wine  he found some hock in the sideboard and after she had drunk it they sat for some few minutes in agitated silence the street sounds outside had died away julians was the topmost flat in the block and their isolation was complete he suddenly realised the position  perhaps he suggested with an almost ludicrous return to the commonplace the first thing to be done is for me to dress  she looked at him as though she had noticed his dishabille for the first time for a moment their feet seemed to be on the earth again  i suppose i seem to you crazy to come to you at such an hour she said one doesnt think of those things somehow  you are quite right he agreed they are unimportant  then suddenly the sense of the silence of their solitude of their strange uncertain relations to one another swept in upon them both for a moment the sense of the great burden she was carrying fell from catherines shoulders she was back in a simpler world julian was no longer a leader of the people the brilliant sociologist the apostle of her creed he was the man who during the last few weeks had monopolised her thoughts to an amazing extent the man for whose aid and protection she had hastened the man to whom she was perfectly content to entrust the setting right of this ghastly blunder watching him she suddenly felt that she was tired of it all that she would like to creep away from the storm and rest somewhere the quiet and his presence seemed to soothe her her tense expression relaxed her eyes became softer she smiled at him gratefully  oh i cannot tell you she exclaimed how glad i am to be with you just now everything in the outside world seems so terrible do you mindit is so silly but after all a woman cannot be as strong as a man can shewould you mind very much just holding my hand for a moment and staying here quite quietly i have had a horrible evening and when i came in my head felt as though it would burst you do not mind  julian smiled as he leaned towards her a kind of resentment of which he had been conscious even though in some measure ashamed of it resentment at her unswerving loyalty to the task she had set herself melted away he suddenly knew why he had kissed her on that sunny morning on the marshes an ecstatic and incomprehensible moment which had seemed sometimes during these days of excitement as though it had belonged to another life and another world he took both her hands in his and stooping down kissed her on the lips  dear catherine he said i am so glad that you came to me i think that during these last few days we have forgotten to be human and it might help usfor after all you know we are engaged  but that she whispered was only for my sake  at first perhaps he admitted but now for mine  her little sigh of content as she stole nearer to him was purely feminine the moments ticked on in restful and wonderful silence then unwillingly she drew away from his protecting arm  my dear she said you look so nice as you are and it is such happiness to be here but there is a great task before us  you are right he declared straightening himself wait for a few minutes dear we shall find them all at westminsterthe place will be open all night close your eyes and rest while i am away  i am rested she answered softly but do not be long the car is outside and on the way i have more to tell you about nicholas fenn     chapter xxi   if the closely drawn blinds of the many windows of westminster buildings could have been raised that night and early morning the place would have seemed a very hive of industry twenty men were hard at work in twenty different rooms some went about their labours doubtfully some almost timorously some with jubilation one or two with real regret under their fingers grew the more amplified mandates which following upon the bombshell of the already prepared telegrams were within a few hours to paralyse industrial england to keep her ships idle in the docks her trains motionless upon the rails her mines silent her forges cold her great factories empty even the least imaginative felt the thrill the awe of the thing he was doing on paper in the brain it seemed so wonderful so logical so certain of the desired result and now there were other thoughts forcing their way to the front how would their names live in history how would englishmen throughout the world regard this deed was it really the truth they were following or some false and ruinous shadow these were fugitive doubts perhaps but to more than one of those midnight toilers they presented themselves in the guise of a chill and drear presentiment  they all heard a motorcar stop outside no one however thought it worth while to discontinue his labours for long enough to look out and see who this nocturnal visitor might be in a very short time however these labours were disturbed from room to room julian with catherine and the bishop for whom they had called on the way passed with a brief message no one made any difficulty about coming to the council room the first protest was made when they paid the visit which they had purposely left until last nicholas fenn had apparently finished or discontinued his efforts he was seated in front of his desk his chin almost resting upon his folded arms and a cigarette between his lips bright was lounging in an easychair within a few feet of him their heads were close together their conversation whatever the subject of it may have been was conducted in whispers apparently they had not heard julians knock for they started apart when the door was opened like conspirators there was something halffearful halfmalicious in fenns face as he stared at them  what are you doing here he demanded whats wrong  julian closed the door  a great deal he replied curtly we have been around to every one of the delegates and asked them to assemble in the council room will you and bright come at once  fenn looked from one to the other of his visitors and remained silent for a few seconds  climbing down eh he asked viciously  we have some information to communicate julian announced  fenn moved abruptly away out of the shadow of the electric lamp which hung over his desk his voice was anxious unnatural  we cant consider any more information he said harshly our decisions have been taken nothing can affect them thats the worst of having you outsiders on the board i was certain you wouldnt face it when the time came  as you yourself julian remarked are somewhat concerned in this matter i think it would be well if you came with the others  i am not going to stir from this room fenn declared doggedly i have my own work to do and as to my being concerned with what you have to say ill thank you to mind your own business and leave mine alone  mr fenn the bishop interposed i beg to offer you my advice that you join us at once in the council room  julian and catherine had already left the room fenn leaned forward and there was an altered note in his tone  whats it mean bishop he asked hoarsely are they ratting those two  what we have come here to say the bishop rejoined must be said to every one  he turned away fenn and bright exchanged quick glances  what do you make of it asked fenn  theyve changed their minds bright muttered thats all theyre theorists damn all theorists they just blow bubbles to destroy them as for the girl shes been at parties all the evening as we know  youre right fenn acknowledged i was a fool come on  many of the delegates had the air of being glad to escape for a few minutes from their tasks one or two of them entered the room carrying a cup of coffee or cocoa most of them were smoking fenn and bright made their appearance last of all the latter made a feeble attempt at a goodhumoured remark  is this a pause for refreshments he asked if so im on  julian who had been waiting near the door locked it fenn started  what the devils that for he demanded  just a precaution we dont want to be interrupted  julian moved towards a little vacant space at the end of the table and stood there his hands upon the back of a chair the bishop remained by his side his eyes downcast as though in prayer catherine had accepted the seat pushed forward by cross the atmosphere of the room which at first had been only expectant became tense  my friends julian began a few hours ago you came to a momentous decision you are all at work prepared to carry that decision into effect i have come to see you because i am very much afraid that we have been the victims of false statements the victims of a disgraceful plot  rubbish fenn scoffed youre ratting thats what you are  youd better thank providence julian replied sternly that there is time for you to rat toothat is if you have any care for your country now mr fenn i am going to ask you a question you led us to believe this evening that although all letters had been destroyed you were in constant communication with freistner when did you hear from him lastpersonally i mean  last week fenn answered boldly and the week before that  and you have destroyed those letters  of course i have why should i keep stuff about that would hang me  you cannot produce then any communication from freistner except the proposals of peace written within the lastsaymonth  what the mischief are you getting at fenn demanded hotly and what right have you to stand there and crossquestion me  the right of being prepared to call you to your face a liar julian said gravely we have very certain information that freistner is now imprisoned in a german fortress and will be shot before the week is out  there was a little murmur of consternation even of disbelief fenn himself was speechless julian went on eagerly  my friends he said on paper on the facts submitted to us we took the right decision but we ought to have remembered this germanys word germanys signature germanys honour are not worth a rap when opposed to german interests germany notwithstanding all her successes is thirsting for peace this armistice would be her salvation she set herself out to get itnot honestly as we have been led to believe but by means of a devilish plot she professed to be overawed by the peace desires of the reichstag the pangermans professed a desire to give in to the socialists all lies they encouraged freistner to continue his negotiations here with fenn freistner was honest enough i am not so sure about fenn  fenn sprang to his feet a blasphemous exclamation broke from his lips julian faced him unmoved the atmosphere of the room was now electric  i am going to finish what i have to say he went on i know that every one will wish me to we are all here to look for the truth and nothing else and thanks to miss abbeway we have stumbled upon it these peace proposals which look so well on paper are a decoy they were made to be broken those signatures are affixed to be repudiated i say that freistner has been a prisoner for weeks and i deny that fenn has received a single communication from him during that time fenn asserts that he has but has destroyed them i repeat that he is a liar  thats plain speaking cross declared now then fenn lad what have you to say about it  fenn leaned forward his face distorted with something which might have been anger but which seemed more closely to resemble fear  this is just part of the ratting he exclaimed i never keep a communication from freistner i have told you so before the preliminary letters i had you all saw and we deliberated upon them together since then all that i have had have been friendly messages which i have destroyed  there was a little uncertain murmur julian proceeded  you see he said mr fenn is not able to clear himself from my first accusation now let us hear what he will do with this one mr fenn started life i believe as a schoolmaster at a parish school a very laudable and excellent occupation he subsequently became manager to a firm of timber merchants in the city and commenced to interest himself in labour movements he rose by industry and merit to his present positiona very excellent career but not i should think a remunerative one shall we put his present salary down at ten pounds a week  what the devil concern is this of yours the goaded man shouted  of mine and all of us julian retorted for i come now to a certain question will you disclose your bank book  fenn reeled for a moment in his seat he affected not to have heard the question  my what he stammered  your bank book julian repeated calmly as you only received your last instalment from germany this week you probably have not yet had time to purchase stocks and shares or property wherever your inclination leads you i imagine therefore that there would be a balance there of something like thirty thousand pounds the last payment made to you by a german agent now in london  fenn sprang to his feet he had all the appearance of a man about to make a vigorous and exhaustive defence and then suddenly he swayed his face became horrible to look upon his lips were twisted  brandy he cried some one give me brandy i am ill  he collapsed in a heap they carried him on to a seat set against the wall and catherine bent over him he lay there moaning they loosened his collar and poured restoratives between his teeth for a time he was silent then the moaning began again julian returned to the table  believe me he said earnestly this is as much a tragedy to me as to any one present i believe that every one of you here except he glanced towards the sofaexcept those whom we will not name have gone into this matter honestly as i did weve got to chuck it tear up your telegrams let me go to see stenson this minute i see the truth about this thing now as i never saw it before there is no peace for us with germany until she is on her knees until we have taken away all her power to do further mischief when that time comes let us be generous let us remember that her working men are of the same flesh and blood as ours and need to live as you need to live let us see that they are left the means to live mercy to all of themmercy and all the possibilities of a free and generous life but to hell with every one of those who are responsible for the poison which has crept throughout all ranks in germany which starting from the kaiser and his friends has corrupted first the proud aristocracy then the industrious hardworking and worthy middle classes and has even permeated to some extent the ranks of the people themselves destined by their infamous ruler to carry on their shoulders the burden of an unnatural ungodly and unholy ambition there is much that i ought to say but i fancy that i have said enough germany must be broken and you can do it let the memory of those undispatched telegrams help you spend your time amongst the men you represent make them see the truth make them understand that every burden they lift every time they wield the pickaxe every blow they strike in their daily work helps i was going to speak about what we owe to the dead i wont we must beat germany to her knees we can and we will then will come the time for generosity  phineas cross struck the table with the flat of his hand  boys he said i feel the sweat in every pore of my body weve nigh done a horrible thing we are with you mr orden but about that little skunk there how did you find him out  through miss abbeway julian answered you have her to thank i can assure you that every charge i have made can be substantiated  there was a little murmur of confidence everyone seemed to find speech difficult  one word more julian went on dont disband this council keep it together just as it is keep this building keep our association and sanctify it to one purposevictory  a loud clamour of applause answered him once more cross glanced towards the prostrate form upon the sofa  let no one interfere julian enjoined there is an act which will deal with him he will be removed from this place presently and he will not be heard of again for a little time we dont want a soul to know how nearly we were duped it rests with every one of you to destroy all the traces of what might have happened you can do this if you will tomorrow call a meeting of the council appoint a permanent chairman a new secretary draw out a syllabus of action for promoting increased production for stimulating throughout every industry a passionate desire for victory if speaking writing or help of mine in any way is wanted it is yours i will willingly be a disciple of the cause but this morning let me be your ambassador let me go to the premier with a message from you let me tell him what you have resolved  hands up all in favour cross exclaimed  every hand was raised bright came back from the couch blinking underneath his heavy spectacles but meekly acquiescent  let us remember this hour the bishop begged as something solemn in our lives the council of labour shall justify itself shall voice the will or the people fighting for victory  for the peace which comes through victory julian echoed     chapter xxii   the bishop and catherine a few weeks later walked side by side up the murky length of st pancras platform the train which they had come to meet was a quarter of an hour late and they had fallen into a sort of reminiscent conversation which was not without interest to both of them  i left mr stenson only an hour ago the bishop observed he could talk about nothing but julian orden and his wonderful speeches they say that at sheffield and newcastle the enthusiasm was tremendous and at three shipbuilding yards on the clyde the actual work done for the week after his visit was nearly as much again he seems to have that extraordinary gift of talking straight to the hearts of the men he makes them feel  mr stenson wrote me about it catherine told her companion with a little smile he said that no dignity that could be thought of or invented would be an adequate offering to julian for his services to the country for the first time since the war labour seems wholly and entirely passionately almost in earnest every one of those delegates went back full of enthusiasm and with every one of them julian before he has finished is going to make a little tour in his own district  and after tomorrow the bishop remarked with a smile i suppose he will not be alone  she pressed his arm  it is very wonderful to think about she said quietly i am going to try and be julians secretarywhilst we are away at any rate  it isnt often the bishop reflected that i have the chance of a few minutes quiet conversation on the day before her wedding with the woman whom i am going to marry to the man i think most of on earth  give me some good advice she begged  the bishop shook his head  you dont need it he said a wife who loves her husband needs very few words of admonition there are marriages so often in which one can see the rocks ahead that one opens ones prayerbook even with a little tremor of fear but with you and julian it is different  there is nothing that a woman can do for the man whom she loves she declared softly which i shall not try to do for julian  they paced up and down for a few moments in silence the bishops step was almost buoyant he seemed to have lost all that weary load of anxiety which had weighed him down during the last few months catherine too in her becoming grey furs her face flushed with excitement had the air of one who has thrown all anxiety to the winds  julians gift of speech must have surprised even himself the bishop remarked of course we always knew that paul fiske when he was found must be a brilliant person but i dont think that even julian himself had any suspicion of his oratorical powers  i dont think he had she agreed in his first letter he told me that it was just like sitting down at his desk to write except that all the dull material impedimenta of paper and ink and walls seemed rolled away and the men to whom he wished his words to travel were there waiting of course he is wonderful but phineas cross david sands and some of the others have shown a positive genius for organisation that council of socialism trades unionism and labour generally which was formed to bring us premature peace seems for the first time to have brought all labour into one party labour in its very broadest sense i mean  the truth of the matter is the bishop pronounced that the people have accepted the dictum that whatever form of republicanism is aimed at there must be government a body of men who realise that however advanced their ideas can do but little harm i am perfectly certainstenson admits it himselfthat before very long we shall have a labour ministry who cares it will probably be a good ministrygood for the country and good for the world there has been too much juggling in international politics this war is going to end that once and for ever by the bye he went on in an altered tone there is one question which i have always had in my mind to ask you if i do so now will you please understand that if you think it best you need not answer me  certainly catherine replied  from what source did you get your information which saved us all  it came to me from a man who is dead was the quiet answer  the bishop looked steadily ahead at the row of signal lights  there was a young foreigner some weeks ago he said a baron hellmanquite a distinguished person i believewho was discovered shot in his rooms  she acquiesced silently  if you were to go to the home office and were able to persuade them to treat you candidly i think that you could discover some wonderful things she confided i wish i could believe that the baron was the only one who has been living in this country unsuspected and occupying a prominent position who was really in the pay of germany  it was a very subtle conspiracy the bishop remarked thoughtfully subtle because in a sense it appeared so genuine it appealed to the very best instincts of thinking men  good has come out of it at any rate she reminded him westminster buildings is now the centre of patriotic england labour was to have brought the war to an endfor germany it is labour which is going to win the victoryfor england  the train rolled into the station and rapidly disgorged its crowd of passengers amongst whom julian was one of the first to alight catherine found herself trembling the shy words of welcome which had formed themselves in her mind died away on her lips as their glances met she lifted her face to his  julian she murmured i am so proudso happy  the bishop left them as they stepped into their cab  i am going to a mission room in the neighbourhood he explained we have war talks every week i try to tell them how things are going on and we have a short service but before i go mr stenson has sent you a little message julian if you go to your club later on tonight you will see it in the telegrams or you will find it in your newspapers in the morning there has been wonderful fighting in flanders today the german line has been broken at half a dozen points we have taken nearly twenty thousand prisoners and zeebrugge is threatened farther south the americans have made their start and have won a complete victory over the crown princes picked troops  the two men wrung hands  this julian declared is the only way to peace
