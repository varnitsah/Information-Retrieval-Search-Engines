from rome stood by the window looking out over the rainswept steaming quays to notre dame on the island yonder overhead rolled and crackled the artillery of an april thunderstorm and mr caryll looking out upon paris in her shroud of rain under her pall of thundercloud felt himself at harmony with nature over his heart too the gloom of storm was lowering just as in his heart it was still little more than april time  behind him in that chamber furnished in dark oak and leather of a reign or two ago sat sir richard everard at a vast writingtable all alitter with books and papers and sir richard watched his adoptive son with fierce melancholy eyes watched him until he grew impatient of this pause  well demanded the old baronet harshly will you undertake it justin now that the chance has come and he added youll never hesitate if you are the man i have sought to make you  mr caryll turned slowly it is because i am the man that youthat god and youhave made me that i do hesitate  his voice was quiet and pleasantly modulated and he spoke english with the faintest slurperceptible perhaps only to the keenest earof a french accent to ears less keen it would merely seem that he articulated with a precision so singular as to verge on pedantry  the light falling full upon his profile revealed the rather singular countenance that was his own it was not in any remarkable beauty that its distinction lay for by the canons of beauty that prevail it was not beautiful the features were irregular and inclined to harshness the nose was too abruptly arched the chin too long and square the complexion too pallid yet a certain dignity haunted that youthful face of such a quality as to stamp it upon the memory of the merest passerby the mouth was difficult to read and full of contradictions the lips were full and red and you would declare them the lips of a sensualist but for the line of stern almost grim determination in which they met and yet somewhere behind that grimness there appeared to lurk a haunting whimsicality a smile seemed ever to impend but whether sweet or bitter none could have told until it broke the eyes were as remarkable wideset and slowmoving as becomes the eyes of an observant man they were of an almost greenish color and so level in their ordinary glance as to seem imbued with an uncanny penetration his hairhe dared to wear his own and clubbed it in a broad ribbon of watered silkwas almost of the hue of bronze with here and there a glint of gold and as luxuriant as any wig  for the rest he was scarcely above the middle height of an almost frail but very graceful slenderness and very graceful too in all his movements in dress he was supremely elegant with the elegance of france that in england would be accounted foppishness he wore a suit of dark blue cloth with white satin linings that were revealed when he moved it was heavily laced with gold and a ramiform pattern broidered in gold thread ran up the sides of his silk stockings of a paler blue jewels gleamed in the brussels at his throat and there were diamond buckles on his lacquered redheeled shoes  sir richard considered him with anxiety and some chagrin justin he cried a world of reproach in his voice what can you need to ponder  whatever it may be said mr caryll it will be better that i ponder it now than after i have pledged myself  but what is it what demanded the baronet  i am marvelling for one thing that you should have waited thirty years  sir richards fingers stirred the papers before him in an idle absent manner into his brooding eyes there leapt the glitter to be seen in the eyes of the fevered of body or of mind  vengeance said he slowly is a dish best relished when tis eaten cold he paused an instant then continued i might have crossed to england at the time and slain him should that have satisfied me what is death but peace and rest  there is a hell we are told mr caryll reminded him  ay was the answer we are told but i dursnt risk its being false where ostermore is concerned so i preferred to wait until i could brew him such a cup of bitterness as no man ever drank ere he was glad to die in a quieter retrospective voice he continued had we prevailed in the 15 i might have found a way to punish him that had been worthy of the crime that calls for it we did not prevail moreover i was taken and transported  what think you justin gave me courage to endure the rigors of the plantations cunning and energy to escape after five such years of it as had assuredly killed a stronger man less strong of purpose what but the task that was awaiting me it imported that i should live and be free to call a reckoning in full with my lord ostermore before i go to my own account  opportunity has gone lame upon this journey but it has arrived at last unless he paused his voice sank from the high note of exaltation to which it had soared it became charged with dread as did the fierce eyes with which he raked his companions face unless you prove false to the duty that awaits you and that ill not believe you are your mothers son justin  and my fathers too answered justin in a thick voice and the earl of ostermore is that same father  the more sweetly shall your mother be avenged cried the other and again his eyes blazed with that unhealthy fanatical light what fitter than the hand of that poor ladys son to pull your father down in ruins he laughed short and fiercely it seldom chances in this world that justice is done so nicely  you hate him very deeply said mr caryll pensively and the look in his eyes betrayed the trend of his thoughts they were of pitybut of pity at the futility of such strong emotions  as deeply as i loved your mother justin the sharp rugged features of that seared old face seemed of a sudden transfigured and softened the wild eyes lost some of their glitter in a look of wistfulness as he pondered a moment the one sweet memory in a wasted life a life wrecked over thirty years agowrecked wantonly by that same ostermore of whom they spoke who had been his friend  a groan broke from his lips he took his head in his hands and elbows on the table he sat very still a moment reviewing as in a flash the events of thirty and more years ago when he and viscount rotherbyas ostermore was thenhad been young men at the st germains court of james ii  it was on an excursion into normandy that they had met mademoiselle de maligny the daughter of an impoverished gentleman of the chetive noblesse of that province both had loved her she had preferredas women willthe outward handsomeness of viscount rotherby to the sounder heart and brain that were dick everards as bold and dominant as any ruffler of them all where men and perils were concerned young everard was timid bashful and without assertiveness with women he had withdrawn from the contest ere it was well lost leaving an easy victory to his friend  and how had that friend used it most foully as you shall learn  leaving rotherby in normandy everard had returned to paris the affairs of his king gave him cause to cross at once to ireland for three years he abode there working secretly in his masters interest to little purpose be it confessed at the end of that time he returned to paris rotherby was gone it appeared that his father lord ostermore had prevailed upon bentinck to use his influence with william on the errant youths behalf rotherby had been pardoned his loyalty to the fallen dynasty a deserter in every sense he had abandoned the fortunes of king jameswhich in everards eyes was bad enoughand he had abandoned the sweet lady he had fetched out of normandy six months before his going of whom it seemed that in his lordly way he was grown tired  from the beginning it would appear they were illmatched it was her beauty had made appeal to him even as his beauty had enamoured her elementals had brought about their union and when these elementals shrank with habit as elementals will they found themselves without a tie of sympathy or common interest to link them each to the other she was by nature blythe a thing of sunshine flowers and music who craved a very poet for her lover and by a poet i mean not your mere rhymer he was downright stolid and stupid under his fine exterior the worst type of briton without the saving grace of a britons honor and so she had wearied him who saw in her no more than a sweet loveliness that had cloyed him presently and when the chance was offered him by bentinck and his father he took it and went his ways and this sweet flower that he had plucked from its normandy garden to adorn him for a brief summers day was left to wilt discarded  the tale that greeted everard on his return from ireland was that brokenhearted she had diedcrushed neath her load of shame for it was said that there had been no marriage  the rumor of her death had gone abroad and it had been carried to england and my lord rotherby by a cousin of hersthe last living malignywho crossed the channel to demand of that stolid gentleman satisfaction for the dishonor put upon his house all the satisfaction the poor fellow got was a foot or so of steel through the lungs of which he died and there may it have seemed to rotherby the matter ended  but everard remainedeverard who had loved her with a great and almost sacred love everard who swore black ruin for my lord rotherbythe rumor of which may also have been carried to his lordship and stimulated his activities in having everard hunted down after the braemar fiasco of 1715  but before that came to pass everard had discovered that the rumor of her death was falseput about no doubt out of fear of that same cousin who had made himself champion and avenger of her honor everard sought her out and found her perishing of want in an attic in the cour des miracles some four months latereight months after rotherbys desertion  in that sordid windswept chamber of paris most abandoned haunt a son had been born to antoinette de maligny two days before everard had come upon her both were dying both had assuredly died within the week but that he came so timely to her aid and that aid he rendered like the noblehearted gentleman he was he had contrived to save his fortune from the wreck of james kingship and this was safely invested in france in holland and elsewhere abroad with a portion of it he repurchased the chateau and estates of maligny which on the death of antoinettes father had been seized upon by creditors  thither he sent her and her childrotherbys childmaking that noble domain a christeninggift to the boy for whom he had stood sponsor at the font and he did his work of love in the background he was the god in the machine no more no single opportunity of thanking him did he afford her he effaced himself that she might not see the sorrow she occasioned him lest it should increase her own  for two years she dwelt at maligny in such peace as the brokenhearted may know the little of life that was left her irradiated by everards noble friendship he wrote to her from time to time now from italy now from holland but he never came to visit her a delicacy which may or may not have been false restrained him and she respecting what instinctively she knew to be his feelings never bade him come to her in their letters they never spoke of rotherby not once did his name pass between them it was as if he had never lived or never crossed their lives meanwhile she weakened and faded day by day despite all the care with which she was surrounded that winter of cold and want in the cour des miracles had sown its seeds and death was sharpening his scythe against the harvest  when the end was come she sent urgently for everard he came at once in answer to her summons but he came too late she died the evening before he arrived but she had left a letter written days before against the chance of his not reaching her before the end that letter in her fine french hand was before him now  i will not try to thank you dearest friend she wrote for the thing that you have done what payment is there in poor thanks oh everard everard had it but pleased god to have helped me to a wiser choice when it was mine to choose she cried to him from that letter and poor everard deemed that the thin ray of joy her words sent through his anguished soul was payment more than enough for the little that he had done gods will be done she continued it is his will he knows why it is best so though we discern it not but there is the boy there is justin i bequeath him to you who already have done so much for him love him a little for my sake cherish and rear him as your own and make of him such a gentleman as are you his father does not so much as know of his existence that too is best so for i would not have him claim my boy never let him learn that justin exists unless it be to punish him by the knowledge for his cruel desertion of me  choking the writing blurred by tears that he accounted no disgrace to his young manhood everard had sworn in that hour that justin should be as a son to him he would do her will and he set upon it a more definite meaning than she intended rotherby should remain in ignorance of his sons existence until such season as should make the knowledge a very anguish to him he would rear justin in bitter hatred of the foul villain who had been his father and with the boys help when the time should be ripe he would lay my lord rotherby in ruins thus should my lords sin come to find him out  this everard had sworn and this he had done he had told justin the story almost as soon as justin was of an age to understand it he had repeated it at very frequent intervals and as the lad grew everard watched in himfostering it by every means in his powerthe growth of his execration for the author of his days and of his reverence for the sweet departed saint that had been his mother  for the rest he had lavished justin nobly for his mothers sake the repurchased estates of maligny with their handsome rent roll remained justins own administered by sir richard during the lads minority and vastly enriched by the care of that administration he had sent the lad to oxford and afterwardsthe more thoroughly to complete his educationon a two years tour of europe and on his return a grown and cultured man he had attached him to the court in rome of the pretender whose agent he was himself in paris  he had done his duty by the boy as he understood his duty always with that grim purpose of revenge for his horizon and the result had been a stranger compound than even everard knew for all that he knew the lad exceedingly well for he had scarcely reckoned sufficiently upon justins mixed nationality and the circumstance that in soul and mind he was entirely his mothers child with nothingor an imperceptible littleof his father as his mothers nature had been so was justinsjoyous but everards training of him had suppressed all inborn vivacity the mirth and diablerie that were his birthright had been overlaid with british phlegm until in their stead and through the blend a certain sardonic humor had developed an ironical attitude toward all things whether sacred or profane this had been helped on by culture andin a still greater measureby the odd training in worldliness which he had from everard his illusions were shattered ere he had cut his wisdom teeth thanks to the tutelage of sir richard who in giving him the ugly story of his own existence taught him the misanthropical lesson that all men are knaves all women fools he developed as a consequence that sardonic outlook upon the world he sought to take vos non vobis for his motto affected to a spectator in the theatre of life with the obvious result that he became the greatest actor of them all  so we find him even now his main emotion pity for sir richard who sat silent for some moments reviewing that thirtyyear dead past until the tears scalded his old eyes the baronet made a queer noise in his throat something between a snarl and a sob and he flung himself suddenly back in his chair  justin sat down a becoming gravity in his countenance tell me all he begged his adoptive father tell me how matters stand preciselyhow you propose to act  with all my heart the baronet assented lord ostermore having turned his coat once for profit is ready now to turn it again for the same end from the information that reaches me from england it would appear that in the rage of speculation that has been toward in london his lordship has suffered heavily how heavily i am not prepared to say but heavily enough i dare swear to have caused this offer to return to his king for he looks no doubt to sell his services at a price that will help him mend the wreckage of his fortunes a week ago a gentleman who goes between his majestys court at rome and his friends here in paris brought me word from his majesty that ostermore had signified to him his willingness to rejoin the stuart cause  together with that information this messenger brought me letters from his majesty to several of his friends which i was to send to england by a safe hand at the first opportunity now amongst these lettersdelivered to me unsealedis one to my lord ostermore making him certain advantageous proposals which he is sure to accept if his circumstances be as crippled as i am given to understand atterbury and his friends it seems have already tampered with my lords loyalty to dutch george to some purpose and there is little doubt but that this letterand he tapped a document before himwill do what else is to be done  but since these letters were left with me come you with his majestys fresh injunctions that i am to suppress them and cross to england at once myself to prevail upon atterbury and his associates to abandon the undertaking  mr caryll nodded because as i have told you said he king james in rome has received positive information that in london the plot is already suspected little though atterbury may dream it but what has this to do with my lord ostermore  this said everard slowly leaning across toward justin and laying a hand upon his sleeve i am to counsel the bishop to stay his hand against a more favorable opportunity there is no reason why you should not do the very opposite with ostermore  mr caryll knit his brows his eyes intent upon the others face but he said no word  it is urged everard an opportunity such as there may never be another we destroy ostermore by a turn of the hand we bring him to the gallows he chuckled over the word with a joy almost diabolical  but howhow do we destroy him quoth justin who suspected yet dared not encourage his suspicions  how do you ask how ist not plain snapped sir richard and what he avoided putting into words his eloquent glance made clear to his companion  mr caryll rose a thought quickly a faint flush stirring in his cheeks and he threw off everards grasp with a gesture that was almost of repugnance you mean that i am to enmesh him  sir richard smiled grimly as his majestys accredited agent he explained i will equip you with papers word shall go ahead of you to ostermore by a safe hand to bid him look for the coming of a messenger bearing his own family name no more than that nothing that can betray us yet enough to whet his lordships appetite you shall be the ambassador to bear him the tempting offers from the king you will obtain his answersaccepting those you will deliver to me and i shall do the trifle that may still be needed to set the rope about his neck  a little while there was silence outside the rain driven by gusts smote the window as with a scourge the thunder was grumbling in the distance now mr caryll resumed his chair he sat very thoughtful but with no emotion showing in his face british stolidity was in the ascendant with him then he felt that he had the need of it  it is ugly he said at last slowly  it is gods own will was the hot answer and sir richard smote the table  has god taken you into his confidence wondered mr caryll  i know that god is justice  yet is it not written that vengeance is his own  aye but he needs human instruments to execute it such instruments are we can youoh can you hesitate  mr caryll clenched his hands hard do it he answered through set teeth do it i shall approve it when tis done but find other hands for the work sir richard he is my father  sir richard remained cool that is the argument i employ for insisting upon the task being yours he replied then in a blaze of passion hewho had schooled his adoptive son so ably in selfcontrolmarshalled once more his arguments it is your duty to your mother to forget that he is your father think of him only as the man who wronged your mother the man to whom her ruined life her early death are dueher murderer and worse consider that your father you say he mocked almost your father in what is he your father you have never seen him he does not know that you exist that you ever existed is that to be a father father you say a word a nameno more than that a name that gives rise to a sentiment and a sentiment is to stand between you and your clear duty a sentiment is to set a protecting shield over the man who killed your mother  i think i shall despise you justin if you fail me in this i have lived for it he ran on tempestuously i have reared you for it and you shall not fail me  then his voice dropped again and in quieter tones  you hate the very name of john caryll earl of ostermore said he as must every decent man who knows the truth of what the life of that satyr holds if i have suffered you to bear his name it is to the end that it should remind you daily that you have no right to it that you have no right to any name  when he said that he thrust his finger consciously into a raw wound he saw justin wince and with pitiless cunning he continued to prod that tender place until he had aggravated the smart of it into a very agony  that is what you owe your father that is the full extent of what lies between youthat you are of those at whom the world is given to sneer and point scorns ready finger  none has ever dared said mr caryll  because none has ever known we have kept the secret well you display no coat of arms that no bar sinister may be displayed but the time may come when the secret must out you might for instance think of marrying a lady of quality a lady of your own supposed station what shall you tell her of yourself that you have no name to offer her that the name you bear is yours by assumption only ah that brings home your own wrongs to you justin consider them have them ever present in your mind together with your mothers blighted life that you may not shrink when the hour strikes to punish the evildoer  he flung himself back in his chair again and watched the younger man with brooding eye mr caryll was plainly moved he had paled a little and he sat now with brows contracted and set teeth  sir richard pushed back his chair and rose recapitulating he is your mothers destroyer he said with a sad sternness is the ruin of that fair life to go unpunished is it justin  mr carylls gallic spirit burst abruptly through its british glaze he crushed fist into palm and swore no by god it shall not sir richard  sir richard held out his hands and there was a fierce joy in his gloomy eyes at last youll cross to england with me justin  but mr carylls soul fell once more into travail wait he cried ah wait his level glance met sir richards in earnestness and entreaty answer me the truth upon your soul and conscience do you in your heart believe that it is what my mother would have had me do  there was an instants pause then everard the fanatic of vengeance the man whose mind upon that one subject was become unsound with excess of brooding answered with conviction as i have a soul to be saved justin i do believe it morei know it here trembling hands took up the old letter from the table and proffered it to justin here is her own message to you read it again  and what time the young mans eyes rested upon that fine pointed writing sir richard recited aloud the words he knew by heart the words that had been ringing in his ears since that day when he had seen her lowered to rest never let him learn that justin exists unless it be to punish him by the knowledge for his cruel desertion of me it is your mothers voice speaking to you from the grave the fanatic pursued and so infected justin at last with something of his fanaticism  the green eyes flashed uncannily the white young face grew cruelly sardonic you believe it he asked and the eagerness that now invested his voice showed how it really was with him  as i have a soul to be saved sir richard repeated  then gladly will i set my hand to it fire stirred through justin now a fire of righteous passion an ideano more than an ideadaunted me you have shown me that i cross to england with you sir richard and let my lord ostermore look to himself for my namei who have no right to any namemy name is judgment  the exaltation fell from him as suddenly as it had mounted he dropped into a chair thoughtful again and slightly ashamed of his sudden outburst  sir richard everard watched with an eye of gloomy joy the man whom he had been at such pains to school in selfcontrol  overhead there was a sudden crackle of thunder sharp and staccato as a peal of demoniac laughter     chapter ii at the adam and eve   mr caryll alighted from his traveling chaise in the yard of the adam and eve at maidstone on a sunny afternoon in may landed at dover the night before he had parted company with sir richard everard that morning his adoptive father had turned aside toward rochester to discharge his kings business with plotting bishop atterbury what time justin was to push on toward town as king james ambassador to the earl of ostermore who advised of his coming was expecting him  here at maidstone it was mr carylls intent to dine resuming his journey in the cool of the evening when he hoped to get at least as far as farnborough ere he slept  landlady chamberlain ostler and a posse of underlings hastened to give welcome to so fine a gentleman and a private room abovestairs was placed at his disposal before ascending however mr caryll sauntered into the bar for a whetting glass to give him an appetite and further for the purpose of bespeaking in detail his dinner with the hostess it was one of his traits that he gave the greatest attention to detail and held that the man who left the ordering of his edibles to his servants was no better than an animal who saw no more than nourishment in food nor was the matter one to be settled summarily it asked thought and time so he sipped his hock listening to the landladys proposals and amending them where necessary with suggestions of his own and what time he was so engaged there ambled into the inn yard a sturdy cob bearing a sturdy little man in snuffcolored clothes that had seen some wear  the newcomer threw his reins to the stableboya person of all the importance necessary to receive so indifferent a guest he got down nimbly from his horse produced an enormous handkerchief of many colors and removed his threecornered hat that he might the better mop his brow and youthful almost cherubic face what time he did so a pair of bright little blue eyes were very busy with mr carylls carriage from which leduc mr carylls valet was in the act of removing a portmantle his mobile mouth fell into lines of satisfaction  still mopping himself he entered the inn and guided by the drone of voices sauntered into the bar at sight of mr caryll leaning there his little eyes beamed an instant as do the eyes of one who espies a friend orapter figurethe eyes of the hunter when they sight the quarry  he advanced to the bar bowing to mr caryll with an air almost apologetic and to the landlady with an air scarcely less so as he asked for a nipperkin of ale to wash the dust of the road from his throat the hostess called a drawer to serve him and departed herself upon the momentous business of mr carylls dinner  a warm day sir said the chubby man  mr caryll agreed with him politely and finished his glass the other sipping meanwhile at his ale  a fine brew sir said he a prodigious fine brew with all respect sir your honor should try a whet of our english ale  mr caryll setting down his glass looked languidly at the man why do you exclude me sir from the nation of this beverage he inquired  the chubby mans face expressed astonishment yere english sir ecod i had thought ye french  it is an honor sir that you should have thought me anything  the other abased himself twas an unwarrantable presumption codso which i hope your honorll pardon then he smiled again his little eyes twinkling humorously an ye would try the ale i dare swear your honor would forgive me i know ale ecod i am a brewer myself green is my name sirtom greenyour very obedient servant sir and he drank as if pledging that same service he professed  mr caryll observed him calmly and a thought indifferently yere determined to honor me said he i am your debtor for your reflections upon whetting glasses but ale sir is a beverage i dont affect nor shall while there are vines in france  ah sighed mr green rapturously tis a great country france is it not sir  tis not the general opinion here at present but i make no doubt that it deserves your praise  and paris now persisted mr green they tell me tis a great city a marvel o th ages there be those ecod that say londons but a kennel tot  be there so quoth mr caryll indifferently  ye dont agree with them belike asked mr green with eagerness  pooh men will say anything mr caryll replied and added pointedly men will talk ye see  not always was the retort in a sly tone ive known men to be prodigious short when they had aught to hide  have ye so ye seem to have had a wide experience and mr caryll sauntered out humming a french air through closed lips  mr green looked after him with hardened eyes he turned to the drawer who stood by hes mighty close said he mighty close  yere not perhaps quite the company he cares for the drawer suggested candidly  mr green looked at him very like he snapped how long does he stay here  ye lost a rare chance of finding out when ye let him go without inquiring said the drawer  mr greens face lost some of its chubbiness when dye look to marry the landlady was his next question  the man stared cod said he marry theare ye daft  mr green affected surprise im mistook it seems ye misled me by your pertness get me another nipperkin  meanwhile mr caryll had taken his way above stairs to the room set apart for him he dined to his satisfaction and thereafter his shapely silkclad legs thrown over a second chair his waistcoat all unbuttoned for the day was of an almost midsummer warmthhe sat mightily at his ease a decanter of sherry at his elbow a pipe in one hand and a book of mr gays poems in the other but the ease went no further than the body as witnessed the circumstances that his pipe was cold the decanter tolerably full and mr gays pleasant rhymes and quaint conceits of fancy all unheeded the light mercurial spirit which he had from nature and his unfortunate mother and which he had retained in spite of the stern training he had received at his adoptive fathers hands was heavyfettered now  the mild fatigue of his journey through the heat of the day had led him to look forward to a voluptuous hour of indolence following upon dinner with pipe and book and glass the hour was come the elements were there but since he could not abandon himself to their dominion the voluptuousness was wanting the task before him haunted him with anticipatory remorse it hung upon his spirit like a sick mans dream it obtruded itself upon his constant thought and the more he pondered it the more did he sicken at what lay before him  wrought upon by everards fanaticism that day in paris some three weeks ago infected for the time being by something of his adoptive fathers fever he had set his hands to the task in a glow of passionate exaltation but with the hour the exaltation went and reaction started in his soul and yet draw back he dared not too long and sedulously had everard trained his spirit to look upon the avenging of his mother as a duty believing that it was his duty he thirsted on the one hand to fulfill it whilst on the other he recoiled in horror at the thought that the man upon whom he was to wreak that vengeance was his fatheralbeit a father whom he did not know who had never seen him who was not so much as aware of his existence  he sought forgetfulness in mr gay he had the delicateminded mans inherent taste for verse a quick ear for the melody of words the aesthetes love of beauty in phrase as of beauty in all else and culture had quickened his perceptions developed his capacity for appreciation for the tenth time he called leduc to light his pipe and that done he set his eye to the page once more but it was like harnessing a bullock to a cart unmindful of the way it went and over what it travelled his eye ambled heavily along the lines and when he came to turn the page he realized with a start that he had no impression of what he had read upon it  in sheer disgust he tossed the book aside and kicking away the second chair rose lythely he crossed to the window and stood there gazing out at nothing nor conscious of the incense that came to him from garden from orchard and from meadow  it needed a clatter of hoofs and a cloud of dust approaching from the north to draw his mind from its obsessing thoughts he watched the yellow body of the coach as it came furiously onward its four horses stretched to the gallop postillion lusty of lungs and whip and the great trail of dust left behind it spreading to right and left over the flowering hedgerows to lose itself above the goldflecked meadowland on it came to draw up there at the very entrance to maidstone at the sign of the adam and eve  mr caryll leaning on the sill of his window looked down with interest to see what manner of travellers were these that went at so redhot a pace from the rumble a lackey swung himself to the rough cobbles of the yard from within the inn came again landlady and chamberlain and from the stable ostler and boy obsequious all and of no interest to mr caryll  then the door of the coach was opened the steps were let down and there emergedhis hand upon the shoulder of the servanta very ferret of a man in black with a parsons bands and neckcloth a coalblack fullbottomed wig and under this a white face rather drawn and haggard and thin lips perpetually agrin to flaunt two rows of yellow teeth disproportionately large after him and the more remarkable by contrast came a tall blackfaced fellow very brave in buffcolored cloth with a fortune in lace at wrist and throat and a heavily powdered tiewig  lackey chamberlain and parson attended his alighting and then he joined their ranks to attend in his turnhat under armthe last of these odd travellers  the interest grew mr caryll felt that the climax was about to be presented and he leaned farther forward that he might obtain a better view of the awaited personage in the silence he caught a rustle of silk a flowered petticoat appearedas much of it as may be seen from the knee downwardsand from beneath this the daintiest foot conceivable was seen to grope an instant for the step another second and the rest of her emerged  mr caryll observedand be it known that he had the very shrewdest eye for a woman as became one of the race from which on his mothers side he sprangthat she was middling tall chastely slender having as he judged from her high waist a fine clean length of limb all this he observed and approved and prayed for a glimpse of the face which her silken hood obscured and screened from his desiring gaze she raised it at that momentraised it in a timid frightened fashion as one who looks fearfully about to see that she is not remarkedand mr caryll had a glimpse of an oval face pale with a warm pallorlike the pallor of the peach he thought and touched like the peach with a faint hint of pink in either cheek a pair of eyes large brown and gentle as a saints met his and mr caryll realized that she was beautiful and that it might be good to look into those eyes at closer quarters  seeing him a faint exclamation escaped her and she turned away in sudden haste to enter the inn the fine gentleman looked up and scowled the parson looked up and trembled the ostler and his boy looked up and grinned then all swept forward and were screened by the porch from the wondering eyes of mr caryll  he turned from the window with a sigh and stepped back to the table for the tinderbox that for the eleventh time he might relight his pipe he sat down blew a cloud of smoke to the ceiling and considered his nature triumphed now over his recent preoccupation the matter of the moment which concerned him not at all engrossed him beyond any other matter of his life he was intrigued to know in what relation one to the other stood the three so oddly assorted travellers he had seen arrive he bethought him that after all the odd assortment arose from the presence of the parson and he wondered what the plague should any christianand seemingly a gentleman at thatbe doing travelling with a parson then there was the wild speed at which they had come  the matter absorbed and vexed him i fear he was inquisitive by nature there came a moment when he went so far as to consider making his way below to pursue his investigations in situ it would have been at great cost to his dignity and this he was destined to be spared  a knock fell upon his door and the landlady came in she was genial buxom and applefaced as becomes a landlady  there is a gentleman below she was beginning when mr caryll interrupted her  i would rather that you told me of the lady said  la sir she cried displaying ivory teeth her eyes cast upwards hands upraised in gentle mirthful protest la sir but i come from the lady too  he looked at her a good ambassador said he should begin with the best news not add it as an afterthought but proceed i beg you give me hope mistress  they send their compliments and would be prodigiously obliged if you was to give yourself the trouble of stepping below  of stepping below he inquired head on one side solemn eyes upon the hostess would it be impertinent to inquire what they may want with me  i think they want you for a witness sir  for a witness am i to testify to the ladys perfection of face and shape to the heaven that sits in her eyes to the miracle she calls her ankle are these and other things besides of the same kind what i am required to witness if so they could not have sent for one more qualified i am an expert maam  oh sir nay she laughed tis a marriage they need you for  mr caryll opened his queer eyes a little wider soho said he the parson is explained then he fell thoughtful his tone lost its note of flippancy this gentleman who sends his compliments does he send his name  he does not sir but i overheard it  confide in me mr caryll invited her  he is a great gentleman she prepared him  no matter i love great gentlemen  they call him lord rotherby  at that sudden and utterly unexpected mention of his halfbrothers namehis unknown halfbrothermr caryll came to his feet with an alacrity which a more shrewd observer would have set down to some cause other than mere respect for a viscount the hostess was shrewd but not shrewd enough and if mr carylls expression changed for an instant it resumed its habitual halfscornful calm so swiftly that it would have needed eyes of an exceptional quickness to have read it  enough he said who could deny his lordship  shall i tell them you are coming she inquired her hand already upon the door  a moment he begged detaining her tis a runaway marriage this eh  her fullhearted smile beamed on him again she was a very woman with a taste for the romantic loving love what else sir she laughed  and why mistress he inquired eying her his fingers plucking at his nether lip do they desire my testimony  his lordships own man will stand witness for one but theyll need another she explained her voice reflecting astonishment at his question  true but why do they need me he pressed her heard you no reason given why they should prefer me to your chamberlain your ostler or your drawer  she knit her brows and shrugged impatient shoulders here was a deal of pother about a trifling affair his lordship saw you as he entered sir and inquired of me who you might be  his lordship flatters me by this interest my looks pleased him let us hope and you answered himwhat  that your honor is a gentleman newly crossed from france  you are wellinformed mistress said mr caryll a thought tartly for if his speech was tainted with a french accent it was in so slight a degree as surely to be imperceptible to the vulgar  your clothes sir the landlady explained and he bethought him then that the greater elegance and refinement of his french apparel must indeed proclaim his origin to one who had so many occasions of seeing travelers from gaul that might even account for mr greens attempts to talk to him of france his mind returned to the matter of the bridal pair below  you told him that eh said he and what said his lordship then  he turned to the parson the very man for us jenkins says he  and the parsonthis jenkinswhat answer did he make  excellently thought he says grinning  hum and you yourself mistress what inference did you draw  inference sir  aye inference maam did you not gather that this was not only a runaway match but a clandestine one my lord can depend upon the discretion of his servant no doubt for other witness he would prefer some passerby some stranger who will go his ways tomorrow and not be like to be heard of again  lard sir cried the landlady her eyes wide with astonishment  mr caryll smiled enigmatically tis so i assure ye maam my lord rotherby is of a family singularly cautious in the unions it contracts in entering matrimony he prefers no doubt to leave a back door open for quiet retreat should he repent him later  your honor has his lordships acquaintance then quoth the landlady  it is a misfortune from which heaven has hitherto preserved me but which the devil it seems now thrusts upon me it will nevertheless interest me to see him at close quarters come maam  as they were going out mr caryll checked suddenly why whats oclock said he  she stared so abruptly came the question past four sir she answered  he uttered a short laugh decidedly said he his lordship must be viewed at closer quarters and he led the way downstairs  in the passage he waited for her to come up with him you had best announce me by name he suggested it is caryll  she nodded and going forward threw open a door inviting him to enter  mr caryll she announced obedient to his injunction and as he went in she closed the door behind him  from the group of three that had been sitting about the polished walnut table the tall gentleman in buff and silver rose swiftly and advanced to the newcomer what time mr caryll made a rapid observation of this brother whom he was meeting under circumstances so odd and by a chance so peculiar  he beheld a man of twentyfive or perhaps a little more tall and well made if already inclining to heaviness with a swarthy face fulllipped bignosed blackeyed an obstinate chin and a deplorable brow at sight by instinct he disliked his brother he wondered vaguely was lord rotherby in appearance at all like their common father but beyond that he gave little thought to the tie that bound them indeed he has placed it upon record that saving in such moments of high stress as followed in their later connection he never could remember that they were the sons of the same parent  i thought was rotherbys greeting a note almost of irritation in his voice that the woman said you were from france  it was an odd welcome but its oddness at the moment went unheeded his swift scrutiny of his brother over mr carylls glance passed on to become riveted upon the face of the lady at the tables head in addition to the beauties which from above he had descried he now perceived that her mouth was sensitive and kindly her whole expression one of gentle wistfulness exceeding sweet to contemplate what did she in this galley he wondered and he has confessed that just as at sight he had disliked his brother so from that hourfrom the very instant of his eyes alighting on her therehe loved the lady whom his brother was to wed felt a surpassing need of her conceived that in the meeting of their eyes their very souls had met so that it was to him as if he had known her since he had known anything meanwhile there was his lordships question to be answered he answered it mechanically his eyes upon the lady and she returning the gaze of those queer greenish eyes with a sweetness that gave place to no confusion  i am from france sir  but not french his lordship continued  mr caryll fetched his eyes from the ladys to meet lord rotherbys more than half french he replied the french taint in his accent growing slightly more pronounced it was but an accident that my father was an englishman  rotherby laughed softly a thought contemptuously foreigners were things which in his untraveled unlettered ignorance he despised the difference between a frenchman and a south sea islander was a thing never quite appreciated by his lordship some subtle difference he had no doubt existed but for him it was enough to know that both were foreigners therefore it logically followed both were kin  your words sir might be oddly interpreted pon honor they might said he and laughed softly again with singular insolence  if they have amused your lordship i am happy said mr caryll in such a tone that rotherby looked to see whether he was being roasted you wanted me i think i beg that youll not thank me for having descended it was an honor  it occurred to rotherby that this was a veiled reproof for the ill manners of the omission again he looked sharply at this man who was scanning him with such interest but he detected in the calm highbred face nothing to suggest that any mockery was intended belatedly he fell to doing the very thing that mr caryll had begged him to leave undone he fell to thanking him as for mr caryll himself not even the queer position into which he had been thrust could repress his characteristics what time his lordship thanked him he looked about him at the other occupants of the room and found that besides the parson sitting pale and wideeyed at the table there was present in the background his lordships mana quiet fellow quietly garbed in gray with a shrewd face and shrewd shifty eyes mr caryll saw and registered for future use the reflection that eyes that are overshrewd are seldom wont to look out of honest heads  you are desired his lordship informed him to be witness to a marriage  so much the landlady had made known to me  it is not i trust a task that will occasion you any scruples  none on the contrary it is the absence of the marriage might do that the smooth easy tone so masked the inner meaning of the answer that his lordship scarce attended to the words  then we had best get on we are in haste  tis the characteristic rashness of folk about to enter wedlock said mr caryll as he approached the table with his lordship his eyes as he spoke turning full upon the bride  my lord laughed musically enough but overloud for a man of brains or breeding marry in haste eh quoth he  you are penetration itself mr caryll praised him  twill take a shrewd rogue to better me his lordship agreed  yet an honest man might worst you one never knows but the ladys patience is being taxed  it was as well he added that for his lordship had turned with intent to ask him what he meant  aye come jenkins get on with your patter gaskell he called to his man stand forward here then he took his place beside the lady who had risen and stood pale with eyes cast down andas mr caryll alone sawthe faintest quiver at the corners of her lips this served to increase mr carylls already considerable cogitations  the parson faced them fumbling at his book mr carylls eyes watching him with that cold level glance of theirs the parson looked up met that uncanny gaze displayed his teeth in a grin of terror fell to trembling and dropped the book in his confusion mr caryll smiling sardonically stooped to restore it him  there followed a fresh pause mr jenkins having lost his place seemed at some pains to find it againamazing indeed in one whose profession should have rendered him so familiar with its pages  mr caryll continued to watch him in silence andas an observer might have thought as indeed gaskell did think though he said nothing at the timewith wicked relish     chapter iii the witness   at last the page was found again by mr jenkins having found it he hesitated still a moment then cleared his throat and in the manner of one hurling himself forward upon a desperate venture he began to read  dearly beloved we are gathered here in the sight of god he read and on in a nasal whining voice which not only was the very voice you would have expected from such a man but in accordance too with sound clerical convention the bridal pair stood before him the groom with a slight flush on his cheeks and a bright glitter in his black eyes which were not nice to see the bride with bowed head and bosom heaving as in response to inward tumult  the cleric came to the end of his exordium paused a moment and whether because he gathered confidence whether because he realized the impressive character of the fresh matter upon which he entered he proceeded now in a firmer more sonorous voice i require and charge you both as ye will answer on the dreadful day of judgment  yeve forgot something mr caryll interrupted blandly  his lordship swung round with an impatient gesture and an impatient snort the lady too looked up suddenly whilst mr jenkins seemed to fall into an utter panic  whawhat he stammered what have i forgot  to read the directions i think  his lordship scowled darkly upon mr caryll who heeded him not at all but watched the lady sideways  mr jenkins turned first scarlet then paler than he had been before and bent his eyes to the book to read in a slightly puzzled voice the italicized words above the period he had embarked upon and also speaking unto the persons that shall be married he shall say he read and looked up inquiry his faintlycolored prominent eyes endeavoring to sustain mr carylls steady glance but failing miserably  tis farther back mr caryll informed him in answer to that mute question and as the fellow moistened his thumb to turn back the pages mr caryll saved him the trouble it says i think that the man should be on your right hand and the woman on your left ye seem to have reversed matters mr jenkins but perhaps yere lefthanded  stab me was mr jenkins most uncanonical comment i vow i am overflustered your lordship is so impatient with me this gentleman is right but that i was so flustered will you not change places with his lordship maam  they changed places after the viscount had thanked mr caryll shortly and cursed the parson with circumstance and fervor it was well done on his lordships part but the lady did not seem convinced by it her face looked whiter and her eyes had an alarmed halfsuspicious expression  we must begin again said mr jenkins and he began again  mr caryll listened and watched and he began to enjoy himself exceedingly he had not reckoned upon so rich an entertainment when he had consented to come down to witness this odd ceremony his sense of humor conquered every other consideration and the circumstance that lord rotherby was his brother if remembered at all served but to add a spice to the situation  out of sheer deviltry he waited until mr jenkins had labored for a second time through the opening periods again he allowed him to get as far as i charge and require you both before again he interrupted him  there is something else yeve forgot said he in that sweet quiet voice of his  this was too much for rotherby damn you he swore turning a livid face upon mr caryll and failed to observe that at the sound of that harsh oath and at the sight of his furious face the lady recoiled from him the suspicion lately in her face turning first to conviction and then to absolute horror  i do not think you are civil said mr caryll critically it was in your interests that i spoke  then ill thank you in my interests to hold your tongue his lordship stormed  in that case said mr caryll i must still speak in the interests of the lady since youve desired me to be a witness ill do my duty by you both and see you properly wed  now what the devil may you mean by that demanded his lordship betraying himself more and more at every word  mr jenkins in a spasm of terror sought to pour oil upon these waters my lord he bleated teeth and eyeballs protruding from his pallid face my lord perhaps the gentleman is right perhapsperhaps he gulped and turned to mr caryll what ist ye think we have forgot now he asked  the time of day mr caryll replied and watched the puzzled look that came into both their faces  do ye deal in riddles with us quoth his lordship what have we to do with the time of day  best ask the parson suggested mr caryll  rotherby swung round again to jenkins jenkins spread his hands in mute bewilderment and distress mr caryll laughed silently  ill not be married ill not be married  it was the lady who spoke and those odd words were the first that mr caryll heard from her lips they made an excellent impression upon him bearing witness to her good sense and judgmentalthough belatedly arousedand informing him although the pitch was strained just now that the rich contralto of her voice was full of music he was a judge of voices as of much else besides  hoitytoity quoth his lordship between petulance and simulated amusement whats all the pother hortensia dear  ill not be married she repeated firmly her wide brown eyes meeting his in absolute defiance head thrown back face pale but fearless  i dont believe ventured mr caryll that you could be if you desired it leastways not here and now and by this and he jerked a contemptuous thumb sideways at mr jenkins toward whom he had turned his shoulder perhaps you have realized it for yourself  a shudder ran through her color flooded into her face and out again leaving it paler than before yet she maintained a brave front that moved mr caryll profoundly to an even greater admiration of her  rotherby his great jaw set his hands clenched and eyes blazing stood irresolute between her and mr caryll jenkins in sheer terror now sank limply to a chair whilst gaskell looked ona perfect servantas immovable outwardly and unconcerned as if he had been a piece of furniture then his lordship turned again to caryll  you take a deal upon yourself sir said he menacingly  a deal of what wondered mr caryll blandly  the question nonplussed rotherby he swore ferociously by god he fumed ill have you make good your insinuations you shall disabuse this ladys mind you shalldamn youor ill compel you  mr caryll smiled very engagingly the matter was speeding excellentlya comedy the like of which he did not remember to have played a part in since his student days at oxford ten years and more ago  i had thought said he that the woman who summoned me to be a witness of thisthisah weddingthere was a whole volume of criticism in his utterance of the wordwas the landlady of the adam and eve i begin to think that she was this ladys good angel fate clothed for once matronly and benign then he dropped the easy bantering manner with a suddenness that was startling gallic fire blazed up through british training let us speak plainly my lord rotherby this marriage is no marriage it is a mockery and a villainy and that scoundrelworthy servant of his masteris no parson no not so much as a hedgeparson is he madame he proceeded turning now to the frightened lady you have been grossly abused by these villains  sir blazed rotherby at last breaking in upon his denunciation hand clapped to sword do ye dare use such words to me  mr jenkins got to his feet in a slow foolish fashion he put out a hand to stay his lordship the lady in the background looked on with wide eyes very breathless one hand to her bosom as if to control its heave  mr caryll proceeded undismayed to make good his accusation he had dropped back into his slightly listless air of thinly veiled persiflage and he appeared to address the lady to explain the situation to her rather than to justify the charge he had made  a blind man could have perceived from the rustling of his prayer book when he fumbled at it that the contents were strange to him and observe the volume he continued picking it up and flaunting it aloft firenew not a thumbmark anywhere purchased expressly for this foul venture is there aught else so clean and fresh about the scurvy thief  you shall moderate your tones sir began his lordship in a snarl  he sets you each on the wrong side of him continued mr caryll all imperturbable lacking even the sense to read the directions which the book contains and he has no thought for the circumstance that the time of day is uncanonical is more needed madame  so much was not needed said she though i am your debtor sir  her voice was marvelously steady icecold with scorn a royal anger increasing the glory of her eyes  rotherbys hand fell away from his sword he realized that bluster was not the most convenient weapon here he addressed mr caryll very haughtily you are from france sir and something may be excused you but not quite all you have used expressions that are not to be offered to a person of my quality i fear you scarcely apprehend it  as well no doubt as those who avoid you sir answered mr caryll with cool contempt his dislike of the man and of the business in which he had found him engaged mounting above every other consideration  his lordship frowned inquiry and who may those be  most decent folk i should conceive if this be an example of your ways  by god sir you are a thought too pert well mend that presently i will first convince you of your error and you hortensia  it will be interesting said mr caryll and meant it  rotherby turned from him keeping a tight rein upon his anger and so much restraint in so tempestuous a man was little short of wonderful hortensia he said this is fools talk what object could i seek to serve she drew back another step contempt and loathing in her face this man he continued flinging a hand toward jenkins and checked upon the word he swung round upon the fellow have you fooled me knave he bawled is it true what this man says of youthat yere no parson at all  jenkins quailed and shriveled here was a move for which he was all unprepared and knew not how to play to it on the bridegrooms part it was excellently acted yet it came too late to be convincing  youll have the license in your pocket no doubt my lord put in mr caryll it will help to convince the lady of the honesty of your intentions it will show her that ye were abused by this thief for the sake of the guinea ye were to pay him  that was checkmate and lord rotherby realized it there remained him nothing but violence and in violence he was exceedingly at homebeing a member of the hell fire club and having served in the bold bucks under his grace of wharton  you damned infernal marplot you blasted meddler he swore and some other things besides froth on his lips the veins of his brow congested what affair was this of yours  i thought you desired me for a witness mr caryll reminded him  i did let me perish said rotherby and i wish to the devil i had bit my tongue out first  the loss to eloquence had been irreparable sighed mr caryll his eyes upon a beam of the ceiling  rotherby stared and choked is there no sense in you you gibbering parrot he inquired what are youan actor or a fool  a gentleman i hope said mr caryll urbanely what are you  ill learn you said his lordship and plucked at his sword  i see said mr caryll in the same quiet voice that thinly veiled his inward laughtera bully  with more oaths my lord heaved himself forward mr caryll was without weapons he had left his sword abovestairs not deeming that he would be needing it at a wedding he never moved hand or foot as rotherby bore down upon him but his greenish eyes grew keen and very watchful he began to wonder had he indulged his amusement overlong and imperceptibly he adjusted his balance for a spring  rotherby stretched out to lunge murder in his inflamed eyes ill silence you you  there was a swift rustle behind him his handdrawn back to thrustwas suddenly caught and ere he realized it the sword was wrenched from fingers that held it lightly unprepared for this  you dog said the ladys voice strident now with anger and disdain she had his sword  he faced about with a horrible oath mr caryll conceived that he was becoming a thought disgusting  hoofs and wheels ground on the cobbles of the yard and came to a halt outside but went unheeded in the excitement of the moment rotherby stood facing her she facing him the sword in her hand and a look in her eyes that promised she would use it upon him did he urge her  a moment thusof utter breathless silence then as if her passion mounted and swept all aside she raised the sword and using it as a whip she lashed him with it until at the third blow it rebounded to the table and was snapped instinctively his lordship had put up his hands to save his face and across one of them a red line grew and grew and oozed forth blood which spread to envelop it  gaskell advanced with a sharp cry of concern but rotherby waved him back and the gesture shook blood from his hand like raindrops his face was livid his eyes were upon the woman he had gone so near betraying with a look that none might read jenkins swayed sickly against the table whilst mr caryll observed all with a critical eye and came to the conclusion that she must have loved this villain  the hilt and stump of sword clattered in the fireplace whither she hurled it a moment she caught her face in her hands and a sob shook her almost fiercely then she came past his lordship across the room to mr caryll rotherby making no shift to detain her  take me away sir take me away she begged him  mr carylls gloomy face lightened suddenly your servant maam said he and made her a bow i think you are very well advised he added cheerfully and offered her his arm she took it and moved a step or two toward the door it opened at that moment and a burly elderly man came in heavily  the lady halted a cry escaped hera cry of pain almostand she fell to weeping there and then mr caryll was very mystified  the newcomer paused at the sight that met him considered it with a dull blue eye and for all that he looked stupid it seemed he had wit enough to take in the situation  so said he with heavy mockery i might have spared myself the trouble of coming after you for it seems that she has found you out in time you villain  rotherby turned sharply at that voice he fell back a step his brow seeming to grow blacker than it had been father he exclaimed but there was little that was filial in the accent  mr caryll staggered and recovered himself it had been indeed a staggering shock for here of course was his own father too     chapter iv mr green   there was a quick patter of feet the rustle of a hooped petticoat and the lady was in the arms of my lord ostermore  forgive me my lord she was crying oh forgive me i was a little fool and i have been punished enough already  to mr caryll this was a surprising development the earl whose arms seemed to have opened readily enough to receive her was patting her soothingly upon the shoulder pish whats this whats this he grumbled yet his voice mr caryll noticed was if anything kindly but it must be confessed that it was a dull gruff voice seldom indicating any shade of emotion unlessas sometimes happenedit was raised in anger he was frowning now upon his son over the girls head his bushy grizzled brows contracted  mr caryll observedand with what interest you should well imaginethat lord ostermore was still in a general way a handsome man of a good height but slightly excessive bulk he had a face that still retained a fair shape shortnecked florid and plethoric he had the air of the man who seldom makes a long illness at the end his eyes were very blue and the lids were puffed and heavy whilst the mouth mr caryll remarked in a critical detached spirit was stupid rather than sensuous he made his survey swiftly and the result left him wondering  meanwhile the earl was addressing his son whose hand was being bandaged by gaskell there was little variety in his invective you villain he bawled at him you damned villain then he patted the girls head you found the scoundrel out before you married him said he i am glad ont glad ont  tis such a reversing of the usual order of things that it calls for wonder said mr caryll  eh quoth his lordship who the devil are you one of his friends  your lordship overwhelms me said mr caryll gravely making a bow he observed the bewilderment in ostermores eyes and began to realize at that early stage of their acquaintance that to speak ironically to the earl of ostermore was not to speak at all  it was hortensiaa very tearful hortensia now who explained this gentleman saved me my lord she said  saved you quoth he dully how did he come to save you  he discovered the parson she explained  the earl looked more and more bewildered just so said mr caryll it was my privilege to discover that the parson is no parson  the parson is no parson echoed his lordship scowling more and more then what the devil is the parson  hortensia freed herself from his protecting arms he is a villain she said who was hired by my lord rotherby to come here and pretend to be a parson her eyes flamed her cheeks were scarlet god help me for a fool my lord to have put my faith in that man oh she choked the shamethe burning shame of it i would i had a brother to punish him  lord ostermore was crimson too with indignation mr caryll was relieved to see that he was capable of so much emotion did i not warn you against him hortensia said he could you not have trusted that i knew himi his father to my everlasting shame then he swung upon rotherby you dog he began and therebeing a man of little inventionwords failed him and wrath alone remained very intense but entirely inarticulate  rotherby moved forward till he reached the table then stood leaning upon it scowling at the company from under his black brows tis your lordship alone is to blame for this he informed his father with a vain pretence at composure  i am to blame gurgled his lordship veins swelling at his brow i am to blame that you should have carried her off thus andby godhad you meant to marry her honestly and fittingly i might find it in my heart to forgive you but to practice such villainy to attempt to put this foul trick upon the child  mr caryll thought for an instant of another child whose child he was and a passion of angry mockery at the forgetfulness of age welled up from the bitter soul of him outwardly he remained a very mirror for placidity  your lordship had threatened to disinherit me if i married her said rotherby  twas to save her from you ostermore explained entirely unnecessarily and you thought totoby god sir i marvel you have the courage to confront me i marvel  take me away my lord hortensia begged him touching his arm  aye we were best away said the earl drawing her to him then he flung a hand out at rotherby in a gesture of repudiation of anathema but tis not the end ont for you you knave what i threatened i will perform ill disinherit you not a penny of mine shall come to you ye shall starve for aught i care starve andandthe world be well rid of a villain ii disown you yere no son of mine ill take oath yere no son of mine  mr caryll thought that on the contrary rotherby was very much his fathers son and he added to his observations upon human nature the reflection that sinners are oddly blessed with short memories he was entirely dispassionate again by now  as for rotherby he received his fathers anger with a scornful smile and a curling lip youll disinherit me quoth he in mockery and of what pray if report speaks true youll be needing to inherit something yourself to bear you through your present straitness he shrugged and produced his snuffbox with an offensive simulation of nonchalance ye cannot cut the entail he reminded his almost apoplectic sire and took snuff delicately sauntering windowwards  cut the entail the entail cried the earl and laughed in a manner that seemed to bode no good have you ever troubled to ascertain what it amounts to you fool it wouldnt keep you ininin snuff  lord rotherby halted in his stride halfturned and looked at his father over his shoulder the sneering mask was wiped from his face which became blank my lord he began  the earl waved a silencing hand and turned with dignity to hortensia  come child said he then he remembered something gad he exclaimed i had forgot the parson ill have him gaoled ill have him hanged if the law will help me come forth man  ignoring the invitation mr jenkins scuttled ratlike across the room mounted the windowseat and was gone in a flash through the open window he dropped plump upon mr green who was crouching underneath the pair rolled over together in the mould of a flowerbed then mr green clutched mr jenkins and mr jenkins squealed like a trapped rabbit mr green thrust his fist carefully into the mockparsons mouth  sh you blubbering fool he snapped in his ear my business is not with you lie still  within the room all stood at gaze following the sudden flight of mr jenkins then lord ostermore made as if to approach the winnow but hortensia restrained him  let the wretch go she said the blame is not his what is he but my lords tool and her eyes scorched rotherby with such a glance of scorn as must have killed any but a shameless man then turning to the demurely observant gentleman who had done her such good service mr caryll she said i want to thank you i want my lord here to thank you  mr caryll bowed to her i beg that you will not think of it said he it is i who will remain in your debt  is your name caryll sir quoth the earl he had a trick of fastening upon the inconsequent though that was scarcely the case now  that my lord is my name i believe i have the honor of sharing it with your lordship  yell belong to some younger branch of the family the earl supposed  like enoughsome outlying branch answered the imperturbable carylla jest which only himself could appreciate and that bitterly  and how came you into this  rotherby sneered audiblyin selfmockery no doubt as he came to reflect that it was he himself had had him fetched  they needed another witness said mr caryll and hearing there was at the inn a gentleman newly crossed from france his lordship no doubt opined that a traveller here today and gone for good tomorrow would be just the witness that he needed for the business he proposed that circumstance aroused my suspicions and  but the earl as usual seemed to have fastened upon the minor point although again it was not so you are newly crossed from france said he ay and your name is the same as mine twas what i was advised  mr caryll flashed a sidelong glance at rotherby who had turned to stare at his father and in his heart he cursed the stupidity of my lord ostermore if this proposed to be a member of a conspiracy heaven help that same conspiracy  were you by any chance going to seek me in town mr caryll  mr caryll suppressed a desire to laugh here was a way to deal with state secrets i my lord he inquired with an assumed air of surprise  the earl looked at him and from him to rotherby bethought himself and started so overtly that rotherbys eyes grew narrow the lines of his mouth tightened nay of course not of course not he blustered clumsily  but rotherby laughed aloud now what a plague is all this mystery he inquired  mystery quoth my lord what mystery should there be  tis what i would fain be informed he answered in a voice that showed he meant to gain the information he sauntered forward towards caryll his eye playing mockingly over this gentleman from france now sir said he whose messenger may you be eh whats all this  rotherby the earl interrupted in a voice intended to be compelling come away mr caryll he added quickly ill not have any gentleman who has shown himself a friend to my ward here affronted by that rascal come away sir  not so fast not so fast ecod  it was another voice that broke in upon them rotherby started round gaskell in the shadows of the cowled fireplace jumped in sheer alarm all stared at the window whence the voice proceeded  they beheld a plump chubbyfaced little man astride the sill a pistol displayed with ostentation in his hand  mr caryll was the only one with the presence of mind to welcome him ha said he smiling engagingly my little friend the brewer of ale  let no one leave this room said mr green with a great dignity then with rather less dignity he whistled shrilly through his fingers and got down lightly into the room  sir blustered the earl this is an intrusion an impertinence what do you want  the papers this gentleman carries said mr green indicating caryll with the hand that held the pistol the earl looked alarmed which was foolish in him thought mr caryll rotherby covered his mouth with his hand after the fashion of one who masks a smile  yere rightly served for meddling said he with relish  out with them the chubby man demanded yell gain nothing by resistance so dont be obstinate now  i could be nothing so discourteous said mr caryll would it be prying on my part to inquire what may be your interest in my papers  his serenity lessened the earls anxieties but bewildered him and it took the edge off the malicious pleasure which rotherby was beginning to experience  i am obeying the orders of my lord carteret the secretary of state said mr green i was to watch for a gentleman from france with letters for my lord ostermore he had a messenger a week ago to tell him to look for such a visitor he took the messenger if you must know andwell we induced him to tell us what was the message he had carried there is so much mystery in all this that my lord carteret desires more knowledge on the subject i think you are the gentleman i am looking for  mr caryll looked him over with an amused eye and laughed it distresses me said he to see so much good thought wasted  mr green was abashed a moment but he recovered quickly no doubt he had met the cool type before come come said he no blustering out with your papers my fine fellow  the door opened and a couple of men came in over their shoulders ere the door closed again mr caryll had a glimpse of the landladys rosy face alarm in her glance the newcomers were dirty rogues tipstaves recognizable at a glance one of them wore a ragged bobwigthe castoff no doubt of some gentlemans gentleman fished out of the sixpenny tub in rosemary lane it was illfitting and wisps of the fellows own unkempt hair hung out in places the other wore no wig at all his yellow thatch fell in streaks from under his shabby hat which he had the illmanners to retain until lord ostermore knocked it from his head with a blow of his cane both were fierily bottlenosed and neither appeared to have shaved for a week or so  now quoth mr green will you hand them over of your own accord or must i have you searched and a wave of the hand towards the advancing myrmidons indicated the searchers  you go too far sir blustered the earl  ay surely put in mr caryll you are mad to think a gentleman is to submit to being searched by any knave that comes to him with a cockandbull tale about the secretary of state  mr green leered again and produced a paper there said he is my lord carterets warrant signed and sealed  mr caryll glanced over it with a disdainful eye it is in blank said he  just so agreed mr green carte blanche as you say over the water if you insist he offered obligingly ill fill in your name before we proceed  mr caryll shrugged his shoulders it might be well said he if you are to search me at all  mr green advanced to the table the writing implements provided for the wedding were still there he took up a pen scrawled a name across the blank dusted it with sand and presented it again to mr caryll the latter nodded  ill not trouble you to search me said he i would as soon not have these noblemen of yours for my valets he thrust his hands into the pockets of his fine coat and brought forth several papers these he proffered to mr green who took them between satisfaction and amazement ostermore stared too stricken for words at this meek surrender and well was it for mr caryll that he was so stricken for had he spoken he had assuredly betrayed himself  hortensia mr caryll observed watched his cowardly yielding with an eye of stern contempt rotherby looked on with a dark face that betrayed nothing  meanwhile mr green was running through the papers and as fast as he ran through them he permitted himself certain comments that passed for humor with his followers there could be no doubt that in his own social stratum mr green must have been accounted something of a wag  ha whats this a bill a bill for snuff my lord carteretll snuff you sir hell tobacco you ecod hell smoke you first and snuff you afterwards he flung the bill aside phew he whistled verses to theocritus upon sailing for albion thats mighty choice dye write verses sir  heyday tis an occupation to which i have succumbed in moments of weakness i crave your indulgence mr green  mr green perceived that here was a weak attempt at irony and went on with his investigations he came to the last of the papers mr caryll had handed him glanced at it swore coarsely and dropped it  dye think ye can bubble me he cried red in the face  lord ostermore heaved a sigh of relief the hard look had faded from hortensias eyes  what ist ye mean giving me this rubbish  i offer you my excuses for the contents of my pockets said mr caryll ye see i did not expect to be honored by your inquisition had i but known  mr green struck an attitude now attend to me sir i am a servant of his majestys government  his majestys government cannot be sufficiently congratulated said mr caryll the irrepressible  mr green banged the table are ye rallying me ecod  you have upset the ink mr caryll pointed out to him  damn the ink swore the spy and damn you for a tom o bedlam i ask you againwhat dye mean giving me this rubbish  you asked me to turn out my pockets  i asked you for the letter ye have brought lord ostermore  i am sorry said mr caryll and eyed the other sympathetically i am sorry to disappoint you but then you assumed too much when you assumed that i had such a letter i have obliged you to the fullest extent in my power i do not think you show a becoming gratitude  mr green eyed him blankly a moment then exploded ecod sir you are cool  it is a condition we do not appear to share  dye say yeve brought his lordship no letter from france thundered the spy what else ha ye come to england for  to study manners sir said mr caryll bowing  that was the last drop in the cup of mr greens endurance he waved his men towards the gentleman from france find it he bade them shortly  mr caryll drew himself up with a great dignity and waved the bailiffs back his white face set an unpleasant glimmer in his eyes a moment he cried you have no authority to go to such extremes i make no objection to being searched but every objection to being soiled and ill not have the fingers of these scavengers about my person  and you are right egad cried lord ostermore advancing harkee you dirty spy this is no way to deal with gentlemen be off now and take your carrioncrows with you or ill have my grooms in with their whips to you  to me roared green i represent the secretary of state  yell represent a side of raw venison if you tarry here the earl promised him dye dare look me in the eye dye dare ye rogue dye know who i am and dont wag that pistol my fine fellow be off now away with you  mr green looked his name the rosiness was all departed from his cheeks he quivered with suppressed wrath if i gogiving way to constraintwhat shall you say to my lord carteret he asked  what concern may that be of yours sirrah  it will be some concern of yours my lord  mr caryll interposed the knave is right said he it were to implicate your lordship it were to give color to his silly suspicions let him make his search but be so good as to summon my valet he shall hand you my garments that you may do your will upon them but unless you justify yourself by finding the letter you are seeking you shall have to reckon with the consequences of discomposing a gentleman for nothing now sir is it a bargain mr green looked him over and if he was shaken by the calm assurance of mr carylls tone and manner he concealed it very effectively well make no bargains said he i have my duty to do he signed to one of the bailiffs fetch the gentlemans servant said he  so be it said mr caryll but you take too much upon yourself sir your duty i think would have been to arrest me and carry me to lord carterets there to be searched if his lordship considered it necessary  i have no cause to arrest you until i find it mr green snapped impatiently  your logic is faultless  i am following my lord carterets orders to the letter i am to effect no arrest until i have positive evidence  yet you are detaining me what does this amount to but an arrest  mr green disdained to answer leduc entered and mr caryll turned to lord ostermore  there is no reason why i should detain your lordship said he and these operationsthe lady he waved an expressive hand bent an expressive eye upon the earl  lord ostermore seemed to waver he was nothe had never beena man to think for others but hortensia cut in before he could reply  we will wait she said since you are travelling to town i am sure his lordship will be glad of your company sir  mr caryll looked deep into those great brown eyes and bowed his thanks if it will not discompose your lordship  no no said ostermore gruff of voice and manner we will wait i shall be honored sir if you will journey with us afterwards  mr caryll bowed again and went to hold the door for them mr greens eyes keenly alert for an attempt at evasion but there was none when his lordship and his ward had departed mr caryll turned to rotherby who had taken a chair his man gaskell behind him he looked from the viscount to mr green  do we require this gentleman he asked the spy  a smile broke over rotherbys swam face by your leave sir ill remain to see fair play you may find me useful mr green i have no cause to wish this marplot well he explained  mr caryll turned his back upon him took off his coat and waistcoat he sat down while mr green spread the garments upon the table emptied out the pockets turned down the cuffs ripped up the satin linings he did it in a consummate fashion very thoroughly yet though he parted the linings from the cloth he did so in such a manner as to leave the garments easily repairable  mr caryll watched him with interest and appreciation and what time he watched he was wondering might it not be better straightway to place the spy in possession of the letter and thus destroy himself and lord ostermore at the same timeand have done with the task on which he was come to england it seemed almost an easy way out of the affair his betrayal of the earl would be less ugly if he himself were to share the consequences of that betrayal  then he checked his thoughts what manner of mood was this besides his inclination was all to become better acquainted with this odd family upon which he had stumbled in so extraordinary a manner down in his heart of hearts he had a feeling that the thing he was come to do would never be doneleastways not by him it was in vain that he might attempt to steel himself to the task it repelled him it went not with a nature such as his  he thought of everard afire with the idea of vengence and to such an extent that he had succeeded in infecting justin himself with a spark of it he thought of him with pity almost pity that a man should obsess his life by such a phantasm as this same vengeance must have been to him was it worth while was anything worth while he wondered  lord rotherby approached the table and took up the garments upon which mr green had finished he turned them over and supplemented mr greens search  yere welcome to all that ye can find sneered mr green and turned to mr caryll let us have your shoes sir  mr caryll removed his shoes in silence and mr green proceeded to examine them in a manner that provoked mr carylls profound admiration he separated the lining from the spanish leather and probed slowly and carefully in the space between he examined the heels very closely going over to the window for the purpose that done he dropped them  your breeches now said he laconically  meanwhile leduc had taken up the coat and with a needle and thread wherewith he had equipped himself he was industriously restoring the stitches that mr green had taken out  mr caryll surrendered his breeches his fine holland shirt went next his stockings and what other trifles he wore until he stood as naked as adam before the fall yet all in vain  his garments were restored to him one by one and one by one with leducs aid he resumed them mr green was looking crestfallen  are you satisfied inquired mr caryll pleasantly his good temper inexhaustible  the spy looked at him with a moody eye plucking thoughtfully at his lip with thumb and forefinger then he brightened suddenly theres your man said he flashing a quick eye upon leduc who looked up with a quiet smile  true said mr caryll and theres my portmantle abovestairs and my saddle on my horse in the stables it is even possible for aught you know that there may be a hollow tooth or two in my head pray let your search be thorough  mr green considered him again if you had it it would be upon your person  yet consider mr caryll begged him holding out his foot that leduc might put on his shoe again i might have supposed that you would suppose that and disposed accordingly you had better investigate to the bitter end  mr greens small eyes continued to scrutinize leduc at intervals the valet was a silent seriousfaced fellow ill search your servant leastways the spy announced  by all means leduc i beg that you will place yourself at this interesting gentlemans disposal  what time mr caryll unaided now completed the resumption of his garments leduc silent and expressionless submitted to being searched  you will observe leduc said mr caryll that we have not come to this country in vain we are undergoing experiences that would be interesting if they were not quite so dull amusing if they entailed less discomfort to ourselves assuredly it was worth while to cross to england to study manners and there are sights for you that you will never see in france you would not for instance had you not come hither have had an opportunity of observing a member of the noblesse seconding and assisting a tipstaff in the discharge of his duty and doing it just as a hog wallows in foulnessfor the love of it  the gentlemen in your country leduc are too fastidious to enjoy life as it should be enjoyed they are too prone to adhere to the amusements of their class you have here an opportunity of perceiving how deeply they are mistaken what relish may lie in setting ones rank on one side in forgetting at times that by an accidenta sheer incredible accident i assure you leducone may have been born to a gentlemans estate  rotherby had drawn himself up his dark face crimsoning  dye talk at me sir he demanded dye dare discuss me with your lackey  but why not since you search me with my tipstaff if you can perceive a difference you are too subtle for me sir  rotherby advanced a step then checked he inherited mental sluggishness from his father you are insolent he charged caryll you insult me  indeed ha i am working miracles  rotherby governed his anger by an effort there was enough between us without this said he  there could not be too much between ustoo much space i mean  the viscount looked at him furiously i shall discuss this further with you said he the present is not the time nor place but i shall know where to look for you  leduc i am sure will always be pleased to see you he too is studying manners  rotherby ignored the insult we shall see then whether you can do anything more than talk  i hope that your lordship too is master of other accomplishments as a talker i do not find you very gifted but perhaps leduc will be less exigent than i  bah his lordship flung at him and went out cursing him profusely gaskell following at his masters heels     chapter v moonshine  my lord ostermore though puzzled entertained no tormenting anxiety on the score of the search to which mr caryll was to be submitted he assured himself from that gentlemans confident easy mannerbeing a man who always drew from things the inference that was obviousthat either he carried no such letter as my lord expected or else he had so disposed of it as to baffle search  so for the moment he dismissed the subject from his mind with hortensia he entered the parlor across the stoneflagged passage to which the landlady ushered them and turned wholeheartedly to the matter of his wards elopement with his son  hortensia said he when they were alone you have been foolish very foolish he had a trick of repeating himself conceiving no doubt that the commonplace achieves distinction by repetition  hortensia sat in an armchair by the window and sighed looking out over the downs do i not know it she cried and the eyes which were averted from his lordship were charred with tearstears of hot anger shame and mortification god help all women she added bitterly after a moment as many another woman under similar and worse circumstances has cried before and since  a more feeling man might have conceived that this was a moment in which to leave her to herself and her own thoughts and in that it is possible that a more feeling man had been mistaken ostermore stolid and unimaginative but not altogether without sympathy for his ward of whom he was reasonably fondas fond no doubt as it was his capacity to be for any other than himselfapproached her and set a plump hand upon the back of her chair  what was it drove you to this  she turned upon him almost fiercely my lady ostermore she answered him  his lordship frowned and his eyes shifted uneasily from her face in his heart he disliked his wife excessively disliked her because she was the one person in the world who governed him who rode roughshod over his feelings and desires because perhaps she was the mother of his unfeeling detestable son she may not have been the only person living to despise lord ostermore but she was certainly the only one with the courage to manifest her contempt and that in no circumscribed terms and yet disliking her as he did returning with interest her contempt of him he veiled it and was loyal to his termagant never suffering himself to utter a complaint of her to others never suffering others to censure her within his hearing this loyalty may have had its roots in prideindeed no other soil can be assigned to thema pride that would allow no strangers to pry into the sore places of his being he frowned now to hear hortensias angry mention of her ladyships name and if his blue eyes moved uneasily under his beetling brows it was because the situation irked him how should he stand as judge between mistress winthroptowards whom as we have seen he had a kindnessand his wife whom he hated yet towards whom he would not be disloyal  he wished the subject dropped since did he ask the obvious questionin what my lady ostermore could have been the cause of hortensias flighthe would provoke he knew a storm of censure from his wife therefore he fell silent  hortensia however felt that she had said too much not to say more  her ladyship has never failed to make me feel my positionmymy poverty she pursued there is no slight her ladyship has not put upon me until not even your servants use me with the respect that is due to my fathers daughter and my father she added with a reproachful glance was your friend my lord  he shifted uncomfortably on his feet deploring now the question with which he had fired the train of feminine complaint pish pish he deprecated tis fancy childpure fancy  so her ladyship would say did you tax her with it yet your lordship knows i am not fanciful in other things should i then be fanciful in this  but what has her ladyship ever done child he demanded thinking thus to baffle hersince he was acquainted with the subtlety of her ladyships methods  a thousand things replied hortensia hotly and yet not one upon which i may fasten tis thus she works by words halfwords looks sneers shrugs and sometimes foul abuse entirely disproportionate to the little cause i may unwittingly have given  her ladyship is a little hot the earl admitted but a good heart tis an excellent heart hortensia  for hatingay my lord  nay plague ont thats womanish in you pon honor it is womanish  what else would you have a woman mannish and raffish like my lady ostermore  ill not listen to you he said yere not just hortensia yere heated heated ill not listen to you besides when all is said what reasons be these for the folly yeve committed  reasons she echoed scornfully reasons and to spare her ladyship has made my life so hard has so shamed and crushed me put such indignities upon me that existence grew unbearable under your roof it could not continue my lord she pursued rising under the sway of her indignation it could not continue i am not of the stuff that goes to making martyrs i am weak andandas your lordship has saidwomanish  indeed you talk a deal said his lordship peevishly but she did not heed the sarcasm  lord rotherby she continued offered me the means to escape he urged me to elope with him his reason was that you would never consent to our marriage but that if we took the matter into our hands and were married first we might depend upon your sanction afterwards that you had too great a kindness for me to withhold your pardon i was weak my lordwomanish she threw the word at him again and it happenedgod help me for a foolthat i thought i loved lord rotherby and soand so  she sat down again weakly miserably averting her face that she might hide her tears he was touched and he even went so far as to show something of his sympathy he approached her again and laid a benign hand lightly upon her shoulder  butbutin that caseoh the damned villainwhy this mockparson  does your lordship not perceive must i die of shame do you not see  see no he was thoughtful a second then repeated no  i understood she informed him a smilea cruelly bitter smilelifting and steadying the corner of her lately quivering lip when he alluded to your lordships straitened circumstances he has no disinheritance to fear because he has no inheritance to look for beyond the entail of which you cannot disinherit him my lord rotherby sets a high value upon himself he mayi do not knowhe may have been in love with methough not as i know love which is all sacrifice all selfdenial but by his lights he may have cared for me he must have done by his lights had i been a lady of fortune not a doubt but he would have made me his wife as it was he must aim at a more profitable marriage and meanwhile to gratify his love for mebase as it washe wouldhe wouldo god i cannot say it you understand my lord  my lord swore strenuously there is a punishment for such a crime as this  ay my lordand a way to avoid punishment for a gentleman in your sons position even did i flaunt my shame in some vain endeavor to have justicea thing he knew i never could have done  my lord swore again he shall be punished he declared emphatically  no doubt god will see to that she said a world of faith in her quivering voice  my lords eyes expressed his doubt of divine intervention he preferred to speak for himself ill disown the dog he shall not enter my house again you shall not be reminded of what has happened here gad you were shrewd to have smoked his motives so he cried in a burst of admiration for her insight gad child shouldst have been a lawyer a lawyer  if it had not been for mr caryll she began but to what else she said he lent no ear being suddenly brought back to his fears at the mention of that gentlemans name  mr caryll save us what is keeping him he cried can theycan they  the door opened and mr caryll walked in ushered by the hostess both turned to confront him hortensias eyes swollen from her weeping  well quoth his lordship did they find nothing  mr caryll advanced with the easy graceful carriage that was one of his main charms his clothes so skilfully restored by leduc that none could have guessed the severity of the examination they had undergone  since i am here and alone your lordship may conclude such to be the case mr green is preparing for departure he is very abject very chapfallen i am almost sorry for mr green i am by nature sympathetic i have promised to make my complaint to my lord carteret and so i trust there is an end to a tiresome matter  but then sir quoth his lordship but thenare you the bearer of no letter  mr caryll shot a swift glance over his shoulder at the door he deliberately winked at the earl did your lordship expect letters he inquired that was scarcely reason enough to suppose me a courier there is some mistake i imagine  between the wink and the words his lordship was bewildered  mr caryll turned to the lady bowing then he waved a hand over the downs a fine view said he airily and she stared at him i shall treasure sweet memories of maidstone her stare grew stonier did he mean the landscape or some other matter his tone was difficult to reada feature peculiar to his tone  not so shall i sir she made answer i shall never think of it other than with burning cheeksunless it be with gratitude to your shrewdness which saved me  no more i beg it is a matter painful to you to dwell on let me exhort you to forget it i have already done so  that is a sweet courtesy in you  i am compounded of sweet courtesy he informed her modestly  his lordship spoke of departure renewing his offer to carry mr caryll to town in his chaise meanwhile mr caryll was behaving curiously he was tiptoeing towards the door along the wall where he was out of line with the keyhole he reached it suddenly and abruptly pulled it open there was a squeal and mr green rolled forward into the room mr caryll kicked him out again before he could rise and called leduc to throw him outside and that was the last they saw of mr green at maidstone  they set out soon afterwards mr caryll travelling in his lordships chaise and leduc following in his masters  it was an hour or so after candlelighting time when they reached croydon the country lying all white under a full moon that sailed in a clear calm sky his lordship swore that he would go no farther that night the travelling fatigued him indeed for the last few miles of the journey he had been dozing in his corner of the carriage conversation having long since been abandoned as too great an effort on so bad a road which shook and jolted them beyond endurance his lordships chaise was of an oldfashioned pattern and the springs far from what might have been desired or expected in a noblemans conveyance  they alighted at the bells his lordship bespoke supper invited mr caryll to join them and what time the meal was preparing went into a noisy doze in the parlors best chair  mistress winthrop sauntered out into the garden the calm and fragrance of the night invited her alone with her thoughts she paced the lawn a while until her solitude was disturbed by the advent of mr caryll he too had need to think and he had come out into the peace of the night to indulge his need seeing her he made as if to withdraw again but she perceived him and called him to her side he went most readily yet when he stood before her in an attitude of courteous deference she was at a loss what she should say to him or rather what words she should employ at last with a halflaugh of nervousness i am by nature very inquisitive sir she prefaced  i had already judged you to be an exceptional woman mr caryll commented softly  she mused an instant are you never serious she asked him  is it worth while he counterquestioned and whether intent or accident he let her see something of himself is it even amusingto be serious  is there in life nothing but amusement  oh yesbut nothing so vital i speak with knowledge the gift of laughter has been my salvation  from what sir  ahwho shall say that my history and my rearing have been such that had i bowed before them i had become the most gloomy melancholy man that steps this gloomy melancholy world by now i might have found existence insupportable and sowho knows i might have set a term to it but i had the wisdom to prefer laughter humanity is a delectable spectacle if we but have the gift to observe it in a dispassionate spirit such a gift have i cultivated the squirming of the human worm is interesting to observe and the practice of observing it has this advantage that while we observe it we forget to squirm ourselves  the bitterness of your words belies their purport  he shrugged and smiled but proves my contention that i might explain myself you made me for a moment serious set me squirming in my turn  she moved a little and he fell into step beside her a little while there was silence  presentlyyou find me no doubt as amusing as any other of your human worms said she  god forbid he answered soberly  she laughed you make an exception in my case then that is a subtle flattery  have i not said that i had judged you to be an exceptional woman  exceptionally foolish not a doubt  exceptionally beautiful exceptionally admirable he corrected  a clumsy compliment devoid of wit  when we grow truthful it may be forgiven us if we fall short of wit  that were an argument in favor of avoiding truth  were it necessary said he for truth is seldom so intrusive as to need avoiding but we are straying there was a score upon which you were inquisitive you said from which i take it that you sought knowledge at my hands pray seek it i am a well of knowledge  i desired to knownay but i have asked you already i desired to know did you deem me a very pitiful little fool  they had reached the privet hedge and turned they paused now before resuming their walk he paused also before replying then  i should judge you wise in most things he answered slowly critically but in the matter to which i owe the blessing of having served you i do not think you wise did youdo you love lord rotherby  what if so  after what you have learned i should account you still less wise  you are impertinent sir she reproved him  nay most pertinent did you not ask me to sit in judgment upon this matter and unless you confess to me how am i to absolve you  i did not crave your absolution you take too much upon yourself  so said lord rotherby you seem to have something in common when all is said  she bit her lip in chagrin they paced in silence to the lawns end and turned again then you treat me like a fool she reproved him  how is that possible when already i think i love you  she started from him and stared at him for a long moment you insult me she cried angrily conceiving that she understood his mind do you think that because i may have committed a folly i have forfeited all claim to be respectedthat i am a subject for insolent speeches  you are illogical said mr caryll the imperturbable i have told you that i love you should i insult the woman i have said i love  you love me she looked at him her face very white in the white moonlight her lips parted a kindling anger in her eyes are you mad  i ant sure there have been moments when i have almost feared it this is not one of them  you wish me to think you serious she laughed a thought stridently in her indignation i have known you just four hours said she  precisely the time i think i have loved you  you think she echoed scornfully oh you make that reservation you are not quite sure  can we be sure of anything he deprecated  of some things she answered icily and i am sure of onethat i am beginning to understand you  i envy you since that is so help meof your charityto understand myself  then understand yourself for an impudent fleering coxcomb she flung at him and turned to leave him  that is not explanation said mr caryll thoughtfully it is mere abuse  what else do you deserve she asked him over her shoulder that you should have dared she withered him  to love you quite so suddenly he inquired and misquoted whoever loved at all that loved not at first sight hortensia  you have not the right to my name sir  yet i offer you the right to mine he answered with humble reproach  you shall be punished she promised him and in high dudgeon left him  punished oh cruel can you then be        unsoft to him whos smooth to thee         tigers and bears ive heard some say         for proffered love will love repay  but she was gone he looked up at the moon and took it into his confidence to reproach it twas your white face beglamored me he told it aloud see how execrable a beginning ive made and therefore how excellent and he laughed but entirely without mirth  he remained pacing in the moonlight very thoughtful and for once it seemed not at all amused his life appeared to be tangling itself beyond unravelling and his vaunted habit of laughter scarce served at present to show him the way out     chapter vi hortensias return   mr caryll needs explaining as he walks there in the moonlight that is if we are at all to understand hima matter by no means easy considering that he has confessed he did not understand himself did ever man make a sincere declaration of sudden passion as flippantly as he had done or in termsbetter calculated to alienate the regard he sought to win did ever man choose his time with less discrimination or his words with less discretion assuredly not to suppose that mr caryll was unaware of this would be to suppose him a fool and that he most certainly was not  his mood was extremely complex its analysis i fear may baffle us it must have seemed to youas it certainly seemed to mistress winthropthat he made a mock of her that in truth he was the impudent fleering coxcomb she pronounced him and nothing more not so mock he most certainly did but his mockery was all aimed to strike himself on the recoilhimself and the sentiments which had sprung to being in his soul and to whichnameless as he was pledged as he was to a task that would most likely involve his ruinhe conceived that he had no right he gave expression to his feelings yet chose for them the expression best calculated to render them barren of all consequence where mistress winthrop was concerned where another would have hidden those emotions mr caryll elected to flaunt them halfderisively that hortensia might trample them under foot in sheer disgust  it was perhaps the knowledge that did he wait and come to her as an honest devout lover he must in honesty tell her all there was to know of his odd history and of his bastardy and thus set up between them a barrier insurmountable better he may have thought to make from the outset a mockery of a passion for which there could be no hope and so under that mocking impertinent exterior i hope you catch some glimpse of the real suffering manthe man who boasted that he had the gift of laughter  he continued a while to pace the dewy lawn after she had left him and a deep despondency descended upon the spirit of this man who accounted seriousness a folly hitherto his rancor against his father had been a theoretical rancor a thing educated into him by everard and accepted by him as we accept a proposition in euclid that is proved to us in its way it had been a makebelieve rancor a rancor on principle for he had been made to see that unless he was inflamed by it he was not worthy to be his mothers son tonight had changed all this no longer was his grievance sentimental theoretical or abstract it was suddenly become real and very bitter it was no longer a question of the wrong done his mother thirty years ago it became the question of a wrong done himself in casting him nameless upon the world a thing of scorn to cruel unjust humanity could mistress winthrop have guessed the bitter selfderision with which he had in apparent levity offered her his name she might have felt some pity for him who had no pity for himself  and so tonight he feltas once for a moment everard had made him feelthat he had a very real wrong of his own to avenge upon his father and the task before him lost much of the repugnance that it had held for him hitherto  all this because four hours ago he had looked into the brown depths of mistress winthrops eyes he sighed and declaimed a line of congreves  woman is a fair image in a pool who leaps at it is sunk  the landlord came to bid him in to supper he excused himself sent his lordship word that he was overtired and went off to bed  they met at breakfast at an early hour upon the morrow mistress winthrop cool and distant his lordship grumpy and mute mr caryll airy and talkative as was his habit they set out soon afterwards but matters were nowise improved his lordship dozed in a corner of the carriage while mistress winthrop found more interest in the flowering hedgerows than in mr caryll ignored him when he talked and did not answer him when he set questions till in the end he too lapsed into silence and as a solatium for his soreness assured himself by lengthy wordless arguments that matters were best so  they entered the outlying parts of london some two hours later and it still wanted an hour or so to noon when the chaise brought up inside the railings before the earls house in lincolns inn fields  there came a rush of footmen a bustle of service amid which they alighted and entered the splendid residence that was part of the little that remained lord ostermore from the wreck his fortunes had suffered on the shoals of the south sea  mr caryll paused a moment to dismiss leduc to the address in old palace yard where he had hired a lodging that done he followed his lordship and hortensia within doors  from the inner hall a footman ushered him across an antechamber to a room on the right which proved to be the library and was his lordships habitual retreat it was a spacious pillared chamber very richly panelled in damask silk and very richly furnished having long french windows that opened on a terrace above the garden  as they entered there came a swift rustle of petticoats at their heels and mr caryll stood aside bowing to give passage to a tall lady who swept by with no more regard for him than had he been one of the houses lackeys she was he observed of middleage lean and aquilinefeatured with an exaggerated chin that ended squarely as boot her sallow cheeks were raddled to a hectic color a monstrous headdresslike that of some horse in a lord mayors showcoiffed her and her dress was a mixture of extravagance and incongruity the petticoat absurdly hooped  she swept into the room like a battleship into action and let fly her first broadside at mistress winthrop from the threshold  codso she shrilled you have come back and for what have you come back am i to live in the same house with you you shameless madamthat have no more thought for your reputation than a slut in a smockrace  hortensia raised indignant eyes from out of a face that was very pale her lips were tightly pressedin resolution thought mr caryll who was very observant of hernot to answer her ladyship for mr caryll had little doubt as to the identity of this dragon  my lovemy dear began his lordship advancing a step his tone a very salve then seeking to create a diversion he waved a hand towards mr caryll let me present  did i speak to you she turned to bombard him have you not done harm enough had you been aught but a foolhad you respected me as a husband shouldyou had left well alone and let her go her ways  there was my duty to her father to say aught of  and what of your duty to me she blazed her eyes puckering most malignantly she reminded mr caryll of nothing so much as a vulture had ye forgotten that have ye no thought for decencyno respect for your wife  her strident voice was echoing through the house and drawing a little crowd of gaping servants to the hall to spare mistress winthrop mr caryll took it upon himself to close the door the countess turned at the sound  who is this she asked measuring the elegant figure with an evil eye and mr caryll felt it in his bones that she had done him the honor to dislike him at sight  it is a gentleman whowho his lordship thought it better apparently not to explain the exact circumstances under which he had met the gentleman he shifted ground i was about to present him my love it is mr caryllmr justin caryll this sir is my lady ostermore  mr caryll made her a profound bow her ladyship retorted with a sniff  is it a kinsman of yours my lord and the contempt of the question was laden with a suggestion that smote mr caryll hard what she implied in wanton offensive mockery was no more than he alone present knew to be the exact and hideous truth  some remote kinsman i make no doubt the earl explained until yesterday i had not the honor of his acquaintance mr caryll is from france  yell be a jacobite no doubt then were her first uncompromising words to the guest  mr caryll made her another bow if i were i should make no secret of it with your ladyship he answered with that irritating suavity in which he clothed his most obvious sarcasms  her ladyship opened her eyes a little wider here was a tone she was unused to and what may your business with his lordship be  his lordships business i think answered mr caryll in a tone of such exquisite politeness and deference that the words seemed purged of all their rudeness  will you answer me so sir she demanded nevertheless her voice quivering  my love interpolated his lordship hurriedly his florid face aflush we are vastly indebted to mr caryll as you shall learn it was he who saved hortensia  saved the drab did he and from what pray  madam it was hortensia who spoke she had risen pale with anger and she made appeal now to her guardian my lord ill not remain to be so spoken of suffer me to go that her ladyship should so speak of me to my faceand to a stranger  stranger crowed her ladyship lard and what dye suppose will happen are you so nice about a stranger hearing what i may have to say of youyou that will be the talk of the whole lewd town for this fine escapade and whatll the town say of you  my love his lordship sought again to soothe her sylvia let me implore you a little moderation a little charity hortensia has been foolish she confesses so much herself yet when all is said tis not she is to blame  am i  my love was it suggested  i marvel it was not indeed i marvel oh hortensia is not to blame the sweet pure dove what is she then  to be pitied maam said his lordship stirred to sudden anger that she should have lent an ear to your disreputable son  my son my son cried her ladyship her voice more and more strident her face flushing till the rouge upon it was put to shame revealed in all its unnatural hideousness and is he not your son my lord  there are moments he answered hardily when i find it difficult to believe  it was much for him to say and to her ladyship of all people it was pure mutiny she gasped for air pumped her brain for words meantime his lordship continued with an eloquence entirely unusual in him and prompted entirely by his strong feelings in the matter of his son he is a disgrace to his name he always has been when a boy he was a liar and a thief and had he had his deserts he had been lodged in newgate long agoor worse now that hes a man hes an abandoned profligate a brawler a drunkard a rakehell so much i have long known him for but today he has shown himself for something even worse i had thought that my ward at least had been sacred from his villainy that is the last drop ill not condone it damn me i cant condone it ill disown him he shall not set foot in house of mine again let him keep the company of his grace of wharton and his other abandoned friends of the hell fire club he keeps not mine he keeps not mine i say  her ladyship swallowed hard from red that she had been she was now ashen under her rouge and is this wanton baggage to keep mine is she to disgrace a household that has grown too nice to contain your son  my lord oh my lord give me leave to go hortensia entreated  ay go sneered her ladyship go you had best goback to him what for did ye leave him did ye dream there could be aught to return to  hortensia turned to her guardian again appealingly but her ladyship bore down upon her incensed by this ignoring she caught the girls wrist in her clawlike hand answer me you drab what for did you return what is to be done with you now that y are soiled goods where shall we find a husband for you  i do not want a husband madam answered hortensia  will ye lead apes in hell then bah tis not what ye want my fine madam tis what we can get you and where shall we find you a husband now  her eye fell upon mr caryll standing by one of the windows a look of profound disgust overplaying the usually immobile face perhaps the gentleman from francethe gentleman who saved you she sneered will propose to take the office  with all my heart maam mr caryll startled them and himself by answering then perceiving that he had spoken too much upon impulsegiven utterance to what was passing in his mindi but mention it to show your ladyship how mistaken are your conclusions he added  the countess loosed her hold of hortensias wrist in her amazement and looked the gentleman from france up and down in a mighty scornful manner codso she swore i may take it then that your saving heras ye call itwas no accident  indeed it was maamand a most fortunate accident for your son  for my son as how  it saved him from hanging maam mr caryll informed her and gave her something other than the baiting of hortensia to occupy her mind  hang she gasped are you speaking of lord rotherby  ay of lord rotherbyand not a word more than is true put in the earl do you knowbut you do notthe extent of your precious sons villainy at maidstone where i overtook themat the adam and evehe had a makebelieve parson and he was luring this poor child into a mockmarriage  her ladyship stared mockmarriage she echoed marriage la and again she vented her unpleasant laugh did she insist on that the prude y amaze me  surely my love you do not apprehend had lord rotherbys parson not been detected and unmasked by mr caryll here  would you ha me believe she did not know the fellow was no parson  oh cried hortensia your ladyship has a very wicked soul may god forgive you  and who is to forgive you snapped the countess  i need no forgiveness for i have done no wrong a folly i confess to i was mad to have heeded such a villain  her ladyship gathered forces for a fresh assault but mr caryll anticipated it it was no doubt a great impertinence in him but he saw hortensias urgent need and he felt moreover that not even lord ostermore would resent his crossing swords a moment with her ladyship  you would do well maam to remember said he in his singularly precise voice that lord rotherby even nowand as things have fallen outis by no means quit of all danger  she looked at this smooth gentleman and his words burned themselves into her brain she quivered with mingling fear and anger  whawhat ist ye mean quoth she  that even at this hour if the matter were put about his lordship might be brought to account for it and it might fare very ill with him the law of england deals heavily with an offense such as lord rotherbys and the attempt at a mockmarriage of which there is no lack of evidence would so aggravate the crime of abduction if he were informed against that it might go very hard with him  her jaw fell she caught more than an admonition in his words it almost seemed to her that he was threatening  whowho is to inform she asked pointblank her tone a challenge and yet the odd change in it from its recent aggressiveness was almost ludicrous  ahwho said mr caryll raising his eyes and fetching a sigh it would appear that a messenger from the secretary of stateon another matterwas at the adam and eve at the time with two of his catchpolls and he was a witness of the whole affair then again and he waved a hand doorwards servants are servants i make no doubt they are listening and your ladyships voice has scarce been controlled you can never say when a servant may cease to be a servant and become an active enemy  damn the servants she swore dismissing them from consideration who is this messenger of the secretarys who is he  he was named green tis all i know  and where may he be found  i cannot say  she turned to lord ostermore where is rotherby she inquired she was a thought breathless  i do not know said he in a voice that signified how little he cared  he must be found this fellows silence must be bought ill not have my son disgraced and gaoled perhaps he must be found  her alarm was very real now she moved towards the door then paused and turned again meantime let your lordship consider what dispositions you are to make for this wretched girl who is the cause of all this garboil  and she swept out slamming the door violently after her     chapter vii father and son   mr caryll stayed to dine at stretton house although they had journeyed but from croydon that morning he would have preferred to have gone first to his lodging to have madefastidious as he wasa suitable change in his apparel but the urgency that his task dictated caused him to waive the point  he had a halfhour or so to himself after the stormy scene with her ladyship in which he had played againthough in a lesser degreethe part of savior to mistress winthrop a matter for which the lady had rewarded him ere withdrawing with a friendly smile which caused him to think her disposed to forgive him his yesternights folly  in that halfhour he gave himself again very seriously to the contemplation of his position he had no illusions on the score of lord ostermore and he rated his father no higher than he deserved but he was just and shrewd in his judgment and he was forced to confess that he had found this father of his vastly different from the man he had been led to expect he had looked to find a debauched old rake a vile creature steeped in vice and wickedness instead he found a weak easynatured commonplace fellow whose worst sin seemed to be the selfishness that is usually inseparable from those other characteristics if ostermore was not a man of the type that inspires strong affection neither was he of the type that provokes strong dislike his colorless nature left one indifferent to him  mr caryll somewhat to his dismay found himself inclined to extend the man some sympathy caught himself upon the verge of pitying him for being burdened with so very unfilial a son and so very cursed a wife it was one of his cherished beliefs that the evil that men do has a trick of finding them out in this life and here he believed as shrewridden husband and despised father the earl of ostermore was being made to expiate that sin of his early years  another of mr carylls philosophies was that when all is said man is little of a free agent his viciousness or sanctity is temperamental and not the man but his naturewhich is not selfimbuedmust bear the responsibility of a mans deeds be they good or bad  in the abstract such beliefs are well enough they are excellent standards by which to judge where other sufferers than ourselves are concerned but when we ourselves are touched they are discounted by the measure in which a mans deeds or misdeeds may affect us and although to an extent this might be the case now with mr caryll yet in spite of it he found himself excusing his father on the score of the mans weakness and stupidity until he caught himself up with the reflection that this was a disloyalty to everard to his training and to his mother and yethe revertedin such a man as ostermore sheer stupidity a lack of imagination of insight into things as they really are a lack of feeling that would disable him from appreciating the extent of any wrong he did seemed to mr caryll to be extenuating circumstances  he conceived that he was amazingly dispassionate in his judgment and he wondered was he right or wrong so to be then the thought of his task arose in his mind and it bathed him in a sweat of horror over in france he had allowed himself to be persuaded and had pledged himself to do this thing everard the relentless unforgiving fanatic of vengeance hadas we have seentrained him to believe that the avenging of his mothers wrongs was the only thing that could justify his own existence besides it had all seemed remote then and easy as remote things are apt to seem but nownow that he had met in the flesh this man who was his fatherhis hesitation was turned to very horror it was not that he did not conceive in spite of his odd ideas upon temperament and its responsibilities that his mothers wrongs cried out for vengeance and that the avenging of them would be a righteous fitting deed but it was that he conceived that his own was not the hand to do the work of the executioner upon one whoafter allwas still his own father it was hideously unnatural  he sat in the library awaiting his lordship and the announcement of dinner there was a book before him but his eyes were upon the window the smooth lawns beyond all drenched in summer sunshine and his thoughts were introspective he looked into his shuddering soul and saw that he could notthat he would notdo the thing which he was come to do he would await the coming of everard to tell him so there would be a storm to face he knew but sooner that than carry this vile thing through it was vilemost damnably vilehe now opined  the decision taken he rose and crossed to the window his mind had been in travail his soul had known the pangs of labor but now that this strong resolve had been brought forth an ease and peace were his that seemed to prove to him how right he was how wrong must aught else have been  lord ostermore came in he announced that they would be dining alone together her ladyship he explained has gone forth in person to seek lord rotherby she believes that she knows where to find himin some disreputable haunt no doubt whither her ladyship would have been better advised to have sent a servant but women are wayward cattlewayward headstrong cattle have you not found them so mr caryll  i have found that the opinion is common to most husbands said mr caryll then added a question touching mistress winthrop and wondered would she not be joining them at table  the poor child keeps her chamber said the earl she is overwroughtoverwrought i am afraid her ladyship he broke off abruptly and coughed she is overwrought he repeated in conclusion so that we dine alone  and alone they dined ostermore despite the havoc suffered by his fortunes kept an excellent table and a clever cook and mr caryll was glad to discover in his sire this one commendable trait  the conversation was desultory throughout the repast but when the cloth was raised and the table cleared of all but the dishes of fruit and the decanters of oporto canary and madeira there came a moment of expansion  mr caryll was leaning back in his chair fingering the stem of his wineglass watching the play of sunlight through the ruddy amber of the wine and considering the extraordinarily odd position of a man sitting at table by the merest chance almost with a father who was not aware that he had begotten him a question from his lordship came to stir him partially from the reverie into which he was beginning to lapse  do you look to make a long sojourn in england mr caryll  it will depend was the vague and halfunconscious answer upon the success of the matter i am come to transact  there ensued a brief pause during which mr caryll fell again into his abstraction  where do you dwell when in france sir inquired my lord as if to make polite conversation  mr caryll lulled by his musings into carelessness answered truthfully at maligny in normandy  the next moment there was a tinkle of breaking glass and mr caryll realized his indiscretion and turned cold  lord ostermore who had been in the act of raising his glass fetched it down again so suddenly that the stem broke in his fingers and the mahogany was flooded with the liquor a servant hastened forward and set a fresh glass for his lordship that done ostermore signed to the man to withdraw the fellow went closing the door and leaving those two alone  the pause had been sufficient to enable mr caryll to recover and for all that his pulses throbbed more quickly than their habit outwardly he maintained his lazily indifferent pose as if entirely unconscious that what he had said had occasioned his father the least disturbance  youyou dwelt at maligny said his lordship the usual high color all vanished from his face and again you dwelt at maligny andandyour name is caryll  mr caryll looked up quickly as if suddenly aware that his lordship was expressing surprise why yes said he what is there odd in that  how does it happen that you come to live there are you at all connected with the family of maligny on your mothers side perhaps  mr caryll took up his wineglass i take it said he easily that there was some such family at some time but it is clear it must have fallen upon evil days he sipped at his wine there are none left now he explained as he set down his glass the last of them died i believe in england his eyes turned full upon the earl but their glance seemed entirely idle it was in consequence of that that my father was enabled to purchase the estate  mr caryll accounted it no lie that he suppressed the fact that the father to whom he referred was but his father by adoption  relief spread instantly upon lord ostermores countenance clearly he saw here was pure coincidence and nothing more indeed what else should there have been what was it that he had feared he did not know still he accounted it an odd matter and said so  what is odd inquired mr caryll does it happen that your lordship was acquainted at any time with that vanished family  i was sirslightly acquaintedat one time with one or two of its members tis that that is odd you see sir my name too happens to be caryll  trueyet i see nothing so oddly coincident in the matter particularly if your acquaintance with these malignys was but slight  indeed you are right you are right there is no such great coincidence when all is said the name reminded me of aa folly of my youth twas that that made impression  a folly quoth mr caryll his eyebrows raised  ay a follya folly that went near undoing me for had it come to my fathers ears he had broke me without mercy he was a hard man my father a puritan in his ideas  a greater than your lordship inquired mr caryll blandly masking the rage that seethed in him  his lordship laughed yere a wag mr carylla damned wag then reverting to the matter that was uppermost in his mind tis a fact thoughpon honor my father would ha broke me luckily she died  who died asked mr caryll with a show of interest  the girl did i not tell you there was a girl twas she was the follyantoinette de maligny but she diedmost opportunely egad twas a very damned mercy that she did itcut thethewhat dye call itknot  the gordian knot suggested mr caryll  aythe gordian knot had she lived and had my father smoked the affairgad he would ha broke me he would so he repeated and emptied his glass  mr caryll white to the lips sat very still a moment then he did a curious thing did it with a curious suddenness he took a knife from the table and hacked off the lowest button from his coat this he pushed across the board to his father  to turn to other matters said he there is the letter you were expecting from abroad  eh what lord ostermore took up the button it was of silk interwoven with gold thread he turned it over in his fingers looking at it with a heavy eye and then at his guest eh letter he muttered puzzled  if your lordship will cut that open you will see what his majesty has to propose he mentioned the king in a voice charged with suggestion so that no doubt could linger on the score of the king he meant  gad cried his lordship gad twas thus ye bubbled mr green shrewd on my soul and you are the messenger then  i am the messenger answered mr caryll coldly  and why did you not say so before  for the fraction of a second mr caryll hesitated then because i did not judge that the time was come said he     chapter viii temptation   his lordship ripped away the silk covering of the button with a penknife and disembowelled it of a small packet which consisted of a sheet of fine and very closelyfolded and tightlycompressed paper this he spread cast an eye over and then looked up at his companion who was watching him with simulated indolence  his lordship had paled a little and there was about the lines of his mouth a look of preternatural gravity he looked furtively towards the door his heavy eyebrows lowering  i think he said that we shall be more snug in the library will you bear me company mr caryll  mr caryll rose instantly the earl folded the letter and turned to go his companion paused to pick up the fragments of the button and slip them into his pocket he performed the office with a smile on his lips that was half pity half contempt it did not seem to him that there would be the least need to betray lord ostermore once his lordship was wedded to the stuart faction he would not fail to betray himself through some act of thoughtless stupidity such as this  in the librarythe door and that of the anteroom beyond it carefully closedhis lordship unlocked a secretaire of walnut very handsomely inlaid and drawing up a chair he sat down to the perusal of the kings letter when he had read it through he remained lost in thought a while at length he looked up and across towards mr caryll who was standing by one of the windows  you are no doubt a confidential agent sir said he and you will be fully aware of the contents of this letter that you have brought me  fully my lord answered mr caryll and i venture to hope that his majestys promises will overcome any hesitation that you may feel  his majestys promises said my lord thoughtfully his majesty may never have a chance of fulfilling them  very true sir but who gambles must set a stake upon the board your lordship has been something of a gamester already andor so i gatherwith little profit here is a chance to play another game that may mend the evil fortunes of the last  the earl scanned him in surprise you are excellent well informed said he between surprise and irony  my trade demands it knowledge is my buckler  his lordship nodded slowly and fell very thoughtful the letter before him his eyes wandering ever and anon to con again some portion of it it is a game in which i stake my head he muttered presently  has your lordship anything else to stake inquired mr caryll  the earl looked at him again with a gloomy eye and sighed but said nothing mr caryll resumed it is for your lordship to declare he said quite coolly whether his majesty has covered your stake if you think not it is even possible that he may be induced to improve his offer though if you think not for my own part i consider that you set too high a value on that same head of yours  touched in his vanity ostermore looked up at him with a sudden frown you take a bold tone sir said he a very bold tone  boldness is the attribute next to knowledge most essential to my calling mr caryll reminded him  his lordships eye fell before the others cold glance and again he lapsed into thoughtfulness his cheek now upon his hand suddenly he looked up again tell me said he who else is in this thing men say that atterbury is not above suspicion is it  mr caryll bent forward to tap the kings letter with a rigid forefinger when your lordship tells me that you are ready to concert upon embarking your fortunes in this bottom you shall find me disposed perhaps to answer questions concerning others meanwhile our concern is with yourself  dons and the devil swore his lordship angrily is this a way to speak to me he scowled at the agent tell me my fine fellow what would happen if i were to lay this letter you have brought me before the nearest justice  i cannot say for sure answered mr caryll quietly but it is very probable it would help your lordship to the gallows for if you will give yourself the trouble of reading it againand more carefullyyou will see that it makes acknowledgment of the offer of services you wrote his majesty a month or so ago  his lordships eyes dropped to the letter again he caught his breath in sudden fear  were i your lordship i should leave the nearest justice to enjoy his dinner in peace said mr caryll smiling  his lordship laughed in a sickly manner he felt foolisha rare condition in him as in most fools well well said he gruffly the matter needs reflection it needs reflection  behind them the door opened noiselessly and her ladyship appeared in cloak and wimple she paused there unperceived by either arrested by the words she had caught and waiting in the hope of hearing more  i must sleep ont at least his lordship was continuing tis too grave a matter to be determined thus in haste  a faint sound caught the keen ears of mr caryll he turned with a leisureliness that bore witness to his miraculous selfcontrol perceiving the countess he bowed and casually put his lordship on his guard  ah said he here is her ladyship returned  lord ostermore gasped audibly and swung round in an alarm than which nothing could have betrayed him more effectively mymy love he cried stammering and by his wild haste to conceal the letter that he held drew her attention to it  mr caryll stepped between them his back to his lordship that he might act as a screen under cover of which to dispose safely of that dangerous document but he was too late her ladyships quick eyes had flashed to it and if the distance precluded the possibility of her discovering anything that might be written upon it she nevertheless could see the curious nature of the paper which was of the flimsiest tissue of a sort extremely uncommon  what ist ye hide said she as she came forward why we are very close surely what mischief ist ye hatch my lord  mismischief my love he smiled propitiatinglyhating her more than ever in that moment he had stuffed the letter into an inner pocket of his coat and but that she had another matter to concern her at the moment she would not have allowed the question she had asked to be so put aside but this other matter upon her mind touched her very closely  devil take it whatever it may be rotherby is here  rotherby his demeanor changed from conciliating it was of a sudden transformed to indignant what makes he here he demanded did i not forbid him my house  i brought him she answered pregnantly  but for once he was not to be put down then you may take him hence again said he ill not have him under my roofunder the same roof with that poor child he used so infamously ill not suffer it  the gorgon cannot have looked more coldly wicked than her ladyship just then have a care my lord she muttered threateningly oh have a care i do beseech you i am not so to be crossed  nor am i maam he rejoined and then before more could be said mr caryll stepped forward to remind them of his presencewhich they seemed to stand in danger of forgetting  i fear that i intrude my lord said he and bowed in leavetaking i shall wait upon your lordship later your most devoted maam your very humble servant and he bowed himself out  in the anteroom he came upon lord rotherby striding to and fro his brow all furrowed with care at sight of mr caryll the viscounts scowl grew blacker oons and the devil he cried what make you here  that said mr caryll pleasantly is the very question your father is asking her ladyship concerning yourself your servant sir and airy graceful smiling that damnable close smile of his he was gone leaving rotherby very hot and angry  outside mr caryll hailed a chair and had himself carried to his lodging in old palace yard where leduc awaited him as his bearers swung briskly along mr caryll sat back and gave himself up to thought  lord ostermore interested him vastly for a moment that day the earl had aroused his anger as you may have judged from the sudden resolve upon which he had acted when he delivered him that letter thus embarking at the eleventh hour upon a task which he had already determined to abandon he knew not now whether to rejoice or deplore that he had acted upon that angry impulse he knew not indeed whether to pity or despise this man who was swayed by no such high motives as must have affected most of those who were faithful to the exiled james those motivesmotives of chivalry and romanticism in most caseslord ostermore would have despised if he could have understood them for he was a man of the type that despises all things that are not essentially practical whose results are not immediately obvious being all but ruined by his association with the south sea company he was willing for the sake of profit to turn traitor to the king de facto even as thirty years ago actuated by similar motives he had turned traitor to the king de jure  what was one to make of such a man wondered mr caryll if he were equipped with wit enough to apprehend the baseness of his conduct he would be easily understood and it would be easy to despise him but mr caryll perceived that he was dealing with one who never probed into the deeps of anythinghimself and his own conduct least of alland that a deplorable lack of perception of understanding almost deprived his lordship of the power to feel as most men feel to judge as most men judge and hence was it that mr caryll thought him a subject for pity rather than contempt even in that other thirtyyearold matter that so closely touched mr caryll the latter was sure that the same pitiful shortcomings might be urged in the mans excuse  meanwhile behind him at stretton house mr caryll had left a scene of strife between lady ostermore and her son on one side and lord ostermore on the other weak and vacillating as he was in most things it seemed that the earl could be strong in his dislike of his son and firm in his determination not to condone the infamy of his behavior toward hortensia winthrop  the fault is yours rotherby sought to excuse himself againemploying the old argument and in an angry contemptuous tone that was entirely unfilial id ha married the girl in earnest but for your threats to disinherit me  you fool his father stormed at him did you suppose that if i should disinherit you for marrying her i should be likely to do less for your luring her into a mock marriage ive done with you go your ways for a damned profligatea scandal to the very name of gentleman ive done with you  and to that the earl adhered in spite of all that rotherby and his mother could urge he stamped out of the library with a final command to his son to quit his house and never disgrace it again by his presence rotherby looked ruefully at his mother  he means it said he he never loved me he was never a father to me  were you ever greatly a son to him asked her ladyship  as much as he would ha me be he answered his black face very sullen oh sdeath i am damnably used by him he paced the chamber storming all this garboil about nothing he complained was he never young himself and when all is said theres no harm done the girls been fetched home again  pshaw yere a fool rotherbya fool and theres an end ont said his mother i sometimes wonder which is the greater foolyou or your father and yet he can marvel that you are his son what do ye think would have happened if you had had your way with that breadandbutter miss it had been matter enough to hang you  pooh said the viscount dropping into a chair and staring sullenly at the carpet then sullenly he added his lordship would have been glad ontso some one would have been pleased as it is  as it is yed better find the man green who was at maidstone and stop his mouth with guineas he is aware of what passed  bah green was there on other business and he told her of the suspicions the messenger entertained against mr caryll  it set her ladyship thinking why she said presently twill be that  twill be what maam asked rotherby looking up  why this fellow caryll must ha bubbled the messenger in spite of the search he may have made i found the popinjay here with your father the pair as thick as thievesand your father with a paper in his hand as fine as a cobweb sdeath ill be sworn hes a damned jacobite  rotherby was on his feet in an instant he remembered suddenly all that he had overheard at maidstone oho he crowed what cause have ye to think that  cause why what i have seen besides i feel it in my bones my every instinct tells me tis so  if you should prove right oh if you should prove right death id find a way to settle the score of that pert fellow from france and to dictate terms to his lordship at the same time  her ladyship stared at him yere an unnatural hound rotherby would ye betray your own father  betray him no but ill set a term to his plotting egad has he not lost enough in the south sea bubble without sinking the little that is left in some wildgoose jacobite plot  how shall it matter to you since hes sworn to disinherit you  how madam rotherby laughed cunningly ill prevent the one and the otherand pay off mr caryll at the same time three birds with one stone let me perish he reached for his hat i must find this fellow green  what will you do she asked a slight anxiety trembling in her voice  stir up his suspicions of caryll hell be ready enough to act after his discomfiture at maidstone ill warrant hes smarting under it if once we can find cause to lay caryll by the heels the fear of the consequences should bring his lordship to his senses twill be my turn then  but youll do nothing thatthat will hurt your father she enjoined him her hand upon his shoulder  trust me he laughed and added cynically it would hardly sort with my interests to involve him it will serve me best to frighten him into reason and a sense of his paternal duty     chapter ix the champion   mr caryll was well and handsomely housed as became the man of fashion in the lodging he had taken in old palace yard knowing him from abroad it was not impossible that the governmentfearful of sedition since the disturbance caused by the south sea distress and aware of an undercurrent of jacobitismmight for a time at least keep an eye upon him it behooved him therefore to appear neither more nor less than a lounger a gentleman of pleasure who had come to london in quest of diversion to support this appearance mr caryll had sought out some friends of his in town there were stapleton and collis who had been at oxford with him and with whom he had ever since maintained a correspondence and a friendship he sought them out on the very evening of his arrivalafter his interview with lord ostermore he had the satisfaction of being handsomely welcomed by them and was plunged under their guidance into the gaieties that the town afforded liberally for people of quality  mr caryll wasas i hope you have gatheredan agreeable fellow very free moreover with the contents of his wellequipped purse and so you may conceive that the town showed him a very friendly cordial countenance he fell into the habits of the men whose company he frequented his days were as idle as theirs and spent at the parade the ring the play the coffeehouse and the ordinary  but under the gay exterior he affected he carried a spirit of most vile unrest the anger which had prompted his impulse to execute after all the business on which he was come and to deliver his father the letter that was to work his ruin was all spent he had cooled and cool it was idle for him to tell himself that lord ostermore by his heartless allusion to the crime of his early years had proved himself worthy of nothing but the pit mr caryll had been sent to dig for him there were moments when he sought to compel himself so to think to steel himself against all other considerations but it was idle the reflection that the task before him was unnatural came ever to revolt him to gain ease the most that he could doand he had the faculty of it developed in a preternatural degreewas to put the business from him for the time endeavor to forget it and he had another matter to consider and to plague himthe matter of hortensia winthrop he thought of her a great deal more than was good for his peace of mind for all that he pretended to a gladness that things were as they were each morning that he lounged at the parade in st jamess park each evening that he visited the ring it was in the hope of catching some glimpse of her among the fashionable women that went abroad to see and to be seen and on the third morning after his arrival the thing he hoped for came to pass  it had happened that my lady had ordered her carriage that morning dressed herself with the habitual splendor which but set off the shortcomings of her lean and angular person egregiously coiffed pulvilled and topknotted and she had sent a message amounting to a command to mistress winthrop that she should drive in the park with her  poor hortensia whose one desire was to hide her face from the towns uncharitable sight just then fearing indeed that rumors unscrupulous tongue would be as busy about her reputation as her ladyship had represented attempted to assert herself by refusing to obey the command it was in vain her ladyship dispensed with ambassadors and went in person to convey her orders to her husbands ward and to enforce them  whats this i am told quoth she as she sailed into hortensias room do my wishes count for nothing that you send me pert answers by my woman  hortensia rose she had been sitting by the window a book in her lap not so indeed madam not pert i trust i am none so well and i fear the sun  tis little wonder laughed her ladyship and im glad ont for it shows ye have a conscience somewhere but tis no matter for that i am tender for your reputation mistress and ill not have you shunning daylight like the guilty thing ye know yourself to be  tis false madam said hortensia with indignation your ladyship knows it to be false  harkee ninny if youd have the town believe it false youll show yourselfshow that ye have no cause for shame no cause to hide you from the eyes of honest folk come girl bid your woman get your hood and tippet the carriage stays for us  to hortensia her ladyships seemed after all a good argument did she hide what must the town think but that it confirmed the talk that she made no doubt was going round already better to go forth and brave it and surely it should disarm the backbiters if she showed herself in the park with lord rotherbys own mother  it never occurred to her that this seeming tenderness for her reputation might be but wanton cruelty on her ladyships part a gratifying of her spleen against the girl by setting her in the pillory of public sight to the end that she should experience the insult of supercilious glances and lips that smile with an ostentation of furtiveness a desire to put down her pride and break the spirit which my lady accounted insolent and stubborn  suspecting naught of this she consented and drove out with her ladyship as she was desired to do but understanding of her ladyships cruel motives and repentance of her own acquiescence were not long in following soonvery soonshe realized that anything would have been better than the ordeal she was forced to undergo  it was a warm sunny morning and the park was crowded with fashionable loungers lady ostermore left her carriage at the gates and entered the enclosure on foot accompanied by hortensia and followed at a respectful distance by a footman her arrival proved something of a sensation hats were swept off to her ladyship sly glances flashed at her companion who went pale but apparently serene eyes looking straight before her and there was an obvious concealing of smiles at first which later grew to be all unconcealed and later still became supplemented by remarks that all might hear remarks which did not escapeas they were meant not to escapeher ladyship and mistress winthrop  madam murmured the girl in her agony of shame we were not welladvised to come will not your ladyship turn back  her ladyship displayed a vinegary smile and looked at her companion over the top of her slowly moving fan why ist not pleasant here quoth she twill be more agreeable under the trees yonder the sun will not reach you there child  tis not the sun i mind madam said hortensia but received no answer perforce she must pace on beside her ladyship  lord rotherby came by arm in arm with his friend the duke of wharton it was a onesided friendship lord rotherby was but one of the many of his type who furnished a court a valetaille to the gay dissolute handsome witty duke who might have been great had he not preferred his vices to his worthier parts  as they went by lord rotherby bared his head and bowed as did his companion her ladyship smiled upon him but hortensias eyes looked rigidly ahead her face a stone she heard his graces insolent laugh as they passed on she heard his voicenowise subdued for he was a man who loved to let the world hear what he might have to say  gad rotherby the wind has changed your dulcinea flies with you o wednesday and has neer a glance for you o saturday i faith ye deserve no better art a clumsy gallant to have been overtaken and the maids in the right ont to resent your clumsiness  rotherbys reply was lost in a splutter of laughter from a group of sycophants who had overheard his graces criticism and were but too ready to laugh at aught his grace might deign to utter her cheeks burned it was by an effort that she suppressed the tears that anger was forcing to her eyes  the duke twas plain had set the fashion emulators were not wanting stray words she caught by instinct was she conscious of the oglings the fluttering of fans from the women the flashing of quizzingglasses from the men and everywhere was there a suppressed laugh a stifled exclamation of surprise at her appearance in publicyet not so stifled but that it reached her as it was intended that it should  in the shadow of a great elm around which there was a seat a little group had gathered of which the centre was the sometime toast of the town and queen of many wells the lady mary deller still beautiful and still unwedas is so often the way of reigning toastsbut already past her pristine freshness already leaning upon the support of art to maintain the endowments she had had from nature she was accounted witty by the witless and by some others  of the group that paid its court to her and her companionstwo giggling cousins in their first season were mr caryll and his friends sir harry collis and mr edward stapleton the former of whomhe was the ladys brotherinlawhad just presented him mr caryll was dressed with even more than his ordinary magnificence he was in dovecolored cloth his coat very richly laced with gold his waistcoatof white brocade with jeweled buttons the flowerpattern outlined in finest gold threaddescended midway to his knees whilst the ruffles at his wrists and the steinkirk at his throat were of the finest point he cut a figure of supremest elegance as he stood there his chestnut head slightly bowed in deference as my lady mary spoke his hat tucked under his arm his right hand outstretched beside him to rest upon the gold head of his cloudedamber cane  to the general he was a stranger still in town and of the sort that draws the eye and provokes inquiry lady mary the only goal of whose shallow existence was the attention of the sterner sex who loved to break hearts as a child breaks toys for the fun of seeing how they look when brokenand who because of that had succeeded in breaking far fewer than she fondly imaginedlooked up into his face with the most perditiously alluring eyes in englandso mr craske the poet who stood at her elbow now had described them in the dedicatory sonnet of his last book of poems wherefore in parenthesis be it observed she had rewarded him with twenty guineas as he had calculated that she would  there was a sudden stir in the group mr craske had caught sight of lady ostermore and mistress winthrop and he fell to giggling a flimsy handkerchief to his painted lips oh sbud he bleated let me die the audaciousness of the creature and behold me the port and glance of her cold as a vestal let me perish  lady mary turned with the others to look in the direction he was pointingpointing openly with no thought of dissembling  mr carylls eyes fell upon mistress winthrop and his glance was oddly perceptive he observed those matters of which mr craske had seemed to make sardonic comment the erect stiffness of her carriage the eyes that looked neither to right nor left and the pallor of her face he observed too the complacent air with which her ladyship advanced beside her husbands ward her fan moving languidly her head nodding to her acquaintance as in supreme unconcern of the stir her coming had effected  mr caryll had been dull indeed knowing what he knew had he not understood to the full the humiliation to which mistress hortensia was being of purpose set submitted  and just then rotherby who had turned with wharton and another now came by them again this time he halted and his companions with him for just a moment to address his mother she turned there was an exchange of greetings in which mistress hortensia standing rigid as stonetook no part a silence fell about quizzingglasses went up all eyes were focussed upon the group then rotherby and his friends resumed their way  the dog said mr caryll between his teeth but went unheard by any for in that moment dorothy dellerthe younger of the lady marys cousinsgave expression to the generous and as yet unsullied little heart that was her own  oh tis shameful she cried will you not go speak with her molly  the lady mary stiffened she looked at the company about her with an apologetic smile i beg that yell not heed the child said she tis not that she is without moralsbut without knowledge an innocent little fool no worse  tis bad enough i vow laughed an old beau who sought fame as a man of a cynical turn of humor  but fortunately rare said mr caryll dryly like charity almost unknown in this babylon  his tone was not quite nice although perhaps the lady mary was the only one to perceive the note of challenge in it but mr craske the poet diverted attention to himself by a prolonged malicious chuckle rotherby was just moving away from his mother at that moment  theyve never a word for each other today he cried oh sbud not so much as the mercy of a glance will the lady afford him and he burst into the ballad of king francis                  souvent femme varie                  bien fol est qui sy fie  and laughed his prodigious delight at the aptness of his quotation  mr caryll put up his goldrimmed quizzingglass and directed through that powerful weapon of offence an eye of supreme displeasure upon the singer he could not contain his rage yet from his languid tone none would have suspected it sir said he yeve a singular unpleasant voice  mr craske thrown out of countenance by so much directness could only stare the same did the others though some few tittered for mr craske when all was said was held in no great esteem by the discriminant  mr caryll lowered his glass ive heard it said by the uncharitable that ye were a lackey before ye became a plagiarist tis a rumor i shall contradict in future tis plainly a lie for your voice betrays you to have been a chairman  sirsir spluttered the poetaster crimson with anger and mortification is thisis thisseemlybetween gentlemen  between gentlemen it would not be seemly mr caryll agreed  mr craske quivering yet controlling himself bowed stiffly i have too much respect for myself he gasped  yell be singular in that no doubt said mr caryll and turned his shoulder upon him  again mr craske appeared to make an effort at selfcontrol again he bowed i knowi hopewhat is due to the lady mary deller toto answer you asas befits but you shall hear from me sir you shall hear from me  he bowed a third timea bow that took in the entire companyand withdrew in high dudgeon and with a great show of dignity a pause ensued and then the lady mary reproved mr caryll  oh twas cruel in you sir she cried poor mr craske and to dub him plagiarist twas the unkindest cut of all  truth madam is never kind  oh fie you make bad worse she cried  hell put you in the pillory of his verse for this laughed collis yell be most scurvily lampooned fort  poor mr craske sighed the lady mary again  poor indeed but not in the sense to deserve pity an upstart impostor such as that to soil a lady with his criticism  lady marys brows went up you use a singular severity sir she opined and i think it unwise in you to grow so hot in the defence of a reputation whose owner has so little care for it herself  mr caryll looked at her out of his level graygreen eyes a hot answer quivered on his tongue an answer that had crushed her venom for some time and had probably left him with a quarrel on his hands yet his smile as he considered her was very sweet so sweet that her ladyship guessing nothing of the bitterness it was used to cover went as near a smirk as it was possible for one so elegant he was she judged another victim ripe for immolation on the altar of her goddessship and mr caryll who had taken her measure very thoroughly seeing something of how her thoughts were running bethought him of a sweeter vengeance  lady mary he cried a soft reproach in his voice i have been sore mistook in you if you are one to be guided by the rabble and he waved a hand toward the modish throng  she knit her fine brows bewildered  ah he cried interpreting her glance to suit his ends perish the thought indeed i knew that i could not be wrong i knew that one so peerless in all else must be peerless too in her opinions judging for herself and standing firm upon her judgment in disdain of meaner soulsmere sheep to follow their bellwether  she opened her mouth to speak but said nothing being too intrigued by this sudden and most sweet flattery her mere beauty had oft been praised and in terms that glowed like fire but what was that compared with this fine appreciation of her less obvious mental partsand that from one who had seen the world  mr caryll was bending over her what a chance is here he was murmuring to mark your lofty detachmentto show how utter is your indifference to what the common herd may think  asas how she asked blinking up at him  the others stood at gaze scarce yet suspecting the drift of so much talk  there is a poor lady yonder of whose fair name a bubble is being blown and pricked i dare swear theres not a woman here durst speak to her yet what a chance for one that dared how fine a triumph would be hers he sighed heigho i almost wish i were a woman that i might make that triumph mine and mark my superiority to these painted dolls that have neither wit nor courage  the lady mary rose a faint color in her cheeks a sparkle in her fine eyes a great joy flashed into mr carylls in quick response a joy in hershe thought with ready vanityand a heightening admiration  will you make it yours as it should beas it must ever beto lead and not to follow he cried flattering incredibility trembling in his voice  and why not sir she demanded now thoroughly aroused  why not indeedsince you are you quoth he it is what i had hoped in you and yetand yet what i had almost feared to hope  she frowned upon him now so excellently had he done his work why should you have feared that  alas i am a man of little faithunworthy indeed your good opinion since i entertained a doubt it was a blasphemy  she smiled again you acknowledge your faults with such a grace said she that we must needs forgive them and now to show you how much you need forgiveness come children she bade her cousinsfor whose innocence she had made apology but a moment back your arm harry she begged her brotherinlaw  sir harry obeyed her readily but without eagerness in his heart he cursed his friend caryll for having set her on to this  mr caryll himself hung upon her other side his eyes toward lady ostermore and hortensia who whilst being observed by all were being approached by few and these few confined themselves to an exchange of greetings with her ladyship which constituted a worse offence to mistress winthrop than had they stayed away  suddenly as if drawn by his ardent gaze hortensias eyes moved at last from their forward fixity her glance met mr carylls across the intervening space instantly he swept off his hat and bowed profoundly the action drew attention to himself all eyes were focussed upon him and between many a pair there was a frown for one who should dare thus to run counter to the general attitude  but there was more to follow the lady mary accepted mr carylls salutation of hortensia as a signal she led the way promptly and the little band swept forward straight for its goal raked by the volleys from a thousand eyes under which the lady mary already began to giggle excitedly  thus they reached the countess the countess standing very rigid in her amazement to receive them  i hope i see your ladyship well said lady mary  i hope your ladyship does answered the countess tartly  mistress winthrops eyes were lowered her cheeks were scarlet her distress was plain born of her doubt of the lady marys purpose and suspense as to what might follow  i have not the honor of your wards acquaintance lady ostermore said lady mary whilst the men were bowing and her cousins curtseying to the countess and her companion collectively  the countess gasped recovered and eyed the speaker without any sign of affection my husbands ward maam she corrected in a voice that seemed to discourage further mention of hortensia  tis but a distinction put in mr caryll suggestively  indeed yes will not your ladyship present me the countess malevolent eyes turned a moment upon mr caryll smiling demurely at lady marys elbow in his faceas well as in the four words he had utteredshe saw that here was work of his and he gained nothing in her favor by it meanwhile there were no groundsother than such as must have been wantonly offensive to the lady mary and so not to be dreamed ofupon which to refuse her request the countess braced herself and with an ill grace performed the brief ceremony of presentation  mistress winthrop looked up an instant then down again it was a piteous almost a pleading glance  lady mary leaving the countess to sir harry stapleton caryll and the others moved to hortensias side for a moment she was at loss what to say and took refuge in a commonplace  i have long desired the pleasure of your acquaintance said she  i am honored madam replied hortensia with downcast eyes then lifting them with almost disconcerting suddenness your ladyship has chosen an odd season in which to gratify this desire with which you honor me  lady mary laughed as much at the remark as for the benefit of those whose eyes were upon her she knew there would not be wanting many who would condemn her but these should be far outnumbered by those who would be lost in admiration of her daring that she could so fly in the face of public opinion and she was grateful to mr caryll for having suggested to her a course of such distinction  i could have chosen no better season she replied to mark my scorn of evil tongues and backbiters  color stained hortensias cheek again gratitude glowed in her eyes you are very noble madam she answered with flattering earnestness  la said the lady mary is nobility then so easily achieved and thereafter they talked of inconsequent trifles until mr caryll moved towards them and lady mary turned aside to speak to the countess  at mr carylls approach hortensias eyes had been lowered again and she made no offer to address him as he stood before her now hat under arm leaning easily upon his amber cane  oh heart of stone said he at last am i not yet forgiven  she misread his meaningperhaps already the suspicion she now voiced had been in her mind she looked up at him sharply was itwas it you who fetched the lady mary to me she inquired  lo said he you have a voice now heaven be praised i was fearing it was lost for methat you had made some awful vow never again to rejoice my ears with the music of it  you have not answered my question she reminded him  nor you mine said he i asked you am i not yet forgiven  forgiven what  for being born an impudent fleering coxcombtwas that you called me i think  she flushed deeply if you would win forgiveness you should not remind me of the offence she answered low  nay he rejoined that is to confound forgiveness with forgetfulness i want you to forgive and yet to remember  that were to condone  what else tis nothing less will satisfy me  you expect too much she answered with a touch that was almost of sternness  he shrugged and smiled whimsically it is my way he said apologetically nature has made me expectant and life whilst showing me the folly of it has not yet cured me  she looked at him and repeated her earlier question was it at your bidding that lady mary came to speak with me  fie he cried what insinuations do you make against her  insinuations  what else that she should do things at my bidding  she smiled understanding you have a talent sir for crooked answers  tis to conceal the rectitude of my behavior  it fails of its object then said she for it deludes no one she paused and laughed at his look of assumed blankness i am deeply beholden to you she whispered quickly breathing at once gratitude and confusion  though i dont descry the cause said he twill be something to comfort me  more he might have added then for the mad mood was upon him awakened by those soft brown eyes of hers but in that moment the others of that little party crowded upon them to take their leave of mistress winthrop  mr caryll felt satisfied that enough had been done to curb the slander concerning hortensia but he was not long in learning how profound was his mistake on every side he continued to hear her discussed and in such terms as made his ears tingle and his hands itch to be at work in her defence for with smirks and sneers and innuendoes her escapade with lord rotherby continued to furnish a topic for the town as her ladyship had sworn it would yet by what right could he espouse her cause with any one of her defamers without bringing her fair name into still more odious notoriety  and meanwhile he knew that he was under strict surveillance from mr green knew that he was watched wherever he went and nothing but his confidence that no evidence could be produced against him allowed him to remain as he did all unconcerned of this  leduc had more than once seen mr green about old palace yard besides a couple of his underlings one or the other of whom was never absent from the place no doubt with intent to observe who came and went at mr carylls once indeed during the absence of master and servant mr carylls lodging was broken into and on leducs return he found a confusion which told him how thoroughly the place had been ransacked  if mr caryll had had anything to hide this would have given him the hint to take his precautions but as he had nothing that was in the least degree in incriminating he went his ways in supremest unconcern of the vigilance exerted over him he used however a greater discretion in the resorts he frequented and if upon occasion he visited such tory meetingplaces as the bell tavern in king street or the cocoatree in pall mall he was still more often to be found at whites that ultrawhig resort  it was at this latter house one evening three or four days after his meeting with hortensia in the park that the chance was afforded him at last of vindicating her honor in a manner that need not add to the scandal that was already abroad nor serve to couple his name with hers unduly and it was lord rotherby himself who afforded him the opportunity  the thing fell out in this wise mr caryll was at cards with harry collis and stapleton and major gascoigne in a room abovestairs there were at least a dozen others present some also at play others merely lounging of the latter was his grace of wharton he was a slender graceful gentleman whose face if slightly effeminate and markedly dissipated was nevertheless of considerable beauty he was very splendid in a suit of green camlett and silver lace and he wore a flaxen periwig without powder  he was awaiting rotherby with whomas he told the companyhe was for a frolic at drury lane where a ridotto was following the play he spoke as usual in a loud voice that all might hear and his talk was loose and heavily salted as became the talk of a rake of his exalted rank it was chiefly concerned with airing his bitter grievance against mrs girdlebank of the theatre royal of whom he announced himself devilishly enamoured  he inveighed against her that she should have the gross vulgarity to love her husband and against her husband that he should have the audacity to play the watchdog over her and bark and growl at the dukes approach  a plague on all husbands say i ended the worthy president of the bold bucks  nay now but im a husband myself gad protested mr sidney who was quite the most delicate mincing man of fashion about town and one of that valetaille that hovered about his grace of whartons heels  tis no matter in your case said the duke with that contempt he used towards his followers your wifes too ugly to be looked at and mr sidneys fresh protest was drowned in the roar of laughter that went up to applaud that brutal frankness mr caryll turned to the fop who happened to be standing at his elbow  never repine man said he in the company you keep such a wife makes for peace of mind to have that is to have much  wharton resumed his railings at the girdlebanks and was still at them when rotherby came in  at last charles the duke hailed him rising another minute and i had gone without you  but rotherby scarce looked at him and answered with unwonted shortness his eyes had discovered mr caryll it was the first time he had run against him since that day over a week ago at stretton house and at sight of him now all rotherbys spleen was moved he stood and stared his dark eyes narrowing his cheeks flushing slightly under their tan wharton who had approached him observing his sudden halt his sudden look of concentration asked him shortly what might ail him  i have seen someone i did not expect to find in a resort of gentlemen said rotherby his eyes ever on mr caryll whoengrossed in his gamewas all unconscious of his lordships advent  wharton followed the direction of his companions gaze and giving now attention himself to mr caryll he fell to appraising his genteel appearance negligent of the insinuation in what rotherby had said  sdeath swore the duke tis a man of tastea travelled gentleman by his air behold me the grace of that shoulderknot charles and the set of that most admirable coat fifty guineas wouldnt buy his steinkirk who is this beau  ill present him to your grace said rotherby shortly he had pretentions at being a beau himself but his gracesupreme arbiter in such mattershad never yet remarked it  they moved across the room greetings passing as they went at their approach mr caryll looked up rotherby made him a leg with an excessive show of deference arguing irony tis an unlookedfor pleasure to meet you here sir said he in a tone that drew the attention of all present  no pleasures are so sweet as the unexpected answered mr caryll with casual amiability and since he perceived at once the errand upon which lord rotherby was come to him he went halfway to meet him has your lordship been contracting any marriages of late he inquired  the viscount smiled icily you have quick wits sir said he which is as it should be in one who lives by them  let your lordship be thankful that such is not your own case returned mr caryll with imperturbable good humor and sent a titter round the room  a hit a shrewd hit pon honor cried wharton tapping his snuffbox i vow to gad yere undone charles yed better play at repartee with gascoigne there yere more of a weight  your grace cried rotherby suppressing at great cost his passion tis not to be borne that a fellow of this condition should sit among men of quality and with that he swung round and addressed the company in general gentlemen do you know who this fellow is he has the effrontery to take my name and call himself caryll  mr caryll looked a moment at his brother in the silence that followed then as in a flash he saw his chance of vindicating mistress winthrop and he seized it  and do you know gentlemen who this fellow is he inquired with an air of sly amusement he isnay you shall judge for yourselves you shall hear the story of how we met it is the story of his abduction of a lady whose name need not be mentioned the story of his dastardly attempt to cozen her into a mockmarriage  mockmockmarriage cried the duke and a dozen others with him some in surprise but most in an unbelief that was already faintly tinged with horrorwhich argued ill for my lord rotherby when the story should be told  you damned rogue began his lordship and would have flung himself upon caryll but that collis and stapleton and wharton himself put forth hands to stay him by main force  others too had risen but mr caryll sat quietly in his chair idly fingering the cards before him and smiling gently between amusement and irony he was much mistaken if he did not make lord rotherby bitterly regret the initiative he had taken in their quarrel  gently my lord the duke admonished the viscount thisthis gentleman has said that which touches your honor he shall say more he shall make good his words or eat them but the matter cannot rest thus  it shall not by god swore rotherby purple now it shall not ill kill him like a dog for what he has said  but before i die gentlemen said mr caryll it were well that you should have the full story of that sorry adventure from an eyewitness  an eyewitness were ye present cried two or three in a breath  i desire to lay before you all the story of how we met my lord there and i it is so closely enmeshed with the story of that abduction and mockmarriage that the one is scarce to be distinguished from the other  rotherby writhed to shake off those who held him  will ye listen to this fellow he roared hes a spy i tell youa jacobite spy he was beside himself with anger and apprehension and he never paused to weigh the words he uttered it was with him a question of stopping his accusers mouth with whatever mud came under his hands he has no right here it is not to be borne i know not by what means he has thrust himself among you but  that is a knowledge i can afford your lordship came stapletons steady voice to interrupt the speaker mr caryll is here by my invitation  and by mine and gascoignes here added sir harry collis and i will answer for his quality to any man who doubts it  rotherby glared at mr carylls sponsors struck dumb by this sudden and unexpected refutation of the charge he had leveled  wharton who had stepped aside knit his brows and flashed his quizzingglassthrough sheer force of habitupon lord rotherby then  youll pardon me harry said he but youll see i hope that the question is not impertinent that i put it to the end that we may clearly know with whom we have to deal and what consideration to extend him what credit to attach to the communication he is to make us touching my lord here under what circumstances did you become acquainted with mr caryll  i have known him these twelve years answered collis promptly so has stapleton so has gascoigne so have a dozen other gentlemen who could be produced and who like ourselves were at oxford with him for myself and stapleton i can say that our acquaintanceindeed i should say our friendshipwith mr caryll has been continuous since then and that we have visited him on several occasions at his estate of maligny in normandy that he habitually inhabits the country of his birth is the reason why mr caryll has not hitherto had the advantage of your graces acquaintance need i say more to efface the false statement made by my lord rotherby  false do you dare give me the lie sir roared rotherby  but the duke soothed him under his profligate exterior his grace of wharton concealedindeed wasteda deal of shrewdness ability and inherent strength one thing at a time my lord said the president of the bold bucks let us attend to the matter of mr caryll  dons and the devil does your grace take sides with him  i take no sides but i owe it to myselfwe all owe it to ourselvesthat this matter should be cleared  rotherby leered at him his lip trembling with anger does the president of the bold bucks pretend to administrate a court of honor he sneered heavily  your lordship will gain little by this wharton admonished him so coldly that rotherby belatedly came to some portion of his senses again the duke turned to caryll mr caryll said he sir harry has given you very handsome credentials which would seem to prove you worthy the hospitality of whites you have however permitted yourself certain expressions concerning his lordship here which we cannot allow to remain where you have left them you must retract sir or make them good his gravity and the preciseness of his diction now sorted most oddly with his foppish airs  mr caryll closed his snuffbox with a snap a hush fell instantly upon the company which by now was all crowding about the little table at which sat mr caryll and his three friends a footman who entered at the moment to snuff the candles and see what the gentlemen might be requiring was dismissed the room when the door had closed mr caryll began to speak  one more attempt was made by rotherby to interfere but this attempt was disposed of by wharton who had constituted himself entirely master of the proceedings  if you will not allow mr caryll to speak we shall infer that you fear what he may have to say you will compel us to hear him in your absence and i cannot think that you would prefer that my lord  my lord fell silent he was breathing heavily and his face was pale his eyes angry beyond words what time mr caryll in amiable musical voice with its precise and at moments slightly foreign enunciation unfolded the shameful story of the affair at the adam and eve at maidstone he told a plain straightforward tale making little attempt to reproduce any of its color giving his audience purely and simply the facts that had taken place he told how he himself had been chosen as a witness when my lord had heard that there was a traveller from france in the house and showed how that slight circumstance had first awakened his suspicions of foul play he provoked some amusement when he dealt with his detection and exposure of the sham parson but in the main he was heard with a stern and ominous attentionominous for lord rotherby  rakes these men admittedly were with but few exceptions no ordinary tale of gallantry could have shocked them or provoked them to aught but a contemptuous mirth at the expense of the victim male or female they would have thought little the worse of a man for running off with the wife say of one of his acquaintance they would have thought nothing of his running off with a sister or a daughterso long as it was not of their own all these were fair game and if the husband father or brother could not protect the wife sister or daughter that was his the more shame to him but though they might be fair game the game had its rulesanomalous as it may seem these rules lord rotherbyif the tale mr caryll told was truehad violated he had practiced a cheat the more dastardly because the poor lady who had so narrowly escaped being his victim had nether father nor brother to avenge her and in every eye that was upon him lord rotherby might have read had he had the wit to do so the very sternest condemnation  a pretty story as ive a soul was his graces comment when mr caryll had done a pretty story my lord rotherby i have a stomach for strong meat myself butodds my lifethis is too nauseous  rotherby glared at him slife your grace is grown very nice on a sudden he sneered the president of the bold bucks the master of the hell fire club is most oddly squeamish where the diversions of another are concerned  diversions said his grace his eyebrows raised until they all but vanished under the golden curls of his peruke diversions ha i observe that you make no attempt to deny the story you admit it then  there was a stir in the group a drawing back from his lordship he observed it trembling between chagrin and rage whats here he cried and laughed contemptuously oh ah youll follow where his grace leads you yeve followed him so long in lewdness that now yell follow him in conversion but as for you sir and he swung fiercely upon caryll you and your precious storywill you maintain it sword in hand  i can do better answered mr caryll if any doubts my word  as how  i can prove it categorically by witnesses  well said caryll stapleton approved him  and if i say that you lieyou and your witnesses  t is you will be liar said mr caryll  besides it is a little late for that cut in the duke  your grace cried rotherby is this affair yours  no i thank heaven said his grace and sat down  rotherby scowled at the man who until ten minutes ago had been his friend and boon companion and there was more of contempt than anger in his eyes he turned again to mr caryll who was watching him with a gleam of amusementthat infernally irritating amusement of hisin his graygreen eyes  well he demanded foolishly have you naught to say  i had thought returned mr caryll that i had said enough and the duke laughed aloud  rotherbys lip was curled ha you dont think now that you may have said too much  mr caryll stifled a yawn do you he inquired blandly  ay by god too much for a gentleman to leave unpunished  possibly but what gentleman is concerned in this  i am thundered rotherby  i see and how do you conceive that you answer the description  rotherby swore at him with great choice and variety you shall learn he promised him my friends shall wait on you tonight  i wonder who will carry his message ventured collis to the ceiling rotherby turned on him fierce as a rat it is a matter you may discover to your cost sir harry he snarled  i think put in his grace very languidly that you are troubling the harmony that is wont to reign here  his lordship stood still a moment then quite suddenly he snatched up a candlestick to hurl at mr caryll but he had it wrenched from his hands ere he could launch it  he stood a moment discomfited glowering upon his brother my friends shall wait on you tonight he repeated  you said so before mr caryll replied wearily i shall endeavor to make them welcome  his lordship nodded stupidly and strode to the door his departure was observed in silence on every face he read his sentence these menrakes though they were professedlywould own him no more for their associate and what these men thought tonight not a gentleman in town but would be thinking the same tomorrow he had the stupidity to lay it all to the score of mr caryll not perceiving that he had brought it upon himself by his own aggressiveness he paused his hand upon the doorknob and turned to loose a last shaft at them  as for you others that follow your bellwether there and he indicated his grace whose shoulder was towards him this matter ends not here  and with that general threat he passed out and that snug room at whites knew him no more  major gascoigne was gathering up the cards that had been flung down when first the storm arose mr caryll bent to assist him and the last voice lord rotherby heard as he departed was mr carylls and the words it uttered were come ned the deal is with you  his lordship swore through his teeth and went downstairs heavily     chapter x spurs to the reluctant   before mr caryll left whiteswhich he did at a comparatively early hour that he might be at home to receive lord rotherbys friendsnot a man present but had offered him his services in the affair he had upon his hands wharton indeed was not to be denied for one and for the other mr caryll desired gascoigne to do him the honor of representing him  it was a fine dry night and feeling the need for exercise mr caryll set out to walk the short distance from st jamess street to his lodging with a linkboy preceding him for only attendant arrived home he was met by leduc with the information that sir richard everard was awaiting him he went in and the next moment he was in the arms of his adoptive father  greetings and minor courtesies disposed of sir richard came straight to the affair which he had at heart well how speeds the matter  mr carylls face became overcast he sat down a thought wearily  so far as lord ostermore is concerned it speedsas you would wish it so far as i am concernedhe paused and sighedi would that it sped not at all or that i was out of it  sir richard looked at him with searching eyes how he asked what would you have me understand  that in spite of all that has been said between us in spite of all the arguments you have employed and with which once for a little while you convinced me this task is loathsome to me in the last degree ostermore is my father and i cant forget it  and your mother sir richards tone was sad rather than indignant it spoke of a bitter disappointment not at the events but at this man whom he loved with all a fathers love  it were idle to go over it all again i know everything that you wouldthat you couldsay i have said it all to myself again and again in a vain endeavor to steel myself to the business to which you plighted me had ostermore been different perhaps it had been easier i cannot say as it is i see in him a weakling a man of inferior intellect who does not judge things as you and i judge them whose life cannot have been guided by the rules that serve for men of stronger purpose  you find excuses for him for his deed cried sir richard and his voice was full of horror now he stared askance at his adoptive son  no no oh i dont know on my soul and conscience i dont know cried mr caryll like one in pain he rose and moved restlessly about the room no he pursued more calmly i dont excuse him i blame himmore bitterly than you can think perhaps more bitterly even than do you for i have had a look into his mind and see the exact place held there by my mothers memory i can judge and condemn him but i cant execute him i cant betray him i dont think i could do it even if he were not my father  he paused and leaning his hands upon the table at which sir richard sat he faced him and spoke in a voice of earnest pleading sir richard this was not the task to give me or if you had planned to give it me you should have reared me differently you should not have sought to make of me a gentleman you have brought me up to principles of honor and you ask me now to outrage them to cast them off and to become a very judas ist wonderful i should rebel  they were hurtful words to sir richardthe poor fanatic whose mind was all unsound on this one point who had lived in contemplation of his vengeance as a fasting monk lives through lent in contemplation of the easter plenty the lines of sorrow deepened in his face  justin he said slowly you forget one thing honor is to be used with men of honor but he who allows his honor to stand a barrier between himself and the man who has wronged him by dishonor is no better than a fool you speak of yourself you think of yourself and what of me justin the things you say of yourself apply in a like degreenay even moreto me  ah but you are not his son oh believe me i speak not hastily or lightly i have been torn this way and that in these past days until at moments the burden has been heavier than i could bear once for a little while i thought i could do all and more than you expect of methe moment indeed in which i took the first step and delivered him the letter but it was a moment of wild heat i cooled and reflection followed and since then because so much was done i have not known an instants peace of mind i have endeavored to forget the position in which i am placed but i have failed i cannot and if i go through with this thing i shall not know another hour in life that is not poisoned by remorse  remorse echoed sir richard between consternation and anger remorse he laughed bitterly what ails thee boy do you pretend that lord ostermore should go unpunished do you go so far as that  not so he has made others suffer and it is justas we understand justicethat he should suffer in his turn though when all is said he is but a poor egotist too dullwitted to understand the full vileness of his sin he is suffering as it iscursed in his son for the father of a fool hath no joy he hates this son of his and his son despises him his wife is a shrew a termagant who embitters every hour of his existence thus he drags out his life unloving and unloved a thing to evoke pity  pity cried sir richard in a voice of thunder pity ha as ive a soul justin he shall be more pitiful yet ere i have done with him  be it so then butif you love mefind some other hand to do the work  if i love you justin echoed the other and his voice softened his eyes looked reproachfully upon his adoptive child needs there an if to that are you not all i havemy son indeed  he held out his hands and justin took them affectionately and pressed them in his own  youll put these weak notions from your mind justin and prove worthy the noble lady who was your mother  mr caryll moved aside again hanging his head his face pale and troubled where everards arguments must fail his own affection for everard was like to conquer him it was very weak in him he told himself but then his love for everard was strong and he would fain spare everard the pain he knew he must be occasioning him still he did battle his repugnance up in arms  i would you could see the matter as i see it he sighed this man grown old and reaping in his old age the fruits of the egotism he has sown i do not believe that in all the world there is a single soul would weep his lordships deathif we except perhaps mistress winthrop  and do you pity him for that quoth sir richard coldly what right has he to expect aught else who sows for himself reaps for himself i marvel indeed that there should be even one to bewail himto spare him a kind thought  and even there mused mr caryll it is perhaps gratitude rather than affection that inspires the kindness  who is mistress winthrop  his ward as sweet a lady i think as i have ever seen said mr caryll incautious enthusiasm assailing him sir richards eyes narrowed  you have some acquaintance with her he suggested  very briefly mr caryll sketched for the second time that evening the circumstances of his first meeting with rotherby  sir richard nodded sardonically hum he is his fathers son not a doubt of that twill be a most worthy successor to my lord ostermore but the lady tell me of the lady how comes she linked with them  i scarce know save from the scraps that i have heard her father it would seem was ostermores friend and dying he appointed ostermore her guardian her fortune i take it is very slender nevertheless ostermore whatever he may have done by other people appears in this case to have discharged his trust with zeal and with affection but indeed who could have done other where that sweet lady was concerned you should see her sir richard he was pacing the room now as he spoke and as he spoke he warmed to his subject more and more she is middling tall of a most dainty slenderness darkhaired with a so sweet and saintly beauty of face that it must be seen to be believed and eyeslord the glory of her eyes they are eyes that would lead a man into hell and make him believe it heaven           love doth to her eyes repair            to help him of his blindness  sir richard watched him displeasure growing in his face so he said at last is that the reason  the reason of what quoth mr caryll recalled from his sweet rapture  the reason of these fresh qualms of yours the reason of all this sympathy for ostermore this unwillingness to perform the sacred duty that is yours  nayon my soul you do me wrong cried mr caryll indignantly if aught had been needed to spur me on it had been my meeting with this lady it needed that to make me realize to the bitter full the wrong my lord ostermore has done me in getting me to make me realize that i am a man without a name to offer any woman  but sir richard watching him intently shook his head and fetched a sigh of sorrow and disdain pshaw justin how we befool ourselves you think it is not so you try to think it is not so but to me it is very plain a woman has arisen in your life and this woman seen but once or twice unknown a week or so ago suffices to eclipse the memory of your mother and turns your aim in lifethe avenging of her bitter wrongsto water oh justin justin i had thought you stronger  your conclusions are all wrong i swear they are wrong  sir richard considered him sombrely are you surequite quite sure  mr carylls eyes fell as the doubt now entered his mind for the first time that it might be indeed as sir richard was suggesting he was not quite sure  prove it to me justin everard pleaded prove it by abandoning this weakness where my lord ostermore is concerned remember only the wrong he has done you are the incarnation of that wrong and by your hand must he be destroyed he rose and caught the younger mans hands again in his own forced mr caryll to confront him he shall know when the time comes whose hand it was that pulled him down he shall know the nemesis that has lain in wait for him these thirty years to smite him at the end and he shall taste hell in this world before he goes to it in the next it is gods own justice boy will you be false to the duty that lies before you will you forget your mother and her sufferings because you have looked into the eyes of this girl who  no no say no more cried mr caryll his voice trembling  you will do it said sir richard between question and assertion  if heaven lends me strength of purpose but it asks much was the gloomy answer i am to see lord ostermore tomorrow to obtain his answer to king james letter  sir richards eyes gleamed he released the others hands and turned slowly to his chair again it is well he said slowly the thing asks dispatch or else some of his majestys real friends may be involved  he proceeded to explain his words i have talked in vain with atterbury he will not abandon the enterprise even at king james commands he urges that his majesty can have no conception of how the matter is advanced that he has been laboring like hercules and that the party is being swelled by men of weight and substance every day that it is too late to go back and that he will go forward with the kings consent or without it should he or his agents approach ostermore in the meantime it will be too late for us to take such measures as we have concerted for to deliver up ostermore then would entail the betrayal of others which is not to be dreamt of so youll use dispatch  if i do the thing at all it shall be done tomorrow answered mr caryll  if at all cried sir richard frowning again if at all  caryll turned to him he crossed to the table and leaning across it until his face was quite close to his adoptive fathers sir richard he begged let us say no more tonight my will is all to do the thing it is mymy instincts that rebel i think that the day will be carried by my will i shall strive to that end believe me but let us say no more now  sir richard looking deep into mr carylls eyes was touched by something that he saw my poor justin he said gently then checking the sympathy as swiftly as it rose so be it then he said briskly youll come to me tomorrow after you have seen his lordship  will you not remain here  you have not the room besides sir richard everardis too well known for a jacobite to be observed sharing your lodging i have no right at all in england and there is always the chance of my being discovered i would not pull you down with me i am lodged at the corner of maiden lane next door to the sign of golden flitch come to me there tomorrow after you have seen lord ostermore he hesitated a moment he was impelled to recapitulate his injunctions but he forbore he put out his hand abruptly goodnight justin  justin took the hand and pressed it the door opened and leduc entered  captain mainwaring and mr falgate are here sir and would speak with you he announced  mr caryll knit his brows a moment his acquaintance with both men was of the slightest and it was only upon reflection that he bethought him they would no doubt be come in the matter of his affair with rotherby which in the stress of his interview with sir richard had been quite forgotten he nodded  wait upon sir richard to the door leduc he bade his man then introduce these gentlemen  sir richard had drawn back a step i trust neither of these gentlemen knows me he said i would not be seen here by any that did it might compromise you  but mr caryll belittled sir richards fears pooh tis very unlike said he whereupon sir richard seeing no help for it went out quickly leduc in attendance  lord rotherbys friends in the anteroom paid little heed to him as he passed briskly through surveillance came rather from an entirely unsuspected quarter as he left the house and crossed the square a figure detached itself from the shadow of the wall and set out to follow it hung in his rear through the filthy labyrinthine streets which sir richard took to charing cross followed him along the strand and up bedford street and took note of the house he entered at the corner of maiden lane   chapter xi the assaultatarms  the meeting was appointed by my lord rotherby for seven oclock next morning in lincolns inn fields it is true that lincolns inn fields at an early hour of the day was accounted a convenient spot for the transaction of such business as this yet considering that it was in the immediate neighborhood of stretton house overlooked indeed by the windows of that mansion it is not easy to rid the mind of a suspicion that rotherby appointed that place of purpose set and with intent to mark his contempt and defiance of his father with whom he supposed mr caryll to be in some league  accompanied by the duke of wharton and major gascoigne mr caryll entered the enclosure promptly as seven was striking from st clement danes they had come in a coach which they had left in waiting at the corner of portugal row  as they penetrated beyond the belt of trees they found that they were the first in the field and his grace proceeded with the major to inspect the ground so that time might be saved against the coming of the other party  mr caryll stood apart breathing the freshness of the sunlit morning but supremely indifferent to its glory he was gloomy and preoccupied he had slept ill that night after his interview with sir richard tormented by the odious choice that lay before him of either breaking with the adoptive father to whom he owed obedience and affection or betraying his natural father whom he had every reason to hate yet who remained his father he had been able to arrive at no solution duty seemed to point one way instinct the other down in his heart he felt that when the moment came it would be the behests of instinct that he would obey and in obeying them play false to sir richard and to the memory of his mother it was the only course that went with honor and yet it was a course that must lead to a break with the one friend he had in the worldthe one man who stood to him for family and kin  and now as if that were not enough to plague him there was this quarrel with rotherby which he had upon his hands that too he had been considering during the wakeful hours of that summer night had he reflected he must have seen that no other result could have followed his narrative at whites last night and yet it was a case in which reflection would not have stayed him hortensia winthrops fair name was to be cleansed of the smirch that had been cast upon it and justin was the only man in whose power it had lain to do it more than thatif more were neededit was rotherby himself by his aggressiveness who had thrust mr caryll into a position which almost made it necessary for him to explain himself and that he could scarcely have done by any other than the means which he had adopted under ordinary circumstances the matter would have troubled him not at all this meeting with such a man as rotherby would not have robbed him of a moments sleep but there came the reflectionbelatedlythat rotherby was his brother his fathers son and he experienced just the same degree of repugnance at the prospect of crossing swords with him as he did at the prospect of betraying lord ostermore sir richard would force upon him a parricides task fate a fratricides truly he thought it was an enviable position his  pacing the turf on which the dew still gleamed and sparkled diamondlike he pondered his course and wondered now at the last moment was there no way to avert this meeting could not the matter be arranged he was stirred out of his musings by gascoignes voice raised to curse the tardiness of lord rotherby  slife where does the fellow tarry was he so drunk last night that hes not yet slept himself sober  the streets are astir put in wharton helping himself to snuff and indeed the cries of the morning hawkers reached them now from the four sides of the square if his lordship does not come soon i doubt if we may stay for him we shall have half the town for spectators  who are these quoth gascoigne stepping aside and craning his neck to get a better view ah here they come and he indicated a group of three that had that moment passed the palings  gascoigne and wharton went to meet the newcomers lord rotherby was attended by mainwaring a militia captaina great burly scarred bully of a manand a mr falgate an extravagant young buck of his acquaintance an odder pair of sponsors he could not have found had he been at pains to choose them so  adso swore mr falgate in his shrill affected voice i vow tis a most ungenteel hour this for men of quality to be abroad i had my beauty sleep broke into to be here in time lard i shall be dozing all day fort he took off his hat and delicately mopped his brow with a square of lace he called a handkerchief  shall we come to business gentlemen quoth mainwaring gruffly  with all my heart answered wharton it is growing late  late la my dears clucked mr falgate in horror has your grace not been to bed yet  to save time said gascoigne we have made an inspection of the ground and we think that under the trees yonder is a spot not to be bettered  mainwaring flashed a critical and experienced eye over the place the sun isso he said looking up yes it should serve well enough i  it will not serve at all cried rotherby who stood a pace or two apart a little to the right there the turf is better  but there is no protection put in the duke you will be under observation from that side of the square including stretton house  what odds quoth rotherby do i care who overlooks us and he laughed unpleasantly or is your grace ashamed of being seen in your friends company  wharton looked him steadily in the face a moment then turned to his lordships seconds if mr caryll is of the same mind as his lordship we had best get to work at once he said and bowing to them withdrew with gascoigne  see to the swords mainwaring said rotherby shortly here fanny this to falgate whose name was francis and who delighted in the feminine diminutive which his intimates used toward him come help me with my clothes  i vow to gad protested mr falgate advancing to the task i make but an indifferent valet my dear  mr caryll stood thoughtful a moment when rotherbys wishes had been made known to him the odd irony of the situationthe key to which he was the only one to holdwas borne in upon him he fetched a sigh of utter weariness  i have said he the greatest repugnance to meeting his lordship  tis little wonder returned his grace contemptuously but since tis forced upon you i hope youll give him the lesson in manners that he needs  is itis it unavoidable quoth mr caryll  unavoidable wharton looked at him in stern wonder  gascoigne too swung round to stare unavoidable what can you mean caryll  i mean is the matter not to be arranged in any way must the duel take place  his grace of wharton stroked his chin contemplatively his eye ironical his lip curling never so slightly why said he at length you may beg my lord rotherbys pardon for having given him the lie you may retract and brand yourself a liar and your version of the maidstone affair a silly invention which ye have not the courage to maintain you may do that mr caryll for my own sake let me add i hope you will not do it  i am not thinking of your grace at all said mr caryll slightly piqued by the tone the other took with him but to relieve your mind of such doubts as i see you entertain i can assure you that it is out of no motives of weakness that i boggle at this combat though i confess that i am no ferrailleur and that i abhor the duel as a means of settling a difference just as i abhor all things that are stupid and insensate yet i am not the man to shirk an encounter where an encounter is forced upon me but in this affair he paused then endedthere is more than meets your graces eye or indeed anyones  he was so calm so master of himself that wharton perceived how groundless must have been his first notion whatever might be mr carylls motives it was plain from his most perfect composure that they were not motives of fear his graces halfcontemptuous smile was dissipated  this is mere trifling mr caryll he reminded his principal and time is speeding your withdrawal now would not only be damaging to yourself it would be damaging to the lady of whose fair name you have made yourself the champion you must see that it is too late for doubts on the score of this meeting  ayby god swore gascoigne hotly what a pox ails you caryll  mr caryll took off his hat and flung it on the ground behind him we must go on then said he gascoigne see to the swords with his lordships friend there  with a relieved look the major went forward to make the final preparations whilst mr caryll attended by wharton rapidly divested himself of coat and waistcoat then kicked off his light shoes and stood ready a slight lithe graceful figure in white holland shirt and pearlcolored small clothes  a moment later the adversaries were face to facerotherby divested of his wig and with a kerchief bound about his closecropped head all a trembling eagerness mr caryll with a reluctance lightly masked by a dangerous composure  there was a perfunctory salutea mere presenting of armsand the blades swept round in a halfcircle to their first meeting but rotherby without so much as allowing his steel to touch his opponents as the laws of courtesy demanded swirled it away again into the higher lines and lunged it was almost like a foul attempt to take his adversary unawares and unprepared and for a second it looked as if it must succeed it must have succeeded but for the miraculous quickness of mr caryll swinging round on the ball of his right foot lightly and gracefully as a dancing master and with no sign of haste or fear in his amazing speed he let the others harddriven blade glance past him to meet nothing but the empty air  as a result by the very force of the stroke rotherby found himself overreached and carried beyond his point of aim while mr carylls sideward movement brought him not only nearer his opponent but entirely within his guard  it was seen by them all and by none with such panic as rotherby himself that as a consequence of his quasifoul stroke the viscount was thrown entirely at the mercy of his opponent thus at the very outset of the encounter before their blades had so much as touched each other a straightening of the arm on the part of mr caryll and the engagement would have been at an end  mr caryll however did not straighten his arm he was observed to smile as he broke ground and waited for his lordship to recover  falgate turned pale mainwaring swore softly under his breath in fear for his principal gascoigne did the same in vexation at the opportunity mr caryll had so wantonly wasted wharton looked on with tightpressed lips and wondered  rotherby recovered and for a moment the two men stood apart seeming to feel each other with their eyes before resuming then his lordship renewed the attack with vigor  mr caryll parried lightly and closely plying a beautiful weapon in the best manner of the french school and opposing to the ponderous force of his antagonist a delicate frustrating science rotherby a fine swordsman in his way soon saw that here was need for all his skill and he exerted it but the prodigious rapidity of his blade broke as upon a cuirass against the others light impenetrable guard  his lordship broke ground breathed heavily and sweated under the glare of the morning sun cursing this swordsman who so cool and deliberate husbanded his strength and scarcely seemed to move yet by sheer skill and address more than neutralized his lordships advantages of greater strength and length of reach  you cursed french dog swore the viscount presently between his teeth and as he spoke he made a ringing parade feinted beat the ground with his foot to draw off the others attention and went in again with a fulllength lunge parry that you damned maitredarmes he roared  mr caryll answered nothing he parried parried again delivered a riposte whenever the opportunity offered or whenever his lordship grew too pressing and it became expedient to drive him back but never once did he stretch out to lunge in his turn the seconds were so lost in wonder at the beauty of this close play of his that they paid no heed to what was taking place in the square about them they never observed the opening windows and the spectators gathering at themas wharton had feared amongst these had either of the combatants looked up he would have seen his own father on the balcony of stretton house a moment the earl stood there lady ostermore at his side then he vanished into the house again to reappear almost at once in the street with a couple of footmen hurrying after him  meanwhile the combat went on once lord rotherby had attempted to fall back for a respite realizing that he was winded but mr caryll denied him this attacking now for the first time and the rapidity of his play was such that rotherby opinedthe end to be at hand appreciated to the full his peril in a last desperate effort gathering up what shreds of strength remained him he repulsed mr caryll by a vigorous counter attack he saw an opening feinted to enlarge it and drove in quickly throwing his last ounce of strength into the effort this time it could not be said to have been parried something else happened his blade coming foible on forte against mr carylls was suddenly enveloped it was as if a tentacle had been thrust out to seize it for the barest fraction of a second was it held so by mr carylls sword then easily but irresistibly it was lifted out of rotherbys hand and dropped on the turf a halfyard or so from his lordships stockinged feet  a cold sweat of terror broke upon him he caught his breath with a halfshuddering sob of fear his eyes dilating wildlyfor mr carylls point was coming straight as an arrow at his throat on it came and on until it was within perhaps three inches of the flesh  there it was suddenly arrested and for a long moment it was held there poised death itself menacing and imminent and lord rotherby not daring to move rooted where he stood looked with fascinated eyes along that shimmering blade into two gleaming eyes behind it that seemed to watch him with a solemnity that was grim to the point of mockery  time and the world stood still or were annihilated in that moment for the man who waited  high in the blue overhead a lark was pouring out its song but his lordship heard it not he heard nothing he was conscious of nothing but that gleaming sword and those gleaming eyes behind it  then a voicethe voice of his antagonistbroke the silence is more needed it asked and without waiting for a reply mr caryll lowered his blade and drew himself upright let this suffice he said to take your life would be to deprive you of the means of profiting by this lesson  it seemed to rotherby as if he were awaking from a trance the world resumed its way he breathed again and straightened himself too from the arrested attitude of his last lunge rage welled up from his black soul a crimson flood swept into his pallid cheeks his eyes rolled and blazed with the fury of the mad  mr caryll moved away in that quiet voice of his take up your sword he said to the vanquished over his shoulder  wharton and gascoigne moved towards him without words to express the amazement that still held rotherby glared an instant longer without moving then doing as mr caryll had bidden him he stooped to recover his blade a moment he held it looking after his departing adversary then with swift silent stealth he sprang to follow his fell intent was written on his face  falgate gaspeda helpless foolwhile mainwaring hurled himself forward to prevent the thing he saw impended too late even as he flung out his hands to grapple with his lordship rotherbys arm drove straight before him and sent his sword through the undefended back of mr caryll  all that mr caryll realized at first was that he had been struck a blow between the shoulder blades and then ere he could turn to inquire into the cause he was amazed to see some three inches of steel come through his shirt in front the next instant an exquisite burning searing pain went through and through him as the blade was being withdrawn he coughed and swayed then hurtled sideways into the arms of major gascoigne his senses swam the turf heaved and rolled as if an earthquake moved it the houses fronting the square and the trees immediately before him leaped and danced as if suddenly launched into grotesque animation while about him swirled a wild incoherent noise of voices rising and falling now loud now silent and reaching him through a murmuring hum that surged about his ears until it shut out all else and consciousness deserted him  around him meanwhile a wild scene was toward  his grace of wharton had wrenched away the sword from rotherby and mastered by an effort his own impulse to use it upon the murderer captain mainwaringrotherbys own second a man of quick fierce passionsutterly unable to control himself fell upon his lordship and beat him to the ground with his hands cursing him and heaping abuse upon him with every blow whilst delicate mr falgate in the background sick to the point of faintness stood dabbing his lips with his handkerchief and swearing that he would rot before he allowed himself again to be dragged into an affair of honor  ye damned cutthroat swore the militia captain standing over the man he had felled dye know whatll be the fruits of this yell swing at tyburn like the dirty thief y are god help me id give a hundred guineas sooner than be mixed in this filthy business  tis no matter for that now said the duke touching him on the shoulder and drawing him away from his lordship get up rotherby  heavily mechanically rotherby got to his feet now that the fit of rage was over he was himself all stricken at the thing he had done he looked at the limp figure on the turf huddled against the knee of major gascoigne looked at the white face the closed eyes and the stain of blood oozing farther and farther across the holland shirt and as white himself as the stricken man he shuddered and his mouth was drawn wide with horror  but pitiful though he looked he inspired no pity in the duke of wharton who considered him with an eye of unspeakable severity if mr caryll dies said he coldly i shall see to it that you hang my lord ill not rest until i bring you to the gallows  and then before more could be said there came a sound of running steps and labored breathing and his grace swore softly to himself as he beheld no other than lord ostermore advancing rapidly all out of breath and apoplectic of face a couple of footmen pressing close upon his heels and behind these a score of sightseers who had followed them  whats here cried the earl without glancing at his son is he dead is he dead  gascoigne who was busily endeavoring to stanch the bleeding answered without looking up it is in gods hands i think he is very like to die  ostermore swung round upon rotherby he had paled suddenly and his mouth trembled he raised his clenched hand and it seemed that he was about to strike his son then he let it fall again you villain he panted breathless from running and from rage i saw it i saw it all it was murder and as gods my life if mr caryll dies i shall see to it that you hangi your own father  thus assailed on every side some of the cowering shrinking manner left the viscount his antagonism to his father spurred him to a prouder carriage he shrugged indifferently so be it he said i have been told that already i dont greatly care  mainwaring who had been stooping over mr caryll and who had perhaps more knowledge of wounds than any present shook his head ominously  twould be dangerous to move him far said he twill increase the hemorrhage  my men shall carry him across to stretton house said lord ostermore lend a hand here you gaping oafs  the footmen advanced the crowd which was growing rapidly and was watching almost in silence awed pressed as close as it dared upon these gentlemen mainwaring procured a couple of cloaks and improvised a stretcher with them of this he took one corner himself gascoigne another and the footmen the remaining two thus as gently as might be they bore the wounded man from the enclosure through the crowd that had by now assembled in the street and over the threshold of stretton house  a groom had been dispatched for a doctor and his grace of wharton had compelled rotherby to accompany them into his fathers house sternly threatening to hand him over to a constable at once if he refused  within the cool hall of stretton house they were met by her ladyship and mistress winthrop both pale but the eyes of each wearing a vastly different expression  whats this demanded her ladyship as they trooped in why do you bring him here  because madam answered ostermore in a voice as hard as iron it imports to save his life for if he dies your son dies as surelyand on the scaffold  her ladyship staggered and flung a hand to her breast but her recovery was almost immediate twas a duel she began stoutly  twas murder his lordship corrected interruptingmurder as any of these gentlemen can and will bear witness rotherby ran mr caryll through the back after mr caryll had spared his life  tis a lie screamed her ladyship her lips ashen she turned to rotherby who stood there in shirt and breeches and shoeless as he had fought why dont you say that it is a lie she demanded  rotherby endeavored to master himself madam he said here is no place for you  but is it true is it true what is being said  he halfturned from her with a despairing movement and caught the sharp hiss of her indrawn breath then she swept past him to the side of the wounded man who had been laid on a settle what is his hurt she inquired wildly looking about her but no one spoke tragedymore far than the tragedy of that mans possible deathwas in the air and struck them all silent will no one answer me she insisted is it mortal is it  his grace of wharton turned to her with an unusual gravity in his blue eyes we hope not maam he said but it is as god wills  her limbs seemed to fail her and she sank down on her knees beside the settle we must save him she muttered fearfully we must save his life where is the doctor he wont die oh he must not die  they stood grouped about looking on in silence rotherby in the background behind him again on the topmost of the three steps that led up into the inner hall stood mistress winthrop white of face a wild horror in the eyes she riveted upon the wounded and unconscious man she realized that he was like to die there was an infinite pity in her souland maybe something more her impulse was to go to him her every instinct urged her but her reason held her back  then as she looked she saw with a feeling almost of terror that his eyes were suddenly wide open  whawhat came in feeble accents from his lips  there was a stir about him  never move justin said gascoigne who stood by his head you are hurt lie still the doctor has been summoned  ah it was a sigh the wounded man closed his eyes a moment then reopened them i remember i remember he said feebly it isit is grave he inquired it went right through me i remember he surveyed himself theres been a deal of blood lost i am like to die i take it  nay sir we hope notwe hope not it was the countess who spoke  a wry smile twisted his lips your ladyship is very good said he i had not thought you quite so much my wellwisher ii have done you a wrong madam he paused for breath and it was not plain whether he spoke in sincerity or in sarcasm then with a startling suddenness he broke into a soft laugh and to those risen who could not think what had occasioned it it sounded more dreadful than any plaint he could have uttered  he had bethought him that there was no longer the need for him to come to a decision in the matter that had brought him to england and his laugh was almost of relief the riddle he could never have solved for himself in a manner that had not shattered his future peace of mind was solved and well solved if this were death  wherewhere is rotherby he inquired presently  there was a stir and men drew back leaving an open lane to the place where rotherby stood mr caryll saw him and smiled and his smile held no tinge of mockery you are the best friend i ever had rotherby he startled all by saying let him approach he begged  rotherby came forward like one who walks in his sleep i am sorry he said thickly cursed sorry  theres scarce the need said mr caryll lift me up tom he begged gascoigne theres scarce the need you have cleared up something that was plaguing me my lord i am your debtor forfor that it disposes of something i could never have disposed of had i lived he turned to the duke of wharton it was an accident he said significantly you all saw that it was an accident  a denial rang out it was no accident cried lord ostermore and swore an oath we all saw what it was  ifaith then your eyes deceived you it was an accident i sayand who should know better than i he was smiling in that whimsical enigmatic way of his smiling still he sank back into gascoignes arms  you are talking too much said the major  what odds i am not like to talk much longer  the door opened to admit a gentleman in black wearing a grizzle wig and carrying a goldheaded cane men moved aside to allow him to approach mr caryll the latter not noticing him had met at last the gaze of hortensias eyes he continued to smile but his smile was now changed to wistfulness under that pitiful regard of hers  it is better so he was saying better so  his glance was upon her and she understood what none other there suspectedthat those words were for her alone  he closed his eyes and swooned again as the doctor stooped to remove the temporary bandages from his wound  hortensia a sob beating in her throat turned and fled to her own room     chapter xii sunshine and shadow  mr caryll was almost happy  he reclined on a long chair supported by pillows cunningly set for him by the deft hands of leduc and took his ease and indulged his daydreams in lord ostermores garden he sat within the cool fragrant shade of a privet arbor interlaced with flowering lilac and laburnum and he looked out upon the long sweep of emerald lawn and the little patch of ornamental water where the waterlilies gaped their ivory chalices to the morning sun  he looked thinner paler and more frail than was his habit which is not wonderful considering that he had been four weeks abed while his wound was mending he was dressed again by the hands of the incomparable leduc in a deshabille of some artistry a darkblue dressinggown of flowered satin fell open at the waist disclosing skyblue breeches and pearlcolored stockings elegant shoes of spanish leather with red heels and diamond buckles his chestnut hair had been dressed with as great care as though he were attending a levee and leduc had insisted upon placing a small round patch under his left eye that it mightsaid leducimpart vivacity to a countenance that looked overwan from his long confinement  he reclined there and as i have said was almost happy  the creature of sunshine that was himself at heart had broken through the heavy clouds that had been obscuring him an oppressive burden was lifted from his mind and conscience that swordthrust through the back a month ago had been guided he opined by the hand of a befriending providence for although he had as you see survived it it had none the less solved for him that hateful problem he could never have solved for himself that problem whose solutionno matter which alternative he had adoptedmust have brought him untold misery afterwards  as it was during the weeks that he had lain helpless his life attached to him by but the merest thread the chance of betraying lord ostermore was gone northe circumstances being such as they werecould sir richard everard blame him that he had let it pass  thus he knew peace knew it as only those know it who have sustained unrest and can appreciate relief from it  nature had made him a voluptuary and reclining there in an ease which the languor born of his long illness rendered the more delicious inhaling the tepid summer air that came to him laden with a most sweet attar from the flowering rosegarden he realized that with all its cares life may be sweet to live in youth and in the month of june  he sighed and smiled pensively at the waterlilies nor was his happiness entirely and solely the essence of his material ease this was his third morning out of doors and on each of the two mornings that were gone hortensia had borne him company coming with the charitable intent of lightening his tedium by reading to him but remaining to talk instead  the most perfect friendliness had prevailed between them a camaraderie which mr caryll had been careful not to dispel by any return to such speeches as those which had originally offended but which seemed now mercifully forgotten  he was awaiting her and his expectancy heightened for him the glory of the morning increased the meed of happiness that was his but there was more besides leduc who stood slightly behind him fussily busy about a little table on which were books and cordials flowers and comfits a pipe and a tobaccojar had just informed him for the first time that during the more dangerous period of his illness mistress winthrop had watched by his bedside for many hours together upon many occasions and onceon the day after he had been wounded and while his fever was at its heightleduc entering suddenly and quietly had surprised her in tears  all this was most sweet news to mr caryll he found that between himself and his halfbrother there lay an even deeper debt than he had at first supposed and already acknowledged in the delicious contemplation of hortensia in tears beside him stricken all but to the point of death he forgot entirely his erstwhile scruples that being nameless he had no name to offer her in imagination he conjured up the scene it made he found a very pretty picture he would smoke upon it  leduc if you were to fill me a pipe of spanish  monsieur has smoked one pipe already leduc reminded him  you are inconsequent leduc it is a sign of advancing age repress it the pipe and he flicked impatient fingers  monsieur is forgetting that the doctor  the devil take the doctor said mr caryll with finality  parfaitement answered the smooth leduc over the bridge we laugh at the saint now that we are cured the devil take the doctor by all means  a ripple of laughter came to applaud leducs excursion into irony the arbor had another narrower entrance on the left hortensia had approached this all unheard on the soft turf and stood there now a heavenly apparition in white flimsy garments head slightly atilt eyes mocking lips laughing a heavy curl of her dark hair falling caressingly into the hollow where white neck sprang from whiter shoulder  you make too rapid a recovery sir said she  it comes of learning how well i have been nursed he answered making shift to rise and he laughed inwardly to see the red flush of confusion spread over the milkwhite skin the reproachful shaft her eyes let loose upon leduc  she came forward swiftly to check his rising but he was already on his feet proud of his return to strength vain to display it nay she reproved him if you are so headstrong i shall leave you  if you do maam i vow here as i am i hope a gentleman that i shall go home today and on foot  you would kill yourself she told him  i might kill myself for less and yet be justified  she looked her despair of him what must i do to make you reasonable  set me the example by being reasonable yourself and let there be no more of this wild talk of leaving me the very moment you are come leduc a chair for mistress winthrop he commanded as though chairs abounded in a garden nook but leduc the diplomat had effaced himself  she laughed at his grand air and herself drew forward the stool that had been leducs and sat down satisfied mr caryll made her a bow and seated himself sideways on his long chair so that he faced her she begged that he would dispose himself more comfortably but he scorned the very notion  unaided i walked here from the house he informed her with a boastful air i had need to begin to feel my feet again you are pampering me here and to pamper an invalid is bad it keeps him an invalid now i am an invalid no longer  but the doctor she began  the doctor maam is disposed of already he assured her very definitely disposed of ask leduc he will tell you  not a doubt of that she answered leduc talks too much  you have a spite against him for the information he gave me on the score of how and by whom i was nursed so have i because he did not tell me before and because when he told me he would not tell me enough he has no eyes this leduc he is a dolt who only sees the half of what happens and only remembers the half of what he has seen  i am sure of it said she  he looked surprised an instant then he laughed i am glad that we agree  but you have yet to learn the cause had this leduc used his eyes or his ears to better purpose he had been able to tell you something of the extent to which i am in your debt  ah said he mystified then the news will be none the less welcome from your lips maam said he is it that you are interested in the ravings of delirium and welcomed the opportunity of observing them at first hand i hope i raved engagingly if so be that i did rave would it perchance be of a lady that i talked in my fevered wanderingsof a lady pale as a lenten rose with soft brown eyes and lips that  your guesses are all wild she checked him my debt is of a more real kind it concerns mymy reputation  fan me ye winds he ejaculated  those fine ladies and gentlemen of the town had made my name a byword she explained in a low tense voice her eyelids lowered my foolishness in running off with my lord rotherbythat i might at all cost escape the tyranny of my lady ostermore mr carylls eyelids flickered suddenly at that explanationhad made me a butt and a jest and an object for slander you remember yourself sir the sneers and oglings the starings and simperings in the park that day when you made your first attempt to champion my cause inducing the lady mary deller to come and speak to me  nay naythink of these things no more gnats will sting tis in their nature i admit tis very vexing at the time but it soon wears off if the flesh they have stung be healthy so think no more ont  but you do not know what follows her ladyship insisted that i should drive with her a week after your hurt when the doctor first proclaimed you out of danger and while the town was still all agog with the affair no doubt her ladyship thought to put a fresh and greater humiliation upon me you would not be present to blunt the edge of the insult of those creatures glances she carried me to vauxhall where a fuller scope might be given to the pursuit of my shame and mortification instead what think you happened  her ladyship i trust was disappointed  the word is too poor to describe her condition she broke a fan beat her black boy and dismissed a footman that she might vent some of the spleen it moved in her never was such respect never such homage shown to any woman as was shown to me that evening we were all but mobbed by the very people who had earlier slighted me  twas all so mysterious that i must seek the explanation of it and i had it at length from his grace of wharton who was at my side for most of the time we walked in the gardens i asked him frankly to what was this change owing and he told me sir  she looked at him as though no more need be said but his brows were knit he told you maam he questioned he told you what  what you had done at whites how to all present and to my lord rotherbys own face you had related the true story of what befell at maidstonehow i had gone thither an innocent foolish maid to be married to a villain whom like the silly child i was i thought i loved how that villain taking advantage of my innocence and ignorance intended to hoodwink me with a mockmarriage  that was the story that was on every lip it had gone round the town like fire and it says much for the town that what between that and the foul business of the duel my lord rotherby was receiving on every hand the condemnation he deserves while for me there was once moreand with heavy interest for the lapse from itthe respect which my indiscretion had forfeited and which would have continued to be denied me but for your noble championing of my cause  that sir is the extent to which i am in your debt do you think it small it is so great that i have no words in which to attempt to express my thanks  mr caryll looked at her a moment with eyes that were very bright then he broke into a soft laugh that had a note of slyness  in my time said he i have seen many attempts to change an inconvenient topic some have been artful others artless others utterly clumsy but this i think is the clumsiest of them all mistress winthrop tis not worthy in you  she looked puzzled intrigued by his mood  mistress winthrop he resumed with an entire change of voice to speak of this trifle is but a subterfuge of yours to prevent me from expressing my deep gratitude for your care of me  indeed no she began  indeed yes said he how can this compare with what you have done for me for i have learnt how greatly it is to you yourself that i owe my recoverythe saving of my life  ah but that is not true it  let me think so whether it be true or not he implored her eyes between tenderness and whimsicality intent upon her face let me believe it for the belief has brought me happinessthe greatest happiness i think that i have ever known i can know but one greater and that  he broke off suddenly and she observed that the hand he had stretched out trembled a moment ere it was abruptly lowered again it was as a man who had reached forth to grasp something that he craves and checked his desire upon a sudden thought  she felt oddly stirred despite herself and oddly constrained it may have been to disguise this that she half turned to the table saying you were about to smoke when i came and she took up his pipe and tobaccojar to offer them  ah but since youve come i would not dream he said  she looked at him the complete change of topic permitted it if i desired you so to do she inquired and added i love the fragrance of it  he raised his brows fragrance quoth he my lady ostermore has another word for it he took the pipe and jar from her tis no humoring this of a man you imagine sickno silly chivalry of yours he questioned doubtfully did i think that id never smoke another pipe again  she shook her head and laughed at his solemnity i love the fragrance she repeated  ah why then ill pleasure you said he with the air of one conferring favors and filled his pipe presently he spoke again in a musing tone in a week or so i shall be well enough to travel  tis your intent to travel she inquired  he set down the jar and reached for the tinderbox it is time i was returning home he explained  ah yes your home is in france  at maligny the sweetest nook in normandy twas my mothers birthplace and twas there she died  you have felt the loss of her i make no doubt  that might have been the case if i had known her answered he but as it is i never did i was but two years oldshe herself but twentywhen she died  he pulled at his pipe in silence a moment or two his face overcast and thoughtful a shallower woman would have broken in with expressions of regret hortensia offered him the nobler sympathy of silence moreover she had felt from his tone that there was more to come that what he had said was but the preface to some story that he desired her to be acquainted with and presently as she expected he continued  she died mistress winthrop of a broken heart my father had abandoned her two years and more before she died in those years of repiningay and worse of actual wanther health was broken so that poor soul she died  o pitiful cried hortensia pain in her face  pitiful indeedthe more pitiful that her death was a source of some slight happiness to those who loved her the only happiness they could have in her was to know that she was at rest  andand your father  i am coming to him my mother had a frienda very noble loftyminded gentleman who had loved her with a great and honest love before the profligate who was my father came forward as a suitor recognizing in the latteras he thought in his honest hearta man in better case to make her happy this gentleman i speak of went his ways he came upon her afterwards broken and abandoned and he gathered up the poor shards of her shattered life and sought with tender but unavailing hands to piece them together again and when she died he vowed to stand my friend and to make up to me for the want i had of parents tis by his bounty that today i am lord of maligny that was for generations the property of my mothers people tis by his bounty and loving care that i am what i am and not what so easily i might have become had the seed sown by my father been allowed to put out shoots  he paused as if bethinking himself and looked at her with a wistful inquiring smile but why plague you he cried with this poor tale of yesterday that will be forgot tomorrow  nayah nay she begged and put out a hand in impulsive sympathy to touch his own so transparent now in its emaciation tell me tell me  his smile softened he sighed gently and continued this gentleman who adopted me lived for one single purpose with one single aim in viewto avenge my mother whom he had loved upon the man whom she had loved and who had so ill repaid her he reared me for that purpose as much i think as out of any other feeling thirty years have sped and still the hand of the avenger has not fallen upon my father it should have fallen a month ago but i was weak i hesitated and then this swordthrust put me out of all case of doing what i had crossed from france to do  she looked at him with something of horror in her face were youwere you to have been the instrument she inquired were you to have avenged this thing upon your own father  he nodded slowly twas to that end that i was reared he answered and put aside his pipe which had gone out the spirit of revenge was educated into me until i came to look upon revenge as the best and holiest of emotions until i believed that if i failed to wreak it i must be a craven and a dastard all this seemed so until the moment came to set my hand to the task and then he shrugged  and then she questioned  i couldnt the full horror of it burst upon me i saw the thing in its true and hideous proportions and it revolted me  it must have been so she approved him  i told my fosterfather but i met with neither sympathy nor understanding he renewed his oldtime arguments and again he seemed to prove to me that did i fail i should be false to my duty and to my mothers memorya weakling a thing of shame  the monster oh the monster he is an evil man for all that you have said of him  not so there is no nobler gentleman in all the world i who know him know that it is through the very nobility of it that this warp has come into his nature sane in all things else he isi see it now i understand it at lastinsane on this one subject much brooding has made him mad upon this mattera fanatic whose gospel is vengeance and like all fanatics he is harsh and intolerant when resisted on the point of his fanaticism this is something i have come to realize in these past days when i lay with naught else to do but ponder  in all things else he sees as deep and clear as any man in this his vision is distorted he has looked at nothing else for thirty years can you wonder that his sight is blurred  he is to be pitied then she said deeply to be pitied  true and because i pitied him because i valued his regardhowever mistaken he might beabove all else i was hesitating againthis time between my duty to myself and my duty to him i was so hesitatingthough i scarce can doubt which had prevailed in the endwhen came this swordthrust so very opportunely to put me out of case of doing one thing or the other  but now that you are well again she asked  now that i am well againi thank heaven that it will be too late the opportunity that was ours is lost hismy father should now be beyond our power  there ensued a spell of silence he sat with eyes averted from her facethose eyes which she had never known other than whimsical and mocking now full of gloom and painriveted upon the glare of sunshine on the pond out yonder a great sympathy welled up from her heart for this man whom she was still far from understanding and who neverthelessbecause of it perhaps for there is much fascination in that which puzzleswas already growing very dear to her the story he had told her drew her infinitely closer to him softening her heart for him even more perhaps than it had already been softened when she had seen himas she had thoughtupon the point of dying a wonder flitted through her mind as to why he had told her then another question surged she gave it tongue  you have told me so much mr caryll she said that i am emboldened to ask something more his eyes invited her to put her question youryour father was he related to lord ostermore  not a muscle of his face moved why that he asked  because your name is caryll said she  my name he laughed softly and bitterly my name he reached for an ebony cane that stood beside his chair i had thought you understood he heaved himself to his feet and she forgot to caution him against exertion i have no right to any name he told her my father was a man too full of worldly affairs to think of trifles and so it befell that before he went his ways he forgot to marry the poor lady who was my mother i might take what name i chose i chose caryll but you will understand mistress winthrop and he looked her fully in the face attempting in vain to dissemble the agony in his eyeshe who a little while ago had been almost happythat if ever it should happen that i should come to love a woman who is worthy of being loved i who am nameless have no name to offer her  revelation illumined her mind as in a flash she looked at him  waswas that what you meant that day we thought you dying when you said to mefor it was to me you spoke to me alonethat it was better so  he inclined his head that is what i meant he answered  her lids drooped her cheeks were very white and he remarked the swift agitated surge of her bosom the fingers that were plucking at one another in her lap without looking up she spoke again if you had the love to offer what would the rest matter what is a name that it should weigh so much  heyday he sighed and smiled very wistfully you are young child in time you will understand what place the world assigns to such men as i it is a place i could ask no woman to share such as i am could i speak of love to any woman  yet you spoke of love once to me she reminded him scarcely above her breath and stabbed him with the recollection  in an hour of moonshine an hour of madness when i was a reckless fool that must give tongue to every impulse you reproved me then in just the terms my case deserved hortensia he bent towards her leaning on his cane tis very sweet and merciful in you to recall it without reproach recall it no more save to think with scorn of the fleering coxcomb who was so lost to the respect that is due to so sweet a lady i have told you so much of myself today that you may  decidedly came a shrill ironical voice from the arbors entrance i may congratulate you sir upon the prodigious strides of your recovery  mr caryll straightened himself from his stooping posture turned and made lady ostermore a bow his whole manner changed again to that which was habitual to him and no less decidedly my lady said he with a tightlipped smile may i congratulate your ladyships son upon that happy circumstance which isas i have learnedso greatly due to the steps your ladyship tookfor which i shall be ever gratefulto ensure that i should be made whole again     chapter xiii the forlorn hope   her ladyship stood a moment leaning upon her cane her head thrown back her thin lip curling and her eyes playing over mr caryll with a look of dislike that she made no attempt to dissemble  mr caryll found the situation redolent with comedy he had a quick eye for such matters so quick an eye that he deplored on the present occasion her ladyships entire lack of a sense of humor but for that lamentable shortcoming she might have enjoyed with him the grotesqueness of her havingshe who disliked him so exceedinglytoiled and anguished robbed herself of sleep and hoped and prayed with more fervor perhaps than she had ever yet hoped and prayed for anything that his life might be spared  her glance shifted presently from him to hortensia who had risen and who stood in deep confusion at having been so found by her ladyship and in deep agitation still arising from the things he had said and from those which he had been hindered from adding by the coming of the countess  the explanations that had been interrupted might never be renewed she felt they never would be he would account that he had said enough since he was determined to ask for nothing and unless the matter were broached again what chance had she of combatting his foolish scruples for foolish she accounted them they were of no weight with her unless indeed to heighten the warm feeling that already she had conceived for him  her ladyship moved forward a step or two her fan going gently to and fro stirring the barbs of the white plume that formed part of her tall headdress  what were you doing here child she inquired very coldly  mistress winthrop looked upa sudden almost scared glance it was  i madam whyi was walking in the garden and seeing mr caryll here i came to ask him how he did to offer to read to him if he would have me  and the maidstone matter not yet cold in its grave commented her ladyship sourly as im a woman it is monstrous i should be inflicted with the care of you that have no care for yourself  hortensia bit her lip controlling herself bravely a spot of red in either cheek mr caryll came promptly to her rescue  your ladyship must confess that mistress winthrop has assisted nobly in the care of me and so has placed your ladyship in her debt  in my debt shrilled the countess eyebrows aloft headdress nodding and what of yours  in my clumsy way maam i have already attempted to convey my thanks to her it might be graceful in your ladyship to follow my example  mentally mr caryll observed that it is unwise to rouge so heavily as did lady ostermore when prone to anger and to paling under it the false color looks so very false on such occasions  her ladyship struck the ground with her cane for what have i to thank her sir will you tell me that you who seem so very well informed  why for her part in saving your sons life maam if you must have it heaven knows he continued in his characteristic halfbantering manner under which it was so difficult to catch a glimpse of his real feelings i am not one to throw services done in the face of folk but here have mistress winthrop and i been doing our best for your son in this matter she by so diligently nursing me i by responding to her nursingand your ladyshipsand so recovering from my wound i do not think that your ladyship shows us a becoming gratitude it is but natural that we fellowworkers in your ladyships and lord rotherbys interests should have a word to say to each other on the score of those labors which have made us colleagues  her ladyship measured him with a malignant eye are you quite mad sir she asked him  he shrugged and smiled it has been alleged against me on occasion but i think it was pure spite then he waved his hand towards the long seat that stood at the back of the arbor will your ladyship not sit you will forgive that i urge it in my own interest they tell me that it is not good for me to stand too long just yet  it was his hope that she would depart not so i cry you mercy said she acidly and rustled to the bench be seated pray she continued to watch them with her baleful glance we have heard fine things from you sir of what you have both done for my lord rotherby she gibed mocking him with the spirit of his halfjest shall i tell you more precisely what tis he owes you  can there be more quoth mr caryll smiling so amiably that he must have disarmed a gorgon  her ladyship ignored him he owes it to you both that you have estranged him from his father set up a breach between them that is never like to be healed tis what he owes you  does he not owe it rather to his abandoned ways asked hortensia in a calm clear voice bravely giving back her ladyship look for look  abandoned ways screamed the countess ist you that speak of abandoned ways ye shameless baggage faith ye may be some judge of them ye fooled him into running off with you twas that began all this just as with your airs and simpers and prettilyplayed innocences you fooled this other here into being your champion  madam you insult me hortensia was on her feet eyes flashing cheeks aflame  i am witness to that said lord ostermore coming in through the sideentrance  mr caryll was the only one who had seen him approach the earls face that had wont to be so florid was now pale and careworn and he seemed to have lost flesh during the past month he turned to her ladyship  out on you he said testily to chide the poor child so  poor child sneered her ladyship eyes raised to heaven to invoke its testimony to this absurdity poor child  let there be an end to it madam he said with attempted sternness it is unjust and unreasonable in you  if it were thatwhich it is notit would be but following the example that you set me what are you but unreasonable and unjustto treat your son as you are treating him  his lordship crimsoned on the subject of his son he could be angry in earnest even with her ladyship as already we have seen  i have no son he declared there is a lewd drunken bullying profligate who bears my name and who will be lord ostermore some day i cant strip him of that but ill strip him of all else thats mine god helping me i beg my lady that youll let me hear no more of this i beg it lord rotherby leaves my house todaynow that mr caryll is restored to health indeed he has stayed longer than was necessary he leaves today he has my orders and my servants have orders to see that he obeys them i do not wish to see him againnever let him go and let him be thankfuland be your ladyship thankful too since it seems you must have a kindness for him in spite of all he has done to disgrace and discredit usthat he goes not by way of holborn hill and tyburn  she looked at him very white from suppressed fury i do believe you had been glad had it been so  nay he answered i had been sorry for mr carylls sake  and for his own  pshaw  are you a father she wondered contemptuously  to my eternal shame maam he flung back at her he seemed indeed a changed man in more than body since mr carylls duel with lord rotherby no more maamno more he cried seeming suddenly to remember the presence of mr caryll who sat languidly drawing figures on the ground with the ferrule of his cane he turned to ask the convalescent how he did her ladyship rose to withdraw and at that moment leduc made his appearance with a salver on which was a bowl of soup a flask of hock and a letter setting this down in such a manner that the letter was immediately under his masters eyes he further proceeded to draw mr carylls attention to it it was addressed in sir richard everards hand mr caryll took it and slipped it into his pocket her ladyships eyebrows went up  will you not read your letter mr caryll she invited him with an amazingly sudden change to amiability  it will keep maam to while away an hour that is less pleasantly engaged and he took the napkin leduc was proffering  you pay your correspondent a poor compliment said she  my correspondent is not one to look for them or need them he answered lightly and dipped his spoon in the broth  is she not quoth her ladyship  mr caryll laughed so feminine said he ha ha so very feminineto assume the sex so readily  tis an easy assumption when the superscription is writ in a womans hand  mr caryll the picture of amiability smiled between spoonfuls your ladyships eyes preserve not only their beauty but a keenness beyond belief  how could you have seen it from that distance sylvia inquired his practical lordship  then again said her ladyship ignoring both remarks there is the assiduity of this fair writer since mr caryll has been in case to receive letters five billets in six days deny it if you can mr caryll  her playfulness so illassumed sat more awkwardly upon her than her usual and more overt malice towards him  to what end should i deny it he replied and added in his most ingratiating manner another of his twoedged compliments your ladyship is the model chatelaine no happening in your household can escape your knowledge his lordship is greatly to be envied  yet you see she cried appealing to her husband and even to hortensia who sat apart scarce heeding this trivial matter of which so much was being made you see that he evades the point avoids a direct answer to the question that is raised  since your ladyship perceives it it were more merciful to spare my invention the labor of fashioning further subterfuges i am a sick man still and my wits are far from brisk he took up the glass of wine leduc had poured for him  the countess looked at him again through narrowing eyelids the playfulness all vanished you do yourself injustice sir as i am a woman your wits want nothing more in briskness she rose and looked down upon him engrossed in his broth for a dissembler sir she pronounced upon him acidly i think it would be difficult to meet your match  he dropped his spoon into the bowl with a clatter he looked up the very picture of amazement and consternation  a dissembler i quoth he in earnest protest then laughed and quoted adapting         tis not my talent to conceal my thoughts         or carry smiles and sunshine in my face         should discontent sit heavy at my heart  she looked him over pursing her lips ive often thought you might have been a player said she contemptuously  ifaith he laughed id sooner play than toil  ay but you make a toil of play sir  compassionate me maam he implored in the best of humors i am but a sick man your ladyships too keen for me  she moved across to the exit without answering him come child she said to hortensia we are tiring mr caryll i fear let us leave him to his letter ere it sets his pocket afire  hortensia rose loath though she might be to depart there was no reason she could urge for lingering  is not your lordship coming said she  of course he is her ladyship commanded i need to speak with you yet concerning rotherby she informed him  hem his lordship coughed plainly he was not at his ease i will follow soon do not stay for me i have a word to say to mr caryll  will it not keep what can you have to say to him that is so pressing  but a wordno more  why then well stay for you said her ladyship and threw him into confusion hopeless dissembler that he was  nay nay i beg that you will not  her ladyships brows went up her eyes narrowed again and a frown came between them you are mighty mysterious said she looking from one to the other of the men and bethinking her that it was not the first time she had found them so bethinking her toojumping womanlike to rash conclusionsthat in this mystery that linked them might lie the true secret of her husbands aversion to his son and of his oath a month ago to see that same son hang if mr caryll succumbed to the wound he had taken with some women to suspect a thing is to believe that thing her ladyship was of these she set too high value upon her acumen upon the keenness of her instincts  and if aught were needed to cement her present suspicions mr caryll himself afforded that cement by seeming to betray the same eagerness to be alone with his lordship that his lordship was betraying to be alone with him though in truth he no more than desired to lend assistance to the earl out of curiosity to learn what it was his lordship might have to say  indeed said he if you could give his lordship leave maam for a few moments i should myself be glad ont  come hortensia said her ladyship shortly and swept out mistress winthrop following  in silence they crossed the lawn together once only ere they reached the house her ladyship looked back i would i knew what they are plotting she said through her teeth  plotting echoed hortensia  ayplotting simpleton i said plotting i mind me tis not the first time i have seen them so mysterious together it began on the day that first mr caryll set foot at stretton house theres a deal of mystery about that mantoo much for honesty and then these letters touching which he is so closeone a dayand his french lackey always at hand to pounce upon them the moment they arrive i wonder whats at bottom ont i wonder and id give these ears to know she snapped in conclusion as they went indoors  in the arbor meanwhile his lordship had taken the rustic seat her ladyship had vacated he sat down heavily like a man who is weary in body and in mind like a man who is bearing a load too heavy for his shoulders mr caryll watching him observed all this  a glass of hock he suggested waving his hand towards the flask let me play host to you out of the contents of your own cellar  his lordships eye brightened at the suggestion which confirmed the impression mr caryll had formed that all was far from well with his lordship leduc brimmed a glass and handed it to my lord who emptied it at a draught mr caryll waved an impatient hand away with you leduc go watch the goldfish in the pond ill call you if i need you  after leduc had departed a silence fell between them and endured some moments his lordship was leaning forward elbows on knees his face in shadow at length he sat back and looked at his companion across the little intervening space  i have hesitated to speak to you before mr caryll upon the matter that you know of lest your recovery should not be so far advanced that you might bear the strain and fatigue of conversing upon serious topics i trust that that cause is now so far removed that i may put aside my scruples  assuredlyi am glad to saythanks to the great care you have had of me here at stretton house  there is no debt between us on that score answered his lordship shortly brusquely almost well then he checked and looked about him we might be approached without hearing any one he said  mr caryll smiled and shook his head i am not wont to neglect such details he observed the eyes of argus were not so vigilant as my leducs and he understands that we are private he will give us warning should any attempt to approach be assured of that and believe therefore that we are more snug here than we should be even in your lordships closet  that being so sirhem you are receiving letters daily do they concern the business of king james  in a measure or rather they are from one concerned in it  ostermores eyes were on the ground again there fell a pause mr caryll frowning slightly and full of curiosity as to what might be coming  how soon think you asked his lordship presently you will be in case to travel  in a week i hope was the reply  good the earl nodded thoughtfully that may be in time i pray it may be tis now the best that we can do youll bear a letter for me to the king  mr caryll passed a hand across his chin his face very grave your answer to the letter that i brought you  my answer my acceptance of his majestys proposals  ha mr caryll seemed to be breathing hard  your letters sirthe letters that you have been receiving will have told you perhaps something of how his majestys affairs are speeding here  very little and from that little i fear that they speed none too well i would counsel your lordship he continued slowlyhe was thinking as he wentto wait a while before you burn your boats from what i gather matters are in the air just now  the earl made a gesture brusque and impatient your information is very scant then said he  mr caryll looked askance at him  pho sir while you have been abed i have been up and doing up and doing matters are being pushed forward rapidly i have seen atterbury he knows my mind there lately came an agent from the king it seems to enjoin the bishop to abandon this conspiracy telling him that the time was not yet ripe atterbury scorns to act upon that order he will work in the kings interests against the kings own commands even  then tis possible he may work to his own undoing said mr caryll to whom this was after all no news  nay nay you have been sick you do not know how things have sped in this past month atterbury holds and he is right i dare swearhe holds that never will there be such another opportunity the finances of the country are still in chaos in spite of all walpoles efforts and fine promises the south sea bubble has sapped the confidence in the government of all men of weight the very whigs themselves are shaken tis to king james england begins to look for salvation from this topsyturveydom the tide runs strongly in our favor strongly sir if we stay for the ebb we may stay for good for there may never be another flow within our lifetime  your lordship is grown strangely hot upon this question said caryll very full of wonder  as he understood ostermore the earl was scarcely the sentimentalist to give way to such a passion of loyalty for a weaker side yet his lordship had spoken not with the cold calm of the practical man who seeks advantage but with all the fervor of the enthusiast  such is my interest answered his lordship even as the fortunes of the country are beggared by the south sea company so are my own even as the country must look to king james for its salvation so must i at best tis but a forlorn hope i confess yet tis the only hope i see  mr caryll looked at him smiled to himself and nodded so all this fire and enthusiasm was about the mending of his personal fortunesthe grubbing of riches for himself well well it was good matter wasted on a paltry cause but it sorted excellently with what mr caryll knew of the nature of this father of his it never could transcend the practical there was no imagination to carry it beyond those narrow sordid confines and mr caryll had been a fool to have supposed that any other springs were pushing here egotism egotism egotism its name he thought was surely ostermore and again as once before under the like circumstances he found more pity than scorn awaking in his heart the whole wasted sterile life that lay behind this man the unhappy loveless home that stood about him now in his declining years were the fruits he had garnered from that consuming love of self with which the gods had cursed him  the only ray to illumine the black desert of ostermores existence was the affection of his ward hortensia winthrop because in that one instance he had sunk his egotism a little sparing a crumb of pityfor once in his lifefor the childs orphanhood had ostermore been other than the man he was his existence must have proved a burden beyond his strength it was so barren of good deeds so sterile of affection yet encrusted as he was in that egotism of hislike the limpet in its shellmy lord perceived nothing of this suffered nothing of it understanding nothing he was allsufficient to himself giving nothing he looked for nothing and sought his happinesswithout knowing the quest vainin what he had the fear of losing this had now in his declining years cast at length a shadow upon his existence  mr caryll looked at him almost sorrowfully then he put by his thoughts and broke the silence all this i had understood when first i sought you out said he yet your lordship did not seem to realize it quite so keenly is it that atterbury and his friends  no no ostermore broke in lookee i will be frankquite frank and open with you mr caryll things were bad when first you came to me yet not so bad that i was driven to a choice of evils i had lost heavily but enough remained to bear me through my time though rotherby might have found little enough left after i had gone while that was so i hesitated to take a risk i am an old man it had been different had i been young with ambitions that craved satisfying i am an old man and i desired peace and my comforts deeming these assured i paused ere i risked their loss against the stake which in king jamess name you set upon the board but it happens today that these are assured no longer he ended his voice breaking almost his eyes haggard they are assured no longer  you mean inquired caryll  i mean that i am confronted by the danger of beggary ruin shame and the sponginghouse at best  mr caryll was stirred out of his calm my lord he cried how is this possible what can have come to pass  the earl was silent for a long while it was as if he pondered how he should answer or whether he should answer at all at last in a low voice a faint tinge reddening his face his eyes averted he explained it shamed him so to do yet must he satisfy that craving of weak minds to unburden to seek relief in confession mine is the case of craggs the secretary of state he said and craggs youll remember shot himself  my god said mr caryll and opened wide his eyes did you he paused not knowing what euphemism to supply for the thing his lordship must have done  his lordship looked up sneering almost in selfderision i did he answered to tell you alli accepted twenty thousand pounds worth of south sea stock when the company was first formed for which i did not pay other than by lending the scheme the support of my name at a time when such support was needed i was of the ministry then you will remember  mr caryll considered him again and wondered a moment at the confession till he understood by intuition that the matter and its consequences were so deeply preying upon the mans mind that he could not refrain from giving vent to his fears  and now you know his lordship added why my hopes are all in king james ruin stares me in the face ruin and shame this forlorn stuart hope is the only hope remaining me therefore am i eager to embrace it i have made all plain to you you should understand now  yet not quite all you did this thing but the inspection of the companys books is past the danger of discovery at least is averted or is it that your conscience compels you to make restitution  his lordship stared and gaped do you suppose me mad he inquired quite seriously pho others were overlooked at the time we did not all go the way of craggs and aislabie and their fellowsufferers stanhope was assailed afterward though he was innocent that filthy fellow the duke of wharton from being an empty fop turned himself on a sudden into a crown attorney to prosecute the peculators it was an easy road to fame for him and the fool had a gift of eloquence stanhopes death is on his conscienceor would be if he had one that was six months ago when he discovered his error in the case of stanhope and saw the fatal consequences it had he ceased his dirty lawyers work but he had good grounds upon which to suspect others as highly placed as stanhope and had he followed his suspicions he might have turned them into certainties and discovered evidence as it was he let the matter lie content with the execution he had done and the esteem into which he had so suddenly hoisted himselfthe damned profligate  mr caryll let pass as typical the ludicrous want of logic in ostermores strictures of his grace of wharton and the application by him to the duke of opprobrious terms that were no whit less applicable to himself  then that being so what cause for these alarms some six months later  because answered his lordship in a sudden burst of passion that brought him to his feet empurpled his face and swelled the veins of his forehead because i am cursed with the filthiest fellow in england for my son  he said it with the air of one who throws a flood of light where darkness has been hitherto who supplies the key that must resolve at a turn a whole situation but mr caryll blinked foolishly  my wits are very dull i fear said he i still cannot understand  then ill make it all clear to you said his lordship  leduc appeared at the arbor entrance  what now asked mr caryll  her ladyship is approaching sir answered leduc the vigilant     chapter xiv lady ostermore   lord ostermore and mr caryll looked across the lawn towards the house but failed to see any sign of her ladyships approach  mr caryll raised questioning eyes to his servants stolid face and in that moment caught the faintest rustle of a gown behind the arbor he halfturned to my lord and nodded slightly in the direction of the sound a smile twisting his lips with a gesture he dismissed leduc who returned to the neighborhood of the pond  his lordship frowned angered by the interruption then if your ladyship will come inside said he you will hear better and with greater comfort  not to speak of dignity said mr caryll  the stiff gown rustled again this time without stealth the countess appeared no whit abashed mr caryll rose politely  you sit with spies to guard your approaches said she  as a precaution against spies was his lordships curt answer  she measured him with a cool eye what ist ye hide she asked him  my shame he answered readily then after a moments pause he rose and offered her his seat since you have thrust yourself in where you were not bidden you may hear and welcome maam said he it may help you to understand what you term my injustice to my son  are these matters wherewith to importune a strangera guest  i am proposing to say in your presence what i was about to say in your absence said he without answering her question be seated maam  she sniffed closed her fan with a clatter and sat down mr caryll resumed his long chair and his lordship took the stool  i am told the latter resumed presently recapitulating in part for her ladyships better understanding that his grace of wharton is intending to reopen the south sea scandal as soon as he can find evidence that i was one of those who profited by the companys charter  profited she echoed between scorn and bitter amusement profited did ye say i think your dotage is surely upon youyou that have sunk nigh all your fortune and all that you had with me in this thieving venturedye talk of profits  at the commencement i did profit as did many others had i been content with my gains had i been less of a trusting fool it had been well i was dazzled maybe by the glare of so much gold i needed more and so i lost all that is evil enough but there is worse i may be called upon to make restitution of what i had from the company without paying for iti may give all thats left me and barely cover the amount and i may starve and be damned thereafter  her ladyships face was ghastly horror stared from her pale eyes she had known from the beginning of that twenty thousand pounds worth of stock and she had hadwith his lordshipher anxious moments when the disclosures were being made six months ago that had brought the craggses aislabie and a halfdozen others to shame and ruin  his lordship looked at her a moment and if this shipwreck comes as it now threatens he continued it is my son i shall have to thank fort  she found voice to ask how so courage to put the question scornfully is it not rather rotherby you have to thank that the disclosures did not come six months ago what was it saved you but the friendship his grace of wharton had for charles  why then stormed his lordship did he not see tot that he preserved that friendship it but needed a behavior of as much decency and honor as wharton exacts in his associatesand the lord knows how much that is he sneered as it is he has gone even lower than that abandoned scourer so low that even this rakehell duke must become his enemy for his own credits sake he attempts mockmarriages with ladies of quality and he attempts murder by stabbing through the back a gentleman who has spared his worthless life not even the president of the hell fire club can countenance these things strong stomach though he have for villainy it is something to have contrived to come so low that even his grace of wharton must turn upon him and swear his ruin and so that he may ruin him his grace is determined to ruin me now you understand madamand you mr caryll  mr caryll understood he understood even more than his lordship meant him to understand more than his lordship understood himself so too did her ladyship if we may judge from the reply she made him  you fool she railed you vain blind selfish fool to blame rotherby for this rather should rotherby blame you that by your damned dishonesty have set a weapon against him in his enemys hands  madam he roared empurpling and coming heavily to his feet do you know who i am  ayand what you are which is something you will never know god was there ever so selfcentered a fool compassionate me heaven she rose too and turned to mr caryll you sir she said to him you have been dragged into this i know not why  she broke off suddenly looking at him her eyes a pair of gimlets now for penetration why have you been dragged into it she demanded what is here i demand to know what help does my lord expect from you that he tells you this does he she paused an instant a cunning smile breaking over her wrinkled painted face does he propose to sell himself to the king over the water and are you a secret agent come to do the buying is that the answer to this riddle  mr caryll imperturbable outwardly but very ill at ease within smiled and waved the delicate hand that appeared through the heavy ruffle at his wrist madam indeedahyour ladyship goes very fast you leap so at conclusions for which no grounds can exist his lordship is so overwroughtas well he may be alasthat he cares not before whom he speaks is it not plainly so  she smiled very sourly you are a very master of evasion sir but your evasion gives me the answer that i lackthat and his lordships face i drew my bow at a venture yet look sir and tell me has my quarrel missed its mark  and indeed the sudden fear and consternation written on my lords face was so plain that all might read it he wasas mr caryll had remarked on the first occasion that they metthe worst dissembler that ever set hand to a conspiracy he betrayed himself at every step if not positively by incautious words why then by the utter lack of control he had upon his countenance  he made now a wild attempt to bluster lies lies he protested your ladyships adreaming should i be making bad worse by plotting at my time of life should i what can king james avail me indeed  tis what i will ask rotherby to help me to discover she informed him  rotherby he cried would you tell that villain what you suspect would you arm him with another weapon for my undoing  ha said she you admit so much then and she laughed disdainfully then with a sudden sternness a sudden nobility almost in the motherhood which she put forwardrotherby is my son she said and ill not have my son the victim of your follies as well as of your injustice we may curb the one and the other yet my lord  and she swept out fan going briskly in one hand her long ebony cane swinging as briskly in the other  o god groaned ostermore and sat down heavily  mr caryll helped himself copiously to snuff i think said he his voice so cool that it had an almost soothing influence i think your lordship has now another reason why you should go no further in this matter  but if i do notwhat other hopes have i damn me im a ruined man either way  nay nay mr caryll reminded him assuming even that you are correctly informed and that his grace of wharton is determined to move against you it is not to be depended that he will succeed in collecting such evidence as he must need at this date much of the evidence that may once have been available will have been dissipated you are rash to despair so soon  there is that his lordship admitted thoughtfully a little hopefully even there is that and with the resilience of his natureof men who form opinions on slight grounds and therefore are ready to change them upon grounds as slighti faith i may have been running to meet my trouble tis but a rumor after all that wharton is for mischief andas you sayas like as not therell be no evidence by now there was little enough at the time  still ill make doubly sure my letter to king james can do no harm well talk of it again when you are in case to travel  it passed through mr carylls mind at the moment that lady ostermore and her son might between them brew such mischief as might seriously hinder him from travelling and he was very near the truth for already her ladyship was closeted with rotherby in her boudoir  the viscount was dressed for travelling intent upon withdrawing to the country for he was wellinformed already of the feeling of the town concerning him and had no mind to brave the slights and coldshoulderings that would await him did he penetrate to any of the haunts of people of quality and fashion he stood before his mother now a tall lank figure his black face very gloomy his sensual lips thrust forward in a sullen pout she in a gilt armchair before her toilettable was telling him the story of what had passed his fathers fear of ruin and disgrace he swore between his teeth when he heard that the danger threatened from the duke of wharton  and your fathers destitution means our destitutionyours and mine for his gambling schemes have consumed my portion long since  he laughed and shrugged i marvel i should concern myself said he what can it avail me to save the rags that are left him of his fortune hes sworn i shall never touch a penny that he may die possessed of  but theres the entail she reminded him if restitution is demanded the crown will not respect it twill be another sop to throw the whining curs that were crippled by the bubble and who threaten to disturb the country if they are not appeased if wharton carries out this exposure were beggarsutter beggars that may ask an alms to quiet hunger  tis whartons present hate of me said he thoughtfully and swore the damned puppy hed make a sacrifice of me upon the altar of respectability just as he made a sacrifice of the south sea bubblers what else was the stinking rakehell seeking but to put himself right again in the eyes of a town that was nauseated with him and his excesses the selfseeking toad that makes virtue his professionthe virtue of othersand profligacy his recreation he smote fist into palm theres a way to silence him  ah she looked up quickly hopefully  a foot or so of steel rotherby explained and struck the hilt of his sword i might pick a quarrel with him twould not be difficult come upon him unawares say and strike him that should force a fight  tusk fool hes all empanoplied in virtue where you are concerned hed use the matter of your affair with caryll as a reason not to meet you whatever you might do and hed set his grooms to punish any indignity you might put upon him  he durst not  pooh the town would all approve him in it since your running caryll through the back what a fool you were charles  he turned away hanging his head full conscious and with no little bitterness of how great had been his folly  salvation may lie for you in the same source that has brought you to the present passthis man caryll said the countess presently i suspect him more than ever of being a jacobite agent  i know him to be such  you know it  all but and green is assured of it too he proceeded to tell her what he knew ever since green met caryll at maidstone has he suspected him yet but that i kept him to the task he would have abandoned it hes in my pay now as much as in lord carterets and if he can run caryll to earth he receives his wages from both sides  wellwell what has he discovered anything  a little this caryll frequented regularly the house of one everard who came to town a week after carylls own arrival this everardsir richard everard is known to be a jacobite he is the pretenders paris agent they would have laid him by the heels before but that by precipitancy they feared to ruin their chances of discovering the business that may have brought him over they are giving him rope at present meanwhile by my cursed folly carylls visits to him were interrupted but there has been correspondence between them  i know said her ladyship a letter was delivered him just now i tried to smoke him concerning it but hes too astute  astute or not replied her son once he leaves stretton house it should not be long ere he betrays himself and gives us cause to lay him by the heels but how will that help us  do you ask how why if there is a plot and we can discover it we might make terms with the secretary of state to avoid any disclosure wharton may intend concerning the south sea matter  but that would be to discover my father for a jacobite what advantage should we derive from that twould be as bad as tother matter  let me die but yere a slowwitted clod charles dye think we can find no way to disclose the plot and mr carylland everard too if you choosewithout including your father my lord is timidly cautious and you may depend hell not have put himself in their hands to any extent just yet  the viscount paced the chamber slowly in long strides head bent in thought hands clasped behind him it will need consideration said he but it may serve and i can count upon green he is satisfied that caryll befooled him at maidstone and that he kept the papers he carried despite the thoroughness of greens investigations moreover he was handled with some roughness by caryll for that and the other matter he asks redressthirsts for it hes a very willing tool as i have found  then see that you use him adroitly to your work said his mother best not leave town at present charles  why no said he ill find me a lodging somewhere at hand since my fond sire is determined i shall pollute no longer the sacrosanctity of his dwelling perhaps when i have pulled him out of this quicksand he will deign to mitigate the bitterness of his feelings for me though faith i find life endurable without the affection he should have consecrated to me  ay she said looking up at him you are his son too much his son i fear tis why he dislikes you so intensely he sees in you the faults to which he is blind in himself  sweet mother said his lordship bowing  she scowled at him she could deal in irony herselfand loved tobut she detested to have it dealt to her  he bowed again gained the door and would have passed out but that she detained him  tis a pity on some scores to dispose so utterly of this caryll she said the pestilent coxcomb has his uses and his uses like adversitys are sweet  he paused to question her with his eyes  he might have made a husband for hortensia and rid me of the company of that whitefaced changeling  might he so quoth the viscount face and voice expressionless  they were made for each other her ladyship opined  were they so  aywere they and faith theyve discovered it i would you had seen the turtles in the arbor an hour ago when i surprised them  his lordship attempted a smile but achieved nothing more than a wry face and a change of color his mothers eyes observing these signs grew on a sudden startled  why fool quoth she do you hold there still art not yet cured of that folly  what folly maam  this folly that already has cost you so much sdeath as im a woman if youd so much feeling for the girl i marvel ye did not marry her honestly and in earnest when the chance was yours  the pallor of his face increased he clenched his hands i marvel myself that i did not he answered passionatelyand went out slamming the door after him and leaving her ladyship agape and angry     chapter xv love and rage   lord rotherby descending from that interview with his mother espied hortensia crossing the hall below forgetting his dignity he quickened his movements and took the remainder of the stairs two at a stride but then his lordship was excited and angry and considerations of dignity did not obtain with him at the time for that matter they seldom did  hortensia hortensia he called to her and at his call she paused  not once during the month that was pastand during which he had for the most part kept his room to all intents a prisonerhad she exchanged so much as a word with him thus not seeing him she had been able to an extent to exclude him from her thoughts which naturally enough were reluctant to entertain him for their guest  her calm as she paused now in acquiescence to his bidding was such that it almost surprised herself she had loved him onceor thought so a little month agoand at a single blow he had slain that love now love so slain has a trick of resurrecting in the guise of hate and so she had thought at first had been the case with her but this moment proved to her now that her love was dead indeed since of her erstwhile affection not even a recoil to hate remained dislike she may have felt but it was that cold dislike that breeds a deadly indifference and seeks no active expression asking no more than the avoidance of its object  her calm reflected in her face of a beauty almost spiritual in every steady line of her slight graceful figure gave him pause a moment and his hot glance fell abashed before the chill indifference that met him from those brown eyes  a man of deeper sensibilities of keener perceptions would have bowed and gone his way but then a man of deeper sensibilities would never have sought this interview that the viscount was now seeking therefore it was but natural that he should recover swiftly from his momentary halt and step aside to throw open the door of a little room on the right of the hall bowing slightly he invited her to enter  grant me a moment ere i go hortensia he said between command and exhortation  she stood cogitating him an instant with no outward sign of what might be passing in her mind then she slightly inclined her head and went forward as he bade her  it was a sunny room gay with light color and dainty furnishings having long windowdoors that opened to the garden an aubusson carpet of palest green with a festoon pattern of pink roses covered twothirds of the blocked polished floor the empanelled walls were white with here a gilt mirror flanked on either side by a girandole in ormolu a spinet stood open in midchamber and upon it were sheets of music a few books and a bowl of emeraldgreen ware charged now with roses whose fragrance lay heavy on the air there were two or three small tables of very dainty fragile make and the chairs were in delicatelytinted tapestry illustrating the fables of la fontaine  it was an apartment looked upon by hortensia as her own withdrawingroom set apart for her own use and as that the householdher very ladyship includedhad ever recognized it  his lordship closed the door with care hortensia took her seat upon the long stool that stood at the spinet her back to the instrument and with hands idle in her lapthe same cold reserve upon her countenanceshe awaited his communication  he advanced until he was close beside her and stood leaning an elbow on the corner of the spinet a long and not ungraceful figure with the black curls of his fullbottomed wig falling about his swarthy bigfeatured face  i have but my farewells to make hortensia said he i am leaving stretton house today at last  i am glad said she in a formal level voice that things should have fallen out so as to leave you free to go your ways  you are glad he answered frowning slightly and leaning farther towards her ay and why are you glad why you are glad for mr carylls sake do you deny it  she looked up at him quite calm and fearlessly i am glad for your own sake too  his dark brooding eyes looked deep into hers which did not falter under his insistent gaze am i to believe you he inquired  why not i do not wish your death  not my deathbut my absence he sneered you wish for that do you not you would prefer me gone my room is better than my company just now tis what you think eh  i have not thought of it at all she answered him with a pitiless frankness  he laughed soft and wickedly is it so very hopeless then you have not thought of it at all by which you mean that you have not thought of me at all  ist not best so you have given me no cause to think of you to your advantage i am therefore kind to exclude you from my thoughts  kind he mocked her you think it kind to put me from your mindi who love you hortensia  she rose upon the instant her cheeks warming faintly my lord said she i think there is no more to be said between us  ah but there is he cried a deal more yet and he left his place by the spinet to come and stand immediately before her barring her passage to the door not only to say farewell was it that i desired to speak with you alone here his voice softened amazingly i want your pardon ere i go i want you to say that you forgive me the vile thing i would have done hortensia contrition quivered in his lowered voice he bent a knee to her and held out his hand i will not rise until you speak my pardon child  why if that be all i pardon you very readily she answered still betraying no emotion  he frowned too readily he cried too readily for sincerity i will not take it so  indeed my lord for a penitent you are very difficult to please i pardon you with all my heart  you are sincere he cried and sought to take her hands but she whipped them away and behind her you bear me no illwill  she considered him now with a calm critical gaze before which he was forced to lower his bold eyes why should i bear you an illwill she asked him  for the thing i didthe thing i sought to do  i wonder do you know all that you did she asked him musingly shall i tell you my lord you cured me of a folly i had been blind and you made me see i had foolishly thought to escape one evil and you made me realize that i was rushing into a worse you saved me from myself you may have made me suffer then but it was a healing hurt you dealt me and should i bear you an illwill for that  he had risen from his knee he stood apart pondering her from under bent brows with eyes that were full of angry fire  i do not think she ended that there needs more between us i have understood you sir since that day at maidstonei think we were strangers until then and perhaps now you may begin to understand me fare you well my lord  she made shift to go but he barred her passage now in earnest his hands clenched beside him in witness of the violence he did himself to keep them there not yet he said in a deep concentrated voice not yet i did you a wrong i know and what you saycruel as it isis no more than i deserve but i desire to make amends i love you hortensia and desire to make amends  she smiled wistfully tis overlate to talk of that  why he demanded fiercely and caught her arms holding her there before him why is it overlate  suffer me to go she commanded rather than begged and made to free herself of his grasp  i want you to be my wife hortensiamy wedded wife  she looked at him and laughed a cold laugh disdainful yet not bitter you wanted that before my lord yet you neglected the opportunity my folly gave you i thank youyou after godfor that same neglect  ah do not say that he begged a very suppliant again do not say that child i love you do you understand  who could fail to understand after the abundant proof you have afforded me of your sincerity and your devotion  do you rally me he demanded letting through a flash of the anger that was mounting in him am i so poor a thing that you whet your little wit upon me  my lord you are paining me what can you look to gain by this suffer me to go  a moment yet he stood holding her wrists and looking down into her eyes with a mixture of pleading and ferocity in his then he made a sound in his throat and caught her bodily to him his arms laced about her held her bound and crushed against him his dark flushed face hovered above her own  fear took her at last it mounted and grew to horror let me go my lord she besought him her voice trembling oh let me go  i love you hortensia i need you he cried as if wrung by pain and then hot upon her brow and cheeks and lips his kisses fell and shame turned her to fire from head to foot as she fought helplessly within his crushing grasp  you dog she panted and writhing harder wrenched free a hand and arm blindly she beat upwards into that evil satyrs face you beast you toad you coward  they fell apart each panting she leaning faint against the spinet her bosom galloping he muttering oaths decent and otherfor in the upward thrusting of her little hand one of its fingers had prodded at an eye and the pain of itwhich had caused him to relax his hold of herstripped what little veneer remained upon the mans true nature  will you go she asked him furiously outraged by the vileness of his ravings will you go or must i summon help  he stood looking at her straightening his wig which had become disarranged in the struggle and forcing himself to an outward calm so he said you scorn me you will not marry me you realise the chance eh and why why  i suppose it is because i am blind to the honor of the alliance she controlled herself to answer him will you go  he did not move yet you loved me once  tis a lie she blazed i thought i didto my undying shame no more than that my lordas ive a soul to be saved  you loved me he insisted and you would love me still but for this damned caryllthis french coxcomb who has crawled into your regard like the slimy creeping thing he is  it sorts well with your ways my lord that you could say these things behind his back you are practiced at stabbing men behind  the gibe with all the hurtful stinging quality that only truth possesses struck his anger from him leaving him limp and pale then he recovered  do you know who he iswhat he is he asked i will tell you hes a spya damned jacobite spy whom a word from me will hang  her eyes lashed him with her scorn i were a fool did i believe you was her contemptuous answer  ask him he said and laughed he turned and strode to the door paused there sardonic looking back i shall be quits with you maam quits ill hang this pretty turtle of yours at tyburn tell him so from me  he wrenched the door open and went out on that leaving her cold and sick with dread  was it but an idle threat to terrorize her was it but that her impulse was to seek mr caryll upon the instant that she might ask him and allay her fears but what right had she upon what grounds could she set a question upon so secret a matter she conceived him raising his brows in that supercilious way of his and looking her over from head to toe as though seeking a clue to the nature of this quaint thing that asked him questions she pictured his smile and the jest with which he would set aside her inquiry she imagined indeed just what she believed would happen did she ask him which was precisely what would not have happened imagining thus she held her peace and nursed her secret dread and on the following day his weakness so far overcome as to leave him no excuse to linger at stretton house mr caryll took his departure and returned to his lodging in old palace yard  one more treasonable interview had he with lord ostermore in the library ere he departed his lordship it was who reopened again the question to repeat much of what he had said in the arbor on the previous day and mr caryll replied with much the same arguments in favor of procrastination that he had already employed  wait at least he begged until i have been abroad a day or two and felt for myself how the wind is setting   tis a prodigiously dangerous document he declared i scarce see the need for so much detail  how can it set but one way  tis a question i shall be in better case to answer when i have had an opportunity of judging meanwhile be assured i shall not sail for france without advising you time enough then to give me your letter should you still be of the same mind  be it so said the earl when all is said the letter will be safer here meantime than in your pocket and he tapped the secretaire but see what i have writ his majesty and tell me should i alter aught  he took out a drawer on the righttook it out bodilythen introduced his hand into the opening running it along the inner side of the desk until no doubt he touched a spring for suddenly a small trap was opened from this cavity he fished out two documentsone the flimsy tissue on which king james later was penned the other on heavier material lord ostermores reply he spread the latter before him and handed it to mr caryll who ran an eye over it  it was indited with stupid characteristic incaution concealment was never once resorted to everywhere expressions of the frankest were employed and every line breathed the full measure of his lordships treason and betrays the existence of a plot  mr caryll returned it his countenance was grave   i desire his majesty to know how wholeheartedly i belong to him  twere best destroyed i think you can write another when the time comes to dispatch it  but ostermore was never one to take sensible advice pooh twill be safe in here tis a secret known to none he dropped it together with king james letter back into the recess snapped down the trap and replaced the drawer whereupon mr caryll took his leave promising to advise his lordship of whatever he might glean and so departed from stretton house  my lord rotherby meanwhile was very diligent in the business upon which he was intent he had received in his interview with hortensia an added spur to such action as might be scatheful to mr caryll his lordship was lodged in portugal row within a stones throw of his fathers house and there on that same evening of his moving thither he had mr green to see him desiring news  mr green had little to impart but strong hope of much to be garnered presently his little eyes twinkling his chubby face suffused in smiles as though it were an excellent jest to be hunting knowledge that should hang a man the spy assured lord rotherby that there was little doubt mr caryll could be implicated as soon as he was about again  and thats the reasonafter your lordships own express wisheswhy so far i have let sir richard everard be it may come to trouble for me with my lord carteret should it be smoked that i have been silent on the matters within my knowledge but  oh a plague on that said his lordship youll be well paid for your services when youve rendered them and meanwhile i understand that not another soul in londonthat is on the side of the governmentis aware of sir richards presence in town so where is your danger  true said mr green plump hand caressing plumper chin had it not been so i should have been forced to apply to the secretary for a warrant before this  then youll wait said his lordship and youll act as i may direct you it will be to your credit in the end wait until caryll has enmeshed himself by frequent visits to sir richards then get your warrantwhen i give the wordand execute it one fine night when caryll happens to be closeted with everard whether we can get further evidence against him or not that circumstance of his being found with the pretenders agent should go some way towards hanging him the rest we must supply  mr green smiled seraphically ecod id give my ears to have the slippery fellow safe codso i would he bubbled me at maidstone and i limped a fortnight from the kick he gave me  he shall do a little more kickingwith both feet said his lordship with unction     chapter xvi mr green executes his warrant   five days later mr caryllwhose recovery had so far progressed that he might now be said to be his own man againcame briskly up from charing cross one evening at dusk to the house at the corner of maiden lane where sir richard everard was lodged he observed three or four fellows lounging about the corner of chandos street and bedford street but it did not occur to him that from that point they could command sir richards doornor that such could be their objectuntil as he swung sharply round the corner he hurtled violently into a man who was moving in the opposite direction without looking whither he was going the man stepped quickly aside with a murmured word of apology to give mr caryll the wall that he might pass on but mr caryll paused  ah mr green said he very pleasantly how dye have ye been searching folk of late  mr green endeavored to dissemble his startled expression in a grin that revealed his white teeth ye cant forgive me that blunder mr caryll said he  mr caryll smiled fondly upon him from your manner i take it that on your side you practice a more christian virtue it is plain that you forgive me the sequel  mr green shrugged and spread his hands you were in the right sir you were in the right he explained those are the risks a man of my calling must run i must suffer for my blunders  mr caryll continued to smile but that the light was failing the spy might have observed a certain hardening in the lines of his mouth here is a very humble mood said he it is like the crouch before the spring in whom do you design to plant your clawsyours and your friends yonder and he pointed with his cane across the street towards the loungers he had observed  my friends quoth mr green in a voice of disgust nay your honor no friends of mine ecod indeed no  no i am at fault then yet they look as if they might be bumbailiffs tis the kind ye herd with ist not give you goodeven mr green and he went on cool and unconcerned and turned in through the narrow doorway by the glovers shop to mount the stairs to sir richards lodging  mr green stood still to watch him go then he swore through his teeth and beckoned one of those whose acquaintance he had disclaimed  tis like him ecod to have gone in in spite of seeing me and you hes cool damned cool but hell be cooler yet codso then briskly questioning his satellite is sir richard within jerry  ay answered jerrya rough heavilybuilt tatterdemalion hes been there these two hours  tis our chance to nab em both thenour last chance maybe the game is up that fine gentleman has smoked it he was angry beyond measure their plans were far from ripe and yet to delay longer now that their vigilance was detected was perhaps to allow sir richard to slip through their fingers as well as the other have ye your barkers he asked harshly  jerry tapped a heavily bulging pocket and winked mr green thrust his threecornered hat acock over one eye and with his hands behind the tails of his coat stood pondering ay pox ont he grumbled it must be done tonight i dursnt delay longer well give the gentlemen time to settle comfortably then up we go to make things merry for em and he beckoned the others across  meanwhile mr caryll had gone up with considerable misgivings the last letter he had received from sir richardthat day at stretton househad been to apprise him that his adoptive father was on the point of leaving town but that he would be returned within the week the business that had taken him had been again concerned with atterbury the obstinate upon another vain endeavor to dissuade the bishop from a scheme his king did not approve had sir richard journeyed to rochester he had had his pains for nothing atterbury had kept him there entertaining him and seeking in his turn to engulf the agent in the business that was towardbusiness which was ultimately to suck down atterbury and his associates sir richard however was very firm and when at last he left rochester to return to town and his adoptive son a coolness marked the parting of those two adherents of the stuart dynasty  returned to londonwhence his absence had been marked with alarm by mr greensir richard had sent a message to mr caryll and the latter made haste to answer it in person  his adoptive father received him with open arms and such a joy in his face such a light in his old eyes as should have gladdened his visitor yet only served sadden him the more he sighed as sir richard thrust him back that he might look at him  yere pale boy he said and ye look thinner and with that he fell to reviling the deed that was the cause of this rotherby and the whole brood of ostermore  let be said mr caryll as he dropped into a chair rotherby is undergoing his punishment the town looks on him as a cutthroat who has narrowly escaped the gallows i marvel that he tarries here an i were he i think id travel for a year or two  what weakness made you spare him when ye had him at the point of your sword  that which made me regret that i had him there the reflection that he is my brother  sir richard looked at him in some surprise i thought you of sterner stuff justin he said presently and sighed passing a long white hand across his bony brow i thought i had reared you to a finer strength but there what of ostermore himself  what of him  have you not talked again with him of the matter of going over to king james  to what end since the chance is lost his betrayal now would involve the betrayal of atterbury and the othersfor he has been in touch with them  has he though the bishop said naught of this  i have it from my lord himselfand i know the man were he taken theyd wring out of him whatever happened to be in him he has no discretion indeed hes but a clod too stupid even to be aware of his own stupidity  then what is to be done inquired sir richard frowning  wed best get home to france again  and leave matters thus he considered a moment and shook his head smiling bitterly could that content you justin could you go as you have cometaking no more than you brought leaving that man as you found him could you  mr caryll looked at the baronet and wondered for a moment whether he should persevere in the rule of his life and deal quite frankly with him telling him precisely what he felt then he realized that he would not be understood he could not combat the fanaticism that was sir richards in this matter if he told him the truth how he loathed the task how he rejoiced that circumstances had now put it beyond his reachall he would achieve would be to wound sir richard in his tenderest place and to no purpose  it is not a matter of what i would he answered slowly wearily almost it is a matter of what i must here in england is no more to be done moreover theres danger for you in lingering or im much mistaken else  danger of what asked sir richard with indifference  you are being spied upon  pho i am accustomed to it i have been spied upon all my life  like enough but this time the spies are messengers from the secretary of state i caught a glimpse of them lurking about your doorwaythree or four at leastand as i entered i all but fell over a mr greena most pertinacious gentleman with whom i have already some acquaintance he is the very man who searched me at maidstone he has kept his eye upon me ever since which has not troubled me but that he should keep an eye on you means that your identity is suspected and if that be sowell the sooner we are out of england the better for your health  sir richard shook his head calmly the finefeatured lean old face showed no sign of uneasiness a fig for all that said he i go not thusemptyhanded as i came after all these years of waiting  a knock fell upon the door and sir richards man entered his face was white his eyes startled  sir richard he announced his voice lowered portentously there are some men here who insist upon seeing you  mr caryll wheeled in his chair surely they did not ask for him by name he inquired in the same low key employed by the valet  the man nodded in silence mr caryll swore through his teeth sir richard rose  i am occupied at present he said in a calm voice i can receive nobody desire to know their business if it imports bid them come again tomorrow  it is overurgent for that sir richard everard came the soft voice of mr green who thrust himself suddenly forward past the servant other figures were seen moving behind him in the anteroom  sir cried sir richard angrily this is a most insolent intrusion bentley show this fellow the door  bentley set a hand on mr greens shoulder mr green nimbly twisted out of it and produced a paper i have here a warrant for your apprehension sir richard from my lord carteret the secretary of state  mr caryll advanced menacingly upon the tipstaff mr green stepped back and fell into a defensive attitude balancing a short but formidablelooking lifepreserver  keep your distance sir or twill be the worse for you he threatened hi he called jerry beattie  jerry beattie and two other ruffians crowded to the doorway but advanced little beyond the threshold mr caryll turned to sir richard but mr green was the first to speak  sir richard said he youll see that we are but instruments of the law it grieves me profoundly to have you for our object but yell see that tis no affair of ours who have but to do the duty that were ordered yell not give these poor fellows trouble i trust yell surrender quietly  sir richards answer was to pull open a drawer in the writingtable by which he was standing and whip out a pistol  what exactly he may have intended he was never allowed to announce an explosion shook the room coming from the doorway upon which mr caryll had turned his shoulder there was a spurt of flame and sir richard collapsed forward onto the table and slithered thence to the ground  jerry taking fright at the sight of the pistol sir richard had produced had forestalled what he supposed to be the baronets intentions by firing instantly upon him with this disastrous result  confusion ensued mr caryll with no more thought for the tipstaves than he had for the smoke in his eyes or the stench of powder in his nostrils sped to sir richard in a passion of grief and anxiety he raised his adoptive father aided by bentley what time mr green was abusing jerry and jerry was urging in exculpation how he had acted purely in mr greens interest fearing that sir richard might have been on the point of shooting him  the spy went forward to mr caryll i am most profoundly sorry he began  take your sorrow to hell snarled mr caryll his face livid his eyes blazing uncannily i believe yeve murdered him  ecod the fool shall smart fort if sir richard dies grumbled mr green  whats that to me you may hang the muckworm and what shall that profit any one will it restore me sir richards life send one of your ruffians for a doctor man and bid him hasten  mr green obeyed with alacrity apart from his regrets at this happening for its own sake it would suit his interests not at all that sir richard should perish thus meanwhile with the help of the valet who was blubbering like a childfor he had been with sir richard for over ten years and was attached to him as a dog to its masterthey opened the wounded mans sodden waistcoat and shirt and reached the hurt which was on the right side of the breast  between them they lifted him up gently mr green would have lent a hand but a snarl from mr caryll drove him back in sheer terror and alone those two bore the baronet into the next room and laid him on his bed here they did the little that they could propping him up and stemming the bleeding what time they waited through what seemed a century for the doctors coming mr caryll madstark mad for the timewith grief and rage  the physician arrived at lasta small birdlike man under a great gray periwig with pointed features and little eyes that beamed brightly behind hornrimmed spectacles  in the anteroom he was met by mr green who in in a few words told him what had happened then the doctor entered the bedchamber alone and deposing hat and cane went forward to make his examination  mr caryll and bentley stood aside to give place to him he stooped felt the pulse examined the lips of the wound estimating the locality and direction of the bullet and his mouth made a clucking sound as of deprecation  very deplorable very deplorable he muttered so hale a man too despite his years very deplorable he looked up a jacobite ye say he is sir  will he live inquired mr caryll shortly by way of recalling the man of medicine to the fact that politics was not the business on which he had been summoned  the doctor pursed his lips and looked at mr caryll over the top of his spectacles he will live  thank god breathed mr caryll  perhaps an hour the doctor concluded and never knew how near was mr caryll to striking him he turned again to his patient producing a probe very deplorable mr caryll heard him muttering parrotlike  a pause ensued and a silence broken only by occasional cluckings from the little doctor and mr caryll stood by a prey to an anguish more poignant than he had ever known at last there was a groan from the wounded man mr caryll started forward  sir richards eyes were open and he was looking about him at the doctor the valet and lastly at his adopted son he smiled faintly at the latter then the doctor touched mr carylls sleeve and drew him aside  i cannot reach the bullet he said but tis no matter for that he shook his head solemnly the lung has been pierced a little time now andi can do nothing more  mr caryll nodded in silence his face drawn with pain with a gesture he dismissed the doctor who went out with bentley  when the valet returned mr caryll was on his knees beside the bed sir richards hand in his and sir richard was speaking in a feeble hoarse voicegasping and coughing at intervals  dontdont grieve justin he was saying i am an old man my time must have been very near ii am glad that it is thus it is much better than if they had taken me theyd ha shown me no mercy tis swifter thus andand easier  silently justin wrung the hand he held  youll miss me a little justin the old man resumed presently we have been good friends ladgood friends for thirty years  father justin cried a sob in his voice  sir richard smiled i would i were your father in more than name justin hast been a good son to meno son could have been more than you  bentley drew nigh with a long glass containing a cordial the doctor had advised sir richard drank avidly and sighed content when he returned the glass how long yet justin he inquired  not long father was the gloomy answer  it is well i am content i am happy justin believe me i am happy what has my life been dissipated in the pursuit of a phantom he spoke musingly critically calm as one who already upon the brink of dissolution takes already but an impersonal interest in the course he has run in life  judging so his judgment was clearer than it had yet been it grew sane and was freed at last from the hackles of fanaticism and there was something that he saw in its true proportions he sighed heavily  this is a judgment upon me he said presently he turned his great eyes full upon justin and their dance was infinitely wistful do you remember justin that night at your lodgingthat first night on which we talked here in london of the thing you were come to dothe thing to which i urged you do you recall how you upbraided me for having set you a task that was unworthy and revolting  i remember answered justin with an inward shudder fearful of what might follow  oh you were right justin right and i was entirely wrongwickedly wrong i should have left vengeance to god he is wreaking it ostermores whole life has been a punishment his end will be a punishment i understand it now we do no wrong in life justin for which in this same life payment is not exacted ostermore has been paying i should have been content with that after all he is your father in the flesh and it was not for you to raise your hand against him tis what you have felt and i am glad you should have felt it for it proves your worthiness can you forgive me  nay nay father speak not of forgiveness  i have sore need of it  ah but not from me not from me what is there i should forgive there is a debt between us i had hoped to repay some day when you were grown truly old i had looked to tend you in your old age to be the comfort of it and the support that you were to my infancy  it had been sweet justin sighed sir richard smiling upon his adopted son and putting forth an unsteady hand to stroke the white drawn face it had been sweet it is sweet to hear that you so proposed  a shudder convulsed him he sank back coughing and there was froth and blood on his lips reverently justin wiped them and signed for the cordial to bentley who stood numbed in the background  it is the end said sir richard feebly god has been good to me beyond my deserts and this is a crowning mercy consider justin it might have been the gibbet and a crowdinstead of this snug bed and you and bentley herejust two good friends  bentley losing all selfcontrol at this mention of himself sank weeping to his knees sir richard put out a hand and touched his head  you will serve mr caryll bentley youll find him a good master if you are as good a servant to him as you have been to me  then suddenly he made the quick movement of one who bethinks himself of something he waved bentley away  there is a case in the drawer yonder he said when the servant was beyond earshot it contains papers that concern youcertificates of your birth and of your mothers death i brought them with me as proofs of your identity against the time when the hour of vengeance upon ostermore should strike they twill serve no purpose now burn them they are best destroyed  mr caryll nodded understanding and on sir richards part there followed another fight for breath another attack of coughing during which bentley instinctively approached again  when the paroxysm was past sir richard turned once more to justin who was holding him in his arms upright to ease his breathing be good to bentley he murmured his voice very faint and exhausted now you are my heir justin all that i havei set all in order ere i left paris itit is growing dark you have not snuffed the candles bentley they are burning very low  suddenly he started forward held as he was in justins arms he halfraised his arms holding out his hands toward the foot of the bed his eyes dilated the expression of his livid face grew first surprised then joyousbeatific antoinette he cried in a loud voice antoi  and thus abruptly but in great happiness he passed     chapter xvii amid the graves   what time sir richard had been dying in the inner room mr green and two of his acolytes had improved the occasion by making a thorough search in sir richards writingtable and a thorough investigation of every scrap of paper found there from which you will understand how much mr green was a gentleman who set business above every other consideration  the man who had shot sir richard had been ordered by mr green to take himself off and had been urged to go down on his knees for once in a way and pray heaven that his rashness might not bring him to the gallows as he so richly deserved  his fourth myrmidon mr green had dispatched with a note to my lord rotherby and it was entirely upon the answer he should receive that it must depend whether he proceeded or not forthwith to the apprehension of mr caryll meanwhile the search went on amain and was extended presently to the very bedroom where the dead sir richard lay every nook and cranny was ransacked the very mattress under the dead man was removed and investigated and even mr caryll and bentley had to submit to being searched but it all proved fruitless not a line of treasonable matter was to be found anywhere to the certificates upon mr caryll the searcher made the mistake of paying but little heed in view of their nature  but if there were no proofs of plots and treasonable dealings there was at least abundant proof of sir richards identity and mr green appropriated these against any awkward inquiries touching the manner in which the baronet had met his death  of such inquiries however there were none it was formally sworn to lord carteret by green and his men that the secretarys messenger jerrythe fellow owned no surnamehad shot sir richard in selfdefence when sir richard had produced firearms upon being arrested on a charge of high treason for which they held the secretarys own warrant  at first lord carteret considered it a thousand pities that they should not have contrived matters better so as to take sir richard alive but upon reflection he was careful not to exaggerate to himself the loss occasioned by his death for sir richard after all was a notoriously stubborn man not in the least likely to have made any avowals worth having so that his trial whilst probably resulting sterile of such results as the government could desire would have given publicity to the matter of a plot that was hatching and such publicity at a time of so much unrest was the last thing the government desired where jacobitism was concerned lord carteret had the wise discretion to proceed with the extremest caution publicity might serve to fan the smouldering embers into a blaze whereas it was his cunning aim quietly to stifle them as he came upon them  so upon the whole he was by no means sure but that jerry had done the state the best possible service in disposing thus summarily of that notorious jacobite agent sir richard everard and his lordship saw to it that there was no inquiry and that nothing further was heard of the matter  as for lord rotherby had the affair transpired twentyfour hours earlier he would certainly have returned mr green a message to effect the arrest of mr caryll upon suspicion but as it chanced he had that very afternoon received a visit from his mother who came in great excitement to inform him that she had forced from lord ostermore an acknowledgment that he was plotting with mr caryll to go over to king james  so before they could move further against mr caryll it behooved them to ascertain precisely to what extent lord ostermore might not be incriminated as otherwise the arrest of caryll might lead to exposures that would ruin the earl more thoroughly than could any south sea bubble revelations thus her ladyship to her son he turned upon her  why madam said he these be the very arguments i used tother day when we talked of this and all you answered me then was to call me a dullwitted clod for not seeing how the thing might be done without involving my lord  tcha snapped her ladyship beating her knuckles impatiently with her fan a dullwitted clod did i call you twas flatterysheer flattery for i think yere something worse fool can ye not see the difference that lies betwixt your disclosing a plot to the secretary of state and causing this caryll to disclose itas might happen if he were seized first discover the plotfind out in what it may consist and then go to lord carteret to make your terms  he looked at her out of temper by her rebuke i may be as dull as your ladyship saysbut i do not see in what the position now is different from what it was  it isnt differentbut we thought it was different she explained impatiently we assumed that your father would not have betrayed himself counting upon his characteristic caution but it seems we are mistook he has betrayed himself to caryll and before we can move in this matter we must have proofs of a plot to lay before the secretary of state  lord rotherby understood and accounted himself between scylla and charybdis and when that evening greens messenger found him he gnashed his teeth in rage at having to allow this chance to pass at being forced to temporize until he should be less parlously situated he returned mr green an urgent message to take no steps concerning mr caryll until they should have concerted together  mr green was relieved mr caryll arrested might stir up matters against the slayer of sir richard and this was a business which mr green had prevision enough to see his master lord carteret would prefer should not be stirred up he had a notion for the rest that if mr caryll were left to go his ways he would not be likely to give trouble touching that same matter and he was right in this before his overwhelming sense of loss mr caryll had few thoughts to bestow upon the manner in which that loss had been sustained moreover if he had a quarrel with any one on that account it was with the government whose representative had issued the warrant for sir richards arrest and no more with the wretched tipstaff who had fired the pistol than with the pistol itself both alike were but instruments of slightly different degrees of insensibility  for twentyfour hours mr carylls grief was overwhelming in its poignancy his sense of solitude was awful gone was the only living man who had stood to him for kith and kin he was left alone in the world utterly alone that was the selfishness of his sorrowthe consideration of sir richards death as it concerned himself  presently an alloy of consolation was supplied by the reflection of sir richards own caseas sir richard himself had stated it upon his deathbed his life had not been happy it had been poisoned by a monomania which like a worm in the bud had consumed the sweetness of his existence sir richard was at rest and since he had been discovered that shot was indeed the most merciful end that could have been measured out to him the alternative might have been the gibbet and the gaping crowd and a moral torture to precede the end bettera thousand times betteras it was  so much did all this weigh with him that when on the following monday he accompanied the body to its grave he found his erstwhile passionate grief succeeded by an odd thankfulness that things were as they were although it must be confessed that a pang of returning anguish smote him when he heard the earth clattering down upon the wooden box that held all that remained of the man who had been father mother brother and all else to him  he turned away at last and was leaving the graveyard when some one touched him on the arm it was a timid touch he turned sharply and found himself looking into the sweet face of hortensia winthrop wondering how came she there she wore a long dark cloak and hood but her veil was turned back a chair was waiting not fifty paces from them along the churchyard wall  i came but to tell you how much i feel for you in this great loss she said  he looked at her in amazement how did you know he asked her  i guessed said she i heard that you were with him at the end and i caught stray words from her ladyship of what had passed lord rotherby had the information from the tipstaff who went to arrest sir richard everard i guessed he was youryour fosterfather as you called him and i came to tell you how deeply i sorrow for you in your sorrow  he caught her hands in his and bore them to his lips reckless of who might see the act ah this is sweet and kind in you said he  she drew him back into the churchyard again along the wall there was an avenue of limesa cool and pleasant walk wherein idlers lounged on sundays in summer after service thither she drew him he went almost mechanically her sympathy stirred his sorrow again as sympathy so often does  i have buried my heart yonder i think said he with a wave of his hand towards that spot amid the graves where the men were toiling with their shovels he was the only living being that loved me  ah surely not said she sorrow rather than reproach in her gentle voice  indeed yes mine is a selfish grief it is for myself that i sorrow for myself and my own loneliness it is thus with all of us when we argue that we weep the dead it would be more true to say that we bewail the living for himit is better as it is no doubt it is better so for most men when all is said and we do wrong to weep their passing  do not talk so she said it hurts  ayit is the way of truth to hurt which is why hating pain we shun truth so often he sighed but oh it was good in you to seek me to bring me word with your own lips of your sweet sympathy if aught could lighten the gloom of my sorrow surely it is that  they stepped along in silence until they came to the end of the avenue and turned it was no idle silence the silence of two beings who have naught to say it was a grave portentous silence occasioned by the unutterable much in the mind of one and by the others apprehension of it at last she spoke to ask him what he meant to do  i shall return to france he said it had perhaps been better had i never crossed to england  i cannot think so she said simply frankly and with no touch of a coquetry that had been harshly at discord with time and place  he shot her a swift sidelong glance then stopped and turned i am glad ont said he twill make my going the easier  i mean not that she cried and held out her hands to him i meant not what you thinkyou know you know what twas i meant you knowyou mustwhat impulse brought me to you in this hour when i knew you must need comfort and in return how cruel were you notto tell me that yonder lay buried the only living being thatthat loved you  his fingers were clenched upon her arm dontdont he implored hoarsely a strange fire in his eyes a hectic flush on either cheek dont or ill forget what i am and take advantage of this midsummer folly that is upon you  is it no more than folly justin she asked him brown eyes looking up into graygreen  ay something morestark madness all great emotions are it will pass and you will be thankful that i was man enoughstrong enoughto allow it the chance of passing  she hung her head shaking it sorrowfully then very softly is it no more than the matter ofof that that stands between us she inquired  no more than that he answered and yet more than enough i have no name to offer any woman  a name she echoed scornfully what store do you think i lay by that when you talk so you obey some foolish prejudice no more  obedience to prejudices is the whole art of living he answered sighing  she made a gesture of impatience and went on justin you said you loved me and when you said so much you gave me the rightor so i understood itto speak to you as i am doing now you are alone in the world without kith or kin the only one you hadthe one who represented all for youlies buried there would you return thus lonely and alone to france  ah now i understand he cried now i understand pity is the impulse that has urged youpity for my loneliness ist not hortensia  ill not deny that without the pity there might not have been the courage why should isince it is a pity that gives you no offense a pity that is rooted firmly inin love for you my justin  he set his hands upon her shoulders and with glowing eyes regarded her ah sweet said he you make me very very proud  and then his arms dropped again limply to his sides he sighed and shook his head drearily and yetreflect when i come to beg your hand in marriage of your guardian what shall i answer him of the questions he will ask me of myselftouching my family my parentage and all the rest that he will crave to know  she observed that he was very white again need you enter into that a man is himself not his father or his family and then she checked you make me plead too much she said a crimson flood in her fair cheeks ill say no more than i have said already have i said more than i intended and you have wanted mercy that you could drive me to it you know my mindmymy inmost heart you know that i care nothing for your namelessness it is yours to decide what you will do come now my chair is staying for me  he bowed he sought again to convey some sense of his appreciation of her great nobility then led her through the gate and to her waiting chair  whatever i may decide hortensia was the last thing he said to her and i shall decide as i account best for you rather than for myself and for myself there needs no thought or hesitationwhatever i may decide believe me when i say from my soul that all my life shall be the sweeter for this hour     chapter xviii the ghost of the past   temptation had seized mr caryll in a throttling grip and for two whole days he kept the house shunning all company and wrestling with that same temptation in the end he took a whimsical resolve entirely worthy of himself  he would go to lord ostermore formally to ask in marriage the hand of mistress winthrop and he would be entirely frank with the earl stating his exact condition but suppressing the names of his parents  he was greatly taken with the notion it would create a situation ironical beyond any grotesque beyond belief and its development should be stupendously interesting it attracted him irresistibly that he should leave it to his own father to say whether a man born as he was born might aspire to marry his fathers ward had in it something that savored of tragicomedy it was a pretty problem that once set could not be left unsolved by a man of mr carylls temperament and indeed no sooner was the idea conceived than it quickened into a resolve upon which he set out to act  he bade leduc call a chair and dressed in mourning but with his habitual care he had himself carried to lincolns inn fields  engrossed as he was in his own thoughts he paid little heed to the hum of excitement about the threshold of stretton house within the railed enclosure that fronted the mansion two coaches were drawn up and a little knot of idlers stood by one of these in busy gossip  paying no attention to them mr caryll mounted the steps nor noticed the gravity of the porters countenance as he passed within  in the hall he found a little flock of servants gathered together and muttering among themselves like conspirators in a tragedy and so engrossed that they paid no heed to him as he advanced nor until he had tapped one of them on the shoulder with his caneand tapped him a thought peremptorily  how now said he does no one wait here  they fell apart a little and stood at attention with something curious in their bearing one and all  my service to his lordship and say that i desire to speak with him  they looked at one another in hesitation for a moment then humphries the butler came forward your honorll not have heard the news said he a solemn gravity in face and tone  news quoth mr caryll sharply intrigued by so much show of mystery what news  his lordship is very ill sir he had a seizure this morning when they came for him  a seizure said mr caryll and then when they came for him he echoed struck by something odd in the mans utterance of those five words when who came for him  the messengers sir replied the butler dejectedly has your honor not heard and seeing the blank look on mr carylls face he proceeded without waiting for an answer his lordship was impeached yesterday by his grace of wharton on a matter concerning the south sea company and lord carteretthe secretary of state your honorsent this morning to arrest him  sdeath ejaculated mr caryll in his surprise a surprise that was tempered with some dismay and he had a seizure ye say  an apoplexy your honor the doctors are with him now sir james himself is here theyre cupping himso i hear from mr tom his lordships man id ha thought your honor would ha heard tis town talk they say  mr caryll would have found it difficult to have said exactly what impression this news made upon him in the main however he feared it left him cold  tis very regrettable said he he fell thoughtful a moment then will you send word to mistress winthrop that i am here and would speak with her humphries  humphries conducted mr caryll to the little white and gold withdrawingroom that was hortensias there in the little time that he waited he revolved the situation as it now stood and the temptation that had been with him for the past three days rose up now with a greater vigor should lord ostermore die temptation argued he need no longer hesitate hortensia would be as much alone in the world as he was worse for life at stretton house with her ladyshipfrom which even in the earls lifetime she had been led to attempt to escapemust be a thing unbearable and what alternative could he suggest but that she should become his wife  she came to him presently whitefaced and with startled eyes as she took his outstretched hands she attempted a smile it is kind in you to come to me at such a time she said  you mistake said he as is but natural i had not heard what had befallen i came to ask your hand in marriage of his lordship  some faint color tinged her cheeks you had decided then  i had decided that his lordship must decide he answered  and now  and now it seems we must decide for ourselves if his lordship dies  her mind swung to the graver matter sir james has every hope she said and added miserably i know not which to pray for his recovery or his death  why that  because if he survive it may be for worse the secretarys agent is even now seeking evidence against him among his own papers he is in the library at this moment going through his lordships desk  mr caryll started that mention of ostermores desk brought vividly before his mind the recollection of the secret drawer wherein the earl had locked away the letter he had received from king james and his own reply all packed as it was with treason if that drawer were discovered and those papers found then was ostermore lost indeed and did he survive this apoplexy it would be to surrender his head upon the scaffold  a moment he considered this dispassionately then it broke upon his mind that were this to happen ostermores blood would indirectly be upon his own head since for the purpose of betrayal had he sought him out with that letter from the exiled stuartwhich be it remembered king james himself had no longer wished delivered  it turned him cold with horror he could not remain idle and let matters run their course he must avert these discoveries if it lay within his power to do so or else he must submit to a lifetime of remorse should ostermore survive to be attainted of treason he had made an enda definite endlong since of his intention of working ostermores ruin he could not stand by now and see that ruin wrought as a result of the little that already he had done towards encompassing it  his papers must be saved he said shortly ill go to the library at once  but the secretarys agent is there already she repeated  tis no matter for that said he moving towards the door his desk contains that which will cost him his head if discovered i know it he assured her and left her cold with fear  but then youyou she cried is it true that you are a jacobite  true enough he answered  lord rotherby knows it she informed him he told me it was so ifif you interfere in this itit may mean your ruin she came to him swiftly a great fear written or her winsome face  sh said he i am not concerned to think of that at present if lord ostermore perishes through his connection with the cause it will mean worse than ruin for methough not the ruin that you are thinking of  but what can you do  that i go to learn  i will come with you then  he hesitated a moment looking at her then he opened the door and held it for her following after he led the way across the hall to the library and they went in together  lord ostermores secretaire stood open and leaning over it his back towards them was a short stifflybuilt man in a snuffcolored coat he turned at the sound of the closing door and revealed the pleasant chubby face of mr green  ha said mr caryll mr green again i declare sir yeve the gift of ubiquity  the spy stood up to regard him and for all that his voice inclined to sharpness when he spoke the habitual grin sat like a mask upon the mobile features what dye seek here  tis what i was about to ask youwhat you are seeking for that you seek is plain i thought perhaps i might assist you  i nothing doubt you could answered mr green with a fresh leer that contained this time something ironic i nothing doubt it but by your leave ill pursue my quest without your assistance  mr caryll continued nevertheless to advance towards him mistress hortensia remaining in the background a quiet spectator betraying nothing of the anxieties by which she was being racked  yere mighty curt this morning mr green said mr caryll very airy yere mighty curt and yere entirely wrong so to be you might find me a very useful friend  ive found you so before said mr green sourly  yeve a nice sense of humor said mr caryll head on one side contemplating the spy with admiration in his glance  and a nicer sense of a jacobite answered mr green  he will have the last word you perceive said mr caryll to hortensia  harkee mr caryll quoth mr green quite grimly now id ha laid you by the heels a month or more ago but for certain friends o mine who have other ends to serve  sir what you tell me shocks me it shakes the very foundations of my faith in human nature i have esteemed you an honest man mr green and it seemson your own confessingthat yere no better than a damned rogue who neglects his duty to the state ive a mind to see lord carteret and tell him the truth of the matter  ye shall have an opportunity before long ecod said mr green goodmorning to you ive work to do and he turned back to the desk  tis wasted labor said mr caryll producing his snuffbox and tapping it you might seek from now till the crack of doom and not find what ye seeknot though you hack the desk to pieces it has a secret mr green ill make a bargain with you for that secret  mr green turned again and his shrewd bright eyes scanned more closely that lean face whose keenness was all dissembled now in an easy languid smile a bargain grumbled the spy i faith then the secrets worthless  ye think that pho tis not like your usual wit mr green the letter that i carried into england and that you were at such splendid pains to find at maidstone is in here and he tapped the veneered top of the secretaire with his forefinger but yell not find it without my help it is concealed as effectivelyas effectively as it was upon my person when ye searched me now sir will ye treat with me itll save you a world of labor  mr green still looked at him he licked his lips thoughtfully catlike what terms dye make he inquired but his tone was very cold his busy brain was endeavoring to conjecture what exactly might be mr carylls object in this frankness which mr green was not fool enough to believe sincere  ah said mr caryll that is more the man i know he tapped his snuffbox and in that moment memory rather than inspiration showed him the thing he needed did ye ever see the constant couple mr green he inquired  the constant couple echoed mr green and though mystified he must air his little jest i never saw any couple that was constantleastways not for long  ha yere a roguish wag but the constant couple i mean is a play  oh a play ay i mind me i saw it some years ago when twas first acted but what has that to do with  yell understand in a moment said mr caryll with a smile the spy did not relish dye recall a ruse of sir harry wildairs to rid himself of the company of an intrusive old fool who was not wanted dye remember what twas he did  mr green his head slightly on one side was watching mr caryll very closely and not without anxiety i dont said he and dropped a hand to the pocket where a pistol lay that he might be prepared for emergencies what did he do  ill show you said mr caryll he did this and with a swift upward movement he emptied his snuffbox full into the face of mr green  mr green leapt back with a scream of pain hands to his eyes and quite unconsciously set himself to play to the life the part of the intrusive old fellow in the comedy dancing wildly about the room his eyes smarting and burning so that he could not open them he bellowed of hellfire and other hot things of which he was being so intensely reminded  twill pass mr caryll consoled him a little water and all will be well with you he stepped to the door as he spoke and flung it open ho there who waits he called  two or three footmen sprang to answer him he took mr green still blind and vociferous by the shoulders and thrust him into their care this gentleman has had a most unfortunate accident get him water to wash his eyeswarm water so take him twill pass mr green twill soon pass i assure you  he shut the door upon them locked it and turned to hortensia smiling grimly then he crossed quickly to the desk and hortensia followed him he sat down and pulled out bodily the bottom drawer on the right inside of the upper part of the desk as he had seen lord ostermore do that day a little over a week ago he thrust his hand into the opening and felt along the sides for some moments in vain he went over the ground again slowly inch by inch exerting constant pressure until he was suddenly rewarded by a click the small trap disclosed itself he pulled it up and took some papers from the recess he spread them before him they were the documents he soughtthe kings letter to ostermore and ostermores reply signed and ready for dispatch these must be burnt he said and burnt at once for that fellow green may return or he may send others call humphries get a taper from him  she sped to the door and did his bidding then she returned she was plainly agitated you must go at once she said imploringly you must return to france without an instants delay  why indeed it would mean my ruin to remain now he admitted and yet he held out his hands to her  i will follow you she promised him i will follow you as soon as his lordship is recovered oror at peace  you have well considered sweetheart he asked her holding her to him and looking down into her gentle eyes  there is no happiness for me apart from you  again his scruples took him tell lord ostermoretell him all he begged her be guided by him his decision for you will represent the decision of the world  what is the world to me you are the world to me she cried  there was a rap upon the door he put her from him and went to open it was humphries with a lighted taper he took it thanked the man with a word and shut the door in his face ignoring the fact that the fellow was attempting to tell him something  he returned to the desk let us make quite sure that this is all he said and held the taper so that the light shone into the recess it seemed empty at first then as the light penetrated farther he saw something that showed white at the back of the cachette he thrust in his hand and drew out a small package bound with a ribbon that once might have been green but was faded now to yellow he set it on the desk and returned to his search there was nothing else the recess was empty he closed the trap and replaced the drawer then he sat down again the taper at his elbow mistress winthrop looking on facing him across the top of the secretaire and he took up the package  the ribbon came away easily and some halfdozen sheets fell out and scattered upon the desk they gave out a curious perfume half of age half of some essence with which years ago they had been imbued something took mr caryll in the throat and he could never explain whether it was that perfume or some premonitory emotion some prophetic apprehension of what he was about to see  he opened the first of those folded sheets and found it to be a letter written in french and in an ink that had paled to yellow with the years that were gone since it had been penned the fine pointed writing was curiously familiar to mr caryll he looked at the signature at the bottom of the page it swam before his eyesantoinettecelle qui ladore antoinette he read and the whole world seemed blotted out for him all consciousness his whole being his every sense seemed concentrated into his eyes as they gazed upon that relic of a deluded womans dream  he did not read it was not for him to commit the sacrilege of reading what that girl who had been his mother had written thirty years ago to the man she lovedthe man who had proved false as hell  he turned the other letters over opened them one by one to make sure that they were of the same nature as the first and what time he did so he found himself speculating upon the strangeness of ostermores having so treasured them perhaps he had thrust them into that secret recess and there forgotten them twas an explanation that sorted better with what mr caryll knew of his father than the supposition that so dull and practical and selfcentered a nature could have been irradiated by a gleam of such tenderness as the hoarding of those letters might have argued  he continued to turn them over halfmechanically forgetful of the urgent need to burn the treasonable documents he had secured forgetful of everything even hortensias presence and meantime she watched him in silence marvelling at this delay and still more at the gray look that had crept into his face  what have you found she asked at last  a ghost he answered and his voice had a strained metallic ring he even vented an odd laugh a bundle of old loveletters  from her ladyship  her ladyship he looked up an expression on his face which seemed to show that he could not at the moment think who her ladyship might be then as the picture of that bedaubed bedizened and harshfeatured jezebel arose in his mind to stand beside the sweet girlimage of his motheras he knew her from the portrait that hung at malignyhe laughed again no not from her ladyship said he from a woman who loved him years ago and he turned to the seventh and last of those poor ghoststhe seventh a fateful number  he spread it before him frowned down on it a moment with a sharp hiss of indrawn breath then he twisted oddly on his chair and sat bolt upright staring straight before him with unseeing eyes presently he passed a hand across his brow and made a queer sound in his throat  what is it she asked  but he did not answer he was staring at the paper again a while he sat thus then with swift fevered fingers he took up once more the other letters he unfolded one and began to read a few lines he read and theno god he cried and flung out his arms under stress of his emotions one of them caught the taper that stood upon the desk and swept it extinguished to the floor he never heeded it never gave a thought to the purpose for which it had been fetched a purpose not yet served he rose he was white as the dead are white and she observed that he was trembling he took up the bundle of old letters and thrust them into an inside pocket of his coat  what are you doing she cried seeking at last to arouse him from the spell under which he appeared to have fallen those letters  i must see lord ostermore he answered wildly and made for the door reeling like a drunkard in his walk     chapter xix the end of lord ostermore  in the anteroom communicating with lord ostermores bedroom the countess was in consultation with rotherby who had been summoned by his mother when my lord was stricken  her ladyship occupied the windowseat rotherby stood beside her leaning slightly against the frame of the open window their conversation was earnest and conducted in a low key and one would naturally have conjectured that it had for subject the dangerous condition of the earl and so it hadthe dangerous condition of the earls political if not physical affairs to her ladyship and her son the matter of their own future was of greater gravity than the matter of whether his lordship lived or diedwhich whatever it may be is not unreasonable since the impeachment of my lord and the coming of the messengers to arrest him the danger of ruin and beggary were become more imminentindeed they impended and measures must be concerted to avert these evils by comparison with that the earls succumbing or surviving was a trivial matter and the concern they had manifested in sir james newswhen the important wellnourished physician who had bled his lordship came to inform them that there was hopewas outward only and assumed for pure decorums sake  whether he lives or dies said the viscount pertinently after the doctor had departed to return to his patient the measures to be taken are the same and he repeated the substance of their earlier discussions upon this same topic if we can but secure the evidence of his treason with caryll he wound up i shall be able to make terms with lord carteret to arrest the proceedings the government may intend and thus avert the restitution it would otherwise enforce  but if he were to die said her ladyship as coldly horribly calculating as though he were none of hers there would be an end to this danger they could not demand restitution of the dead nor impose fines upon him  rotherby shook his head believe not that madam said he they can demand restitution of his heirs and impose their fines upon the estate twas done in the case of chancellor craggs though he shot himself  she raised a haggard face to his and do you dream that lord carteret would make terms with you  if i can show himby actual proofthat a conspiracy does exist that the stuart supporters are plotting a rising proof of that should be of value to lord carteret of sufficient value to the government to warrant the payment of the paltry price i askthat the impeachment against my father for his dealings with the south sea company shall not be allowed  but it might involve the worse betrayal of your father charles and if he were to live  sdeath mother why must you harp on that i ant the fool you think me he cried i shall make it a further condition that my father have immunity there will be no lack of victims once the plot is disclosed and they may begin upon that coxcomb caryllthe damned meddler who is at the bottom of all this garboil  she sat bemused her eyes upon the sunlit gardens below where a faint breeze was stirring the shrub tops  there is she said presently a secret drawer somewhere in his desk if he has papers they will no doubt be there had you not best be making search for them  he smiled darkly i have seen to that already he replied  how excitedly you have got the papers  no but i have set an experienced hand to find them and one moreover who has the right by virtue of his warrantthe messenger of the secretary of state  she sat up rigid sdeath what ist ye mean  no need for alarm he reassured her this fellow green is in my pay as well as in the secretarys and it will profit him most to keep faith with me hes a selfseeking dog content to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds so that there be profit in it and hed sacrifice his ears to bring mr caryll to the gallows i have promised him that and a thousand pounds if we save the estates from confiscation  she looked at him between wonder and fear can ye trust him she asked breathlessly  he laughed softly and confidently i can trust him to earn a thousand pounds he answered when he heard of the impeachment he used such influence as he has to be entrusted with the arrest of his lordship and having obtained his warrant he came first to me to tell me of it a thousand pounds is the price of him body and soul i bade him seek not only evidence of my lords having received that plaguey stock but also papers relating to this jacobite plot into which his lordship has been drawn by our friend caryll he is at his work at present and i shall hear from him when it is accomplished  she nodded slowly thoughtfully you have very well disposed charles she approved him if your father lives it should not be a difficult matter  she checked suddenly and turned while rotherby too looked up and stepped quickly from the windowembrasure where he had stood  the door of the bedroom had been suddenly pulled open and sir james came out very pale and discomposed  madamyour ladyshipmy lord he gasped his mouth working his hands waving foolishly  the countess rose to confront him tall severe and harsh the viscount scowled a question sir james quailed before them evidently in affliction  madamhis lordship he said and by his eloquent gesture of dejection announced what he had some difficulty in putting into words  she stepped forward and took him by the wrist is he dying she inquired  have courage madam the doctor besought her  the apparent irrelevancy of the request at such a moment angered her her mood was dangerously testy and had the doctor but known it sympathy was a thing she had not borne well these many years  i asked you was he dying she reminded him with a cold sternness that beat aside all his attempts at subterfuge  your ladyshiphe is dead he faltered with lowered eyes  dead she echoed dully and her hand went to the region of her heart her face turned livid under its rouge dead she said again and behind her rotherby echoed the dread word in a stupor almost equal to her own her lips moved to speak but no words came she staggered where she stood and put her hand to her brow her sons arms were quickly about her he supported her to a chair where she sank as if all her joints were loosened  sir james flew for restoratives bathed her brow with a dampened handkerchief held strong salts to her nostrils and murmured words of foolish banal consolation whilst rotherby in a halfdreaming condition stunned by the suddenness of the blow stood beside her mechanically lending his assistance and supporting her  gradually she mastered her agitation it was odd that she should feel so much at losing what she valued so little leastways it would have been odd had it been that it was notit was something more in the awful august presence of death stepped so suddenly into their midst she felt herself appalled  for nigh upon thirty years she had been bound by legal and churchly ties in a loveless union with lord ostermoremarried for the handsome portion that had been hers a portion which he had gamed away and squandered until for their station their circumstances were now absolutely straitened they had led a harsh discordant life and the coming of a son which should have bridged the loveless gulf between them seemed but to have served to dig it wider and the son had been just the harsh unfeeling offspring that might be looked for from such a union thirty years of slavery had been her ladyships and in those thirty years her nature had been soured and warped and what inherent sweetness it may once have known had long since been smothered and destroyed she had no cause to love that man who had never loved her never loved aught of hers beyond her jointure and yet there was the habit of thirty years for thirty years they had been yokefellows however detestable the yoke but yesterday he had been alive and strong a stupid querulous thing maybe but a living and now he was so much carrion that should be given to the earth in some such channel ran her ladyships reflections during those few seconds in which she was recovering for an instant she was softened the longsince driedup springs of tenderness seemed like to push anew under the shock of this event she put out a hand to take her sons  charles she said and surprised him by the tender note  a moment thus then she was herself again how did he die she asked the doctor and the abruptness of the resumption of her usual manner startled sir james more than aught in his experience of such scenes  it was most sudden madam answered he i had the best grounds for hope i was being persuaded we should save him and then quite suddenly without an instants warning he succumbed he just heaved a sigh and was gone i could scarcely believe my senses madam  he would have added more particulars of his feelings and emotionsfor he was of those who believe that their own impressions of a phenomenon are that phenomenons most interesting manifestationsbut her ladyship waved him peremptorily into silence  he drew back washing his hands in the air an expression of polite concern upon his face is there aught else i can do to be of service to your ladyship he inquired solicitous  what else she asked with a fuller return to her old self yeve killed him what more is there you can do  oh madamnay madam i am most deeply grieved that mymy  his lordship will wait upon you to the door said she designating her son  the eminent physician effaced himself from her ladyships attention it was his boast that he could take a hint when one was given him and so he could provided it were broad enough as in the present instance  he gathered up his hat and goldheaded canethe unfailing insignia of his orderand was gone swiftly and silently  rotherby closed the door after him and returned slowly head bowed to the window where his mother was still seated they looked at each other gravely for a long moment  this makes matters easier for you she said at length  much easier it does not matter now how far his complicity may be betrayed by his papers i am glad madam to see you so far recovered from your weakness  she shivered as much perhaps at his tone as at the recollections he evoked you are very indifferent charles said she  he looked at her steadily then slightly shrugged what need to wear a mask bah did he ever give me cause to feel for him he asked mother if one day i have a son of my own i shall see to it that he loves me  you will be hard put to it with your nature charles she told him critically then she rose will you go to him with me she asked  he made as if to acquiesce then halted no he said and there was repugnance in his tone and face notnot now  there came a knocking at the door rapid insistent grateful for the interruption rotherby went to open  mr green staggered forward with swollen eyes his face inflamed with rage and with something else that was not quite apparent to rotherby  my lord he cried in a loud angry voice  rotherby caught his wrist and checked him sh sir he said gravely not here and he pushed him out again her ladyship following them  it was in the galleryabove the hall in which the servants still stood idly aboutthat mr green spattered out his wrathful tale of what had befallen in the library  rotherby shook him as if he had been a rat you cursed fool he cried you left him thereat the desk  what help had i demanded green with spirit my eyes were on fire i couldnt see and the pain of them made me helpless  then why did ye not send word to me at once you fool  because i was concerned only to stop my eyes from burning answered mr green in a towering rage at finding reproof where he had come in quest of sympathy i have come to you at the first moment damn you he burst out in full rebellion and youll use me civilly now that i am come orecoditll be the worse for your lordship  rotherby considered him through a faint mist that rage had set before his eyes to be so spoken todamned indeedby a dirty spy had he been alone with the man there can be little doubt but that he would have jeopardized his very precarious future by kicking mr green downstairs but his mother saved him from that rashness it may be that she saw something of his anger in his kindling eye and thought it well to intervene  she set a hand on his sleeve charles she said to him in a voice that was dead cold with warning  he responded to it and chose discretion he looked green over nevertheless i vow im very patient with you said he and green had the discretion on his side to hold his tongue come man while we stand talking here that knave may be destroying precious evidence  and his lordship went quickly down the stairs mr green following hard upon his heels and her ladyship bringing up the rear  at the door of the library rotherby came to a halt and turned the handle the door was locked he beckoned a couple of footmen across the hall and bade them break it open     chapter xx mr carylls identity   i must see lord ostermore had been mr carylls wild cry as he strode to the door  from the other side of it there came a sound of steps and voices some one was turning the handle  hortensia caught mr caryll by the sleeve but the letters she cried frantically and pointed to the incriminating papers which he had left forgotten upon the desk  he stared at her a moment and memory swept upon him in a flood he mastered the wild agitation that had been swaying him thrust the paper that he was carrying into his pocket and turned to go back for the treasonable letters  the taper he exclaimed and pointed to the extinguished candle on the floor what can we do  a sharp blow fell upon the lock of the door he stood still looking over his shoulder  quick make haste hortensia admonished him in her excitement get them conceal them at least do the best you can since we have not the means to burn them  a second blow was struck succeeded instantly by a third and something was heard to snap the door swung open and green and rotherby sprang into the room a brace of footmen at their heels they were followed more leisurely by the countess whilst a little flock of servants brought up the rear but checked upon the threshold and hung there to witness events that held out such promise of being unusual  mr caryll swore through set teeth and made a dash for the desk but he was too late to accomplish his object his hand had scarcely closed upon the letters when he was himself seized rotherby and green on either side of him held him in their grasp each with one hand upon his shoulder and the other at his wrist thus stood he powerless between them and after the first shock of it cool and making no effort to disengage himself his right hand was tightly clenched upon the letters  rotherby called a servant forward take those papers from the thiefs hand he commanded  stop cried mr caryll lord rotherby may i speak with you alone before you go further in a matter you will bitterly regret  take those papers from him rotherby repeated swearing and the servant bent to the task but mr caryll suddenly wrenched the hand away from the fellow and the wrist out of lord rotherbys grip  a moment my lord as you value your honor and your possessions he insisted let me speak with lord ostermore first take me before him  you are before him now said rotherby say on  i demand to see lord ostermore  i am lord ostermore said rotherby  you since when said mr caryll not even beginning to understand  since ten minutes ago was the callous answer that first gave that household the news of my lords passing  there was a movement a muttering among the servants old humphries broke through the group by the door his heavy chops white and trembling and in that moment hortensia turned awestricken to ask her ladyship was this true her ladyship nodded in silence hortensia cried out and sank to a chair as if beaten down by the news whilst the old servant answered too withdrew wringing his hands and making foolish laments and the tears of those were the only tears that watered the grave of john caryll fifth earl of ostermore  as for mr caryll the shock of that announcement seemed to cast a spell upon him he stood still limp and almost numbed oh the neverceasing irony of things that his father should have died at such a moment  dead quoth he dead is my lord dead they told me he was recovering  they told you false answered rotherby so nowthose papers  mr caryll relinquished them take them he said since that is sotake them  rotherby received them himself remove his sword he bade a footman  mr caryll looked sharply round at him my sword quoth he what do you mean by that what right  we mean to keep you by us sir said mr green on his other side until you have explained what you were doing with those paperswhat is your interest in them  meanwhile a servant had done his lordships bidding and mr caryll stood weaponless amid his enemies he mastered himself at once here it was plain that he must walk with caution for the ground he perceived was of a sudden grown most insecure and treacherous rotherby and green in league it gave him matter for much thought  theres not the need to hold me said he quietly i am not likely to tire myself by violence theres scarcely necessity for so much  rotherby looked up sharply the cool selfpossessed tone had an intimidating note but mr green laughed maliciously as he continued to mop his still watering eyes he was acquainted with mr carylls methods and knew that probably the more at ease he seemed the less at ease he was  rotherby spread the letters on the desk and scanned them with a glowing eye mr green at his elbow reading with him the countess swept forward that she too might inspect this find  theyll serve their turn said her son and added to caryll and theyll help to hang you  no doubt you find me mentioned in them said mr caryll  ay sir snapped green if not by name at least as the messenger who is to explain that which the writersthe royal writer and the otherhave out of prudence seen fit to exclude  hortensia looked up and across the room at that a wild fear clutching at her heart but mr caryll laughed pleasantly eyebrows raised as if in mild surprise the most excellent relations appear to prevail between you said he looking from rotherby to green are you too my lord in the secretarys pay  his lordship flushed darkly youll clown it to the end he sneered  and thats none so far off snarled mr green who since the peppering of his eyes had flung aside his usual cherubic air oh you may sneer sir he mocked the prisoner but we have you fast this letter was brought hither by you and this one was to have been carried hence by you  the latter sir was a matter for the future and you can hardly prove what a man will do so well let that pass as for the formerthe letter which you say i broughtyoull remember that you searched me at maidstone  and i have your admission that the letter was upon you at the time roared the spy interrupting himyour admission in the presence of that lady as she can be made to witness  mistress winthrop rose tis a lie she said firmly i can not be made to witness  mr caryll smiled and nodded across to her tis vastly kind in you mistress winthrop but the gentleman is mistook he turned to green harkee sirrah did i admit that i had carried that letter  mr green shrugged you admitted that you carried a letter what other letter should it have been but that  nay smiled mr caryll tis not for you to ask me rather is it for you to prove that the letter i admitted having carried and that letter are one and the same twill take a deal of proving i dare swear  yell be forsworn then put in her ladyship sourly for i can witness to the letter that you bore not only did i see ita letter on that same fine paperin my husbands hands on the day you came here and during your visit but i have his lordships own word for it that he was in the plot and that you were the gobetween  ah chuckled mr green what now sir what now by what fresh piece of acrobatics will you get out of that  yere a fool said mr caryll with calm contempt and fetched out his snuffbox dye dream that one witness will suffice to establish so grave a charge pah he opened his snuffbox to find it empty and viciously snapped down the lid again pah he said again yeve cost me a whole boxfull of burgamot  why did ye throw it in my face demanded mr green what purpose did ye look to serve but one of treason answer me that  i didnt like the way ye looked at me twas wanting respect and i bethought me i would lessen the impudence of your expression have ye any other foolish questions for me and he looked again from green to rotherby including both in his inquiry no he rose in that case if youll give me leave and  you do not leave this house rotherby informed him  i think you push hospitality too far will you desire your lackey to return me my sword i have affairs elsewhere  mr caryll i beg that you will understand said his lordship with a calm that he was at some pains to maintain that you do not leave this house save in the care of the messengers from the secretary of state  mr caryll looked at him and yawned in his face yere prodigiously tiresome said he did ye but know how i detest disturbances what shall the secretary of state require of me  hell require you on a charge of high treason said mr green  have you a warrant to take me  i have not but  then how do you dare detain me sir demanded mr caryll sharply dye think i dont know the law  i think youll know a deal more of it shortly countered mr green  meanwhile sirs i depart offer me violence at your peril he moved a step and then at a sign from rotherby the lackeys hands fell on him again and forced him back and down into his chair  away with you for the warrant said rotherby to green well keep him here till you return  mr green grinned at the prisoner and was gone in great haste  mr caryll lounged back in his chair and threw one leg over the other i have always endeavored said he to suffer fools as gladly as a christian should so since you insist ill be patient until i have the ear of my lord carteretwho i take it is a man of sense but if i were you my lord and you my lady i should not insist believe me youll cut poor figures as for you my lord yere in none such good odor as it is  let that be snarled his lordship  if i mention it at all i but do so in your lordships own interests it will be remembered that ye attempted to murder me once and that will not be of any great help to such accusations as you may bring against me besides which there is the unfortunate circumstance that its widely known yere not a man to be believed  will you be silent roared his lordship in a towering passion  if i trouble myself to speak at all it is out of concern for your lordship mr caryll insisted sweetly and in your own interest and your ladyships too id counsel you to hear me a moment without witnesses  his tone was calculatedly grave lord rotherby looked at him sneering not so her ladyship less acquainted with his ways the absolute confidence and unconcern of his demeanor was causing her uneasiness a man who was perilously entrammelled would not bear himself so easily she opined she rose and crossed to her sons side  what have you to say she asked mr caryll  nay madam he replied not before these and he indicated the servants  tis but a pretext to have them out of the room said rotherby  mr caryll laughed the notion to scorn if you think thati give you my word of honor to attempt no violence nor to depart until you shall give me leave said he  rotherby judging mr caryll by his knowledge of himself still hesitated but her ladyship realized in spite of her detestation of the man that he was not of the temper of those whose word is to be doubted she signed to the footmen  go she bade them wait within call  they departed and mr caryll remained seated for all that her ladyship was standing it was as if by that he wished to show how little he was minded to move  her ladyships eye fell upon hortensia do you go too child she bade her  instead hortensia came forward i wish to remain madam she said  did i ask you what you wished demanded the countess  my place is here hortensia explained unless mr caryll should himself desire me to depart  nay nay he cried and smiled upon her fondlyso fondly that the countesss eyes grew wider with all my heart i desire you to remain it is most fitting you should hear that which i have to say  what does it mean demanded rotherby thrusting himself forward and scowling from one to the other of them what dye mean hortensia  i am mr carylls betrothed wife she answered quietly  rotherbys mouth fell open but he made no sound not so her ladyship a peal of shrill laughter broke from her la what did i tell you charles then to hortensia im sorry for you maam said she i think yeve been a thought too long in making up your mind and she laughed again  lord ostermore lies above stairs hortensia reminded her and her ladyship went white at the reminder the indecency of her laughter borne in upon her  would ye lesson me girl she cried as much to cover her confusion as to vent her anger at the cause of it yeve an odd daring by god yell be well matched with his impudence there  rotherby singularly selfcontained recalled her to the occasion  mr caryll is waiting said he a sneer in his voice  ah yes she said and flashing a last malignant glance upon hortensia she sank to a chair beside her but not too near her  mr caryll sat back his legs crossed his elbows on his chairarms his fingertips together the thing i have to tell you is of some gravity he announced by way of preface  rotherby took a seat by the desk his hand upon the treasonable letters proceed sir he said importantly mr caryll nodded as in acknowledgment of the invitation  i will admit before going further that in spite of the cheerful countenance i maintained before your lordships friend the bumbailiff and your lackeys i recognize that you have me in a very dangerous position  ah from his lordship in a breath of satisfaction and  ah from hortensia in a gasp of apprehension  her ladyship retained a stony countenance and a silence that sorted excellently with it  there is mr caryll proceeded marking off the points on his fingers the incident at maidstone there is your ladyships evidence that i was the bearer of just such a letter on the day that first i came here there is the dangerous circumstanceof which mr green i am sure will not fail to make a dealof my intimacy with sir richard everard and my constant visits to his lodging where i was in fact on the occasion when he met his death there is the fact that i committed upon mr green an assault with my snuff box for motives that after all admit of but one acceptable explanation and lastly there is the circumstance that apparently if interrogated i can show no good reason why i should be in england at all where no apparent interest has called me or keeps me  now these matters are so trivial that taken separately they have no value whatever taken conjointly their value is not great they do not contain evidence enough to justify the hanging of a dog and yet i realize that disturbed as the times are fearful of sedition as the government finds itself in consequence of the mischief done to public credit by the south sea disaster and ready as the ministry is to see plots everywhere and to make examples pour discourager les autres if the accusation you intend is laid against me backed by such evidence as this it is not impossibleindeed it is not improbablethat it mayahtend to shorten my life  sir sneered rotherby i declare you should have been a lawyer we havent a pleader of such parts and such lucidity at the whole bar  mr caryll nodded his thanks your praise is very flattering my lord said he with a wry smile and then proceeded it is because i see my case to be so very nearly desperate that i venture to hope you will not persevere in the course you are proposing to adopt  lord rotherby laughed noiselessly can you urge me any reasons why we should not  if you could urge me any reasons why you should said mr caryll no doubt i should be able to show you under what misapprehensions you are laboring he shot a keen glance at his lordship whose face had suddenly gone blank mr caryll smiled quietly there is in this something that i do not understand he resumed it does not satisfy me to suppose as at first might seem that you are acting out of sheer malice against me you have scarcely cause to do that my lord and you my lady have none that fool greenpatiencehe conceives that he has suffered at my hands but without your assistance mr green would be powerless to hurt me what then is it that is moving you  he paused looking from one to the other of his declared enemies they exchanged glanceshortensia watching them breathless her own mind working too upon this question that mr caryll had set yet nowhere finding an answer  i had thought said her ladyship at last that you promised to tell us something that it was in our interest to hear instead you appear to be asking questions  mr caryll shifted in his chair one glance he gave the countess then smiled i have sought at your hands the reasons why you should desire my death said he slowly you withhold them be it so i take it that you are ashamed of them and so their nature is not difficult to conjecture  sir began rotherby hotly halfstarting from his seat  nay let him trundle on charles said his mother hell be the sooner done  instead proceeded mr caryll as if there had been no interruption i will now urge you my reasons why you should not so proceed  ha snapped rotherby they will need to be valid  mr caryll twisted farther round to face his lordship more fully they are as valid said he very impressivelyso impressively and sternly that his hearers felt themselves turning cold under his words filled with some mysterious apprehension they are as valid as were my reasons for holding my hand in the field out yonder when i had you at the mercy of my sword my lord neither more nor less from that you may judge them to be very valid  but ye dont name them said her ladyship attempting to conquer her uneasiness  i shall do so said he and turned again to his lordship i had no cause to love you that morning nor at any time my lord i had no cause to thinkas even you in your heart must realize if so be that you have a heart and the intelligence to examine iti had no cause to think my lord that i should be doing other than a good deed by letting drive my blade that such an opinion was well founded was proven by the thing you did when i turned my back upon you after sparing your useless life  rotherby broke in tempestuously smiting the desk before him if you think to move us to mercy by such  oh not to mercy would i move you said mr caryll his hand raised to stay the other not to mercy but to horror of the thing you contemplate and then in an oddly impressive manner he launched his thunderbolt know then that if that morning i would not spill your blood it was because i should have been spilling the same blood that flows in my own veins it was because you are my brother because your father was my father no less than that was the reason that withheld my hand  he had announced his aim of moving them to horror and it was plain that he had not missed it for in frozen horror sat they all their eyes upon him their cheeks ashen their mouths agapeeven hortensia who from what already mr caryll had told her understood now more than any of them  after a spell rotherby spoke you are my brother he said his voice colorless my brother what are you saying  and then her ladyship found her voice who was your mother she inquired and her very tone was an insult not to the man who sat there so much as to the memory of poor antoinette de maligny he flushed to the temples then paled again  ill not name her to your ladyship said he at last in a cold imperious voice  im glad yeve so much decency she countered  you mistake i think said he tis respect for my mother that inspires me and his green eyes flashed upon the painted hag she rose up a very fury  what are you saying she shrilled dye hear the filthy fellow rotherby hell not name the wanton in my presence out of respect for her  for shame madam you are speaking of his mother cried hortensia hot with indignation  pshaw tis all an impudent liea pack of lies cried rotherby hes crafty as all the imps of hell  mr caryll rose here in the sight of god and by all that i hold most sacred i swear that what i have said is true i swear that lord ostermoreyour fatherwas my father i was born in france in the year 1690 as i have papers upon me that will prove which you may see rotherby  his lordship rose produce them said he shortly  mr caryll drew from an inner pocket of his coat the small leather case that sir richard everard had given him from this he took a paper which he unfolded it was a certificate of baptism copied from the register of the church of st antoine in paris  rotherby held out his hand for it but mr caryll shook his head stand here beside me and read it said he  obeying him rotherby went and read that authenticated copy wherein it was declared that sir richard everard had brought to the church of st antoine for baptism a male child which he had declared to be the son of john caryll viscount rotherby and antoinette de maligny and which had received in baptism the name of justin  rotherby drew away again his head sunk on his breast her ladyship was seated her eyes upon her son her fingers drumming absently at the arms of her chair then rotherby swung round again  how do i know that you are the person designated therethis justin caryll  you do not but you may cast your mind back to that night at whites when you picked your quarrel with me my lord do you remember how stapleton and collis spoke up for me declared that they had known me from boyhood at oxford and had visited me at my chateau in france what was the name of that chateau my lorddo you remember  rotherby looked at him searching his memory but he did not need to search far at first glance the name of maligny had seemed familiar to him it was maligny he replied and yet  if more is needed to convince you i can bring a hundred witnesses from france who have known me from infancy you may take it that i can establish my identity beyond all doubt  and what if you do demanded her ladyship suddenly what if you do establish your identity as my lords bastard what claim shall that be upon us  that maam answered mr caryll very gravely i wait to learn from my brother here     chapter xxi the lions skin  for a spell there was utter silence in that spacious pillared chamber mr caryll and her ladyship had both resumed their chairs the former spuriously calm the latter making no attempt to conceal her agitation hortensia leant forward an eager spectator watching the three actors in this tragicomedy  as for rotherby he stood with bent head and furrowed brow it was for him to speak and yet he was utterly at a loss for words he was not moved at the news he had received so much as dismayed it dictated a course that would interfere with all his plans and therefore a course unthinkable so he remained puzzled how to act how to deal with this unexpected situation  it was her ladyship who was the first to break the silence she had been considering mr caryll through narrowing eyes the corners of her mouth drawn down she had caught the name of maligny when it was uttered and out of the knowledge which happened to be hersthough mr caryll was ignorant of thisit set her thinking  i do not believe that you are the son of mademoiselle de maligny she said at last i never heard that my lord had a son i cannot believe there was so much between them  mr caryll stared startled out of his habitual calm rotherby turned to her with an exclamation of surprise how he cried you knew then my father was  she laughed mirthlessly your father would have married her had he dared she informed them twas to beg his fathers consent that he braved his banishment and came to england but his father was as headstrong as himself held just such views as he himself held later where you were concerned he would not hear of the match i was to be had for the asking my father was a man who traded in his children and he had offered me with a jointure that was a fortune to the earl of ostermore as a wife for his son  mr caryll was listening all ears some light was being shed upon much that had lain in darkness  and so she proceeded your grandfather constrained your father to forget the woman he had left in france and to marry me i know not what sins i had committed that i should have been visited with such a punishment but so it befell your father resisted dallying with the matter for a whole year then there was a duel fought a cousin of mademoiselle de malignys crossed to england and forced a quarrel upon your father they met and m de maligny was killed then a change set in in my lords bearing and one day a month or so later he gave way to his fathers insistence and we were wed but i do not believe that my lord had left a son in francei do not believe that had he done so i should not have known it i do not believe that under such circumstances unfeeling as he was he would have abandoned mademoiselle de maligny  you think then said rotherby that this man has raked up this story to  consider what you are saying cut in mr caryll with a flash of scorn should i have come prepared with documents against such a happening as this  nay but the documents might have been intended for some other purpose had my lord livedsome purpose of extortion suggested her ladyship  but consider again madam that i am wealthyfar wealthier than was ever my lord ostermore as my friends collis stapleton and many another can be called to prove what need then had i to extort  how came you by your means being what you say you are she asked him  briefly he told her how sir richard everard had cared for him for his mothers sake endowed him richly upon adopting him and since made him heir to all his wealth which was considerable and for the rest madam and you rotherby set doubts on one side your ladyship says that had my lord had a son you must have heard of it but my lord madam never knew he had a son tell mecan you recall the date the month at least in which my lord returned to england  i can sir it was at the end of april of 89 what then  mr caryll produced the certificate again he beckoned rotherby and held the paper under his eyes what date is therethe date of birth  rotherby read the third of january of 1690  mr caryll folded the paper again that will help your ladyship to understand how it might happen that my lord remained in ignorance of my birth he sighed as he replaced the case in his pocket i would he had known before he died said he almost as if speaking to himself  and now her ladyship lost her temper she saw rotherby wavering and it angered her and angered she committed a grave error wisdom lay in maintaining the attitude of repudiation it would at least have afforded some excuse for her and rotherby instead she now recklessly flung off that armor and went naked down into the fray  a fig fort all she cried and snapped her fingers she had risen and she towered there a lean and malevolent figure her headdress nodding foolishly what does it matter that you be what you claim to be is it to weigh with you rotherby  rotherby turned grave eyes upon her he was it seemed not quite rotten through and through there was still in himin the depths of hima core that was in a measure sound and that core was reached most of all had the story weighed with him because it afforded the only explanation of why mr caryll had spared his life that morning of the duel it was a matter that had puzzled him as it had puzzled all who had witnessed the affront that led to the encounter  between that and the restto say nothing of the certificate he had seen which he could not suppose a forgeryhe was convinced that mr caryll was the brother that he claimed to be he gathered from his mothers sudden anger that she too was convinced in spite of herself by the answers mr caryll had returned to all her arguments against the identity he claimed  he hated mr caryll no whit less for what he had learnt if anything he hated him more and yet a sense of decency forbade him from persecuting him now as he had intended and delivering to the hangman from ordinary murder once in the heat of passionas we have seenhe had not shrunk but fratricide appearedsuch is the effect of educationa far far graver thing even though it should be indirect fratricide of the sort that he had contemplated before learning that this man was his brother  there seemed to be one of two only courses left him to provide mr caryll with the means of escape or else to withhold such evidence as he intended to supply against him and to persuadeto compel if necessaryhis mother to do the same when all was said his interests need not suffer very greatly his position would not be quite so strong perhaps if he but betrayed a plot without delivering up any of the plotters still he thought it should be strong enough his father dead out of consideration of the signal loyalty his act must manifest he thought the government would prove grateful and forbear from prosecuting a claim for restitution against the ostermore estates  he had then all but resolved upon the cleaner course when suddenly something that in the stress of the moment he had gone near to overlooking was urged upon his attention  hortensia had risen and had started forward at her ladyships last words she stood before his lordship now with pleading eyes and hands held out my lord she cried you cannot do this thing you cannot do it  but instead of moving him to generosity by those very words she steeled his heart against it and proved to him that after all his potentialities for evil were strong enough to enable him to do the very thing she said he could not his brow grew black as midnight his dark eyes raked her face and saw the agony of apprehension for her lover written there he drew breath hissing and audible glanced once at caryll then a moment said he  he strode to the door and called the footmen then turned again  mr caryll he said in a formal voice will you give yourself the trouble of waiting in the anteroom i need to consider upon this matter  mr caryll conceiving that it was with his mother that rotherby intended to consider rose instantly i would remind you rotherby that time is pressing said he  i shall not keep you long was rotherbys cold reply and mr caryll went out  what now charles asked his mother is this child to remain  it is the child that is to remain said his lordship will your ladyship do me the honor too of waiting in the anteroom and he held the door for her  what folly are you considering she asked  your ladyship is wasting time and time as mr caryll has said is pressing  she crossed to the door controlled almost despite herself by the calm air of purpose that was investing him you are not thinking of  you shall learn very soon of what i am thinking maam i beg that you will give us leave  she paused almost upon the threshold if you do a rashness here remember that i can still act without you she reminded him you may choose to believe that that man is your brother and so out of that andshe added with a cruel sneer at hortensiaother considerations you may elect to let him go but remember that you still have me to reckon with whether he prove of your blood or not he cannot prove himself of minethank god  his lordship bowed in silence preserving an unmoved countenance whereupon she cursed him for a fool and passed out he closed the door and turned the key hortensia watching him in a sort of horror let me go she found voice to cry at last and advanced towards the door herself but rotherby came to meet her his face white his eyes glowing she fell away before his opening arms and he stood still mastering himself  that man he said jerking a backward thumb at the closed door lives or dies goes free or hangs as you shall decide hortensia  she looked at him her face haggard her heart beating high in her throat as if to suffocate her what do you mean she asked  you love him he growled pah i see it in your eyesin your tremorsthat you do it is for him that you are afraid ist not  why do you mock me with it she inquired with dignity  i do not mock you hortensia answer me is it true that you love him  it is true she answered steadily what ist to you  everything he answered hotly everything it is heaven and hell to me ten days ago hortensia i asked you to marry me  no more she begged him an arm thrown out to stay him  but there is more he answered advancing again this time i can make the offer more attractive marry me and caryll is not only free to depart but no evidence shall be laid against him i swear it refuse me and he hangs as surelyas surely as you and i talk together here this moment  cold eyes scathed him with contempt god she cried what manner of monster are you my lord to speak soto speak of marriage to me and to speak of hanging a man who is son to that same father of yours who lies above stairs not yet turned cold are you human at all  ayand in nothing so human as in my love for you hortensia  she put her hands to her face give me patience she prayed the insult of it after what has passed let me go sir open that door and let me go  he stood regarding her a moment with lowering brows then he turned and went slowly to the door he dies remember said he and the words the sinister tone and the sinister look that was stamped upon his face shattered her spirit as at a blow  no no she faltered and advanced a step or two oh have pity  when you show me pity he answered  she was beaten youyou swear to let him goto see him safely out of englandifif i consent  his eyes blazed he came back swiftly and she stood a frozen thing passively awaiting him a frozen thing she let him take her in his arms yielding herself in horrific surrender  he held her close a moment the blood surging to his face and glowing darkly through the swarthy skin have i conquered then he cried youll marry me hortensia  at that price she answered piteously at that price  shalt find me a gentle loving husband ever i swear it before heaven he vowed the ardor of his passion softening his nature as steel is softened in the fire  then be it so she said and her tone was less cold for she began to glow as it were with the ardor of the sacrifice that she was makingbegan to experience the exalted ecstasy of martyrdom save him and you shall find me ever a dutiful wife to you my lorda dutiful wife  and loving he demanded greedily  even that i promise it she answered  with a hoarse cry he stooped to kiss her then with an oath he checked and flung her from him so violently that she hurtled to a chair and sank to it overbalanced no he roared like a mad thing now hell and damnationno  a wild frenzy of jealousy had swept aside his tenderness he was sick and faint with the passion of it of this proof of how deeply she must love that other man he strove to control his violence he snarled at her in his endeavors to subdue the animal the primitive creature that he was at heart if you can love him so much as that he had better hang i think he laughed on a high fierce note you have spoke his sentence girl dye think id take you soat second hand oh sdeath what dye deem me  he laughed againin his throat now a quivering halfsobbing laugh of angerand crossed to the door her eyes following him terrified her mind understanding nothing of this savage he turned the key and flung wide the door with a violent gesture bring him in he shouted  they enteredmr caryll with the footmen at his heels a frown between his brows his eyes glancing quickly and searchingly from rotherby to hortensia after him came her ladyship no less inquisitive of look rotherby dismissed the lackeys and closed the door again he flung out an arm to indicate hortensia  this little fool he said to caryll would have married me to save your life  mr caryll raised his brows the words relieved his fears i am glad sir that you perceive she would have been a fool to do so you i take it have been fool enough to refuse the offer  yes you damned playactor yes he thundered dye think i want another mans castoffs  that is an overstatement said mr caryll mistress winthrop is no castoff of mine  enough said snapped rotherby he had intended to say much to do some mighty ranting but before mr carylls cold halfbantering reduction of facts to their true values he felt himself robbed of words you hang he ended shortly  yere sure of that questioned mr caryll  i would i were as sure of heaven  i think you may bejust about as sure mr caryll rejoined entirely unperturbed and he sauntered forward towards hortensia rotherby and his mother watched him exchanging glances  then rotherby shrugged and sneered tis his bluster said he hell be a farceur to the end i doubt hes halfwitted  mr caryll never heeded him he was bending beside hortensia he took her hand and bore it to his lips sweet he murmured twas a treason that you intended have you then no faith in me courage sweetheart they cannot hurt me  she clutched his hands and looked up into his eyes you but say that to comfort me she cried  not so he answered gravely i tell you no more than what is true they think they hold me they will cheat and lie and swear falsely to the end that they may destroy me but they shall have their pains for nothing  aydepend upon that rotherby mocked him depend upon itto the gallows  mr carylls curious eyes smiled upon his brother but his lips were contemptuous i am of your own blood rotherbyyour brother he said again and once already out of that consideration i have spared your lifebecause i would not have a brothers blood upon my hands he sighed and continued i had hoped that you had enough humanity to do the same i deplore that you should lack it but i deplore it for your own sake because after all you are my brother apart from that it matters nothing to me  will it matter nothing when you are proved a jacobite spy cried her ladyship enraged beyond endurance by this calm scorn of them will it matter nothing when it is proved that you carried that letter and would have carried that otherthat you were empowered to treat in your exiled masters name will that matter nothing  he looked at her an instant then as if utterly disdaining to answer her he turned again to rotherby i were a fool and blind did i not see to the bottom of this turbid little puddle upon which you think to float your argosies you are selling me you are to make a bargain with the government to forbear the confiscations your father has incurred out of consideration of the service you can render by disclosing this plot and you would throw me in as something tangiblein earnest of the others that may follow have i sounded the depths of your intent  and if you havewhat then demanded sullen rotherby  this my lord answered mr caryll and he quoted the man that once did sell the lions skin while the beast lived was killed with hunting him remember that  they looked at him impressed by the ringing voice in which he had spokena voice in which the ring was of mingled mockery and exultation then her ladyship shook off the impression and laughed  with what dye threaten us she asked contemptuously  ithreaten maam nay i am incapable of threatening i do not threaten i have reasoned with you exhorted you shown you cause why had you one spark of decency left you would allow me to depart and shield me from the law you have invoked to ruin me i have hoped for your own sakes that you would be moved so to do but since you will not he paused and shrugged on your own heads be it  on our own heads be what demanded rotherby  but mr caryll smiled and shook his head did you know all it might indeed influence your decision and i would not have that happen you have chosen have you not rotherby you will sell me you will hang meme your fathers son poor rotherby from my soul i pity you  pity me death you impudent rogue keep your pity for those that need it  that is why i offer it you rotherby said mr caryll almost sadly in all my life i have not met a man who stood more sorely in need of it nor am i ever like to meet another  there was a movement without a tap at the door and humphries entered to announce mr greens return accompanied by mr second secretary templeton and without waiting for more he ushered them into the room     chapter xxii the hunters   to the amazement of them all there entered a tall gentleman in a fullbottomed wig with a long pale face a resolute mouth and a pair of eyes that were keen yet kindly close upon the heels of the second secretary came mr green humphries withdrew and closed the door  mr templeton made her ladyship a low bow  madam said he very gravely i offer your ladyshipand you my lordmy profoundest condolence in the bereavement you have suffered and my scarcely less profound excuses for this intrusion upon your grief  mr templeton may or may not have reflected that the grief upon which he deplored his intrusion was none so apparent  i had not ventured to do so he continued but that your lordship seemed to invite my presence  invited it sir questioned rotherby with deference i should scarcely have presumed so far as to invite it  not directly perhaps returned the second secretary his was a deep rich voice and he spoke with great deliberateness as if considering well each word before allowing it utterance not directly perhaps but in view of your message to lord carteret his lordship has desired me to come in person to inquire into this matter for him before proceeding farther this fellow indicating green brought information from you that a jacobitean agent of james stuartis being detained here and that your lordship has a communication to make to the secretary of state  rotherby bowed his assent all i desired that mr green should do meanwhile said he was to procure a warrant for this mans arrest my revelations would have followed that has he the warrant  your lordship may not be aware said mr templeton with an increased precision of diction that of late so many plots have been disclosed and have proved in the end to be no plots at all that his lordship has resolved to proceed now with the extremest caution for it is not held desirable by his majesty that publicity should be given to such matters until there can be no doubt that they are susceptible to proof talk of them is disturbing to the public quiet and there is already disturbance enough as it unfortunately happens therefore it is deemed expedient that we should make quite sure of our ground before proceeding to arrests  but this plot is no sham plot cried rotherby with the faintest show of heat out of patience with the others deliberateness it is a very real danger as i can prove to his lordship  it is for the purpose of ascertaining that fact resumed the second secretary entirely unruffled for the purpose of ascertaining it before taking any steps that would seem to acknowledge it that my lord carteret has desired me to wait upon youthat you may place me in possession of the circumstances that have come to your knowledge  rotherbys countenance betrayed his growing impatience why for that matter it has come to my knowledge that a plot is being hatched by the friends of the stuart and that a rising is being prepared the present moment being considered auspicious while the peoples confidence in the government is shaken by the late south sea company disaster  mr templeton wagged his head gently that sirif you will permit the observationis the preface of all the disclosures that have lately been made to us the consolation sir for his majestys friends has been that in no case did the subsequent matter make that preface good  it is in that particular then that my disclosures shall differ from those others said rotherby in a tone that caused mr templeton afterwards to describe him as a damned hot fellow  you have evidence  documentary evidence a letter from the pretender himself amongst it  a becoming gravity overspread mr templetons clearcut face that would be indeed regrettable said he it was plain that whatever the second secretary might display when the plot was disclosed to him he would display none of that satisfaction upon which rotherby had counted to whom sir let me ask is this letter indited  to my late father answered his lordship  mr templeton made an exclamation whose significance was not quite clear  i have discovered it since his death continued rotherby i was but in time to wrest it from the hands of that spy of the pretenders who was in the act of destroying it when i caught him my devotion to his majesty made my course clear sirand i desired mr green to procure a warrant for this traitors arrest  sir said mr templeton regarding him with an eye in which astonishment was blent with admiration this is very loyal in youvery loyal under theahpeculiar circumstances of the affair i do not think that his majestys government considering to whom this letter was addressed could have censured you even had you suppressed it you have conducted yourself my lordif i may venture upon a criticism of your lordships conductwith a patriotism worthy of the best models of ancient rome and i am assured that his majestys government will not be remiss in signifying appreciation of this very lofty loyalty of yours  lord rotherby bowed low in acknowledgment of the compliment her ladyship concealed a cynical smile under cover of her fan mr caryllstanding in the background beside hortensias chairsmiled too and poor hortensia detecting his smile sought to take comfort in it  my son interposed the countess is i am sure gratified to hear you so commend his conduct  mr templeton bowed to her with a great politeness i should be a stone maam did i not signify myahappreciation of it  there is a little more to follow sir put in mr caryll in that quiet manner of his i think you will find it blunt the edge of his lordships lofty loyaltycause it to savor less like the patriotism of rome and more like that of israel  mr templeton turned upon him a face of cold displeasure he would have spoken but that whilst he was seeking words of a becoming gravity rotherby forestalled him  sir he exclaimed what i did i did though my ruin must have followed i know what this traitor has in mind he imagines i have a bargain to make but you must see sir that in no sense is it so for having already surrendered the facts it is too late now to attempt to sell them i am ready to yield up the letters that i have found no consideration could induce me to do other and yet sir i venture to hope that in return the government will be pleased to see that i have some claim upon my countrys recognition for the signal service i am rendering herand in rendering which i make a holocaust of my fathers honor  surely surely sir murmured mr templeton but his countenance told of a lessening enthusiasm in his lordships roman patriotism lord carteret i am sure would never permit so muchahdevotion to his majesty to go unrewarded  i only ask sirand i ask it for the sake of my fathers name which stands in unavoidable danger of being smirchedthat no further shame be heaped upon it than that which must result from the horror with which the discovery of this plot will inspire all rightthinking subjects  mr caryll smiled and nodded he judged in a detached spirita mere spectator at a playand he was forced to admit to himself that it was subtly done of his brother and showed an astuteness in this thing at least of which he had never supposed him capable  there is sir rotherby proceeded the matter of my fathers dealings with the south sea company he is no longer alive to defend himself from the accusationsfrom the impeachment which has been levelled against him by our enemy the duke of wharton therefore it might be possible to make it appear as if his dealings wereahnotahquite such as should befit an upright gentleman there is that and there is this greater matter against him between the two i should never again be able to look my fellowcountrymen in the face yet this is the more important since the safety of the kingdom is involved whilst the other is but a personal affair and trivial by comparison  i will beg sir that out of consideration for my disclosing this dastardly conspiracywhich i cannot do without disclosing my fathers misguided share in iti will implore sir that out of that consideration lord carteret will see fit to dispose that the south sea company affair is allowed to be forgotten it has already been paid for by my father with his life  mr templeton looked at the young man before him with eyes of real commiseration he was entirely duped and in his heart he regretted that for a moment he could have doubted rotherbys integrity of purpose  sir he said i offer you my sympathymy profoundest sympathy and you my lady  as for this south sea company affair welli am empowered by lord carteret to treat only of the other matter and to issue or not a warrant for the apprehension of the person you are detaining after i have investigated the grounds upon which his arrest is urged nevertheless sir i think i can sayindeed i think i can promisethat in consideration of your readiness to deliver up these letters and provided their nature is as serious as you represent and also in consideration of this your most signal proof of loyalty lord carteret will not wish to increase the load which already you have to bear  oh sir cried rotherby in the deepest emotion i have no words in which to express my thanks  nor i put in mr caryll words in which to express my admiration a most excellent performance rotherby i had not credited you with so much ability  mr templeton frowned upon him again ye betray a singular callousness sir said he  nay sir not callousness merely the ease that springs from a tranquil conscience  her ladyship glanced across at him and sneered audibly you hear the poisonous traitor sir he glories in a tranquil conscience in spite of this murderous matter to which he stood committed  rotherby turned aside to take the letters from the desk he thrust them into mr templetons hands here sir is a letter from king james to my father and here is a letter from my father to king james from their contents you will gather how far advanced are matters what devilries are being hatched here in his majestys dominions  mr templeton received them and crossed to the window that he might examine them his countenance lengthened rotherby took his stand beside his mothers chair both observing mr caryll who in his turn was observing mr templeton a faint smile playing round the corners of his mouth once they saw him stoop and whisper something in hortensias ear and they caught the upward glance of her eyes half fear half question  mr green by the door stood turning his hat in his hands furtively watching everybody whilst drawing no attention to himselfa matter in which much practice had made him perfect  at last templeton turned folding the letters this is very grave my lord said he and my lord carteret will no doubt desire to express in person his gratitude and his deep sense of the service you have done him i think you may confidently expect to find him as generous as you hope  he pocketed the letters and raised a hand to point at mr caryll this man he inquired laconically  is a spy of king jamess he is the messenger who bore my father that letter from the pretender and he would no doubt have carried back the answer had my father lived  mr templeton drew a paper from his pocket and crossed to the desk he sat down and took up a quill you can prove this of course he said testing the point of his quill upon his thumbnail  abundantly was the ready answer my mother can bear witness to the fact that twas he brought the pretenders letter and there is no lack of corroboration enough i think would be afforded by the assault made by this rogue upon mr green of which no doubt you are already informed sir his objectthis proved objectwas to possess himself of those papers that he might destroy them i but caught him in time as my servants can bear witness as they can also bear witness to the circumstance that we were compelled to force an entrance here and to use force to him to obtain the letters from him  mr templeton nodded tis a clear case then said he and dipped his pen  and yet put in mr caryll in an indolent musing voice it might be made to look as clear another way  mr templeton scowled at him the opportunity shall be afforded you said he meanwhilewhat is your name  mr caryll looked whimsically at the secretary a moment then flung his bomb i am justin caryll sixth earl of ostermore and your very humble servant mr secretary  the effect was ludicrousfrom mr carylls point of viewand yet it was disappointing five pairs of dilating eyes confronted him five gaping mouths then her ladyship broke into a laugh  the creatures madive long suspected it and she meant to be taken literally his many whimsicalities were explained to her at last he was indeed halfwitted as he now proved  mr templeton recovering smote the table angrily he thought he had good reason to lose his selfcontrol on this occasion though it was a matter of pride with him that he could always preserve an unruffled calm under the most trying circumstances what is your name sir he demanded again  you are hard of hearing sir i think i am lord ostermore set down that name in the warrant if you are determined to be bubbled by that fellow there and made to look foolish afterwards with my lord carteret  mr templeton sat back in his chair frowning but more from utter bewilderment now than anger  perhaps said mr caryll if i were to explain it would help you to see the imposture that is being practiced upon you as for the allegations that have been made against methat i am a jacobite spy and an agent of the pretenders he shrugged and waved an airy hand i scarce think there will remain the need for me to deny them when you have heard the rest  rotherby took a step forward his face purple his hands clenched her ladyship thrust out a bony claw clutched at his sleeve and drew him back and into the chair beside her pho charles she said give the fool rope and hell hang himself never doubt itthe poor witless creature  mr caryll sauntered over to the secretaire and leaned an elbow on the top of it facing all in the room  i admit mr secretary said he that i had occasion to assault mr green to the end that i might possess myself of the papers he was seeking in this desk  why then began mr templeton  patience sir i admit so much but i admit no more i do not for instance admit that the objectthe object itselfof my search was such as has been represented  what then what else growled rotherby  ay sirwhat else quoth mr templeton  sir said mr caryll with a sorrowful shake of the head i have already startled you it seems by one statement i beg that you will prepare yourself to be startled by another then he abruptly dropped his languor i should think twice sir he advised before signing that warrant were i in your place to do so would be to render yourself the tool of those who are plotting my ruin and ready to bear false witness that they may accomplish it i refer and he waved a hand towards the countess and his brother to the late lord ostermores mistress and his natural son there  in their utter stupefaction at the unexpectedness and seeming wildness of the statement neither mother nor son could find a word to say no more could mr templeton for a moment then suddenly wrathfully what are you saying sir he roared  the truth sir  the truth echoed the secretary  ay sirthe truth have ye never heard of it  mr templeton sat back again i begin to think said he surveying through narrowing eyes the slender graceful figure before him that her ladyship is right that you are mad unlessunless you are mad of the same madness that beset ulysses you remember  let us have done cried rotherby in a burst of anger leaping to his feet let us have done i say are we to waste the day upon this tom o bedlam write him down as carylljustin carylltis the name hes known by and let green see to the rest  mr templeton made an impatient sound and poised his pen  ye are not to suppose sir mr caryll stayed him that i cannot support my statements i have by me proofsirrefragable proofs of what i say  proofs the word seemed to come from every member of that little assemblyif we except mr green whose face was beginning to betray his uneasiness he was not so ready as the others to believe that mr caryll was mad for him the situation asked some other explanation  ayproofs said mr caryll he had drawn the case from his pocket again from this he took the birthcertificate and placed it before mr templeton will you glance at that sirto begin with  mr templeton complied his face became more and more grave he looked at mr caryll then at rotherby who was scowling and at her ladyship who was breathing hard his glance returned to mr caryll  you are the person designated here he inquired  as i can abundantly prove said mr caryll i have no lack of friends in london who will bear witness to that much  yet said mr templeton frowning perplexed this does not make you what you claim to be rather does it show you to be his late lordships  theres more to come said mr caryll and placed another document before the secretary it was an extract from the register of st etienne of maligny relating to his mothers death  do you know sir in what year this lady went through a ceremony of marriage with my fatherthe late lord ostermore it was in 1690 i think as the lady will no doubt confirm  to what purpose this quoth mr templeton  the purpose will be presently apparent observe that date said mr caryll and he pointed to the document in mr templetons hand  mr templeton read the date aloud1692and then the name of the deceasedantoinette de beaulieu de maligny what of it he demanded  you will understand that when i show you the paper i took from this desk the paper that i obtained as a consequence of my violence to mr green i think you will consider sir that if ever the end justified the means it did so in this case here was something very different from the paltry matter of treason that is alleged against me  and he passed the secretary a third paper  over mr templetons shoulder rotherby and his mother whodrawn by the overpowering excitement that was mastering themhad approached in silence were examining the document with wideopen startled eyes fearing by very instinct without yet apprehending the true nature of the revelation that was to come  god shrieked her ladyship who took in the meaning of this thing before rotherby had begun to suspect it tis a forgery  that were idle when the original entry in the register is to be seen in the church of st antoine madam answered mr caryll i rescued that document together with some letters which my mother wrote my father when first he returned to englandand which are superfluous nowfrom a secret drawer in that desk an hour ago  but what is it inquired rotherby huskily what is it  it is the certificate of the marriage of my father the late lord ostermore and my mother antoinette de maligny at the church of st antoine in paris in the year 1689 he turned to mr templeton you apprehend the matter sir he demanded and recapitulated in 1689 they were married in 1692 she died yet in 1690 his lordship went through a form of marriage with mistress sylvia etheridge there  mr templeton nodded very gravely his eyes upon the document before him that they might avoid meeting at that moment the eyes of the woman whom the world had always known as the countess of ostermore  fortunate is it for me said mr caryll that i should have possessed myself of these proofs in time does it need more to show how urgent might be the need for my suppressionhow little faith can be attached to an accusation levelled against me from such a quarter  by god began rotherby but his mother clutched his wrist  be still fool she hissed in his ear she had need to keep her wits about her to think to weigh each word that she might utter an abyss had opened in her path a false step and she and her son were irrevocably lostsent headlong to destruction rotherby already reduced to the last stage of fear was obedient as he had never been and fell silent instantly  mr templeton folded the papers rose and proffered them to their owner have you any means of proving that this was the document you sought he inquired  i can prove that it was the document he found it was hortensia who spoke she had advanced to her lovers side and she controlled her amazement to bear witness for him i was present in this room when he went through that desk as all in the house know and i can swear to his having found that paper in it  mr templeton bowed my lord he said to caryll your contentions appear clear it is a matter in which i fear i can go no further nor do i now think that the secretary of state would approve of my issuing a warrant upon such testimony as we have received the matter is one for lord carteret himself  i shall do myself the honor of waiting upon his lordship within the hour said the new lord ostermore as for the letter which it is alleged i brought from francefrom the pretenderhe was smiling now a regretful deprecatory smile it is a fortunate circumstance that being suspected by that very man green who stands yonder i was subjected upon my arrival in england to a thorough search at maidstonea search it goes without saying that yielded nothing i was angry at the time at the indignity i was forced to endure we little know what the future may hold and today i am thankful to have that evidence to rebut this charge  your lordship is indeed to be congratulated mr templeton agreed you are thus in a position to clear yourself of even a shadow of suspicion  you fool cried she who until that hour had been countess of ostermore turning fiercely upon mr templeton you fool  madam this is not seemly cried the second secretary with awkward dignity  seemly idiot she stormed at him i swear as ive a soul to be saved that in spite of all this i know that man to be a traitor and a jacobitethat it was the letter from the king he sought whatever he may pretend to have found  mr templeton looked at her in sorrow for all that in her overwrought condition she insulted him madam you might swear and swear and yet no one would believe you in the face of the facts that have come to light  do you believe me she demanded angrily  my beliefs can matter nothing he compromised and made her a valedictory bow your servant maam said he from force of habit he nodded to rotherby took up his hat and cane and strode to the door which mr green had made haste to open for him from the threshold he bowed to mr caryll my lord said he i shall go straight to lord carteret he will stay for you till you come  i shall not keep his lordship waiting answered caryll and bowed in his turn  the second secretary went out mr green hesitated a moment then abruptly followed him the game was ended here it was played and lost he saw and what should such as mr green be doing on the losing side     chapter xxiii the lion   the game was played and lost all realized it and none so keenly as hortensia who found it in her gentle heart to pity the woman who had never shown her a kindness  she set a hand upon her lovers arm what will you do justin she inquired in tones that seemed to plead for mercy for those others for she had not paused to thinkas another might have thoughtthat there was no mercy he could show them  rotherby and his mother stood hand in hand it was the woman who had clutched at her son for comfort and support in this bitter hour of retribution this hour of the recoil upon themselves of all the evil they had plotted  mr caryll considered them a moment his face a mask his mind entirely detached they interested him profoundly this subjugation of two natures that in themselves were arrogant and cruel was a process very engrossing to observe he tried to conjecture what they felt what thoughts they might be harboring and it seemed to him that a sort of paralysis had fallen on their wits they were stunned under the shock of the blow he had dealt them anon there would be railings and to spareagainst him against themselves against the dead man above stairs against fate and more besides for the present there was this horrid almost vacuous calm  presently the woman stirred instinctthe instinct of the stricken beast to creep to hidingmoved her while reason was still bound in lethargy she moved to step drawing at her sons hand come charles she said in a low hoarse voice come  the touch and the speech awakened him to life no he cried harshly and shook his hand free of hers it ends not thus  he looked almost as he would fling himself upon his brother his figure erect now defiant and menacing his face ashen his eyes wild it ends not thus he repeated and his voice rang sinister  no mr caryll agreed quietly it ends not thus  he looked sadly from son to mother it had not even begun thus but that you would have it so you would have it i sought to move you to mercy i reminded you my brother of the tie that bound us and i would have turned you from fratricide i would have saved you from the crime you meditatedfor it was a crime  fratricide exclaimed rotherby and laughed angrily fratricide it was as if he threatened it  but mr caryll continued to regard him sorrowfully from his soul he pitied him pitied them bothnot because of their condition but because of the soullessness behind it all to him it was truly tragic tragic beyond anything that he had ever known  you said some fine things sir to mr templeton of your regard for your fathers memory said mr caryll you expressed some lofty sentiments of filial piety which almost sounded truewhich sounded true indeed to mr templeton it was out of interest for your father that you pleaded for the suppression of his dealings with the south sea company not for a moment did you consider yourself or the profit you should make from such suppression  why this demanded the mother fiercely do you rally us do you turn the sword in the wound now that you have us at your mercynow that we are fallen  from what are you fallen mr caryll inquired ah but let that pass i do not rally madam mockery is far indeed from my intention he turned again to rotherby lord ostermore was a father to you which he never was to meknew not that he was the sentiments you so beautifully expressed to mr templeton are the sentiments that actuate me now though i shall make no attempt to express them it is not that my heart stirs much where my lord ostermore is concerned and yet for the sake of the name that is mine now i shall leave england as i camemr justin caryll neither more nor less  in the eyes of the world there is no slur upon my mothers name because her historyher supposed historywas unknown see that none ever falls on it else shall you find me pitiless indeed see that none ever falls on it or i shall return and drive home the lesson that like antinous youve learntthat twixt the cup and lip much ill may growand turn you naked upon a contemptuous world needs more be said you understand i think  rotherby understood nothing but his mothers keener wits began to perceive a glimmer of the truth do you mean thatthat we are toto remain in the station that we believed our own  what else  she stared at him here was a generosity so weak it seemed to her as almost to provoke her scorn you will leave your brother in possession of the title and what else there may be  you think me generous madam said he do not misapprehend me i am not i covet neither the title nor estates of ostermore their possession would be a thorn in my flesh a thorn of bitter memory that is one reason why you should not think me generous though it is not the reason why i cede them i would have you understand me on this perhaps the last time that we may meet  lord ostermore my father married you madam in good faith  she interrupted harshly what ist you say she almost screamed quivering with rage at the very thought of what her dead lord had done  he married you in good faith mr caryll repeated quietly impressively i will make it plain to you he married you believing that the girlwife he had left in france was dead for fear it should come to his fathers knowledge he kept that marriage secret from all he durst not own his marriage to his father  he was notas you may have appreciated in the years you lived with hima man of any profound feeling for others for himself he had a prodigiously profound feeling as you may also have gathered that marriage in france was troublesome he had come to look upon it as one of his youths folliesas he himself described it to me in this house little knowing to whom he spoke when he received the false news of her deathfor he did receive such news from the very cousin who crossed from france to avenge her believing her dead himselfhe rejoiced at his near escape from the consequences of his folly nor was he ever disabused of his error for she had ceased to write to him by then and so he married you madam in good faith that is the argument i shall use with my lord carteret to make him understand that respect for my fathers memory urges me to depart in silencesave for what i must have said to escape the impeachment with which you threatened me  lord carteret is a man of the world he will understand the farreaching disturbance that must result from the disclosure of the truth of this affair he will pledge mr templeton to silence and the truth madam will never be disclosed that i think is all madam  by god sir cried rotherby thats damned handsome of you  you epitomize it beautifully said mr caryll with a reversion to his habitual manner  his mother however had no words at all she advanced a step towards mr caryll put out her hands and thenportent of portentstwo tears were seen to trickle down her cheeks playing havoc ploughing furrows in the paint that overlaid them  mr caryll stepped forward quickly the sight of those tears springing from that driedup heartwithered by god alone knew what blightwashing their way down those poor bedaubed cheeks moved him to a keener pity than anything he had ever looked upon he took her hands and pressed them a moment giving way for once to an impulse he could not master  she would have kissed his own in the abasement and gratitude of the moment but he restrained her  no more your ladyship said he and by thus giving her once more the title she had worn he seemed to reinstate her in the station from which in selfdefence he had pulled her down promise that youll bear no witness against me should so much be needed and ill cry quits with you without your testimony they cannot hurt me even though they were disposed to do so which is scarcely likely  sirsir she faltered brokenly could youcould you
