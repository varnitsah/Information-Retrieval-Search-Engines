57586454	what maisie knew  by  henry james        the litigation seemed interminable and had in fact been complicated but by the decision on the appeal the judgement of the divorcecourt was confirmed as to the assignment of the child the father who though bespattered from head to foot had made good his case was in pursuance of this triumph appointed to keep her it was not so much that the mothers character had been more absolutely damaged as that the brilliancy of a ladys complexion and this ladys in court was immensely remarked might be more regarded as showing the spots attached however to the second pronouncement was a condition that detracted for beale farange from its sweetnessan order that he should refund to his late wife the twentysix hundred pounds put down by her as it was called some three years before in the interest of the childs maintenance and precisely on a proved understanding that he would take no proceedings a sum of which he had had the administration and of which he could render not the least account the obligation thus attributed to her adversary was no small balm to idas resentment it drew a part of the sting from her defeat and compelled mr farange perceptibly to lower his crest he was unable to produce the money or to raise it in any way so that after a squabble scarcely less public and scarcely more decent than the original shock of battle his only issue from his predicament was a compromise proposed by his legal advisers and finally accepted by hers  his debt was by this arrangement remitted to him and the little girl disposed of in a manner worthy of the judgementseat of solomon she was divided in two and the portions tossed impartially to the disputants they would take her in rotation for six months at a time she would spend half the year with each this was odd justice in the eyes of those who still blinked in the fierce light projected from the tribunala light in which neither parent figured in the least as a happy example to youth and innocence what was to have been expected on the evidence was the nomination in loco parentis of some proper third person some respectable or at least some presentable friend apparently however the circle of the faranges had been scanned in vain for any such ornament so that the only solution finally meeting all the difficulties was save that of sending maisie to a home the partition of the tutelary office in the manner i have mentioned there were more reasons for her parents to agree to it than there had ever been for them to agree to anything and they now prepared with her help to enjoy the distinction that waits upon vulgarity sufficiently attested their rupture had resounded and after being perfectly insignificant together they would be decidedly striking apart had they not produced an impression that warranted people in looking for appeals in the newspapers for the rescue of the little onereverberation amid a vociferous public of the idea that some movement should be started or some benevolent person should come forward a good lady came indeed a step or two she was distantly related to mrs farange to whom she proposed that having children and nurseries wound up and going she should be allowed to take home the bone of contention and by working it into her system relieve at least one of the parents this would make every time for maisie after her inevitable six months with beale much more of a change  more of a change ida cried wont it be enough of a change for her to come from that low brute to the person in the world who detests him most  no because you detest him so much that youll always talk to her about him youll keep him before her by perpetually abusing him  mrs farange stared pray then am i to do nothing to counteract his villainous abuse of me  the good lady for a moment made no reply her silence was a grim judgement of the whole point of view poor little monkey she at last exclaimed and the words were an epitaph for the tomb of maisies childhood she was abandoned to her fate what was clear to any spectator was that the only link binding her to either parent was this lamentable fact of her being a ready vessel for bitterness a deep little porcelain cup in which biting acids could be mixed they had wanted her not for any good they could do her but for the harm they could with her unconscious aid do each other she should serve their anger and seal their revenge for husband and wife had been alike crippled by the heavy hand of justice which in the last resort met on neither side their indignant claim to get as they called it everything if each was only to get half this seemed to concede that neither was so base as the other pretended or to put it differently offered them both as bad indeed since they were only as good as each other the mother had wished to prevent the father from as she said so much as looking at the child the fathers plea was that the mothers lightest touch was simply contamination these were the opposed principles in which maisie was to be educatedshe was to fit them together as she might nothing could have been more touching at first than her failure to suspect the ordeal that awaited her little unspotted soul there were persons horrified to think what those in charge of it would combine to try to make of it no one could conceive in advance that they would be able to make nothing ill  this was a society in which for the most part people were occupied only with chatter but the disunited couple had at last grounds for expecting a time of high activity they girded their loins they felt as if the quarrel had only begun they felt indeed more married than ever inasmuch as what marriage had mainly suggested to them was the unbroken opportunity to quarrel there had been sides before and there were sides as much as ever for the sider too the prospect opened out taking the pleasant form of a superabundance of matter for desultory conversation the many friends of the faranges drew together to differ about them contradiction grew young again over teacups and cigars everybody was always assuring everybody of something very shocking and nobody would have been jolly if nobody had been outrageous the pair appeared to have a social attraction which failed merely as regards each other it was indeed a great deal to be able to say for ida that no one but beale desired her blood and for beale that if he should ever have his eyes scratched out it would be only by his wife it was generally felt to begin with that they were awfully goodlookingthey had really not been analysed to a deeper residuum they made up together for instance some twelve feet three of stature and nothing was more discussed than the apportionment of this quantity the sole flaw in idas beauty was a length and reach of arm conducive perhaps to her having so often beaten her exhusband at billiards a game in which she showed a superiority largely accountable as she maintained for the resentment finding expression in his physical violence billiards was her great accomplishment and the distinction her name always first produced the mention of notwithstanding some very long lines everything about her that might have been large and that in many women profited by the licence was with a single exception admired and cited for its smallness the exception was her eyes which might have been of mere regulation size but which overstepped the modesty of nature her mouth on the other hand was barely perceptible and odds were freely taken as to the measurement of her waist she was a person who when she was outand she was always outproduced everywhere a sense of having been seen often the sense indeed of a kind of abuse of visibility so that it would have been in the usual places rather vulgar to wonder at her strangers only did that but they to the amusement of the familiar did it very much it was an inevitable way of betraying an alien habit like her husband she carried clothes carried them as a train carries passengers people had been known to compare their taste and dispute about the accommodation they gave these articles though inclining on the whole to the commendation of ida as less overcrowded especially with jewellery and flowers beale farange had natural decorations a kind of costume in his vast fair beard burnished like a gold breastplate and in the eternal glitter of the teeth that his long moustache had been trained not to hide and that gave him in every possible situation the look of the joy of life he had been destined in his youth for diplomacy and momentarily attached without a salary to a legation which enabled him often to say in my time in the east but contemporary history had somehow had no use for him had hurried past him and left him in perpetual piccadilly every one knew what he hadonly twentyfive hundred poor ida who had run through everything had now nothing but her carriage and her paralysed uncle this old brute as he was called was supposed to have a lot put away the child was provided for thanks to a crafty godmother a defunct aunt of beales who had left her something in such a manner that the parents could appropriate only the income     i   the child was provided for but the new arrangement was inevitably confounding to a young intelligence intensely aware that something had happened which must matter a good deal and looking anxiously out for the effects of so great a cause it was to be the fate of this patient little girl to see much more than she at first understood but also even at first to understand much more than any little girl however patient had perhaps ever understood before only a drummerboy in a ballad or a story could have been so in the thick of the fight she was taken into the confidence of passions on which she fixed just the stare she might have had for images bounding across the wall in the slide of a magiclantern her little world was phantasmagoricstrange shadows dancing on a sheet it was as if the whole performance had been given for hera mite of a halfscared infant in a great dim theatre she was in short introduced to life with a liberality in which the selfishness of others found its account and there was nothing to avert the sacrifice but the modesty of her youth  her first term was with her father who spared her only in not letting her have the wild letters addressed to her by her mother he confined himself to holding them up at her and shaking them while he showed his teeth and then amusing her by the way he chucked them across the room bang into the fire even at that moment however she had a scared anticipation of fatigue a guilty sense of not rising to the occasion feeling the charm of the violence with which the stiff unopened envelopes whose big monogramsida bristled with monogramsshe would have liked to see were made to whizz like dangerous missiles through the air the greatest effect of the great cause was her own greater importance chiefly revealed to her in the larger freedom with which she was handled pulled hither and thither and kissed and the proportionately greater niceness she was obliged to show her features had somehow become prominent they were so perpetually nipped by the gentlemen who came to see her father and the smoke of whose cigarettes went into her face some of these gentlemen made her strike matches and light their cigarettes others holding her on knees violently jolted pinched the calves of her legs till she shriekedher shriek was much admiredand reproached them with being toothpicks the word stuck in her mind and contributed to her feeling from this time that she was deficient in something that would meet the general desire she found out what it was it was a congenital tendency to the production of a substance to which moddle her nurse gave a short ugly name a name painfully associated at dinner with the part of the joint that she didnt like she had left behind her the time when she had no desires to meet none at least save moddles who in kensington gardens was always on the bench when she came back to see if she had been playing too far moddles desire was merely that she shouldnt do that and she met it so easily that the only spots in that long brightness were the moments of her wondering what would become of her if on her rushing back there should be no moddle on the bench they still went to the gardens but there was a difference even there she was impelled perpetually to look at the legs of other children and ask her nurse if they were toothpicks moddle was terribly truthful she always said oh my dear youll not find such another pair as your own it seemed to have to do with something else that moddle often said you feel the strainthats where it is and youll feel it still worse you know  thus from the first maisie not only felt it but knew she felt it a part of it was the consequence of her fathers telling her he felt it too and telling moddle in her presence that she must make a point of driving that home she was familiar at the age of six with the fact that everything had been changed on her account everything ordered to enable him to give himself up to her she was to remember always the words in which moddle impressed upon her that he did so give himself your papa wishes you never to forget you know that he has been dreadfully put about if the skin on moddles face had to maisie the air of being unduly almost painfully stretched it never presented that appearance so much as when she uttered as she often had occasion to utter such words the child wondered if they didnt make it hurt more than usual but it was only after some time that she was able to attach to the picture of her fathers sufferings and more particularly to her nurses manner about them the meaning for which these things had waited by the time she had grown sharper as the gentlemen who had criticised her calves used to say she found in her mind a collection of images and echoes to which meanings were attachableimages and echoes kept for her in the childish dusk the dim closet the high drawers like games she wasnt yet big enough to play the great strain meanwhile was that of carrying by the right end the things her father said about her motherthings mostly indeed that moddle on a glimpse of them as if they had been complicated toys or difficult books took out of her hands and put away in the closet a wonderful assortment of objects of this kind she was to discover there later all tumbled up too with the things shuffled into the same receptacle that her mother had said about her father  she had the knowledge that on a certain occasion which every day brought nearer her mother would be at the door to take her away and this would have darkened all the days if the ingenious moddle hadnt written on a paper in very big easy words ever so many pleasures that she would enjoy at the other house these promises ranged from a mothers fond love to a nice poached egg to your tea and took by the way the prospect of sitting up ever so late to see the lady in question dressed in silks and velvets and diamonds and pearls to go out so that it was a real support to maisie at the supreme hour to feel how by moddles direction the paper was thrust away in her pocket and there clenched in her fist the supreme hour was to furnish her with a vivid reminiscence that of a strange outbreak in the drawingroom on the part of moddle who in reply to something her father had just said cried aloud you ought to be perfectly ashamed of yourselfyou ought to blush sir for the way you go on the carriage with her mother in it was at the door a gentleman who was there who was always there laughed out very loud her father who had her in his arms said to moddle my dear woman ill settle you presentlyafter which he repeated showing his teeth more than ever at maisie while he hugged her the words for which her nurse had taken him up maisie was not at the moment so fully conscious of them as of the wonder of moddles sudden disrespect and crimson face but she was able to produce them in the course of five minutes when in the carriage her mother all kisses ribbons eyes arms strange sounds and sweet smells said to her and did your beastly papa my precious angel send any message to your own loving mamma then it was that she found the words spoken by her beastly papa to be after all in her little bewildered ears from which at her mothers appeal they passed in her clear shrill voice straight to her little innocent lips he said i was to tell you from him she faithfully reported that youre a nasty horrid pig     ii   in that lively sense of the immediate which is the very air of a childs mind the past on each occasion became for her as indistinct as the future she surrendered herself to the actual with a good faith that might have been touching to either parent crudely as they had calculated they were at first justified by the event she was the little feathered shuttlecock they could fiercely keep flying between them the evil they had the gift of thinking or pretending to think of each other they poured into her little gravelygazing soul as into a boundless receptacle and each of them had doubtless the best conscience in the world as to the duty of teaching her the stern truth that should be her safeguard against the other she was at the age for which all stories are true and all conceptions are stories the actual was the absolute the present alone was vivid the objurgation for instance launched in the carriage by her mother after she had at her fathers bidding punctually performed was a missive that dropped into her memory with the dry rattle of a letter falling into a pillarbox like the letter it was as part of the contents of a wellstuffed postbag delivered in due course at the right address in the presence of these overflowings after they had continued for a couple of years the associates of either party sometimes felt that something should be done for what they called the real good dont you know of the child the only thing done however in general took place when it was sighingly remarked that she fortunately wasnt all the year round where she happened to be at the awkward moment and that furthermore either from extreme cunning or from extreme stupidity she appeared not to take things in  the theory of her stupidity eventually embraced by her parents corresponded with a great date in her small still life the complete vision private but final of the strange office she filled it was literally a moral revolution and accomplished in the depths of her nature the stiff dolls on the dusky shelves began to move their arms and legs old forms and phrases began to have a sense that frightened her she had a new feeling the feeling of danger on which a new remedy rose to meet it the idea of an inner self or in other words of concealment she puzzled out with imperfect signs but with a prodigious spirit that she had been a centre of hatred and a messenger of insult and that everything was bad because she had been employed to make it so her parted lips locked themselves with the determination to be employed no longer she would forget everything she would repeat nothing and when as a tribute to the successful application of her system she began to be called a little idiot she tasted a pleasure new and keen when therefore as she grew older her parents in turn announced before her that she had grown shockingly dull it was not from any real contraction of her little stream of life she spoiled their fun but she practically added to her own she saw more and more she saw too much it was miss overmore her first governess who on a momentous occasion had sown the seeds of secrecy sown them not by anything she said but by a mere roll of those fine eyes which maisie already admired moddle had become at this time after alternations of residence of which the child had no clear record an image faintly embalmed in the remembrance of hungry disappearances from the nursery and distressful lapses in the alphabet sad embarrassments in particular when invited to recognise something her nurse described as the important letter haitch miss overmore however hungry never disappeared this marked her somehow as of higher rank and the character was confirmed by a prettiness that maisie supposed to be extraordinary mrs farange had described her as almost too pretty and some one had asked what that mattered so long as beale wasnt there beale or no beale maisie had heard her mother reply i take her because shes a lady and yet awfully poor rather nice people but there are seven sisters at home what do people mean  maisie didnt know what people meant but she knew very soon all the names of all the sisters she could say them off better than she could say the multiplicationtable she privately wondered moreover though she never asked about the awful poverty of which her companion also never spoke food at any rate came up by mysterious laws miss overmore never like moddle had on an apron and when she ate she held her fork with her little finger curled out the child who watched her at many moments watched her particularly at that one i think youre lovely she often said to her even mamma who was lovely too had not such a pretty way with the fork maisie associated this showier presence with her now being big knowing of course that nurserygovernesses were only for little girls who were not as she said really little she vaguely knew further somehow that the future was still bigger than she and that a part of what made it so was the number of governesses lurking in it and ready to dart out everything that had happened when she was really little was dormant everything but the positive certitude bequeathed from afar by moddle that the natural way for a child to have her parents was separate and successive like her mutton and her pudding or her bath and her nap  does he know he liesthat was what she had vivaciously asked miss overmore on the occasion which was so suddenly to lead to a change in her life  does he know miss overmore stared she had a stocking pulled over her hand and was pricking at it with a needle which she poised in the act her task was homely but her movement like all her movements graceful  why papa  that he lies  thats what mamma says im to tell himthat he lies and he knows he lies miss overmore turned very red though she laughed out till her head fell back then she pricked again at her muffled hand so hard that maisie wondered how she could bear it am i to tell him the child went on it was then that her companion addressed her in the unmistakeable language of a pair of eyes of deep dark grey i cant say no they replied as distinctly as possible i cant say no because im afraid of your mamma dont you see yet how can i say yes after your papa has been so kind to me talking to me so long the other day smiling and flashing his beautiful teeth at me the time we met him in the park the time when rejoicing at the sight of us he left the gentlemen he was with and turned and walked with us stayed with us for half an hour somehow in the light of miss overmores lovely eyes that incident came back to maisie with a charm it hadnt had at the time and this in spite of the fact that after it was over her governess had never but once alluded to it on their way home when papa had quitted them she had expressed the hope that the child wouldnt mention it to mamma maisie liked her so and had so the charmed sense of being liked by her that she accepted this remark as settling the matter and wonderingly conformed to it the wonder now lived again lived in the recollection of what papa had said to miss overmore ive only to look at you to see youre a person i can appeal to for help to save my daughter maisies ignorance of what she was to be saved from didnt diminish the pleasure of the thought that miss overmore was saving her it seemed to make them cling together as in some wild game of going round     iii   she was therefore all the more startled when her mother said to her in connexion with something to be done before her next migration you understand of course that shes not going with you  maisie turned quite faint oh i thought she was  it doesnt in the least matter you know what you think mrs farange loudly replied and you had better indeed for the future miss learn to keep your thoughts to yourself this was exactly what maisie had already learned and the accomplishment was just the source of her mothers irritation it was of a horrid little critical system a tendency in her silence to judge her elders that this lady suspected her liking as she did for her own part a child to be simple and confiding she liked also to hear the report of the whacks she administered to mr faranges character to his pretensions to peace of mind the satisfaction of dealing them diminished when nothing came back the day was at hand and she saw it when she should feel more delight in hurling maisie at him than in snatching her away so much so that her conscience winced under the acuteness of a candid friend who had remarked that the real end of all their tugging would be that each parent would try to make the little girl a burden to the othera sort of game in which a fond mother clearly wouldnt show to advantage the prospect of not showing to advantage a distinction in which she held she had never failed begot in ida farange an ill humour of which several persons felt the effect she determined that beale at any rate should feel it she reflected afresh that in the study of how to be odious to him she must never give way nothing could incommode him more than not to get the good for the child of a nice female appendage who had clearly taken a fancy to her one of the things ida said to the appendage was that beales was a house in which no decent woman could consent to be seen it was miss overmore herself who explained to maisie that she had had a hope of being allowed to accompany her to her fathers and that this hope had been dashed by the way her mother took it she says that if i ever do such a thing as enter his service i must never expect to show my face in this house again so ive promised not to attempt to go with you if i wait patiently till you come back here we shall certainly be together once more  waiting patiently and above all waiting till she should come back there seemed to maisie a long way roundit reminded her of all the things she had been told first and last that she should have if shed be good and that in spite of her goodness she had never had at all then wholl take care of me at papas  heaven only knows my own precious miss overmore replied tenderly embracing her there was indeed no doubt that she was dear to this beautiful friend what could have proved it better than the fact that before a week was out in spite of their distressing separation and her mothers prohibition and miss overmores scruples and miss overmores promise the beautiful friend had turned up at her fathers the little lady already engaged there to come by the hour a fat dark little lady with a foreign name and dirty fingers who wore throughout a bonnet that had at first given her a deceptive air too soon dispelled of not staying long besides asking her pupil questions that had nothing to do with lessons questions that beale farange himself when two or three were repeated to him admitted to be awfully lowthis strange apparition faded before the bright creature who had braved everything for maisies sake the bright creature told her little charge frankly what had happenedthat she had really been unable to hold out she had broken her vow to mrs farange she had struggled for three days and then had come straight to maisies papa and told him the simple truth she adored his daughter she couldnt give her up shed make for her any sacrifice on this basis it had been arranged that she should stay her courage had been rewarded she left maisie in no doubt as to the amount of courage she had required some of the things she said made a particular impression on the childher declaration for instance that when her pupil should get older shed understand better just how dreadfully bold a young lady to do exactly what she had done had to be  fortunately your papa appreciates it he appreciates it immensely that was one of the things miss overmore also said with a striking insistence on the adverb maisie herself was no less impressed with what this martyr had gone through especially after hearing of the terrible letter that had come from mrs farange mamma had been so angry that in miss overmores own words she had loaded her with insultproof enough indeed that they must never look forward to being together again under mammas roof mammas roof however had its turn this time for the child of appearing but remotely contingent so that to reassure her there was scarce a need of her companions secret solemnly confidedthe probability there would be no going back to mamma at all it was miss overmores private conviction and a part of the same communication that if mr faranges daughter would only show a really marked preference she would be backed up by public opinion in holding on to him poor maisie could scarcely grasp that incentive but she could surrender herself to the day she had conceived her first passion and the object of it was her governess it hadnt been put to her and she couldnt or at any rate she didnt put it to herself that she liked miss overmore better than she liked papa but it would have sustained her under such an imputation to feel herself able to reply that papa too liked miss overmore exactly as much he had particularly told her so besides she could easily see it     iv   all this led her on but it brought on her fate as well the day when her mother would be at the door in the carriage in which maisie now rode on no occasions but these there was no question at present of miss overmores going back with her it was universally recognised that her quarrel with mrs farange was much too acute the child felt it from the first there was no hugging nor exclaiming as that lady drove her awaythere was only a frightening silence unenlivened even by the invidious enquiries of former years which culminated according to its stern nature in a still more frightening old woman a figure awaiting her on the very doorstep youre to be under this ladys care said her mother take her mrs wix she added addressing the figure impatiently and giving the child a push from which maisie gathered that she wished to set mrs wix an example of energy mrs wix took her and maisie felt the next day would never let her go she had struck her at first just after miss overmore as terrible but something in her voice at the end of an hour touched the little girl in a spot that had never even yet been reached maisie knew later what it was though doubtless she couldnt have made a statement of it these were things that a few days talk with mrs wix quite lighted up the principal one was a matter mrs wix herself always immediately mentioned she had had a little girl quite of her own and the little girl had been killed on the spot she had had absolutely nothing else in all the world and her affliction had broken her heart it was comfortably established between them that mrs wixs heart was broken what maisie felt was that she had been with passion and anguish a mother and that this was something miss overmore was not something strangely confusingly that mamma was even less  so it was that in the course of an extraordinarily short time she found herself as deeply absorbed in the image of the little dead clara matilda who on a crossing in the harrow road had been knocked down and crushed by the cruellest of hansoms as she had ever found herself in the family group made vivid by one of seven shes your little dead sister mrs wix ended by saying and maisie all in a tremor of curiosity and compassion addressed from that moment a particular piety to the small accepted acquisition somehow she wasnt a real sister but that only made her the more romantic it contributed to this view of her that she was never to be spoken of in that character to any one elseleast of all to mrs farange who wouldnt care for her nor recognise the relationship it was to be just an unutterable and inexhaustible little secret with mrs wix maisie knew everything about her that could be known everything she had said or done in her little mutilated life exactly how lovely she was exactly how her hair was curled and her frocks were trimmed her hair came down far below her waistit was of the most wonderful golden brightness just as mrs wixs own had been a long time before mrs wixs own was indeed very remarkable still and maisie had felt at first that she should never get on with it it played a large part in the sad and strange appearance the appearance as of a kind of greasy greyness which mrs wix had presented on the childs arrival it had originally been yellow but time had turned that elegance to ashes to a turbid sallow unvenerable white still excessively abundant it was dressed in a manner of which the poor lady appeared not yet to have recognised the supersession with a glossy braid like a large diadem on the top of the head and behind at the nape of the neck a dingy rosette like a large button she wore glasses which in humble reference to a divergent obliquity of vision she called her straighteners and a little ugly snuffcoloured dress trimmed with satin bands in the form of scallops and glazed with antiquity the straighteners she explained to maisie were put on for the sake of others whom as she believed they helped to recognise the bearing otherwise doubtful of her regard the rest of the melancholy garb could only have been put on for herself with the added suggestion of her goggles it reminded her pupil of the polished shell or corslet of a horrid beetle at first she had looked cross and almost cruel but this impression passed away with the childs increased perception of her being in the eyes of the world a figure mainly to laugh at she was as droll as a charade or an animal toward the end of the natural historya person whom people to make talk lively described to each other and imitated every one knew the straighteners every one knew the diadem and the button the scallops and satin bands every one though maisie had never betrayed her knew even clara matilda  it was on account of these things that mamma got her for such low pay really for nothing so much one day when mrs wix had accompanied her into the drawingroom and left her the child heard one of the ladies she found therea lady with eyebrows arched like skippingropes and thick black stitching like ruled lines for musical notes on beautiful white glovesannounce to another she knew governesses were poor miss overmore was unmentionably and mrs wix ever so publicly so neither this however nor the old brown frock nor the diadem nor the button made a difference for maisie in the charm put forth through everything the charm of mrs wixs conveying that somehow in her ugliness and her poverty she was peculiarly and soothingly safe safer than any one in the world than papa than mamma than the lady with the arched eyebrows safer even though so much less beautiful than miss overmore on whose loveliness as she supposed it the little girl was faintly conscious that one couldnt rest with quite the same tuckedin and kissedforgoodnight feeling mrs wix was as safe as clara matilda who was in heaven and yet embarrassingly also in kensal green where they had been together to see her little huddled grave it was from something in mrs wixs tone which in spite of caricature remained indescribable and inimitable that maisie before her term with her mother was over drew this sense of a support like a breasthigh banister in a place of drops that would never give way if she knew her instructress was poor and queer she also knew she was not nearly so qualified as miss overmore who could say lots of dates straight off letting you hold the book yourself state the position of malabar play six pieces without notes and in a sketch put in beautifully the trees and houses and difficult parts maisie herself could play more pieces than mrs wix who was moreover visibly ashamed of her houses and trees and could only with the help of a smutty forefinger of doubtful legitimacy in the field of art do the smoke coming out of the chimneys they dealt the governess and her pupil in subjects but there were many the governess put off from week to week and that they never got to at all she only used to say well take that in its proper order her order was a circle as vast as the untravelled globe she had not the spirit of adventurethe child could perfectly see how many subjects she was afraid of she took refuge on the firm ground of fiction through which indeed there curled the blue river of truth she knew swarms of stories mostly those of the novels she had read relating them with a memory that never faltered and a wealth of detail that was maisies delight they were all about love and beauty and countesses and wickedness her conversation was practically an endless narrative a great garden of romance with sudden vistas into her own life and gushing fountains of homeliness these were the parts where they most lingered she made the child take with her again every step of her long lame course and think it beyond magic or monsters her pupil acquired a vivid vision of every one who had ever in her phrase knocked against hersome of them oh so hardevery one literally but mr wix her husband as to whom nothing was mentioned save that he had been dead for ages he had been rather remarkably absent from his wifes career and maisie was never taken to see his grave     v   the second parting from miss overmore had been bad enough but this first parting from mrs wix was much worse the child had lately been to the dentists and had a term of comparison for the screwedup intensity of the scene it was dreadfully silent as it had been when her tooth was taken out mrs wix had on that occasion grabbed her hand and they had clung to each other with the frenzy of their determination not to scream maisie at the dentists had been heroically still but just when she felt most anguish had become aware of an audible shriek on the part of her companion a spasm of stifled sympathy this was reproduced by the only sound that broke their supreme embrace when a month later the arrangement as her periodical uprootings were called played the part of the horrible forceps embedded in mrs wixs nature as her tooth had been socketed in her gum the operation of extracting her would really have been a case for chloroform it was a hug that fortunately left nothing to say for the poor womans want of words at such an hour seemed to fall in with her want of everything maisies alternate parent in the outermost vestibulehe liked the impertinence of crossing as much as that of his late wifes thresholdstood over them with his open watch and his still more open grin while from the only corner of an eye on which something of mrs wixs didnt impinge the child saw at the door a brougham in which miss overmore also waited she remembered the difference when six months before she had been torn from the breast of that more spirited protectress miss overmore then also in the vestibule but of course in the other one had been thoroughly audible and voluble her protest had rung out bravely and she had declared that somethingher pupil didnt know exactly whatwas a regular wicked shame that had at the time dimly recalled to maisie the faraway moment of moddles great outbreak there seemed always to be shames connected in one way or another with her migrations at present while mrs wixs arms tightened and the smell of her hair was strong she further remembered how in pacifying miss overmore papa had made use of the words you dear old duckan expression which by its oddity had stuck fast in her young mind having moreover a place well prepared for it there by what she knew of the governess whom she now always mentally characterised as the pretty one she wondered whether this affection would be as great as before that would at all events be the case with the prettiness maisie could see in the face which showed brightly at the window of the brougham  the brougham was a token of harmony of the fine conditions papa would this time offer he had usually come for her in a hansom with a fourwheeler behind for the boxes the fourwheeler with the boxes on it was actually there but mamma was the only lady with whom she had ever been in a conveyance of the kind always of old spoken of by moddle as a private carriage papas carriage was now that he had one still more private somehow than mammas and when at last she found herself quite on top as she felt of its inmates and gloriously rolling away she put to miss overmore after another immense and talkative squeeze a question of which the motive was a desire for information as to the continuity of a certain sentiment did papa like you just the same while i was gone she enquiredfull of the sense of how markedly his favour had been established in her presence she had bethought herself that this favour might like her presence and as if depending on it be only intermittent and for the season papa on whose knee she sat burst into one of those loud laughs of his that however prepared she was seemed always like some trick in a frightening game to leap forth and make her jump before miss overmore could speak he replied why you little donkey when youre away what have i left to do but just to love her miss overmore hereupon immediately took her from him and they had a merry little scrimmage over her of which maisie caught the surprised perception in the white stare of an old lady who passed in a victoria then her beautiful friend remarked to her very gravely i shall make him understand that if he ever again says anything as horrid as that to you i shall carry you straight off and well go and live somewhere together and be good quiet little girls the child couldnt quite make out why her fathers speech had been horrid since it only expressed that appreciation which their companion herself had of old described as immense to enter more into the truth of the matter she appealed to him again directly asked if in all those months miss overmore hadnt been with him just as she had been before and just as she would be now of course she has old girlwhere else could the poor dear be cried beale farange to the still greater scandal of their companion who protested that unless he straightway took back his nasty wicked fib it would be this time not only him she would leave but his child too and his house and his tiresome troubleall the impossible things he had succeeded in putting on her beale under this frolic menace took nothing back at all he was indeed apparently on the point of repeating his extravagance but miss overmore instructed her little charge that she was not to listen to his bad jokes she was to understand that a lady couldnt stay with a gentleman that way without some awfully proper reason  maisie looked from one of her companions to the other this was the freshest gayest start she had yet enjoyed but she had a shy fear of not exactly believing them well what reason is proper she thoughtfully demanded  oh a longlegged stick of a tomboy theres none so good as that her father enjoyed both her drollery and his own and tried again to get possession of heran effort deprecated by their comrade and leading again to something of a public scuffle miss overmore declared to the child that she had been all the while with good friends on which beale farange went on she means good friends of mine you knowtremendous friends of mine there has been no end of them aboutthat i will say for her maisie felt bewildered and was afterwards for some time conscious of a vagueness just slightly embarrassing as to the subject of so much amusement and as to where her governess had really been she didnt feel at all as if she had been seriously told and no such feeling was supplied by anything that occurred later her embarrassment of a precocious instinctive order attached itself to the idea that this was another of the matters it was not for her as her mother used to say to go into therefore under her fathers roof during the time that followed she made no attempt to clear up her ambiguity by an ingratiating way with housemaids and it was an odd truth that the ambiguity itself took nothing from the fresh pleasure promised her by renewed contact with miss overmore the confidence looked for by that young lady was of the fine sort that explanation cant improve and she herself at any rate was a person superior to any confusion for maisie moreover concealment had never necessarily seemed deception she had grown up among things as to which her foremost knowledge was that she was never to ask about them it was far from new to her that the questions of the small are the peculiar diversion of the great except the affairs of her doll lisette there had scarcely ever been anything at her mothers that was explicable with a grave face nothing was so easy to her as to send the ladies who gathered there off into shrieks and she might have practised upon them largely if she had been of a more calculating turn everything had something behind it life was like a long long corridor with rows of closed doors she had learned that at these doors it was wise not to knockthis seemed to produce from within such sounds of derision little by little however she understood more for it befell that she was enlightened by lisettes questions which reproduced the effect of her own upon those for whom she sat in the very darkness of lisette was she not herself convulsed by such innocence in the presence of it she often imitated the shrieking ladies there were at any rate things she really couldnt tell even a french doll she could only pass on her lessons and study to produce on lisette the impression of having mysteries in her life wondering the while whether she succeeded in the air of shading off like her mother into the unknowable when the reign of miss overmore followed that of mrs wix she took a fresh cue emulating her governess and bridging over the interval with the simple expectation of trust yes there were matters one couldnt go into with a pupil there were for instance days when after prolonged absence lisette watching her take off her things tried hard to discover where she had been well she discovered a little but never discovered all there was an occasion when on her being particularly indiscreet maisie replied to herand precisely about the motive of a disappearanceas she maisie had once been replied to by mrs farange find out for yourself she mimicked her mothers sharpness but she was rather ashamed afterwards though as to whether of the sharpness or of the mimicry was not quite clear     vi   she became aware in time that this phase wouldnt have shone by lessons the care of her education being now only one of the many duties devolving on miss overmore a devolution as to which she was present at various passages between that lady and her fatherpassages significant on either side of dissent and even of displeasure it was gathered by the child on these occasions that there was something in the situation for which her mother might come down on them all though indeed the remark always dropped by her father was greeted on his companions part with direct contradiction such scenes were usually brought to a climax by miss overmores demanding with more asperity than she applied to any other subject in what position under the sun such a person as mrs farange would find herself for coming down as the months went on the little girls interpretations thickened and the more effectually that this stretch was the longest she had known without a break she got used to the idea that her mother for some reason was in no hurry to reinstate her that idea was forcibly expressed by her father whenever miss overmore differing and decided took him up on the question which he was always putting forward of the urgency of sending her to school for a governess miss overmore differed surprisingly far more for instance than would have entered into the bowed head of mrs wix she observed to maisie many times that she was quite conscious of not doing her justice and that mr farange equally measured and equally lamented this deficiency the reason of it was that she had mysterious responsibilities that interferedresponsibilities miss overmore intimated to mr farange himself and to the friendly noisy little house and those who came there mr faranges remedy for every inconvenience was that the child should be put at schoolthere were such lots of splendid schools as everybody knew at brighton and all over the place that however maisie learned was just what would bring her mother down from the moment he should delegate to others the housing of his little charge he hadnt a leg to stand on before the law didnt he keep her away from her mother precisely because mrs farange was one of these others  there was also the solution of a second governess a young person to come in by the day and really do the work but to this miss overmore wouldnt for a moment listen arguing against it with great public relish and wanting to know from all comersshe put it even to maisie herselfthey didnt see how frightfully it would give her away what am i supposed to be at all dont you see if im not here to look after her she was in a false position and so freely and loudly called attention to it that it seemed to become almost a source of glory the way out of it of course was just to do her plain duty but that was unfortunately what with his excessive his exorbitant demands on her which every one indeed appeared quite to understand he practically he selfishly prevented beale farange for miss overmore was now never anything but he and the house was as full as ever of lively gentlemen with whom under that designation she chaffingly talked about him maisie meanwhile as a subject of familiar gossip on what was to be done with her was left so much to herself that she had hours of wistful thought of the large loose discipline of mrs wix yet she none the less held it under her fathers roof a point of superiority that none of his visitors were ladies it added to this odd security that she had once heard a gentleman say to him as if it were a great joke and in obvious reference to miss overmore hanged if shell let another woman come near youhanged if she ever will shed let fly a stick at her as they do at a strange cat maisie greatly preferred gentlemen as inmates in spite of their also having their waylouder but sooner overof laughing out at her they pulled and pinched they teased and tickled her some of them even as they termed it shied things at her and all of them thought it funny to call her by names having no resemblance to her own the ladies on the other hand addressed her as you poor pet and scarcely touched her even to kiss her but it was of the ladies she was most afraid  she was now old enough to understand how disproportionate a stay she had already made with her father and also old enough to enter a little into the ambiguity attending this excess which oppressed her particularly whenever the question had been touched upon in talk with her governess oh you neednt worry she doesnt care miss overmore had often said to her in reference to any fear that her mother might resent her prolonged detention she has other people than poor little you to think about and has gone abroad with them so you neednt be in the least afraid shell stickle this time for her rights maisie knew mrs farange had gone abroad for she had had weeks and weeks before a letter from her beginning my precious pet and taking leave of her for an indeterminate time but she had not seen in it a renunciation of hatred or of the writers policy of asserting herself for the sharpest of all her impressions had been that there was nothing her mother would ever care so much about as to torment mr farange what at last however was in this connexion bewildering and a little frightening was the dawn of a suspicion that a better way had been found to torment mr farange than to deprive him of his periodical burden this was the question that worried our young lady and that miss overmores confidences and the frequent observations of her employer only rendered more mystifying it was a contradiction that if ida had now a fancy for waiving the rights she had originally been so hot about her late husband shouldnt jump at the monopoly for which he had also in the first instance so fiercely fought but when maisie with a subtlety beyond her years sounded this new ground her main success was in hearing her mother more freshly abused miss overmore had up to now rarely deviated from a decent reserve but the day came when she expressed herself with a vividness not inferior to beales own on the subject of the lady who had fled to the continent to wriggle out of her job it would serve this lady right maisie gathered if that contract in the shape of an overgrown and underdressed daughter should be shipped straight out to her and landed at her feet in the midst of scandalous excesses  the picture of these pursuits was what miss overmore took refuge in when the child tried timidly to ascertain if her father were disposed to feel he had too much of her she evaded the point and only kicked up all round it the dust of idas heartlessness and folly of which the supreme proof it appeared was the fact that she was accompanied on her journey by a gentleman whom to be painfully plain on it she hadwell picked up the terms on which unless they were married ladies and gentlemen might as miss overmore expressed it knock about together were the terms on which she and mr farange had exposed themselves to possible misconception she had indeed as has been noted often explained this before often said to maisie i dont know what in the world darling your father and i should do without you for you just make the difference as ive told you of keeping us perfectly proper the child took in the office it was so endearingly presented to her that she performed a comfort that helped her to a sense of security even in the event of her mothers giving her up familiar as she had grown with the fact of the great alternative to the proper she felt in her governess and her father a strong reason for not emulating that detachment at the same time she had heard somehow of little girlsof exalted rank it was truewhose education was carried on by instructors of the other sex and she knew that if she were at school at brighton it would be thought an advantage to her to be more or less in the hands of masters she turned these things over and remarked to miss overmore that if she should go to her mother perhaps the gentleman might become her tutor  the gentleman the proposition was complicated enough to make miss overmore stare  the one whos with mamma mightnt that make it rightas right as your being my governess makes it for you to be with papa  miss overmore considered she coloured a little then she embraced her ingenious friend youre too sweet im a real governess  and couldnt he be a real tutor  of course not hes ignorant and bad  bad maisie echoed with wonder  her companion gave a queer little laugh at her tone hes ever so much younger but that was all  younger than you  miss overmore laughed again it was the first time maisie had seen her approach so nearly to a giggle  younger thanno matter whom i dont know anything about him and dont want to she rather inconsequently added hes not my sort and im sure my own darling hes not yours and she repeated the free caress into which her colloquies with maisie almost always broke and which made the child feel that her affection at least was a gage of safety parents had come to seem vague but governesses were evidently to be trusted maisies faith in mrs wix for instance had suffered no lapse from the fact that all communication with her had temporarily dropped during the first weeks of their separation clara matildas mamma had repeatedly and dolefully written to her and maisie had answered with an enthusiasm controlled only by orthographical doubts but the correspondence had been duly submitted to miss overmore with the final effect of its not suiting her it was this ladys view that mr farange wouldnt care for it at all and she ended by confessingsince her pupil pushed herthat she didnt care for it herself she was furiously jealous she said and that weakness was but a new proof of her disinterested affection she pronounced mrs wixs effusions moreover illiterate and unprofitable she made no scruple of declaring it monstrous that a woman in her senses should have placed the formation of her daughters mind in such ridiculous hands maisie was well aware that the proprietress of the old brown dress and the old odd headgear was lower in the scale of form than miss overmore but it was now brought home to her with pain that she was educationally quite out of the question she was buried for the time beneath a conclusive remark of her critics shes really beyond a joke this remark was made as that charming woman held in her hand the last letter that maisie was to receive from mrs wix it was fortified by a decree proscribing the preposterous tie must i then write and tell her the child bewilderedly asked she grew pale at the dreadful things it appeared involved for her to say dont dream of it my dearill write you may trust me cried miss overmore who indeed wrote to such purpose that a hush in which you could have heard a pin drop descended upon poor mrs wix she gave for weeks and weeks no sign whatever of life it was as if she had been as effectually disposed of by miss overmores communication as her little girl in the harrow road had been disposed of by the terrible hansom her very silence became after this one of the largest elements of maisies consciousness it proved a warm and habitable air into which the child penetrated further than she dared ever to mention to her companions somewhere in the depths of it the dim straighteners were fixed upon her somewhere out of the troubled little current mrs wix intensely waited     vii   it quite fell in with this intensity that one day on returning from a walk with the housemaid maisie should have found her in the hall seated on the stool usually occupied by the telegraphboys who haunted beale faranges door and kicked their heels while in his room answers to their missives took form with the aid of smokepuffs and growls it had seemed to her on their parting that mrs wix had reached the last limits of the squeeze but she now felt those limits to be transcended and that the duration of her visitors hug was a direct reply to miss overmores veto she understood in a flash how the visit had come to be possiblethat mrs wix watching her chance must have slipped in under protection of the fact that papa always tormented in spite of arguments with the idea of a school had for a three days excursion to brighton absolutely insisted on the attendance of her adversary it was true that when maisie explained their absence and their important motive mrs wix wore an expression so peculiar that it could only have had its origin in surprise this contradiction indeed peeped out only to vanish for at the very moment that in the spirit of it she threw herself afresh upon her young friend a hansom crested with neat luggage rattled up to the door and miss overmore bounded out the shock of her encounter with mrs wix was less violent than maisie had feared on seeing her and didnt at all interfere with the sociable tone in which under her rivals eyes she explained to her little charge that she had returned for a particular reason a day sooner than she first intended she had left papain such nice lodgingsat brighton but he would come back to his dear little home on the morrow as for mrs wix papas companion supplied maisie in later converse with the right word for the attitude of this personage mrs wix stood up to her in a manner that the child herself felt at the time to be astonishing this occurred indeed after miss overmore had so far raised her interdict as to make a move to the diningroom where in the absence of any suggestion of sitting down it was scarcely more than natural that even poor mrs wix should stand up maisie at once enquired if at brighton this time anything had come of the possibility of a school to which much to her surprise miss overmore who had always grandly repudiated it replied after an instant but quite as if mrs wix were not there  it may be darling that something will come the objection i must tell you has been quite removed  at this it was still more startling to hear mrs wix speak out with great firmness i dont think if youll allow me to say so that theres any arrangement by which the objection can be removed what has brought me here today is that ive a message for maisie from dear mrs farange  the childs heart gave a great thump oh mammas come back  not yet sweet love but shes coming said mrs wix and she hasmost thoughtfully you knowsent me on to prepare you  to prepare her for what pray asked miss overmore whose first smoothness began with this news to be ruffled  mrs wix quietly applied her straighteners to miss overmores flushed beauty well miss for a very important communication  cant dear mrs farange as you so oddly call her make her communications directly cant she take the trouble to write to her only daughter the younger lady demanded maisie herself will tell you that its months and months since she has had so much as a word from her  oh but ive written to mamma cried the child as if this would do quite as well  that makes her treatment of you all the greater scandal the governess in possession promptly declared  mrs farange is too well aware said mrs wix with sustained spirit of what becomes of her letters in this house  maisies sense of fairness hereupon interposed for her visitor you know miss overmore that papa doesnt like everything of mammas  no one likes my dear to be made the subject of such language as your mothers letters contain they were not fit for the innocent child to see miss overmore observed to mrs wix  then i dont know what you complain of and shes better without them it serves every purpose that im in mrs faranges confidence  miss overmore gave a scornful laugh then you must be mixed up with some extraordinary proceedings  none so extraordinary cried mrs wix turning very pale as to say horrible things about the mother to the face of the helpless daughter  things not a bit more horrible i think miss overmore returned than those you madam appear to have come here to say about the father  mrs wix looked for a moment hard at maisie and then turning again to this witness spoke with a trembling voice i came to say nothing about him and you must excuse mrs farange and me if were not so above all reproach as the companion of his travels  the young woman thus described stared at the apparent breadth of the descriptionshe needed a moment to take it in maisie however gazing solemnly from one of the disputants to the other noted that her answer when it came perched upon smiling lips it will do quite as well no doubt if you come up to the requirements of the companion of mrs faranges  mrs wix broke into a queer laugh it sounded to maisie an unsuccessful imitation of a neigh thats just what im here to make knownhow perfectly the poor lady comes up to them herself she held up her head at the child you must take your mammas message maisie and you must feel that her wishing me to come to you with it this way is a great proof of interest and affection she sends you her particular love and announces to you that shes engaged to be married to sir claude  sir claude maisie wonderingly echoed but while mrs wix explained that this gentleman was a dear friend of mrs faranges who had been of great assistance to her in getting to florence and in making herself comfortable there for the winter she was not too violently shaken to perceive her old friends enjoyment of the effect of this news on miss overmore that young lady opened her eyes very wide she immediately remarked that mrs faranges marriage would of course put an end to any further pretension to take her daughter back mrs wix enquired with astonishment why it should do anything of the sort and miss overmore gave as an instant reason that it was clearly but another dodge in a system of dodges she wanted to get out of the bargain why else had she now left maisie on her fathers hands weeks and weeks beyond the time about which she had originally made such a fuss it was vain for mrs wix to representas she speciously proceeded to dothat all this time would be made up as soon as mrs farange returned she miss overmore knew nothing thank heaven about her confederate but was very sure any person capable of forming that sort of relation with the lady in florence would easily agree to object to the presence in his house of the fruit of a union that his dignity must ignore it was a game like another and mrs wixs visit was clearly the first move in it maisie found in this exchange of asperities a fresh incitement to the unformulated fatalism in which her sense of her own career had long since taken refuge and it was the beginning for her of a deeper prevision that in spite of miss overmores brilliancy and mrs wixs passion she should live to see a change in the nature of the struggle she appeared to have come into the world to produce it would still be essentially a struggle but its object would now be not to receive her  mrs wix after miss overmores last demonstration addressed herself wholly to the little girl and drawing from the pocket of her dingy old pelisse a small flat parcel removed its envelope and wished to know if that looked like a gentleman who wouldnt be nice to everybodylet alone to a person he would be so sure to find so nice mrs farange in the candour of newfound happiness had enclosed a cabinet photograph of sir claude and maisie lost herself in admiration of the fair smooth face the regular features the kind eyes the amiable air the general glossiness and smartness of her prospective stepfatheronly vaguely puzzled to suppose herself now with two fathers at once her researches had hitherto indicated that to incur a second parent of the same sex you had usually to lose the first isnt he sympathetic asked mrs wix who had clearly on the strength of his charming portrait made up her mind that sir claude promised her a future you can see i hope she added with much expression that hes a perfect gentleman maisie had never before heard the word sympathetic applied to anybodys face she heard it with pleasure and from that moment it agreeably remained with her she testified moreover to the force of her own perception in a small soft sigh of response to the pleasant eyes that seemed to seek her acquaintance to speak to her directly hes quite lovely she declared to mrs wix then eagerly irrepressibly as she still held the photograph and sir claude continued to fraternise oh cant i keep it she broke out no sooner had she done so than she looked up from it at miss overmore this was with the sudden instinct of appealing to the authority that had long ago impressed on her that she mustnt ask for things miss overmore to her surprise looked distant and rather odd hesitating and giving her time to turn again to mrs wix then maisie saw that ladys long face lengthen it was stricken and almost scared as if her young friend really expected more of her than she had to give the photograph was a possession that direly denuded she clung to and there was a momentary struggle between her fond clutch of it and her capability of every sacrifice for her precarious pupil with the acuteness of her years however maisie saw that her own avidity would triumph and she held out the picture to miss overmore as if she were quite proud of her mother isnt he just lovely she demanded while poor mrs wix hungrily wavered her straighteners largely covering it and her pelisse gathered about her with an intensity that strained its ancient seams  it was to me darling the visitor said that your mamma so generously sent it but of course if it would give you particular pleasure she faltered only gasping her surrender  miss overmore continued extremely remote if the photographs your property my dear i shall be happy to oblige you by looking at it on some future occasion but you must excuse me if i decline to touch an object belonging to mrs wix  that lady had by this time grown very red you might as well see him this way miss she retorted as you certainly never will i believe in any other keep the pretty picture by all means my precious she went on sir claude will be happy himself i dare say to give me one with a kind inscription the pathetic quaver of this brave boast was not lost on maisie who threw herself so gratefully on the speakers neck that when they had concluded their embrace the public tenderness of which she felt made up for the sacrifice she imposed their companion had had time to lay a quick hand on sir claude and with a glance at him or not whisk him effectually out of sight released from the childs arms mrs wix looked about for the picture then she fixed miss overmore with a hard dumb stare and finally with her eyes on the little girl again achieved the grimmest of smiles well nothing matters maisie because theres another thing your mamma wrote about she has made sure of me even after her loyal hug maisie felt a bit of a sneak as she glanced at miss overmore for permission to understand this but mrs wix left them in no doubt of what it meant she has definitely engaged mefor her return and for yours then youll see for yourself maisie on the spot quite believed she should but the prospect was suddenly thrown into confusion by an extraordinary demonstration from miss overmore  mrs wix said that young lady has some undiscoverable reason for regarding your mothers hold on you as strengthened by the fact that shes about to marry i wonder thenon that systemwhat our visitor will say to your fathers  miss overmores words were directed to her pupil but her face lighted with an irony that made it prettier even than ever before was presented to the dingy figure that had stiffened itself for departure the childs discipline had been bewilderinghad ranged freely between the prescription that she was to answer when spoken to and the experience of lively penalties on obeying that prescription this time nevertheless she felt emboldened for risks above all as something portentous seemed to have leaped into her sense of the relations of things she looked at miss overmore much as she had a way of looking at persons who treated her to grown up jokes do you mean papas hold on medo you mean hes about to marry  papas not about to marrypapa is married my dear papa was married the day before yesterday at brighton miss overmore glittered more gaily meanwhile it came over maisie and quite dazzlingly that her smart governess was a bride hes my husband if you please and im his little wife so now well see whos your little mother she caught her pupil to her bosom in a manner that was not to be outdone by the emissary of her predecessor and a few moments later when things had lurched back into their places that poor lady quite defeated of the last word had soundlessly taken flight     viii   after mrs wixs retreat miss overmore appeared to recognise that she was not exactly in a position to denounce ida faranges second union but she drew from a tabledrawer the photograph of sir claude and standing there before maisie studied it at some length  isnt he beautiful the child ingenuously asked  her companion hesitated nohes horrid she to maisies surprise sharply returned but she debated another minute after which she handed back the picture it appeared to maisie herself to exhibit a fresh attraction and she was troubled having never before had occasion to differ from her lovely friend so she only could ask what such being the case she should do with it should she put it quite awaywhere it wouldnt be there to offend on this miss overmore again cast about after which she said unexpectedly put it on the schoolroom mantelpiece  maisie felt a fear wont papa dislike to see it there  very much indeed but that wont matter now miss overmore spoke with peculiar significance and to her pupils mystification  on account of the marriage maisie risked  miss overmore laughed and maisie could see that in spite of the irritation produced by mrs wix she was in high spirits which marriage do you mean  with the question put to her it suddenly struck the child she didnt know so that she felt she looked foolish so she took refuge in saying shall you be different this was a full implication that the bride of sir claude would be  as your fathers wedded wife utterly miss overmore replied and the difference began of course in her being addressed even by maisie from that day and by her particular request as mrs beale it was there indeed principally that it ended for except that the child could reflect that she should presently have four parents in all and also that at the end of three months the staircase for a little girl hanging over banisters sent up the deepening rustle of more elaborate advances everything made the same impression as before mrs beale had very pretty frocks but miss overmores had been quite as good and if papa was much fonder of his second wife than he had been of his first maisie had foreseen that fondness had followed its development almost as closely as the person more directly involved there was little indeed in the commerce of her companions that her precocious experience couldnt explain for if they struck her as after all rather deficient in that air of the honeymoon of which she had so often heardin much detail for instance from mrs wixit was natural to judge the circumstance in the light of papas proved disposition to contest the empire of the matrimonial tie his honeymoon when he came back from brightonnot on the morrow of mrs wixs visit and not oddly till several days laterhis honeymoon was perhaps perceptibly tinged with the dawn of a later stage of wedlock there were things dislike of which as the child knew it wouldnt matter to mrs beale now and their number increased so that such a trifle as his hostility to the photograph of sir claude quite dropped out of view this pleasing object found a conspicuous place in the schoolroom which in truth mr farange seldom entered and in which silent admiration formed during the time i speak of almost the sole scholastic exercise of mrs beales pupil  maisie was not long in seeing just what her stepmother had meant by the difference she should show in her new character if she was her fathers wife she was not her own governess and if her presence had had formerly to be made regular by the theory of a humble function she was now on a footing that dispensed with all theories and was inconsistent with all servitude that was what she had meant by the drop of the objection to a school her small companion was no longer required at home asit was mrs beales own amusing worda little duenna the argument against a successor to miss overmore remained it was composed frankly of the fact of which mrs beale granted the full absurdity that she was too awfully fond of her stepdaughter to bring herself to see her in vulgar and mercenary hands the note of this particular danger emboldened maisie to put in a word for mrs wix the modest measure of whose avidity she had taken from the first but mrs beale disposed afresh and effectually of a candidate who would be sure to act in some horrible and insidious way for idas interest and who moreover was personally loathsome and as ignorant as a fish she made also no more of a secret of the awkward fact that a good school would be hideously expensive and of the further circumstance which seemed to put an end to everything that when it came to the point papa in spite of his previous clamour was really most nasty about paying would you believe mrs beale confidentially asked of her little charge that he says im a worse expense than ever and that a daughter and a wife together are really more than he can afford it was thus that the splendid school at brighton lost itself in the haze of larger questions though the fear that it would provoke ida to leap into the breach subsided with her prolonged her quite shameless nonappearance her daughter and her successor were therefore left to gaze in united but helpless blankness at all maisie was not learning  this quantity was so great as to fill the childs days with a sense of intermission to which even french lisette gave no accentwith finished games and unanswered questions and dreaded tests with the habit above all in her watch for a change of hanging over banisters when the doorbell sounded this was the great refuge of her impatience but what she heard at such times was a clatter of gaiety downstairs the impression of which from her earliest childhood had built up in her the belief that the grownup time was the time of real amusement and above all of real intimacy even lisette even mrs wix had never she felt in spite of hugs and tears been so intimate with her as so many persons at present were with mrs beale and as so many others of old had been with mrs farange the note of hilarity brought people together still more than the note of melancholy which was the one exclusively sounded for instance by poor mrs wix maisie in these days preferred none the less that domestic revels should be wafted to her from a distance she felt sadly unsupported for facing the inquisition of the drawingroom that was a reason the more for making the most of susan ash who in her quality of underhousemaid moved at a very different level and who none the less was much depended upon out of doors she was a guide to peregrinations that had little in common with those intensely definite airings that had left with the child a vivid memory of the regulated mind of moddle there had been under moddles system no dawdles at shopwindows and no nudges in oxford street of i say look at er there had been an inexorable treatment of crossings and a serene exemption from the fear thatespecially at corners of which she was yet weakly fondhaunted the housemaid the fear of being as she ominously said spoken to the dangers of the town equally with its diversions added to maisies sense of being untutored and unclaimed  the situation however had taken a twist when on another of her returns at susans side extremely tired from the pursuit of exercise qualified by much hovering she encountered another emotion she on this occasion learnt at the door that her instant attendance was requested in the drawingroom crossing the threshold in a cloud of shame she discerned through the blur mrs beale seated there with a gentleman who immediately drew the pain from her predicament by rising before her as the original of the photograph of sir claude she felt the moment she looked at him that he was by far the most shining presence that had ever made her gape and her pleasure in seeing him in knowing that he took hold of her and kissed her as quickly throbbed into a strange shy pride in him a perception of his making up for her fallen state for susans public nudges which quite bruised her and for all the lessons that in the dead schoolroom where at times she was almost afraid to stay alone she was bored with not having it was as if he had told her on the spot that he belonged to her so that she could already show him off and see the effect he produced no nothing else that was most beautiful ever belonging to her could kindle that particular joynot mrs beale at that very moment not papa when he was gay nor mamma when she was dressed nor lisette when she was new the joy almost overflowed in tears when he laid his hand on her and drew her to him telling her with a smile of which the promise was as bright as that of a christmastree that he knew her ever so well by her mother but had come to see her now so that he might know her for himself she could see that his view of this kind of knowledge was to make her come away with him and further that it was just what he was there for and had already been some time arranging it with mrs beale and getting on with that lady in a manner evidently not at all affected by her having on the arrival of his portrait thought of him so ill they had grown almost intimateor had the air of itover their discussion and it was still further conveyed to maisie that mrs beale had made no secret and would make yet less of one of all that it cost to let her go you seem so tremendously eager she said to the child that i hope youre at least clear about sir claudes relation to you it doesnt appear to occur to him to give you the necessary reassurance  maisie a trifle mystified turned quickly to her new friend why its of course that youre married to her isnt it  her anxious emphasis started them off as she had learned to call it this was the echo she infallibly and now quite resignedly produced moreover sir claudes laughter was an indistinguishable part of the sweetness of his being there weve been married my dear child three months and my interest in you is a consequence dont you know of my great affection for your mother in coming here its of course for your mother im acting  oh i know maisie said with all the candour of her competence she cant come herselfexcept just to the door then as she thought afresh cant she come even to the door now  there you are mrs beale exclaimed to sir claude she spoke as if his dilemma were ludicrous  his kind face in a hesitation seemed to recognise it but he answered the child with a frank smile nonot very well  because she has married you  he promptly accepted this reason well that has a good deal to do with it  he was so delightful to talk to that maisie pursued the subject but papahe has married miss overmore  ah youll see that he wont come for you at your mothers that lady interposed  yes but that wont be for a long time maisie hastened to respond  we wont talk about it nowyouve months and months to put in first and sir claude drew her closer  oh thats what makes it so hard to give her up mrs beale made this point with her arms out to her stepdaughter maisie quitting sir claude went over to them and clasped in a still tenderer embrace felt entrancingly the extension of the field of happiness ill come for you said her stepmother if sir claude keeps you too long we must make him quite understand that dont talk to me about her ladyship she went on to their visitor so familiarly that it was almost as if they must have met before i know her ladyship as if i had made her theyre a pretty pair of parents cried mrs beale  maisie had so often heard them called so that the remark diverted her but an instant from the agreeable wonder of this grand new form of allusion to her mother and that in its turn presently left her free to catch at the pleasant possibility in connexion with herself of a relation much happier as between mrs beale and sir claude than as between mamma and papa still the next thing that happened was that her interest in such a relation brought to her lips a fresh question  have you seen papa she asked of sir claude  it was the signal for their going off again as her small stoicism had perfectly taken for granted that it would be all that mrs beale had nevertheless to add was the vague apparent sarcasm oh papa  im assured hes not at home sir claude replied to the child but if he had been i should have hoped for the pleasure of seeing him  wont he mind your coming maisie asked as with need of the knowledge  oh you bad little girl mrs beale humorously protested  the child could see that at this sir claude though still moved to mirth coloured a little but he spoke to her very kindly thats just what i came to see you knowwhether your father would mind but mrs beale appears strongly of the opinion that he wont  this lady promptly justified that view to her stepdaughter it will be very interesting my dear you know to find out what it is today that your father does mind im sure i dont knowand she seemed to repeat though with perceptible resignation her plaint of a moment before your father darling is a very odd person indeed she turned with this smiling to sir claude but perhaps its hardly civil for me to say that of his not objecting to have you in the house if you knew some of the people he does have  maisie knew them all and none indeed were to be compared to sir claude he laughed back at mrs beale he looked at such moments quite as mrs wix in the long stories she told her pupil always described the lovers of her distressed beautiesthe perfect gentleman and strikingly handsome he got up to the childs regret as if he were going oh i dare say we should be all right  mrs beale once more gathered in her little charge holding her close and looking thoughtfully over her head at their visitor its so charmingfor a man of your typeto have wanted her so much  what do you know about my type sir claude laughed whatever it may be i dare say it deceives you the truth about me is simply that im the most unappreciated ofwhat do you call the fellowsfamilymen yes im a familyman upon my honour i am  then why on earth cried mrs beale didnt you marry a familywoman  sir claude looked at her hard you know who one marries i think besides there are no familywomenhanged if there are none of them want any childrenhanged if they do  his account of the matter was most interesting and maisie as if it were of bad omen for her stared at the picture in some dismay at the same time she felt through encircling arms her protectress hesitate you do come out with things but you mean her ladyship doesnt want anyreally  wont hear of themsimply but she cant help the one she has got and with this sir claudes eyes rested on the little girl in a way that seemed to her to mask her mothers attitude with the consciousness of his own she must make the best of her dont you see if only for the look of the thing dont you know one wants ones wife to take the proper line about her child  oh i know what one wants mrs beale cried with a competence that evidently impressed her interlocutor  well if you keep him upand i dare say youve had worry enoughwhy shouldnt i keep ida whats sauce for the goose is sauce for the ganderor the other way round dont you know i mean to see the thing through  mrs beale for a minute still with her eyes on him as he leaned upon the chimneypiece appeared to turn this over youre just a wonder of kindnessthats what you are she said at last a ladys expected to have natural feelings but your horrible sex isnt it a horrible sex little love she demanded with her cheek upon her stepdaughters  oh i like gentlemen best maisie lucidly replied  the words were taken up merrily thats a good one for you sir claude exclaimed to mrs beale  no said that lady ive only to remember the women she sees at her mothers  ah theyre very nice now sir claude returned  what do you call nice  well theyre all right  that doesnt answer me said mrs beale but i dare say you do take care of them that makes you more of an angel to want this job too and she playfully whacked her smaller companion  im not an angelim an old grandmother sir claude declared i like babiesi always did if we go to smash i shall look for a place as responsible nurse  maisie in her charmed mood drank in an imputation on her years which at another moment might have been bitter but the charm was sensibly interrupted by mrs beales screwing her round and gazing fondly into her eyes youre willing to leave me you wretch  the little girl deliberated even this consecrated tie had become as a cord she must suddenly snap but she snapped it very gently isnt it my turn for mamma  youre a horrible little hypocrite the less i think now said about turns the better mrs beale made answer i know whose turn it is youve not such a passion for your mother  i say i say do look out sir claude quite amiably protested  theres nothing she hasnt heard but it doesnt matterit hasnt spoiled her if you knew what it costs me to part with you she pursued to maisie  sir claude watched her as she charmingly clung to the child im so glad you really care for her thats so much to the good  mrs beale slowly got up still with her hands on maisie but emitting a soft exhalation well if youre glad that may help us for i assure you that i shall never give up any rights in her that i may consider ive acquired by my own sacrifices i shall hold very fast to my interest in her what seems to have happened is that she has brought you and me together  she has brought you and me together said sir claude  his cheerful echo prolonged the happy truth and maisie broke out almost with enthusiasm ive brought you and her together  her companions of course laughed anew and mrs beale gave her an affectionate shake you little monstertake care what you do but thats what she does do she continued to sir claude she did it to me and beale  well then he said to maisie you must try the trick at our place he held out his hand to her again will you come now  nowjust as i am she turned with an immense appeal to her stepmother taking a leap over the mountain of mending the abyss of packing that had loomed and yawned before her oh may i  mrs beale addressed her assent to sir claude as well so as any other way ill send on her things tomorrow then she gave a tug to the childs coat glancing at her up and down with some ruefulness  shes not turned out as i should likeher mother will pull her to pieces but whats one to dowith nothing to do it on and shes better than when she cameyou can tell her mother that im sorry to have to say it to youbut the poor child was a sight  oh ill turn her out myself the visitor cordially said  i shall like to see howmrs beale appeared much amused you must bring her to show mewe can manage that goodbye little fright and her last word to sir claude was that she would keep him up to the mark     ix   the idea of what she was to make up and the prodigious total it came to were kept well before maisie at her mothers these things were the constant occupation of mrs wix who arrived there by the back stairs but in tears of joy the day after her own arrival the process of making up as to which the good lady had an immense deal to say took through its successive phases so long that it heralded a term at least equal to the childs last stretch with her father this however was a fuller and richer time it bounded along to the tune of mrs wixs constant insistence on the energy they must both put forth there was a fine intensity in the way the child agreed with her that under mrs beale and susan ash she had learned nothing whatever the wildness of the rescued castaway was one of the forces that would henceforth make for a career of conquest the year therefore rounded itself as a receptacle of retarded knowledgea cup brimming over with the sense that now at least she was learning mrs wix fed this sense from the stores of her conversation and with the immense bustle of her reminder that they must cull the fleeting hour they were surrounded with subjects they must take at a rush and perpetually getting into the attitude of triumphant attack they had certainly no idle hours and the child went to bed each night as tired as from a long days play this had begun from the moment of their reunion begun with all mrs wix had to tell her young friend of the reasons of her ladyships extraordinary behaviour at the very first  it took the form of her ladyships refusal for three days to see her little girlthree days during which sir claude made hasty merry dashes into the schoolroom to smooth down the odd situation to say shell come round you know i assure you shell come round and a little even to compensate maisie for the indignity he had caused her to suffer there had never in the childs life been in all ways such a delightful amount of reparation it came out by his sociable admission that her ladyship had not known of his visit to her late husbands house and of his having made that persons daughter a pretext for striking up an acquaintance with the dreadful creature installed there heaven knew she wanted her child back and had made every plan of her own for removing her what she couldnt for the present at least forgive any one concerned was such an officious underhand way of bringing about the transfer maisie carried more of the weight of this resentment than even mrs wixs confidential ingenuity could lighten for her especially as sir claude himself was not at all ingenious though indeed on the other hand he was not at all crushed he was amused and intermittent and at moments most startling he impressed on his young companion with a frankness that agitated her much more than he seemed to guess that he depended on her not letting her mother when she should see her get anything out of her about anything mrs beale might have said to him he came in and out he professed in joke to take tremendous precautions he showed a positive disposition to romp he chaffed mrs wix till she was purple with the pleasure of it and reminded maisie of the reticence he expected of her till she set her teeth like an indian captive her lessons these first days and indeed for long after seemed to be all about sir claude and yet she never really mentioned to mrs wix that she was prepared under his inspiring injunction to be vainly tortured this lady however had formulated the position of things with an acuteness that showed how little she needed to be coached her explanation of everything that seemed not quite pleasantand if her own footing was perilous it met that danger as wellthat her ladyship was passionately in love maisie accepted this hint with infinite awe and pressed upon it much when she was at last summoned into the presence of her mother  there she encountered matters amid which it seemed really to help to give her a cluean almost terrifying strangeness full none the less after a little of reverberations of idas old fierce and demonstrative recoveries of possession they had been some time in the house together and this demonstration came late preoccupied however as maisie was with the idea of the sentiment sir claude had inspired and familiar in addition by mrs wixs anecdotes with the ravages that in general such a sentiment could produce she was able to make allowances for her ladyships remarkable appearance her violent splendour the wonderful colour of her lips and even the hard stare the stare of some gorgeous idol described in a storybook that had come into her eyes in consequence of a curious thickening of their already rich circumference her professions and explanations were mixed with eager challenges and sudden drops in the midst of which maisie recognised as a memory of other years the rattle of her trinkets and the scratch of her endearments the odour of her clothes and the jumps of her conversation she had all her old clever waymrs wix said it was aristocraticof changing the subject as she might have slammed the door in your face the principal thing that was different was the tint of her golden hair which had changed to a coppery red and with the head it profusely covered struck the child as now lifted still further aloft this picturesque parent showed literally a grander stature and a nobler presence things which with some others that might have been bewildering were handsomely accounted for by the romantic state of her affections it was her affections maisie could easily see that led ida to break out into questions as to what had passed at the other house between that horrible woman and sir claude but it was also just here that the little girl was able to recall the effect with which in earlier days she had practised the pacific art of stupidity this art again came to her aid her mother in getting rid of her after an interview in which she had achieved a hollowness beyond her years allowed her fully to understand she had not grown a bit more amusing  she could bear that she could bear anything that helped her to feel she had done something for sir claude if she hadnt told mrs wix how mrs beale seemed to like him she certainly couldnt tell her ladyship in the way the past revived for her there was a queer confusion it was because mamma hated papa that she used to want to know bad things of him but if at present she wanted to know the same of sir claude it was quite from the opposite motive she was awestruck at the manner in which a lady might be affected through the passion mentioned by mrs wix she held her breath with the sense of picking her steps among the tremendous things of life what she did however now after the interview with her mother impart to mrs wix was that in spite of her having had her good effect as she called itthe effect she studied the effect of harmless vacancyher ladyships last words had been that her ladyships duty by her would be thoroughly done over this announcement governess and pupil looked at each other in silent profundity but as the weeks went by it had no consequences that interfered gravely with the breezy gallop of making up her ladyships duty took at times the form of not seeing her child for days together and maisie led her life in great prosperity between mrs wix and kind sir claude mrs wix had a new dress and as she was the first to proclaim a better position so it all struck maisie as a crowded brilliant life with for the time mrs beale and susan ash simply left out like children not invited to a christmas party mrs wix had a secret terror which like most of her secret feelings she discussed with her little companion in great solemnity by the hour the possibility of her ladyships coming down on them in her sudden highbred way with a school but she had also a balm to this fear in a conviction of the strength of sir claudes grasp of the situation he was too pleaseddidnt he constantly say as muchwith the good impression made in a wide circle by idas sacrifices and he came into the schoolroom repeatedly to let them know how beautifully he felt everything had gone off and everything would go on  he disappeared at times for days when his patient friends understood that her ladyship would naturally absorb him but he always came back with the drollest stories of where he had been a wonderful picture of society and even with pretty presents that showed how in absence he thought of his home besides giving mrs wix by his conversation a sense that they almost themselves went out he gave her a fivepound note and the history of france and an umbrella with a malachite knob and to maisie both chocolatecreams and storybooks besides a lovely greatcoat which he took her out all alone to buy and ever so many games in boxes with printed directions and a bright red frame for the protection of his famous photograph the games were as he said to while away the evening hour and the evening hour indeed often passed in futile attempts on mrs wixs part to master what it said on the papers when he asked the pair how they liked the games they always replied oh immensely but they had earnest discussions as to whether they hadnt better appeal to him frankly for aid to understand them this was a course their delicacy shrank from they couldnt have told exactly why but it was a part of their tenderness for him not to let him think they had trouble what dazzled most was his kindness to mrs wix not only the fivepound note and the not forgetting her but the perfect consideration as she called it with an air to which her sounding of the words gave the only grandeur maisie was to have seen her wear save on a certain occasion hereafter to be described an occasion when the poor lady was grander than all of them put together he shook hands with her he recognised her as she said and above all more than once he took her with his stepdaughter to the pantomime and in the crowd coming out publicly gave her his arm when he met them in sunny piccadilly he made merry and turned and walked with them heroically suppressing his consciousness of the stamp of his company a heroism thatneedless for mrs wix to sound those wordsher ladyship though a bloodrelation was little enough the woman to be capable of even to the hard heart of childhood there was something tragic in such elation at such humanities it brought home to maisie the way her humble companion had sidled and ducked through life but it settled the question of the degree to which sir claude was a gentleman he was more of one than anybody else in the worldi dont care mrs wix repeatedly remarked whom you may meet in grand society nor even to whom you may be contracted in marriage there were questions that maisie never asked so her governess was spared the embarrassment of telling her if he were more of a gentleman than papa this was not moreover from the want of opportunity for there were no moments between them at which the topic could be irrelevant no subject they were going into not even the principal dates or the auxiliary verbs in which it was further off than the turn of the page the answer on the winter nights to the puzzle of cards and counters and little bewildering pamphlets was just to draw up to the fire and talk about him and if the truth must be told this edifying interchange constituted for the time the little girls chief education  it must also be admitted that he took them far further perhaps than was always warranted by the oldfashioned conscience the dingy decencies of maisies simple instructress there were hours when mrs wix sighingly testified to the scruples she surmounted seemed to ask what other line one could take with a young person whose experience had been as it were so peculiar it isnt as if you didnt already know everything is it love and i cant make you any worse than you are can i darlingthese were the terms in which the good lady justified to herself and her pupil her pleasant conversational ease what the pupil already knew was indeed rather taken for granted than expressed but it performed the useful function of transcending all textbooks and supplanting all studies if the child couldnt be worse it was a comfort even to herself that she was bada comfort offering a broad firm support to the fundamental fact of the present crisis the fact that mamma was fearfully jealous this was another side of the circumstance of mammas passion and the deep couple in the schoolroom were not long in working round to it it brought them face to face with the idea of the inconvenience suffered by any lady who marries a gentleman producing on other ladies the charming effect of sir claude that such ladies wouldnt be able to help falling in love with him was a reflexion naturally irritating to his wife one day when some accident some crash of a banged door or some scurry of a scared maid had rendered this truth particularly vivid maisie receptive and profound suddenly said to her companion and you my dear are you in love with him too even her profundity had left a margin for a laugh so she was a trifle startled by the solemn promptitude with which mrs wix plumped out over head and ears ive never since you ask me been so far gone  this boldness had none the less no effect of deterrence for her when a few days laterit was because several had elapsed without a visit from sir claudeher governess turned the tables may i ask you miss if you are mrs wix brought it out she could see with hesitation but clearly intending a joke why rather the child made answer as if in surprise at not having long ago seemed sufficiently to commit herself on which her friend gave a sigh of apparent satisfaction it might in fact have expressed positive relief everything was as it should be  yet it was not with them they were very sure that her ladyship was furious nor because she had forbidden it that there befell at last a periodsix months brought it roundwhen for days together he scarcely came near them he was off and ida was off and they were sometimes off together and sometimes apart there were seasons when the simple students had the house to themselves when the very servants seemed also to be off and dinner became a reckless forage in pantries and sideboards mrs wix reminded her disciple on such occasionshungry moments often when all the support of the reminder was requiredthat the real life of their companions the brilliant society in which it was inevitable they should move and the complicated pleasures in which it was almost presumptuous of the mind to follow them must offer features literally not to be imagined without being seen at one of these times maisie found her opening it out that though the difficulties were many it was mrs beale who had now become the chief then somehow it was brought fully to the childs knowledge that her stepmother had been making attempts to see her that her mother had deeply resented it that her stepfather had backed her stepmother up that the latter had pretended to be acting as the representative of her father and that her mother took the whole thing in plain terms very hard the situation was as mrs wix declared an extraordinary muddle to be sure her account of it brought back to maisie the happy vision of the way sir claude and mrs beale had made acquaintancean incident to which with her stepfather though she had had little to say about it to mrs wix she had during the first weeks of her stay at her mothers found more than one opportunity to revert as to what had taken place the day sir claude came for her she had been vaguely grateful to mrs wix for not attempting as her mother had attempted to put her through that was what sir claude had called the process when he warned her of it and again afterwards when he told her she was an awfully good chap for having foiled it then it was that well aware mrs beale hadnt in the least really given her up she had asked him if he remained in communication with her and if for the time everything must really be held to be at an end between her stepmother and herself this conversation had occurred in consequence of his one day popping into the schoolroom and finding maisie alone     x   he was smoking a cigarette and he stood before the fire and looked at the meagre appointments of the room in a way that made her rather ashamed of them then before on the subject of mrs beale he let her draw himthat was another of his words it was astonishing how many she gathered inhe remarked that really mamma kept them rather low on the question of decorations mrs wix had put up a japanese fan and two rather grim texts she had wished they were gayer but they were all she happened to have without sir claudes photograph however the place would have been as he said as dull as a cold dinner he had said as well that there were all sorts of things they ought to have yet governess and pupil it had to be admitted were still divided between discussing the places where any sort of thing would look best if any sort of thing should ever come and acknowledging that mutability in the childs career which was naturally unfavourable to accumulation she stayed long enough only to miss things not half long enough to deserve them the way sir claude looked about the schoolroom had made her feel with humility as if it were not very different from the shabby attic in which she had visited susan ash then he had said in abrupt reference to mrs beale do you think she really cares for you  oh awfully maisie had replied  but i mean does she love you for yourself as they call it dont you know is she as fond of you now as mrs wix  the child turned it over oh im not every bit mrs beale has  sir claude seemed much amused at this no youre not every bit she has  he laughed for some moments but that was an old story to maisie who was not too much disconcerted to go on but shell never give me up  well i wont either old boy so thats not so wonderful and shes not the only one but if shes so fond of you why doesnt she write to you  oh on account of mamma this was rudimentary and she was almost surprised at the simplicity of sir claudes question  i seethats quite right he answered she might get at youthere are all sorts of ways but of course theres mrs wix  theres mrs wix maisie lucidly concurred mrs wix cant abide her  sir claude seemed interested oh she cant abide her then what does she say about her  nothing at allbecause she knows i shouldnt like it isnt it sweet of her the child asked  certainly rather nice mrs beale wouldnt hold her tongue for any such thing as that would she  maisie remembered how little she had done so but she desired to protect mrs beale too the only protection she could think of however was the plea oh at papas you know they dont mind  at this sir claude only smiled no i dare say not but here we mind dont wewe take care what we say i dont suppose its a matter on which i ought to prejudice you he went on but i think we must on the whole be rather nicer here than at your fathers however i dont press that for its the sort of question on which its awfully awkward for you to speak dont worry at any rate i assure you ill back you up then after a moment and while he smoked he reverted to mrs beale and the childs first enquiry im afraid we cant do much for her just now i havent seen her since that dayupon my word i havent seen her the next instant with a laugh the least bit foolish the young man slightly coloured he must have felt this profession of innocence to be excessive as addressed to maisie it was inevitable to say to her however that of course her mother loathed the lady of the other house he couldnt go there again with his wifes consent and he wasnt the manhe begged her to believe falling once more in spite of himself into the scruple of showing the child he didnt tripto go there without it he was liable in talking with her to take the tone of her being also a man of the world he had gone to mrs beales to fetch away maisie but that was altogether different now that she was in her mothers house what pretext had he to give her mother for paying calls on her fathers wife and of course mrs beale couldnt come to idasida would tear her limb from limb maisie with this talk of pretexts remembered how much mrs beale had made of her being a good one and how for such a function it was her fate to be either much depended on or much missed sir claude moreover recognised on this occasion that perhaps things would take a turn later on and he wound up by saying im sure she does sincerely care for youhow can she possibly help it shes very young and very pretty and very clever i think shes charming but we must walk very straight if youll help me you know ill help you he concluded in the pleasant fraternising equalising not a bit patronising way which made the child ready to go through anything for him and the beauty of which as she dimly felt was that it was so much less a deceitful descent to her years than a real indifference to them  it gave her moments of secret rapturemoments of believing she might help him indeed the only mystification in this was the imposing time of life that her elders spoke of as youth for sir claude then mrs beale was young just as for mrs wix sir claude was that was one of the merits for which mrs wix most commended him what therefore was maisie herself and in another relation to the matter what therefore was mamma it took her some time to puzzle out with the aid of an experiment or two that it wouldnt do to talk about mammas youth she even went so far one day in the presence of that ladys thick colour and marked lines as to wonder if it would occur to any one but herself to do so yet if she wasnt young then she was old and this threw an odd light on her having a husband of a different generation mr farange was still olderthat maisie perfectly knew and it brought her in due course to the perception of how much more since mrs beale was younger than sir claude papa must be older than mrs beale such discoveries were disconcerting and even a trifle confounding these persons it appeared were not of the age they ought to be this was somehow particularly the case with mamma and the fact made her reflect with some relief on her not having gone with mrs wix into the question of sir claudes attachment to his wife she was conscious that in confining their attention to the state of her ladyships own affections they had been controlledmrs wix perhaps in especialby delicacy and even by embarrassment the end of her colloquy with her stepfather in the schoolroom was her saying then if were not to see mrs beale at all it isnt what she seemed to think when you came for me  he looked rather blank what did she seem to think  why that ive brought you together  she thought that sir claude asked  maisie was surprised at his already forgetting it just as i had brought papa and her dont you remember she said so  it came back to sir claude in a peal of laughter oh yesshe said so  and you said so maisie lucidly pursued  he recovered with increasing mirth the whole occasion and you said so he retorted as if they were playing a game  then were we all mistaken  he considered a little no on the whole not i dare say its just what you have done we are togetherits really most odd shes thinking of usof you and methough we dont meet and ive no doubt youll find it will be all right when you go back to her  am i going back to her maisie brought out with a little gasp which was like a sudden clutch of the happy present  it appeared to make sir claude grave a moment it might have made him feel the weight of the pledge his action had given oh some day i suppose weve plenty of time  ive such a tremendous lot to make up maisie said with a sense of great boldness  certainly and you must make up every hour of it oh ill see that you do  this was encouraging and to show cheerfully that she was reassured she replied thats what mrs wix sees too  oh yes said sir claude mrs wix and i are shoulder to shoulder  maisie took in a little this strong image after which she exclaimed then ive done it also to you and herive brought you together  blest if you havent sir claude laughed and more upon my word than any of the lot oh youve done for us now if you couldas i suggested you know that dayonly manage me and your mother  the child wondered bring you and her together  you see were not togethernot a bit but i oughtnt to tell you such things all the more that you wont really do itnot you no old chap the young man continued there youll break down but it wont matterwell rub along the great thing is that you and i are all right  were all right maisie echoed devoutly but the next moment in the light of what he had just said she asked how shall i ever leave you it was as if she must somehow take care of him  his smile did justice to her anxiety oh well you neednt it wont come to that  do you mean that when i do go youll go with me  sir claude cast about not exactly with you perhaps but i shall never be far off  but how do you know where mamma may take you  he laughed again i dont i confess then he had an idea though something too jocose that will be for you to seethat she shant take me too far  how can i help it maisie enquired in surprise mamma doesnt care for me she said very simply not really child as she was her little long history was in the words and it was as impossible to contradict her as if she had been venerable  sir claudes silence was an admission of this and still more the tone in which he presently replied that wont prevent her fromsome time or otherleaving me with you  then well live together she eagerly demanded  im afraid said sir claude smiling that that will be mrs beales real chance  her eagerness just slightly dropped at this she remembered mrs wixs pronouncement that it was all an extraordinary muddle to take me again well cant you come to see me there  oh i dare say  though there were parts of childhood maisie had lost she had all childhoods preference for the particular promise then you will comeyoull come often wont you she insisted while at the moment she spoke the door opened for the return of mrs wix sir claude hereupon instead of replying gave her a look which left her silent and embarrassed  when he again found privacy convenient howeverwhich happened to be long in cominghe took up their conversation very much where it had dropped you see my dear if i shall be able to go to you at your fathers it yet isnt at all the same thing for mrs beale to come to you here maisie gave a thoughtful assent to this proposition though conscious she could scarcely herself say just where the difference would lie she felt how much her stepfather saved her as he said with his habitual amusement the trouble of that i shall probably be able to go to mrs beales without your mothers knowing it  maisie stared with a certain thrill at the dramatic element in this and she couldnt come here without mammas she was unable to articulate the word for what mamma would do  my dear child mrs wix would tell of it  but i thought maisie objected that mrs wix and you  are such brothersinarmssir claude caught her up oh yes about everything but mrs beale and if you should suggest he went on that we might somehow or other hide her peeping in from mrs wix  oh i dont suggest that maisie in turn cut him short  sir claude looked as if he could indeed quite see why no it would really be impossible there came to her from this glance at what they might hide the first small glimpse of something in him that she wouldnt have expected there had been times when she had had to make the best of the impression that she was herself deceitful yet she had never concealed anything bigger than a thought of course she now concealed this thought of how strange it would be to see him hide and while she was so actively engaged he continued besides you know im not afraid of your father  and you are of my mother  rather old man sir claude returned     xi   it must not be supposed that her ladyships intermissions were not qualified by demonstrations of another ordertriumphal entries and breathless pauses during which she seemed to take of everything in the room from the state of the ceiling to that of her daughters boottoes a survey that was rich in intentions sometimes she sat down and sometimes she surged about but her attitude wore equally in either case the grand air of the practical she found so much to deplore that she left a great deal to expect and bristled so with calculation that she seemed to scatter remedies and pledges her visits were as good as an outfit her manner as mrs wix once said as good as a pair of curtains but she was a person addicted to extremessometimes barely speaking to her child and sometimes pressing this tender shoot to a bosom cut as mrs wix had also observed remarkably low she was always in a fearful hurry and the lower the bosom was cut the more it was to be gathered she was wanted elsewhere she usually broke in alone but sometimes sir claude was with her and during all the earlier period there was nothing on which these appearances had had so delightful a bearing as on the way her ladyship was as mrs wix expressed it under the spell but isnt she under it maisie used in thoughtful but familiar reference to exclaim after sir claude had swept mamma away in peals of natural laughter not even in the old days of the convulsed ladies had she heard mamma laugh so freely as in these moments of conjugal surrender to the gaiety of which even a little girl could see she had at last a righta little girl whose thoughtfulness was now all happy selfish meditation on good omens and future fun  unaccompanied in subsequent hours and with an effect of changing to meet a change ida took a tone superficially disconcerting and abruptthe tone of having at an immense cost made over everything to sir claude and wishing others to know that if everything wasnt right it was because sir claude was so dreadfully vague he has made from the first such a row about you she said on one occasion to maisie that ive told him to do for you himself and try how he likes itsee ive washed my hands of you ive made you over to him and if youre discontented its on him please youll come down so dont haul poor me upi assure you ive worries enough one of these visibly was that the spell rejoiced in by the schoolroom fire was already in danger of breaking another was that she was finally forced to make no secret of her husbands unfitness for real responsibilities the day came indeed when her breathless auditors learnt from her in bewilderment that what ailed him was that he was alas simply not serious maisie wept on mrs wixs bosom after hearing that sir claude was a butterfly considering moreover that her governess but halfpatched it up in coming out at various moments the next few days with the opinion that it was proper to his station to be careless and free that had been proper to every ones station that she had yet encountered save poor mrs wixs own and the particular merit of sir claude had seemed precisely that he was different from every one she talked with him however as time went on very freely about her mother being with him in this relation wholly without the fear that had kept her silent before her fatherthe fear of bearing tales and making bad things worse he appeared to accept the idea that he had taken her over and made her as he said his particular lark he quite agreed also that he was an awful fraud and an idle beast and a sorry dunce and he never said a word to her against her motherhe only remained dumb and discouraged in the face of her ladyships own overtopping earnestness there were occasions when he even spoke as if he had wrenched his little charge from the arms of a parent who had fought for her tooth and nail  this was the very moral of a scene that flashed into vividness one day when the four happened to meet without company in the drawingroom and maisie found herself clutched to her mothers breast and passionately sobbed and shrieked over made the subject of a demonstration evidently sequent to some sharp passage just enacted the connexion required that while she almost cradled the child in her arms ida should speak of her as hideously as fatally estranged and should rail at sir claude as the cruel author of the outrage he has taken you from me she cried he has set you against me and youve been won away and your horrid little mind has been poisoned youve gone over to him youve given yourself up to side against me and hate me you never open your mouth to meyou know you dont and you chatter to him like a dozen magpies dont lie about iti hear you all over the place you hang about him in a way thats barely decenthe can do what he likes with you well then let him to his hearts content he has been in such a hurry to take you that well see if it suits him to keep you im very good to break my heart about it when youve no more feeling for me than a clammy little fish she suddenly thrust the child away and as a disgusted admission of failure sent her flying across the room into the arms of mrs wix whom at this moment and even in the whirl of her transit maisie saw very red exchange a quick queer look with sir claude  the impression of the look remained with her confronting her with such a critical little view of her mothers explosion that she felt the less ashamed of herself for incurring the reproach with which she had been cast off her father had once called her a heartless little beast and now though decidedly scared she was as stiff and cold as if the description had been just she was not even frightened enough to cry which would have been a tribute to her mothers wrongs she was only more than anything else curious about the opinion mutely expressed by their companions taking the earliest opportunity to question mrs wix on this subject she elicited the remarkable reply well my dear its her ladyships game and we must just hold on like grim death  maisie could interpret at her leisure these ominous words her reflexions indeed at this moment thickened apace and one of them made her sure that her governess had conversations private earnest and not infrequent with her denounced stepfather she perceived in the light of a second episode that something beyond her knowledge had taken place in the house the things beyond her knowledgenumerous enough in truthhad not hitherto she believed been the things that had been nearest to her she had even had in the past a small smug conviction that in the domestic labyrinth she always kept the clue this time too however she at last found outwith the discreet aid it had to be confessed of mrs wix sir claudes own assistance was abruptly taken from her for his comment on her ladyships game was to start on the spot quite alone for paris evidently because he wished to show a spirit when accused of bad behaviour he might be fond of his stepdaughter maisie felt without wishing her to be after all thrust on him in such a way his absence therefore it was clear was a protest against the thrusting it was while this absence lasted that our young lady finally discovered what had happened in the house to be that her mother was no longer in love  the limit of a passion for sir claude had certainly been reached she judged some time before the day on which her ladyship burst suddenly into the schoolroom to introduce mr perriam who as she announced from the doorway to maisie wouldnt believe his ears that one had a great hoyden of a daughter mr perriam was short and massivemrs wix remarked afterwards that he was too fat for the pace and it would have been difficult to say of him whether his head were more bald or his black moustache more bushy he seemed also to have moustaches over his eyes which however by no means prevented these polished little globes from rolling round the room as if they had been billiardballs impelled by idas celebrated stroke mr perriam wore on the hand that pulled his moustache a diamond of dazzling lustre in consequence of which and of his general weight and mystery our young lady observed on his departure that if he had only had a turban he would have been quite her idea of a heathen turk  hes quite my idea mrs wix replied of a heathen jew  well i mean said maisie of a person who comes from the east  thats where he must come from her governess opinedhe comes from the city in a moment she added as if she knew all about him hes one of those people who have lately broken out hell be immensely rich  on the death of his papa the child interestedly enquired  dear nonothing hereditary i mean he has made a mass of money  how much do you think maisie demanded  mrs wix reflected and sketched it oh many millions  a hundred  mrs wix was not sure of the number but there were enough of them to have seemed to warm up for the time the penury of the schoolroomto linger there as an afterglow of the hot heavy light mr perriam sensibly shed this was also no doubt on his part an effect of that enjoyment of life with which among her elders maisie had been in contact from her earliest yearsthe sign of happy maturity the old familiar note of overflowing cheer how dye do maam how dye do little misshe laughed and nodded at the gaping figures she has brought me up for a peepits true i wouldnt take you on trust shes always talking about you but shed never produce you so today i challenged her on the spot well you aint a myth my deari back down on that the visitor went on to maisie nor you either miss though you might be to be sure  i bored him with you darlingi bore every one ida said and to prove that you are a sweet thing as well as a fearfully old one i told him he could judge for himself so now he sees that youre a dreadful bouncing business and that your poor old mummys at least sixtyand her ladyship smiled at mr perriam with the charm that her daughter had heard imputed to her at papas by the merry gentlemen who had so often wished to get from him what they called a rise her manner at that instant gave the child a glimpse more vivid than any yet enjoyed of the attraction that papa in remarkable language always denied she could put forth  mr perriam however clearly recognised it in the humour with which he met her i never said you aint wonderfuldid i ever say it hey and he appealed with pleasant confidence to the testimony of the schoolroom about which itself also he evidently felt something might be expected of him so this is their little place hey charming charming charming he repeated as he vaguely looked round the interrupted students clung together as if they had been personally exposed but ida relieved their embarrassment by a hunch of her high shoulders this time the smile she addressed to mr perriam had a beauty of sudden sadness what on earth is a poor woman to do  the visitors grimace grew more marked as he continued to look and the conscious little schoolroom felt still more like a cage at a menagerie charming charming charming mr perriam insisted but the parenthesis closed with a prompt click there you are said her ladyship bybye she sharply added the next minute they were on the stairs and mrs wix and her companion at the open door and looking mutely at each other were reached by the sound of the large social current that carried them back to their life  it was singular perhaps after this that maisie never put a question about mr perriam and it was still more singular that by the end of a week she knew all she didnt ask what she most particularly knewand the information came to her unsought straight from mrs wixwas that sir claude wouldnt at all care for the visits of a millionaire who was in and out of the upper rooms how little he would care was proved by the fact that under the sense of them mrs wixs discretion broke down altogether she was capable of a transfer of allegiance capable at the altar of propriety of a desperate sacrifice of her ladyship as against mrs beale she more than once intimated she had been willing to do the best for her but as against sir claude she could do nothing for her at all it was extraordinary the number of things that still without a question maisie knew by the time her stepfather came back from pariscame bringing her a splendid apparatus for painting in watercolours and bringing mrs wix by a lapse of memory that would have been droll if it had not been a trifle disconcerting a second and even a more elegant umbrella he had forgotten all about the first with which buried in as many wrappers as a mummy of the pharaohs she wouldnt for the world have done anything so profane as use it maisie knew above all that though she was now by what she called an informal understanding on sir claudes side she had yet not uttered a word to him about mr perriam that gentleman became therefore a kind of flourishing public secret out of the depths of which governess and pupil looked at each other portentously from the time their friend was restored to them he was restored in great abundance and it was marked that though he appeared to have felt the need to take a stand against the risk of being too roughly saddled with the offspring of others he at this period exposed himself more than ever before to the presumption of having created expectations  if it had become now for that matter a question of sides there was at least a certain amount of evidence as to where they all were maisie of course in such a delicate position was on nobodys but sir claude had all the air of being on hers if therefore mrs wix was on sir claudes her ladyship on mr perriams and mr perriam presumably on her ladyships this left only mrs beale and mr farange to account for mrs beale clearly was like sir claude on maisies and papa it was to be supposed on mrs beales here indeed was a slight ambiguity as papas being on mrs beales didnt somehow seem to place him quite on his daughters it sounded as this young lady thought it over very much like pussinthecorner and she could only wonder if the distribution of parties would lead to a rushing to and fro and a changing of places she was in the presence she felt of restless change wasnt it restless enough that her mother and her stepfather should already be on different sides that was the great thing that had domestically happened mrs wix besides had turned another face she had never been exactly gay but her gravity was now an attitude as public as a posted placard she seemed to sit in her new dress and brood over her lost delicacy which had become almost as doleful a memory as that of poor clara matilda it is hard for him she often said to her companion and it was surprising how competent on this point maisie was conscious of being to agree with her hard as it was however sir claude had never shown to greater advantage than in the gallant generous sociable way he carried it off a way that drew from mrs wix a hundred expressions of relief at his not having suffered it to embitter him it threw him more and more at last into the schoolroom where he had plainly begun to recognise that if he was to have the credit of perverting the innocent child he might also at least have the amusement he never came into the place without telling its occupants that they were the nicest people in the housea remark which always led them to say to each other mr perriam as loud as ever compressed lips and enlarged eyes could make them articulate he caused maisie to remember what she had said to mrs beale about his having the nature of a good nurse and rather more than she intended before mrs wix to bring the whole thing out by once remarking to him that none of her good nurses had smoked quite so much in the nursery this had no more effect than it was meant to on his cigarettes he was always smoking but always declaring that it was death to him not to lead a domestic life  he led one after all in the schoolroom and there were hours of late evening when she had gone to bed that maisie knew he sat there talking with mrs wix of how to meet his difficulties his consideration for this unfortunate woman even in the midst of them continued to show him as the perfect gentleman and lifted the subject of his courtesy into an upper air of beatitude in which her very pride had the hush of anxiety he leans on mehe leans on me she only announced from time to time and she was more surprised than amused when later on she accidentally found she had given her pupil the impression of a support literally supplied by her person this glimpse of a misconception led her to be explicitto put before the child with an air of mourning indeed for such a stoop to the common that what they talked about in the small hours as they said was the question of his taking right hold of life the life she wanted him to take right hold of was the public she being i hasten to add in this connexion not the mistress of his fate but only mrs wix herself she had phrases about him that were full of easy understanding yet full of morality hes a wonderful nature but he cant live like the lilies hes all right you know but he must have a high interest she had more than once remarked that his affairs were sadly involved but that they must get himmaisie and she together apparentlyinto parliament the child took it from her with a flutter of importance that parliament was his natural sphere and she was the less prepared to recognise a hindrance as she had never heard of any affairs whatever that were not involved she had in the old days once been told by mrs beale that her very own were and with the refreshment of knowing that she had affairs the information hadnt in the least overwhelmed her it was true and perhaps a little alarming that she had never heard of any such matters since then full of charm at any rate was the prospect of some day getting sir claude in especially after mrs wix as the fruit of more midnight colloquies once went so far as to observe that she really believed it was all that was wanted to save him this critic with these words struck her disciple as cropping up after the manner of mamma when mamma talked quite in a new place the child stared as at the jump of a kangaroo save him from what  mrs wix debated then covered a still greater distance why just from awful misery     xii   she had not at the moment explained her ominous speech but the light of remarkable events soon enabled her companion to read it it may indeed be said that these days brought on a high quickening of maisies direct perceptions of her sense of freedom to make out things for herself this was helped by an emotion intrinsically far from sweetthe increase of the alarm that had most haunted her meditations she had no need to be told as on the morrow of the revelation of sir claudes danger she was told by mrs wix that her mother wanted more and more to know why the devil her father didnt send for her she had too long expected mammas curiosity on this point to express itself sharply maisie could meet such pressure so far as meeting it was to be in a position to reply in words directly inspired that papa would be hanged before hed again be saddled with her she therefore recognised the hour that in troubled glimpses she had long foreseen the hour whenthe phrase for it came back to her from mrs bealewith two fathers two mothers and two homes six protections in all she shouldnt know wherever to go such apprehension as she felt on this score was not diminished by the fact that mrs wix herself was suddenly white with terror a circumstance leading maisie to the further knowledge that this lady was still more scared on her own behalf than on that of her pupil a governess who had only one frock was not likely to have either two fathers or two mothers accordingly if even with these resources maisie was to be in the streets where in the name of all that was dreadful was poor mrs wix to be she had had it appeared a tremendous brush with ida which had begun and ended with the request that she would be pleased on the spot to bundle it had come suddenly but completely this signal of which she had gone in fear the companions confessed to each other the dread each had hidden the worst of but mrs wix was better off than maisie in having a plan of defence she declined indeed to communicate it till it was quite mature but meanwhile she hastened to declare her feet were firm in the schoolroom they could only be loosened by force she would leave for the police perhaps but she wouldnt leave for mere outrage that would be to play her ladyships game and it would take another turn of the screw to make her desert her darling her ladyship had come down with extraordinary violence it had been one of many symptoms of a situation strainedbetween them all as mrs wix said but especially between the twoto the point of god only knew what  her description of the crisis made the child blanch between which twopapa and mamma  dear no i mean between your mother and him  maisie in this recognised an opportunity to be really deep himmr perriam  she fairly brought a blush to the scared face well my dear i must say what you dont know aint worth mentioning that it wont go on for ever with mr perriamsince i must meet youyou can suppose but i meant dear sir claude  maisie stood corrected rather than abashed i see but its about mr perriam hes angry  mrs wix waited he says hes not  not angry he has told you so  mrs wix looked at her hard not about him  then about some one else  mrs wix looked at her harder about some one else  lord eric the child promptly brought forth  at this of a sudden her governess was more agitated oh why little unfortunate should we discuss their dreadful namesand she threw herself for the millionth time on maisies neck it took her pupil but a moment to feel that she quivered with insecurity and the contact of her terror aiding the pair in another instant were sobbing in each others arms then it was that completely relaxed demoralised as she had never been mrs wix suffered her wound to bleed and her resentment to gush her great bitterness was that ida had called her false denounced her hypocrisy and duplicity reviled her spying and tattling her lying and grovelling to sir claude me me the poor woman wailed whove seen what ive seen and gone through everything only to cover her up and ease her off and smooth her down if ive been an ipocrite its the other way round ive pretended to him and to her to myself and to you and to every one not to see it serves me right to have held my tongue before such horrors  what horrors they were her companion forbore too closely to enquire showing even signs not a few of an ability to take them for granted that put the couple more than ever in this troubled sea in the same boat so that with the consciousness of ideas on the part of her fellow mariner maisie could sit close and wait sir claude on the morrow came in to tea and then the ideas were produced it was extraordinary how the childs presence drew out their full strength the principal one was startling but maisie appreciated the courage with which her governess handled it it simply consisted of the proposal that whenever and wherever they should seek refuge sir claude should consent to share their asylum on his protesting with all the warmth in nature against this note of secession she asked what else in the world was left to them if her ladyship should stop supplies  supplies be hanged my dear woman said their delightful friend leave supplies to meill take care of supplies  mrs wix rose to it well its exactly because i knew youd be so glad to do so that i put the question before you theres a way to look after us better than any other the ways just to come along with us  it hung before maisie mrs wixs way like a glittering picture and she clasped her hands in ecstasy come along come along come along  sir claude looked from his stepdaughter back to her governess do you mean leave this house and take up my abode with you  it will be the right thingif you feel as youve told me you feel mrs wix sustained and uplifted was now as clear as a bell  sir claude had the air of trying to recall what he had told her then the light broke that was always breaking to make his face more pleasant its your happy thought that i shall take a house for you  for the wretched homeless child any roofover our headswill do for us but of course for you it will have to be something really nice  sir claudes eyes reverted to maisie rather hard as she thought and there was a shade in his very smile that seemed to show herthough she also felt it didnt show mrs wixthat the accommodation prescribed must loom to him pretty large the next moment however he laughed gaily enough my dear lady you exaggerate tremendously my poor little needs mrs wix had once mentioned to her young friend that when sir claude called her his dear lady he could do anything with her and maisie felt a certain anxiety to see what he would do now well he only addressed her a remark of which the child herself was aware of feeling the force your plan appeals to me immensely but of coursedont you seei shall have to consider the position i put myself in by leaving my wife  youll also have to remember mrs wix replied that if you dont look out your wife wont give you time to consider her ladyship will leave you  ah my good friend i do look out the young man returned while maisie helped herself afresh to bread and butter of course if that happens i shall have somehow to turn round but i hope with all my heart it wont i beg your pardon he continued to his stepdaughter for appearing to discuss that sort of possibility under your sharp little nose but the fact is i forget half the time that idas your sainted mother  so do i said maisie her mouth full of bread and butter and to put him the more in the right  her protectress at this was upon her again the little desolate precious pet for the rest of the conversation she was enclosed in mrs wixs arms and as they sat there interlocked sir claude before them with his teacup looked down at them in deepening thought shrink together as they might they couldnt help maisie felt being a very large lumpish image of what mrs wix required of his slim fineness she knew moreover that this lady didnt make it better by adding in a moment of course we shouldnt dream of a whole house any sort of little lodging however humble would be only too blest  but it would have to be something that would hold us all said sir claude  oh yes mrs wix concurred the whole points our being together while youre waiting before you act for her ladyship to take some step our position here will come to an impossible pass you dont know what i went through with her for you yesterdayand for our poor darling but its not a thing i can promise you often to face again she cast me out in horrible languageshe has instructed the servants not to wait on me  oh the poor servants are all right sir claude eagerly cried  theyre certainly better than their mistress its too dreadful that i should sit here and say of your wife sir claude and of maisies own mother that shes lower than a domestic but my being betrayed into such remarks is just a reason the more for our getting away i shall stay till im taken by the shoulders but that may happen any day what also may perfectly happen you must permit me to repeat is that shell go off to get rid of us  oh if shell only do that sir claude laughed that would be the very making of us  dont say itdont say it mrs wix pleaded dont speak of anything so fatal you know what i mean we must all cling to the right you mustnt be bad  sir claude set down his teacup he had become more grave and he pensively wiped his moustache wont all the world say im awful if i leave the house beforebefore she has bolted theyll say it was my doing so that made her bolt  maisie could grasp the force of this reasoning but it offered no check to mrs wix why need you mind thatif youve done it for so high a motive think of the beauty of it the good lady pressed  of bolting with you sir claude ejaculated  she faintly smiledshe even faintly coloured so far from doing you harm it will do you the highest good sir claude if youll listen to me it will save you  save me from what  maisie at this question waited with renewed suspense for an answer that would bring the thing to some finer point than their companion had brought it to before but there was on the contrary only more mystification in mrs wixs reply ah from you know what  do you mean from some other woman  yesfrom a real bad one  sir claude at least the child could see was not mystified so little indeed that a smile of intelligence broke afresh in his eyes he turned them in vague discomfort to maisie and then something in the way she met them caused him to chuck her playfully under the chin it was not till after this that he goodnaturedly met mrs wix you think me much worse than i am  if that were true she returned i wouldnt appeal to you i do sir claude in the name of all thats good in youand oh so earnestly we can help each other what youll do for our young friend here i neednt say that isnt even what i want to speak of now what i want to speak of is what youll getdont you seefrom such an opportunity to take hold take hold of ustake hold of her make her your dutymake her your life shell repay you a thousandfold  it was to mrs wix during this appeal that maisies contemplation transferred itself partly because though her heart was in her throat for trepidation her delicacy deterred her from appearing herself to press the question partly from the coercion of seeing mrs wix come out as mrs wix had never come beforenot even on the day of her call at mrs beales with the news of mammas marriage on that day mrs beale had surpassed her in dignity but nobody could have surpassed her now there was in fact at this moment a fascination for her pupil in the hint she seemed to give that she had still more of that surprise behind so the sharpened sense of spectatorship was the childs main support the long habit from the first of seeing herself in discussion and finding in the fury of itshe had had a glimpse of the game of footballa sort of compensation for the doom of a peculiar passivity it gave her often an odd air of being present at her history in as separate a manner as if she could only get at experience by flattening her nose against a pane of glass such she felt to be the application of her nose while she waited for the effect of mrs wixs eloquence sir claude however didnt keep her long in a position so ungraceful he sat down and opened his arms to her as he had done the day he came for her at her fathers and while he held her there looking at her kindly but as if their companion had brought the blood a good deal to his face he said  dear mrs wix is magnificent but shes rather too grand about it i mean the situation isnt after all quite so desperate or quite so simple but i give you my word before her and i give it to her before you that ill never never forsake you do you hear that old fellow and do you take it in ill stick to you through everything  maisie did take it intook it with a long tremor of all her little being and then as to emphasise it he drew her closer she buried her head on his shoulder and cried without sound and without pain while she was so engaged she became aware that his own breast was agitated and gathered from it with rapture that his tears were as silently flowing presently she heard a loud sob from mrs wixmrs wix was the only one who made a noise  she was to have made for some time none other but this though within a few days in conversation with her pupil she described her intercourse with ida as little better than the state of being battered there was as yet nevertheless no attempt to eject her by force and she recognised that sir claude taking such a stand as never before had intervened with passion and with success as maisie rememberedand remembered wholly without disdainthat he had told her he was afraid of her ladyship the little girl took this act of resolution as a proof of what in the spirit of the engagement sealed by all their tears he was really prepared to do mrs wix spoke to her of the pecuniary sacrifice by which she herself purchased the scant security she enjoyed and which if it was a defence against the hand of violence yet left her exposed to incredible rudeness didnt her ladyship find every hour of the day some artful means to humiliate and trample upon her there was a quarters salary owing hera great name even maisie could suspect for a small matter she should never see it as long as she lived but keeping quiet about it put her ladyship thank heaven a little in ones power now that he was doing so much else she could never have the grossness to apply for it to sir claude he had sent home for schoolroom consumption a huge frosted cake a wonderful delectable mountain with geological strata of jam which might with economy see them through many days of their siege but it was none the less known to mrs wix that his affairs were more and more involved and her fellow partaker looked back tenderly in the light of these involutions at the expression of face with which he had greeted the proposal that he should set up another establishment maisie felt that if their maintenance should hang by a thread they must still demean themselves with the highest delicacy what he was doing was simply acting without delay so far as his embarrassments permitted on the inspiration of his elder friend there was at this season a wonderful month of mayas soft as a drop of the wind in a gale that had kept one awakewhen he took out his stepdaughter with a fresh alacrity and they rambled the great town in search as mrs wix called it of combined amusement and instruction  they rode on the top of buses they visited outlying parks they went to cricketmatches where maisie fell asleep they tried a hundred places for the best one to have tea this was his direct way of rising to mrs wixs grand lessonof making his little accepted charge his duty and his life they dropped under incontrollable impulses into shops that they agreed were too big to look at things that they agreed were too small and it was during these hours that mrs wix alone at home but a subject of regretful reference as they pulled off their gloves for refreshment subsequently described herself as least sheltered from the blows her ladyship had achieved such ingenuity in dealing she again and again repeated that she wouldnt so much have minded having her attainments held up to scorn and her knowledge of every subject denied hadnt she been branded as low in character and tone there was by this time no pretence on the part of any one of denying it to be fortunate that her ladyship habitually left london every saturday and was more and more disposed to a return late in the week it was almost equally public that she regarded as a preposterous pose and indeed as a direct insult to herself her husbands attitude of staying behind to look after a child for whom the most elaborate provision had been made if there was a type ida despised sir claude communicated to maisie it was the man who pottered about town of a sunday and he also mentioned how often she had declared to him that if he had a grain of spirit he would be ashamed to accept a menial position about mr faranges daughter it was her ladyships contention that he was in craven fear of his predecessorotherwise he would recognise it as an obligation of plain decency to protect his wife against the outrage of that persons barefaced attempt to swindle her the swindle was that mr farange put upon her the whole intolerable burden and even when i pay for you myself sir claude averred to his young friend she accuses me the more of truckling and grovelling it was mrs wixs conviction they both knew arrived at on independent grounds that idas weekly excursions were feelers for a more considerable absence if she came back later each week the week would be sure to arrive when she wouldnt come back at all this appearance had of course much to do with mrs wixs actual valour could they but hold out long enough the snug little home with sir claude would find itself informally established     xiii   this might moreover have been taken to be the sense of a remark made by her stepfather asone rainy day when the streets were all splash and two umbrellas unsociable and the wanderers had sought shelter in the national gallerymaisie sat beside him staring rather sightlessly at a roomful of pictures which he had mystified her much by speaking of with a bored sigh as a silly superstition they represented with patches of gold and cataracts of purple with stiff saints and angular angels with ugly madonnas and uglier babies strange prayers and prostrations so that she at first took his words for a protest against devotional idolatryall the more that he had of late often come with her and with mrs wix to morning church a place of worship of mrs wixs own choosing where there was nothing of that sort no haloes on heads but only during long sermons beguiling backs of bonnets and where as her governess always afterwards observed he gave the most earnest attention it presently appeared however that his reference was merely to the affectation of admiring such ridiculous worksan admonition that she received from him as submissively as she received everything what turn it gave to their talk neednt here be recorded the transition to the colourless schoolroom and lonely mrs wix was doubtless an effect of relaxed interest in what was before them maisie expressed in her own way the truth that she never went home nowadays without expecting to find the temple of her studies empty and the poor priestess cast out this conveyed a full appreciation of her peril and it was in rejoinder that sir claude uttered acknowledging the source of that peril the reassurance at which i have glanced dont be afraid my dear ive squared her it required indeed a supplement when he saw that it left the child momentarily blank i mean that your mother lets me do what i want so long as i let her do what she wants  so you are doing what you want maisie asked  rather miss farange  miss farange turned it over and shes doing the same  up to the hilt  again she considered then please what may it be  i wouldnt tell you for the whole world  she gazed at a gaunt madonna after which she broke into a slow smile well i dont care so long as you do let her  oh you monsterand sir claudes gay vehemence brought him to his feet  another day in another placea place in baker street where at a hungry hour she had sat down with him to tea and bunshe brought out a question disconnected from previous talk i say you know what do you suppose your father would do  maisie hadnt long to cast about or to question his pleasant eyes if you were really to go with us hed make a great complaint  he seemed amused at the term she employed oh i shouldnt mind a complaint  hed talk to every one about it said maisie  well i shouldnt mind that either  of course not the child hastened to respond youve told me youre not afraid of him  the question is are you said sir claude  maisie candidly considered then she spoke resolutely no not of papa  but of somebody else  certainly of lots of people  of your mother first and foremost of course  dear yes more of mamma than ofthan of  than of what sir claude asked as she hesitated for a comparison  she thought over all objects of dread than of a wild elephant she at last declared and you are too she reminded him as he laughed  oh yes i am too  again she meditated why then did you marry her  just because i was afraid  even when she loved you  that made her the more alarming  for maisie herself though her companion seemed to find it droll this opened up depths of gravity more alarming than she is now  well in a different way fear unfortunately is a very big thing and theres a great variety of kinds  she took this in with complete intelligence then i think ive got them all  you her friend cried nonsense youre thoroughly game  im awfully afraid of mrs beale maisie objected  he raised his smooth brows that charming woman  well she answered you cant understand it because youre not in the same state  she had been going on with a luminous but when across the table he laid his hand on her arm i can understand it he confessed i am in the same state  oh but she likes you so maisie promptly pleaded  sir claude literally coloured that has something to do with it  maisie wondered again being liked with being afraid  yes when it amounts to adoration  then why arent you afraid of me  because with you it amounts to that he had kept his hand on her arm well what prevents is simply that youre the gentlest spirit on earth besides he pursued but he came to a pause  besides  i should be in fear if you were olderthere seeyou already make me talk nonsense the young man added the questions about your father is he likewise afraid of mrs beale  i think not and yet he loves her maisie mused  oh nohe doesnt not a bit after which as his companion stared sir claude apparently felt that he must make this oddity fit with her recollections theres nothing of that sort now  but maisie only stared the more theyve changed  like your mother and me  she wondered how he knew then youve seen mrs beale again  he demurred oh no she has written to me he presently subjoined shes not afraid of your father either no one at all isreally then he went on while maisies little mind with its filial spring too relaxed from of old for a pang at this want of parental majesty speculated on the vague relation between mrs beales courage and the question for mrs wix and herself of a neat lodging with their friend she wouldnt care a bit if mr farange should make a row  do you mean about you and me and mrs wix why should she care it wouldnt hurt her  sir claude with his legs out and his hand diving into his trouserspocket threw back his head with a laugh just perceptibly tempered as she thought by a sigh my dear stepchild youre delightful look here we must pay youve had five buns  how can you maisie demanded crimson under the eye of the young woman who had stepped to their board ive had three  shortly after this mrs wix looked so ill that it was to be feared her ladyship had treated her to some unexampled passage maisie asked if anything worse than usual had occurred whereupon the poor woman brought out with infinite gloom he has been seeing mrs beale  sir claude the child remembered what he had said oh nonot seeing her  i beg your pardon i absolutely know it mrs wix was as positive as she was dismal  maisie nevertheless ventured to challenge her and how please do you know it  she faltered a moment from herself ive been to see her  then on maisies visible surprise i went yesterday while you were out with him he has seen her repeatedly  it was not wholly clear to maisie why mrs wix should be prostrate at this discovery but her general consciousness of the way things could be both perpetrated and resented always eased off for her the strain of the particular mystery there may be some mistake he says he hasnt  mrs wix turned paler as if this were a still deeper ground for alarm he says sohe denies that he has seen her  he told me so three days ago perhaps shes mistaken maisie suggested  do you mean perhaps she lies she lies whenever it suits her im very sure but i know when people lieand thats what ive loved in you that you never do mrs beale didnt yesterday at any rate he has seen her  maisie was silent a little he says not she then repeated perhapsperhaps once more she paused  do you mean perhaps he lies  gracious goodness no maisie shouted  mrs wixs bitterness however again overflowed he does he does she cried and its that thats just the worst of it theyll take you theyll take you and what in the world will then become of me she threw herself afresh upon her pupil and wept over her with the inevitable effect of causing the childs own tears to flow but maisie couldnt have told you if she had been crying at the image of their separation or at that of sir claudes untruth as regards this deviation it was agreed between them that they were not in a position to bring it home to him mrs wix was in dread of doing anything to make him as she said worse and maisie was sufficiently initiated to be able to reflect that in speaking to her as he had done he had only wished to be tender of mrs beale it fell in with all her inclinations to think of him as tender and she forbore to let him know that the two ladies had as she would never do betrayed him  she had not long to keep her secret for the next day when she went out with him he suddenly said in reference to some errand he had first proposed no we wont do thatwell do something else on this a few steps from the door he stopped a hansom and helped her in then following her he gave the driver over the top an address that she lost when he was seated beside her she asked him where they were going to which he replied my dear child youll see she saw while she watched and wondered that they took the direction of the regents park but she didnt know why he should make a mystery of that and it was not till they passed under a pretty arch and drew up at a white house in a terrace from which the view she thought must be lovely that mystified she clutched him and broke out i shall see papa  he looked down at her with a kind smile no probably not i havent brought you for that  then whose house is it  its your fathers theyve moved here  she looked about she had known mr farange in four or five houses and there was nothing astonishing in this except that it was the nicest place yet but i shall see mrs beale  its to see her that i brought you  she stared very white and with her hand on his arm though they had stopped kept him sitting in the cab to leave me do you mean  he could scarce bring it out its not for me to say if you can stay we must look into it  but if i do i shall see papa  oh some time or other no doubt then sir claude went on have you really so very great a dread of that  maisie glanced away over the apron of the cabgazed a minute at the green expanse of the regents park and at this moment colouring to the roots of her hair felt the full hot rush of an emotion more mature than any she had yet known it consisted of an odd unexpected shame at placing in an inferior light to so perfect a gentleman and so charming a person as sir claude so very near a relative as mr farange she remembered however her friends telling her that no one was seriously afraid of her father and she turned round with a small toss of her head oh i dare say i can manage him  sir claude smiled but she noted that the violence with which she had just changed colour had brought into his own face a slight compunctious and embarrassed flush it was as if he had caught his first glimpse of her sense of responsibility neither of them made a movement to get out and after an instant he said to her look here if you say so we wont after all go in  ah but i want to see mrs beale the child gently wailed  but what if she does decide to take you then you know youll have to remain  maisie turned it over straight onand give you up  welli dont quite know about giving me up  i mean as i gave up mrs beale when i last went to mammas i couldnt do without you here for anything like so long a time as that it struck her as a hundred years since she had seen mrs beale who was on the other side of the door they were so near and whom she yet had not taken the jump to clasp in her arms  oh i dare say youll see more of me than youve seen of mrs beale it isnt in me to be so beautifully discreet sir claude said but all the same he continued i leave the thing now that were here absolutely with you you must settle it well only go in if you say so if you dont say so well turn right round and drive away  so in that case mrs beale wont take me  wellnot by any act of ours  and i shall be able to go on with mamma maisie asked  oh i dont say that  she considered but i thought you said you had squared her  sir claude poked his stick at the splashboard of the cab not my dear child to the point she now requires  then if she turns me out and i dont come here  sir claude promptly took her up what do i offer you you naturally enquire my poor chick thats just what i ask myself i dont see it i confess quite as straight as mrs wix  his companion gazed a moment at what mrs wix saw you mean we cant make a little family  its very base of me no doubt but i cant wholly chuck your mother  maisie at this emitted a low but lengthened sigh a slight sound of reluctant assent which would certainly have been amusing to an auditor then there isnt anything else  i vow i dont quite see what there is  maisie waited her silence seemed to signify that she too had no alternative to suggest but she made another appeal if i come here youll come to see me  i wont lose sight of you  but how often will you come as he hung fire she pressed him often and often  still he faltered my dear old woman he began then he paused again going on the next moment with a change of tone youre too funny yes then he said often and often  all right maisie jumped out mrs beale was at home but not in the drawingroom and when the butler had gone for her the child suddenly broke out but when im here what will mrs wix do  ah you should have thought of that sooner said her companion with the first faint note of asperity she had ever heard him sound     xiv   mrs beale fairly swooped upon her and the effect of the whole hour was to show the child how much how quite formidably indeed after all she was loved this was the more the case as her stepmother so changedin the very manner of her motherthat she really struck her as a new acquaintance somehow recalled more familiarity than maisie could feel a rich strong expressive affection in short pounced upon her in the shape of a handsomer ampler older mrs beale it was like making a fine friend and they hadnt been a minute together before she felt elated at the way she had met the choice imposed on her in the cab there was a whole future in the combination of mrs beales beauty and mrs beales hug she seemed to maisie charming to behold and also to have no connexion at all with anybody who had once mended underclothing and had meals in the nursery the child knew one of her fathers wives was a woman of fashion but she had always dimly made a distinction not applying that epithet without reserve to the other mrs beale had since their separation acquired a conspicuous right to it and maisies first flush of response to her present delight coloured all her splendour with meanings that this time were sweet she had told sir claude she was afraid of the lady in the regents park but she had confidence enough to break on the spot into the frankest appreciation why arent you beautiful isnt she beautiful sir claude isnt she  the handsomest woman in london simply sir claude gallantly replied just as sure as youre the best little girl  well the handsomest woman in london gave herself up with tender lustrous looks and every demonstration of fondness to a happiness at last clutched again there was almost as vivid a bloom in her maturity as in mammas and it took her but a short time to give her little friend an impression of positive poweran impression that seemed to begin like a long bright day this was a perception on maisies part that neither mamma nor sir claude nor mrs wix with their immense and so varied respective attractions had exactly kindled and that made an immediate difference when the talk as it promptly did began to turn to her father oh yes mr farange was a complication but she saw now that he wouldnt be one for his daughter for mrs beale certainly he was an immense oneshe speedily made known as much but mrs beale from this moment presented herself to maisie as a person to whom a great gift had come the great gift was just for handling complications maisie felt how little she made of them when after she had dropped to sir claude some recall of a previous meeting he made answer with a sound of consternation and yet an air of relief that he had denied to their companion their having since the day he came for her seen each other till that moment  mrs beale could but vaguely pity it why did you do anything so silly  to protect your reputation  from maisie mrs beale was much amused my reputation with maisie is too good to suffer  but you believed me you rascal didnt you sir claude asked of the child  she looked at him she smiled her reputation did suffer i discovered you had been here  he was not too chagrined to laugh the way my dear you talk of that sort of thing  how should she talk mrs beale wanted to know after all this wretched time with her mother  it was not mamma who told me maisie explained it was only mrs wix she was hesitating whether to bring out before sir claude the source of mrs wixs information but mrs beale addressing the young man showed the vanity of scruples  do you know that preposterous person came to see me a day or two agowhen i told her i had seen you repeatedly  sir claude for once in a way was disconcerted the old cat she never told me then you thought i had lied he demanded of maisie  she was flurried by the term with which he had qualified her gentle friend but she took the occasion for one to which she must in every manner lend herself oh i didnt mind but mrs wix did she added with an intention benevolent to her governess  her intention was not very effective as regards mrs beale mrs wix is too idiotic that lady declared  but to you of all people sir claude asked what had she to say  why that like mrs micawberwhom she must i think rather resembleshe will never never never desert miss farange  oh ill make that all right sir claude cheerfully returned  im sure i hope so my dear man said mrs beale while maisie wondered just how he would proceed before she had time to ask mrs beale continued thats not all she came to do if you please but youll never guess the rest  shall i guess it maisie quavered  mrs beale was again amused why youre just the person it must be quite the sort of thing youve heard at your awful mothers have you never seen women there crying to her to spare the men they love  maisie wondering tried to remember but sir claude was freshly diverted oh they dont trouble about ida mrs wix cried to you to spare me  she regularly went down on her knees to me  the darling old dear the young man exclaimed  these words were a joy to maisiethey made up for his previous description of mrs wix and will you spare him she asked of mrs beale  her stepmother seizing her and kissing her again seemed charmed with the tone of her question not an inch of him ill pick him to the bone  you mean that hell really come often maisie pressed  mrs beale turned lovely eyes to sir claude thats not for me to sayits for him  he said nothing at once however with his hands in his pockets and vaguely humming a tuneeven maisie could see he was a little nervoushe only walked to the window and looked out at the regents park well he has promised maisie said but how will papa like it  his being in and out ah thats a question that to be frank with you my dear hardly matters in point of fact however beale greatly enjoys the idea that sir claude too poor man has been forced to quarrel with your mother  sir claude turned round and spoke gravely and kindly dont be afraid maisie you wont lose sight of me  thank you so much maisie was radiant but what i meantdont you knowwas what papa would say to me  oh ive been having that out with him said mrs beale hell behave well enough you see the great difficulty is that though he changes every three days about everything else in the world he has never changed about your mother its a caution the way he hates her  sir claude gave a short laugh it certainly cant beat the way she still hates him  well mrs beale went on obligingly nothing can take the place of that feeling with either of them and the best way they can think of to show it is for each to leave you as long as possible on the hands of the other theres nothing as youve seen for yourself that makes either so furious it isnt asking so little as you do that youre much of an expense or a trouble its only that you make each feel so well how nasty the other wants to be therefore beale goes on loathing your mother too much to have any great fury left for any one else besides you know ive squared him  oh lord sir claude cried with a louder laugh and turning again to the window  i know how maisie was prompt to proclaim by letting him do what he wants on condition that he lets you also do it  youre too delicious my own petshe was involved in another hug how in the world have i got on so long without you ive not been happy love said mrs beale with her cheek to the childs  be happy nowshe throbbed with shy tenderness  i think i shall be youll save me  as im saving sir claude the little girl asked eagerly  mrs beale a trifle at a loss appealed to her visitor is she really  he showed high amusement at maisies question its dear mrs wixs idea there may be something in it  he makes me his dutyhe makes me his life maisie set forth to her stepmother  why thats what i want to domrs beale so anticipated turned pink with astonishment  well you can do it together then hell have to come  mrs beale by this time had her young friend fairly in her lap and she smiled up at sir claude shall we do it together  his laughter had dropped and for a moment he turned his handsome serious face not to his hostess but to his stepdaughter well its rather more decent than some things upon my soul the way things are going it seems to me the only decency he had the air of arguing it out to maisie of presenting it through an impulse of conscience as a connexion in which they could honourably see her participate though his plea of mere decency might well have appeared to fall below her rosy little vision if were not good for you he exclaimed ill be hanged if i know who we shall be good for  mrs beale showed the child an intenser light i dare say you will save usfrom one thing and another  oh i know what shell save me from sir claude roundly asserted therell be rows of course he went on  mrs beale quickly took him up yes but theyll be nothingfor you at leastto the rows your wife makes as it is i can bear what i sufferi cant bear what you go through  were doing a good deal for you you know young woman sir claude went on to maisie with the same gravity  she coloured with a sense of obligation and the eagerness of her desire it should be remarked how little was lost on her oh i know  then you must keep us all right this time he laughed  how you talk to her cried mrs beale  no worse than you he gaily answered  handsome is that handsome does she returned in the same spirit you can take off your things she went on releasing maisie  the child on her feet was all emotion then im just to stopthis way  it will do as well as any other sir claude tomorrow will have your things brought  ill bring them myself upon my word ill see them packed sir claude promised come here and unbutton  he had beckoned his young companion to where he sat and he helped to disengage her from her coverings while mrs beale from a little distance smiled at the hand he displayed theres a stepfather for you im bound to say you know that he makes up for the want of other people  he makes up for the want of a nurse sir claude laughed dont you remember i told you so the very first time  remember it was exactly what made me think so well of you  nothing would induce me the young man said to maisie to tell you what made me think so well of her having divested the child he kissed her gently and gave her a little pat to make her stand off the pat was accompanied with a vague sigh in which his gravity of a moment before came back all the same if you hadnt had the fatal gift of beauty  well what maisie asked wondering why he paused it was the first time she had heard of her beauty  why we shouldnt all be thinking so well of each other  he isnt speaking of personal lovelinessyouve not that vulgar beauty my dear at all mrs beale explained hes just talking of plain dull charm of character  her characters the most extraordinary thing in all the world sir claude stated to mrs beale  oh i know all about that sort of thingshe fairly bridled with the knowledge  it gave maisie somehow a sudden sense of responsibility from which she sought refuge well youve got it too that sort of thingyouve got the fatal gift you both really have she broke out  beauty of character my dear boy we havent a pennyworth sir claude protested  speak for yourself sir she leaped lightly from mrs beale im good and im clever what more do you want for you ill spare your blushes and not be personalill simply say that youre as handsome as you can stick together  youre both very lovely you cant get out of itmaisie felt the need of carrying her point and its beautiful to see you side by side  sir claude had taken his hat and stick he stood looking at her a moment youre a comfort in trouble but i must go home and pack you  and when will you come backtomorrow tomorrow  you see what were in for he said to mrs beale  well i can bear it if you can  their companion gazed from one of them to the other thinking that though she had been happy indeed between sir claude and mrs wix she should evidently be happier still between sir claude and mrs beale but it was like being perched on a prancing horse and she made a movement to hold on to something then you know shant i bid goodbye to mrs wix  oh ill make it all right with her said sir claude  maisie considered and with mamma  ah mamma he sadly laughed  even for the child this was scarcely ambiguous but mrs beale endeavoured to contribute to its clearness your mother will crow shell crow  like the early bird said sir claude as she looked about for a comparison  shell need no consolation mrs beale went on for having made your father grandly blaspheme  maisie stared will he grandly blaspheme it was impressive it might have been out of the bible and her question produced a fresh play of caresses in which sir claude also engaged she wondered meanwhile who if mrs wix was disposed of would represent in her life the element of geography and anecdote and she presently surmounted the delicacy she felt about asking wont there be any one to give me lessons  mrs beale was prepared with a reply that struck her as absolutely magnificent you shall have such lessons as youve never had in all your life you shall go to courses  courses maisie had never heard of such things  at institutionson subjects  maisie continued to stare subjects  mrs beale was really splendid all the most important ones french literatureand sacred history youll take part in classeswith awfully smart children  im going to look thoroughly into the whole thing you know and sir claude with characteristic kindness gave her a nod of assurance accompanied by a friendly wink  but mrs beale went much further my dear child you shall attend lectures  the horizon was suddenly vast and maisie felt herself the smaller for it all alone  oh no ill attend them with you said sir claude theyll teach me a lot i dont know  so they will me mrs beale gravely admitted well go with her togetherit will be charming its ages she confessed to maisie since ive had any time for study thats another sweet way in which youll be a motive to us oh wont the good shell do us be immense she broke out uncontrollably to sir claude  he weighed it then he replied thats certainly our idea  of this idea maisie naturally had less of a grasp but it inspired her with almost equal enthusiasm if in so bright a prospect there would be nothing to long for it followed that she wouldnt long for mrs wix but her consciousness of her assent to the absence of that fond figure caused a pair of words that had often sounded in her ears to ring in them again it showed her in short what her father had always meant by calling her mother a low sneak and her mother by calling her father one she wondered if she herself shouldnt be a low sneak in learning to be so happy without mrs wix what would mrs wix dowhere would mrs wix go before maisie knew it and at the door as sir claude was off these anxieties on her lips grew articulate and her stepfather had stopped long enough to answer them oh ill square her he cried and with this he departed  face to face with mrs beale maisie giving a sigh of relief looked round at what seemed to her the dawn of a higher order then every one will be squared she peacefully said on which her stepmother affectionately bent over her again     xv   it was susan ash who came to her with the news hes downstairs miss and he do look beautiful  in the schoolroom at her fathers which had pretty blue curtains she had been making out at the piano a lovely little thing as mrs beale called it a moonlight berceuse sent her through the post by sir claude who considered that her musical education had been deplorably neglected and who the last months at her mothers had been on the point of making arrangements for regular lessons she knew from him familiarly that the real thing as he said was shockingly dear and that anything else was a waste of money and she therefore rejoiced the more at the sacrifice represented by this composition of which the price five shillings was marked on the cover and which was evidently the real thing she was already on her feet mrs beale has sent up for me  oh noits not that said susan ash mrs beale has been out this hour  then papa  dear nonot papa youll do miss all but them wandering airs susan went on your papa never came ome at all she added  home from where maisie responded a little absently and very excitedly she gave a wild manual brush to her locks  oh that miss i should be very sorry to tell you id rather tuck away that white thing behindthough im blest if its my work  do then please i know where papa was maisie impatiently continued  well in your place i wouldnt tell  he was at the clubthe chrysanthemum so  all night long why the flowers shut up at night you know cried susan ash  well i dont carehe child was at the door sir claude asked for me alone  the same as if you was a duchess  maisie was aware on her way downstairs that she was now quite as happy as one and also a moment later as she hung round his neck that even such a personage would scarce commit herself more grandly there was moreover a hint of the duchess in the infinite point with which as she felt she exclaimed and this is what you call coming often  sir claude met her delightfully and in the same fine spirit my dear old man dont make me a scenei assure you its what every woman i look at does let us have some funits a lovely day clap on something smart and come out with me then well talk it over quietly  they were on their way five minutes later to hyde park and nothing that even in the good days at her mothers they had ever talked over had more of the sweetness of tranquillity than his present prompt explanations he was at his best in such an office and with the exception of mrs wix the only person she had met in her life who ever explained with him however the act had an authority transcending the wisdom of woman it all came backthe plans that always failed all the rewards and bribes that she was perpetually paying for in advance and perpetually out of pocket by afterwardsthe whole great stress to be dealt with introduced her on each occasion afresh to the question of money even she herself almost knew how it would have expressed the strength of his empire to say that to shuffle away her sense of being duped he had only from under his lovely moustache to breathe upon it it was somehow in the nature of plans to be expensive and in the nature of the expensive to be impossible to be involved was of the essence of everybodys affairs and also at every particular moment to be more involved than usual this had been the case with sir claudes with papas with mammas with mrs beales and with maisies own at the particular moment a moment of several weeks that had elapsed since our young lady had been reestablished at her fathers there wasnt twoandtuppence for anything or for any one and that was why there had been no sequel to the classes in french literature with all the smart little girls it was devilish awkward didnt she see to try without even the limited capital mentioned to mix her up with a remote array that glittered before her after this as the children of the rich she was to feel henceforth as if she were flattening her nose upon the hard windowpane of the sweetshop of knowledge if the classes however that were select and accordingly the only ones were impossibly dear the lectures at the institutionsat least at some of themwere directly addressed to the intelligent poor and it therefore had to be easier still to produce on the spot the reason why she had been taken to none this reason sir claude said was that she happened to be just going to be though they had nothing to do with that in now directing their steps to the banks of the serpentine maisies own park in the north had been nearer at hand but they rolled westward in a hansom because at the end of the sweet june days this was the direction taken by every one that any one looked at they cultivated for an hour on the row and by the drive this opportunity for each observer to amuse and for one of them indeed not a little hilariously to mystify the other and before the hour was over maisie had elicited in reply to her sharpest challenge a further account of her friends long absence  why ive broken my word to you so dreadfullypromising so solemnly and then never coming well my dear thats a question that not seeing me day after day you must very often have put to mrs beale  oh yes the child replied again and again  and what has she told you  that youre as bad as youre beautiful  is that what she says  those very words  ah the dear old soul sir claude was much diverted and his loud clear laugh was all his explanation those were just the words maisie had last heard him use about mrs wix she clung to his hand which was encased in a pearlgrey glove ornamented with the thick black lines that at her mothers always used to strike her as connected with the way the bestitched fists of the long ladies carried with the elbows well out their umbrellas upside down the mere sense of his grasp in her own covered the ground of loss just as much as the ground of gain his presence was like an object brought so close to her face that she couldnt see round its edges he himself however remained showman of the spectacle even after they had passed out of the park and begun under the charm of the spot and the season to stroll in kensington gardens what they had left behind them was as he said only a pretty bad circus and through prepossessing gates and over a bridge they had come in a quarter of an hour as he also remarked a hundred miles from london a great green glade was before them and high old trees and under the shade of these in the fresh turf the crooked course of a rural footpath its the forest of arden sir claude had just delightfully observed and im the banished duke and yourewhat was the young woman calledthe artless country wench and there he went on is the other girlwhats her name rosalindand dont you know the fellow who was making up to her upon my word he is making up to her  his allusion was to a couple who side by side at the end of the glade were moving in the same direction as themselves these distant figures in their slow stroll which kept them so close together that their heads drooping a little forward almost touched presented the back of a lady who looked tall who was evidently a very fine woman and that of a gentleman whose left hand appeared to be passed well into her arm while his right behind him made jerky motions with the stick that it grasped maisies fancy responded for an instant to her friends idea that the sight was idyllic then stopping short she brought out with all her clearness why mercyif it isnt mamma  sir claude paused with a stare mamma but mammas at brussels  maisie with her eyes on the lady wondered at brussels  shes gone to play a match  at billiards you didnt tell me  of course i didnt sir claude ejaculated theres plenty i dont tell you she went on wednesday  the couple had added to their distance but maisies eyes more than kept pace with them then she has come back  sir claude watched the lady its much more likely she never went  its mamma the child said with decision  they had stood still but sir claude had made the most of his opportunity and it happened that just at this moment at the end of the vista the others halted and still showing only their backs seemed to stay talking right you are my duck he exclaimed at last its my own sweet wife  he had spoken with a laugh but he had changed colour and maisie quickly looked away from him then who is it with her  blest if i know said sir claude  is it mr perriam  oh dear noperriams smashed  smashed  exposedin the city but there are quantities of others sir claude smiled  maisie appeared to count them she studied the gentlemans back then is this lord eric  for a moment her companion made no answer and when she turned her eyes again to him he was looking at her she thought rather queerly what do you know about lord eric  she tried innocently to be odd in return oh i know more than you think is it lord eric she repeated  it maybe blest if i care  their friends had slightly separated and now as sir claude spoke suddenly faced round showing all the splendour of her ladyship and all the mystery of her comrade maisie held her breath theyre coming  let them come and sir claude pulling out his cigarettes began to strike a light  we shall meet them  no theyll meet us  maisie stood her ground they see us just look  sir claude threw away his match come straight on the others in the return evidently startled had halfpaused again keeping well apart shes horribly surprised and wants to slope he continued but its too late  maisie advanced beside him making out even across the interval that her ladyship was ill at ease then what will she do  sir claude puffed his cigarette shes quickly thinking he appeared to enjoy it  ida had wavered but an instant her companion clearly gave her moral support maisie thought he somehow looked brave and he had no likeness whatever to mr perriam his face thin and rather sharp was smooth and it was not till they came nearer that she saw he had a remarkably fair little moustache she could already see that his eyes were of the lightest blue he was far nicer than mr perriam mamma looked terrible from afar but even under her guns the childs curiosity flickered and she appealed again to sir claude is itis it lord eric  sir claude smoked composedly enough i think its the count  this was a happy solutionit fitted her idea of a count but what idea as she now came grandly on did mamma fitunless that of an actress in some tremendous situation sweeping down to the footlights as if she would jump them maisie felt really so frightened that before she knew it she had passed her hand into sir claudes arm her pressure caused him to stop and at the sight of this the other couple came equally to a stand and beyond the diminished space remained a moment more in talk this however was the matter of an instant leaving the count apparently to come round more circuitouslyan outflanking movement if maisie had but knownher ladyship resumed the onset what will she do now her daughter asked  sir claude was at present in a position to say try to pretend its me  you  why that im up to something  in another minute poor ida had justified this prediction erect there before them like a figure of justice in full dress there were parts of her face that grew whiter while maisie looked and other parts in which this change seemed to make other colours reign with more intensity what are you doing with my daughter she demanded of her husband in spite of the indignant tone of which maisie had a greater sense than ever in her life before of not being personally noticed it seemed to her sir claude also grew pale as an effect of the loud defiance with which ida twice repeated this question he put her instead of answering it an enquiry of his own who the devil have you got hold of now and at this her ladyship turned tremendously to the child glaring at her as at an equal plotter of sin maisie received in petrifaction the full force of her mothers huge painted eyesthey were like japanese lanterns swung under festal arches but life came back to her from a tone suddenly and strangely softened go straight to that gentleman my dear ive asked him to take you a few minutes hes charminggo ive something to say to this creature  maisie felt sir claude immediately clutch her no nothank you that wont do shes mine  yours it was confounding to maisie to hear her speak quite as if she had never heard of sir claude before  mine youve given her up youve not another word to say about her i have her from her father said sir claudea statement that startled his companion who could also measure its lively action on her mother  there was visibly however an influence that made ida consider she glanced at the gentleman she had left who having strolled with his hands in his pockets to some distance stood there with unembarrassed vagueness she directed to him the face that was like an illuminated garden turnstile and all for the frequentation of which he had his seasonticket then she looked again at sir claude ive given her up to her father to keepnot to get rid of by sending about the town either with you or with any one else if shes not to mind me let him come and tell me so i decline to take it from another person and i like your pretending that with your humbug of interest youve a leg to stand on i know your game and have something now to say to you about it  sir claude gave a squeeze of the childs arm didnt i tell you shed have miss farange  youre uncommonly afraid to hear it ida went on but if you think shell protect you from it youre mightily mistaken she gave him a moment ill give her the benefit as soon as look at you should you like her to know my dear maisie had a sense of her launching the question with effect yet our young lady was also conscious of hoping that sir claude would declare that preference we have already learned that she had come to like peoples liking her to know before he could reply at all none the less her mother opened a pair of arms of extraordinary elegance and then she felt the loosening of his grasp my own child ida murmured in a voicea voice of sudden confused tendernessthat it seemed to her she heard for the first time she wavered but an instant thrilled with the first direct appeal as distinguished from the mere maternal pull she had ever had from lips that even in the old vociferous years had always been sharp the next moment she was on her mothers breast where amid a wilderness of trinkets she felt as if she had suddenly been thrust with a smash of glass into a jewellers shopfront but only to be as suddenly ejected with a push and the brisk injunction now go to the captain  maisie glanced at the gentleman submissively but felt the want of more introduction the captain  sir claude broke into a laugh i told her it was the count  ida stared she rose so superior that she was colossal youre too utterly loathsome she then declared be off she repeated to her daughter  maisie started moved backward and looking at sir claude only for a moment she signed to him in her bewilderment but he was too angry to heed hertoo angry with his wife as she turned away she heard his anger break out you damned old bshe couldnt quite hear all it was enough it was too much she fled before it rushing even to a stranger for the shock of such a change of tone     xvi   as she met the captains light blue eyes the greatest marvel occurred she felt a sudden relief at finding them reply with anxiety to the horror in her face what in the world has he done he put it all on sir claude  he has called her a damned old brute she couldnt help bringing that out  the captain at the same elevation as her ladyship gaped wide then of course like every one else he was convulsed but he instantly caught himself up echoing her bad words a damned old bruteyour mother  maisie was already conscious of her second movement i think she tried to make him angry  the captains stupefaction was fine angryshe why shes an angel  on the spot as he said this his face won her over it was so bright and kind and his blue eyes had such a reflexion of some mysterious grace that for him at least her mother had put forth her fund of observation enabled her as she gazed up at him to place him he was a candid simple soldier very graveshe came back to thatbut not at all terrible at any rate he struck a note that was new to her and that after a moment made her say do you like her very much  he smiled down at her hesitating looking pleasanter and pleasanter let me tell you about your mother  he put out a big military hand which she immediately took and they turned off together to where a couple of chairs had been placed under one of the trees she told me to come to you maisie explained as they went and presently she was close to him in a chair with the prettiest of picturesthe sheen of the lake through other treesbefore them and the sound of birds the plash of boats the play of children in the air the captain inclining his military person sat sideways to be closer and kinder and as her hand was on the arm of her seat he put his own down on it again to emphasise something he had to say that would be good for her to hear he had already told her how her mother from the moment of seeing her so unexpectedly with a person who waswell not at all the right person had promptly asked him to take charge of her while she herself tackled as she said the real culprit he gave the child the sense of doing for the time what he liked with her ten minutes before she had never seen him but she could now sit there touching him touched and impressed by him and thinking it nice when a gentleman was thin and brownbrown with a kind of clear depth that made his strawcoloured moustache almost white and his eyes resemble little pale flowers the most extraordinary thing was the way she didnt appear just then to mind sir claudes being tackled the captain wasnt a bit like him for it was an odd part of the pleasantness of mammas friend that it resided in a manner in this friends having a face so informally put together that the only kindness could be to call it funny an odder part still was that it finally made our young lady to classify him further say to herself that of all people in the world he reminded her most insidiously of mrs wix he had neither straighteners nor a diadem nor at least in the same place as the other a button he was sunburnt and deepvoiced and smelt of cigars yet he marvellously had more in common with her old governess than with her young stepfather what he had to say to her that was good for her to hear was that her poor mother didnt she know was the best friend he had ever had in all his life and he added she has told me ever so much about you im awfully glad to know you  she had never she thought been so addressed as a young lady not even by sir claude the day so long ago that she found him with mrs beale it struck her as the way that at balls by delightful partners young ladies must be spoken to in the intervals of dances and she tried to think of something that would meet it at the same high point but this effort flurried her and all she could produce was at first you know i thought you were lord eric  the captain looked vague lord eric  and then sir claude thought you were the count  at this he laughed out why hes only five foot high and as red as a lobster maisie laughed with a certain elegance in returnthe young lady at the ball certainly wouldand was on the point as conscientiously of pursuing the subject with an agreeable question but before she could speak her companion challenged her who in the worlds lord eric  dont you know him she judged her young lady would say that with light surprise  do you mean a fat man with his mouth always open she had to confess that their acquaintance was so limited that she could only describe the bearer of the name as a friend of mammas but a light suddenly came to the captain who quickly spoke as knowing her man whatdoyoucallhims brother the fellow that owned bobolink then with all his kindness he contradicted her flat oh dear no your mother never knew him  but mrs wix said so the child risked  mrs wix  my old governess  this again seemed amusing to the captain she mixed him up your old governess hes an awful beast your mother never looked at him  he was as positive as he was friendly but he dropped for a minute after this into a silence that gave maisie confused but ingenious a chance to redeem the mistake of pretending to know too much by the humility of inviting further correction and doesnt she know the count  oh i dare say but hes another ass after which abruptly with a different look he put down again on the back of her own the hand he had momentarily removed maisie even thought he coloured a little i want tremendously to speak to you you must never believe any harm of your mother  oh i assure you i dont cried the child blushing herself up to her eyes in a sudden surge of deprecation of such a thought  the captain bending his head raised her hand to his lips with a benevolence that made her wish her glove had been nicer of course you dont when you know how fond she is of you  shes fond of me maisie panted  tremendously but she thinks you dont like her you must like her she has had too much to put up with  oh yesi know she rejoiced that she had never denied it  of course ive no right to speak of her except as a particular friend the captain went on but shes a splendid woman she has never had any sort of justice  hasnt shehis companion to hear the words felt a thrill altogether new  perhaps i oughtnt to say it to you but she has had everything to suffer  oh yesyou can say it to me maisie hastened to profess  the captain was glad well you neednt tell its all for youdo you see  serious and smiling she only wanted to take it from him its between you and me oh there are lots of things ive never told  well keep this with the rest i assure you she has had the most infernal time no matter what any one says to the contrary shes the cleverest woman i ever saw in all my life shes too charming she had been touched already by his tone and now she leaned back in her chair and felt something tremble within her shes tremendous funshe can do all sorts of things better than ive ever seen any one she has the pluck of fiftyand i know i assure you i do she has the nerve for a tigershootby jove id take her and she is awfully open and generous dont you know there are women that are such horrid sneaks shell go through anything for any one she likes he appeared to watch for a moment the effect on his companion of this emphasis then he gave a small sigh that mourned the limits of the speakable but it was almost with the note of a fresh challenge that he wound up look here shes true  maisie had so little desire to assert the contrary that she found herself in the intensity of her response throbbing with a joy still less utterable than the essence of the captains admiration she was fairly hushed with the sense that he spoke of her mother as she had never heard any one speak it came over her as she sat silent that after all this admiration and this respect were quite new words which took a distinction from the fact that nothing in the least resembling them in quality had on any occasion dropped from the lips of her father of mrs beale of sir claude or even of mrs wix what it appeared to her to come to was that on the subject of her ladyship it was the first real kindness she had heard so that at the touch of it something strange and deep and pitying surged up within hera revelation that practically and so far as she knew her mother apart from this had only been disliked mrs wixs original account of sir claudes affection seemed as empty now as the chorus in a childrens game and the husband and wife but a little way off at that moment were face to face in hatred and with the dreadful name he had called her still in the air what was it the captain on the other hand had called her maisie wanted to hear that again the tears filled her eyes and rolled down her cheeks which burned under them with the rush of a consciousness that for her too five minutes before the vivid towering beauty whose assault she awaited had been a moment long an object of pure dread she became on the spot indifferent to her usual fear of showing what in children was notoriously most offensivepresented to her companion soundlessly but hideously her wet distorted face she cried with a pang straight at him cried as she had never cried at any one in all her life oh do you love her she brought out with a gulp that was the effect of her trying not to make a noise  it was doubtless another consequence of the thick mist through which she saw him that in reply to her question the captain gave her such a queer blurred look he stammered yet in his voice there was also the ring of a great awkward insistence of course im tremendously fond of heri like her better than any woman i ever saw i dont mind in the least telling you that he went on and i should think myself a great beast if i did then to show that his position was superlatively clear he made her with a kindness that even sir claude had never surpassed tremble again as she had trembled at his first outbreak he called her by her name and her name drove it home my dear maisie your mothers an angel  it was an almost unbelievable balmit soothed so her impression of danger and pain she sank back in her chair she covered her face with her hands oh mother mother mother she sobbed she had an impression that the captain beside her if more and more friendly was by no means unembarrassed in a minute however when her eyes were clearer he was erect in front of her very red and nervously looking about him and whacking his leg with his stick say you love her mr captain say it say it she implored  mr captains blue eyes fixed themselves very hard of course i love her damn it you know  at this she also jumped up she had fished out somehow her pockethandkerchief so do i then i do i do i do she passionately asseverated  then will you come back to her  maisie staring stopped the tight little plug of her handkerchief on the way to her eyes she wont have me  yes she will she wants you  back at the housewith sir claude  again he hung fire no not with him in another place  they stood looking at each other with an intensity unusual as between a captain and a little girl she wont have me in any place  oh yes she will if i ask her  maisies intensity continued shall you be there  the captains on the whole did the same oh yessome day  then you dont mean now  he broke into a quick smile will you come nowgo with us for an hour  maisie considered she wouldnt have me even now she could see that he had his idea but that her tone impressed him that disappointed her a little though in an instant he rang out again  she will if i ask her he repeated ill ask her this minute  maisie turning at this looked away to where her mother and her stepfather had stopped at first among the trees nobody was visible but the next moment she exclaimed with expression its overhere he comes  the captain watched the approach of her ladyships husband who lounged composedly over the grass making to maisie with his closed fingers a little movement in the air ive no desire to avoid him  well you mustnt see him said maisie  oh hes in no hurry himself sir claude had stopped to light another cigarette  she was vague as to the way it was proper he should feel but she had a sense that the captains remark was rather a free reflexion on it oh he doesnt care she replied  doesnt care for what  doesnt care who you are he told me so go and ask mamma she added  if you can come with us very good you really want me not to wait for him  please dont but sir claude was not yet near and the captain had with his left hand taken hold of her right which he familiarly sociably swung a little only first she continued tell me this are you going to live with mamma  the immemorial note of mirth broke out at her seriousness one of these days  she wondered wholly unperturbed by his laughter then where will sir claude be  hell have left her of course  does he really intend to do that  youve every opportunity to ask him  maisie shook her head with decision he wont do it not first  her first made the captain laugh out again oh hell be sure to be nasty but ive said too much to you  well you know ill never tell said maisie  no its all for yourself goodbye  goodbye maisie kept his hand long enough to add i like you too and then supremely you do love her  my dear child the captain wanted words  then dont do it only for just a little  a little  like all the others  all the othershe stood staring  she pulled away her hand do it always she bounded to meet sir claude and as she left the captain she heard him ring out with apparent gaiety  oh im in for it  as she joined sir claude she noted her mother in the distance move slowly off and glancing again at the captain saw him swinging his stick retreat in the same direction  she had never seen sir claude look as he looked just then flushed yet not excitedsettled rather in an immoveable disgust and at once very sick and very hard his conversation with her mother had clearly drawn blood and the childs old horror came back to her begetting the instant moral contraction of the days when her parents had looked to her to feed their love of battle her greatest fear for the moment however was that her friend would see she had been crying the next she became aware that he had glanced at her and it presently occurred to her that he didnt even wish to be looked at at this she quickly removed her gaze while he said rather curtly well who in the world is the fellow  she felt herself flooded with prudence oh i havent found out this sounded as if she meant he ought to have done so himself but she could only face doggedly the ugliness of seeming disagreeable as she used to face it in the hours when her father for her blankness called her a dirty little donkey and her mother for her falsity pushed her out of the room  then what have you been doing all this time  oh i dont know it was of the essence of her method not to be silly by halves  then didnt the beast say anything they had got down by the lake and were walking fast  well not very much  he didnt speak of your mother  oh yes a little  then what i ask you please is how she kept silenceso long that he presently went on i say you knowdont you hear me at this she produced well im afraid i didnt attend to him very much  sir claude smoking rather hard made no immediate rejoinder but finally he exclaimed then my dearwith such a chanceyou were the perfection of a dunce he was so irritatedor she took him to bethat for the rest of the time they were in the gardens he spoke no other word and she meanwhile subtly abstained from any attempt to pacify him that would only lead to more questions at the gate of the gardens he hailed a fourwheeled cab and in silence without meeting her eyes put her into it only saying give him that as he tossed half a crown upon the seat even when from outside he had closed the door and told the man where to go he never took her departing look nothing of this kind had ever yet happened to them but it had no power to make her love him less so she could not only bear it she felt as she drove awayshe could rejoice in it it brought again the sweet sense of success that ages before she had had at a crisis when on the stairs returning from her fathers she had met a fierce question of her mothers with an imbecility as deep and had in consequence been dashed by mrs farange almost to the bottom     xvii   if for reasons of her own she could bear the sense of sir claudes displeasure her young endurance might have been put to a serious test the days went by without his knocking at her fathers door and the time would have turned sadly to waste if something hadnt conspicuously happened to give it a new difference what took place was a marked change in the attitude of mrs bealea change that somehow even in his absence seemed to bring sir claude again into the house it began practically with a conversation that occurred between them the day maisie came home alone in the cab mrs beale had by that time returned and she was more successful than their friend in extracting from our young lady an account of the extraordinary passage with the captain she came back to it repeatedly and on the very next day it grew distinct to the child that she was already in full possession of what at the same moment had been enacted between her ladyship and sir claude this was the real origin of her final perception that though he didnt come to the house her stepmother had some rare secret for not being quite without him this led to some rare passages with mrs beale the promptest of which had beennot on maisies parta wonderful outbreak of tears mrs beale was not as she herself said a crying creature she hadnt cried to maisies knowledge since the lowly governess days the grey dawn of their connexion but she wept now with passion professing loudly that it did her good and saying remarkable things to her charge for whom the occasion was an equal benefit an addition to all the fine precautionary wisdom stored away it somehow hadnt violated that wisdom maisie felt for her to have told mrs beale what she had not told sir claude inasmuch as the greatest strain to her sense was between sir claude and sir claudes wife and his wife was just what mrs beale was unfortunately not he sent his stepdaughter three days after the incident in kensington gardens a message as frank as it was tender and that was how mrs beale had had to bring out in a manner that seemed half an appeal half a defiance well yes hang iti do see him  how and when and where however were just what maisie was not to knowan exclusion moreover that she never questioned in the light of a participation large enough to make him while she shared the ample void of mrs beales rather blank independence shine in her yearning eye like the single the sovereign windowsquare of a great dim disproportioned room as far as her father was concerned such hours had no interruption and then it was clear between them that each was thinking of the absent and thinking the other thought so that he was an object of conscious reference in everything they said or did the wretched truth mrs beale had to confess was that she had hoped against hope and that in the regents park it was impossible sir claude should really be in and out hadnt they at last to look the fact in the faceit was too disgustingly evident that no one after all had been squared well if no one had been squared it was because every one had been vile no one and every one were of course beale and ida the extent of whose power to be nasty was a thing that to a little girl mrs beale simply couldnt give chapter and verse for therefore it was that to keep going at all as she said that lady had to make as she also said another arrangementthe arrangement in which maisie was included only to the point of knowing it existed and wondering wistfully what it was conspicuously at any rate it had a side that was responsible for mrs beales sudden emotion and sudden confidencea demonstration this however of which the tearfulness was far from deterrent to our heroines thought of how happy she should be if she could only make an arrangement for herself mrs beales own operated it appeared with regularity and frequency for it was almost every day or two that she was able to bring maisie a message and to take one back it had been over the vision of what as she called it he did for her that she broke down and this vision was kept in a manner before maisie by a subsequent increase not only of the gaiety but literallyit seemed not presumptuous to perceiveof the actual virtue of her friend the friend was herself the first to proclaim it he had pulled her up immenselyhe had quite pulled her round she had charming tormenting words about him he was her good fairy her hidden springabove all he was just her higher conscience that was what had particularly come out with her startling tears he had made her dear man think ever so much better of herself it had been thus rather surprisingly revealed that she had been in a way to think ill and maisie was glad to hear of the corrective at the same time that she heard of the ailment  she presently found herself supposing and in spite of her envy even hoping that whenever mrs beale was out of the house sir claude had in some manner the satisfaction of it this was now of more frequent occurrence than ever beforeso much so that she would have thought of her stepmother as almost extravagantly absent had it not been that in the first place her father was a superior specimen of that habit it was the frequent remark of his present wife as it had been before the tribunals of their country a prominent plea of her predecessor that he scarce came home even to sleep in the second place mrs beale when she was on the spot had now a beautiful air of longing to make up for everything the only shadow in such bright intervals was that as maisie put it to herself she could get nothing by questions it was in the nature of things to be none of a small childs business even when a small child had from the first been deluded into a fear that she might be only too much initiated things then were in maisies experience so true to their nature that questions were almost always improper but she learned on the other hand soon to recognise how at last sometimes patient little silences and intelligent little looks could be rewarded by delightful little glimpses there had been years at beale faranges when the monosyllable he meant always meant almost violently the master but all that was changed at a period at which sir claudes merits were of themselves so much in the air that it scarce took even two letters to name him he keeps me up splendidlyhe does my own precious mrs beale would observe to her comrade or else she would say that the situation at the other establishment had reached a point that could scarcely be believedthe point monstrous as it sounded of his not having laid eyes upon her for twelve days she of course at beale faranges had never meant any one but ida and there was the difference in this case that it now meant ida with renewed intensity mrs bealeit was strikingwas in a position to animadvert more and more upon her dreadfulness the moral of all which appeared to be how abominably yet blessedly little she had to do with her husband this flow of information came home to our two friends because truly mrs beale had not much more to do with her own but that was one of the reflexions that maisie could make without allowing it to break the spell of her present sympathy how could such a spell be anything but deep when sir claudes influence operating from afar at last really determined the resumption of his stepdaughters studies mrs beale again took fire about them and was quite vivid for maisie as to their being the great matter to which the dear absent one kept her up  this was the second sourcei have just alluded to the firstof the childs consciousness of something that very hopefully she described to herself as a new phase and it also presented in the brightest light the fresh enthusiasm with which mrs beale always reappeared and which really gave maisie a happier sense than she had yet had of being very dear at least to two persons that she had small remembrance at present of a third illustrates i am afraid a temporary oblivion of mrs wix an accident to be explained only by a state of unnatural excitement for what was the form taken by mrs beales enthusiasm and acquiring relief in the domestic conditions still left to her but the delightful form of reading with her little charge on lines directly prescribed and in works profusely supplied by sir claude he had got hold of an awfully good listmostly essays dont you know mrs beale had said a word always august to maisie but henceforth to be softened by hazy in fact by quite languorous edges there was at any rate a week in which no less than nine volumes arrived and the impression was to be gathered from mrs beale that the obscure intercourse she enjoyed with sir claude not only involved an account and a criticism of studies but was organised almost for the very purpose of report and consultation it was for maisies education in short that as she often repeated she closed her doorclosed it to the gentlemen who used to flock there in such numbers and whom her husbands practical desertion of her would have made it a course of the highest indelicacy to receive maisie was familiar from of old with the principle at least of the care that a woman as mrs beale phrased it attractive and exposed must take of her character and was duly impressed with the rigour of her stepmothers scruples there was literally no one of the other sex whom she seemed to feel at liberty to see at home and when the child risked an enquiry about the ladies who one by one during her own previous period had been made quite loudly welcome mrs beale hastened to inform her that one by one they had the fiends been found out after all to be awful if she wished to know more about them she was recommended to approach her father  maisie had however at the very moment of this injunction much livelier curiosities for the dream of lectures at an institution had at last become a reality thanks to sir claudes now unbounded energy in discovering what could be done it stood out in this connexion that when you came to look into things in a spirit of earnestness an immense deal could be done for very little more than your fare in the underground the institutionthere was a splendid one in a part of the town but little known to the childbecame in the glow of such a spirit a thrilling place and the walk to it from the station through glower street a pronunciation for which mrs beale once laughed at her little friend a pathway literally strewn with subjects maisie imagined herself to pluck them as she went though they thickened in the great grey rooms where the fountain of knowledge in the form usually of a high voice that she took at first to be angry plashed in the stillness of rows of faces thrust out like empty jugs it must do us goodits all so hideous mrs beale had immediately declared manifesting a purity of resolution that made these occasions quite the most harmonious of all the many on which the pair had pulled together maisie certainly had never in such an association felt so uplifted and never above all been so carried off her feet as at the moments of mrs beales breathlessly reentering the house and fairly shrieking upstairs to know if they should still be in time for a lecture her stepdaughter all ready from the earliest hours almost leaped over the banister to respond and they dashed out together in quest of learning as hard as they often dashed back to release mrs beale for other preoccupations there had been in short no bustle like these particular spasms once they had broken out since that last brief flurry when mrs wix blowing as if she were grooming her made up for everything previously lost at her fathers  these weeks as well were too few but they were flooded with a new emotion part of which indeed came from the possibility that through the long telescope of glower street or perhaps between the pillars of the institutionwhich impressive objects were what maisie thought most made it onethey should some day spy sir claude that was what mrs beale under pressure had saiddoubtless a little impatiently oh yes oh yes some day his joining them was clearly far less of a matter of course than was to have been gathered from his original profession of desire to improve in their company his own mind and this sharpened our young ladys guess that since that occasion either something destructive had happened or something desirable hadnt mrs beale had thrown but a partial light in telling her how it had turned out that nobody had been squared maisie wished at any rate that somebody would be squared however though in every approach to the temple of knowledge she watched in vain for sir claude there was no doubt about the action of his loved image as an incentive and a recompense when the institution was most on pillarsor as mrs beale put it on stiltswhen the subject was deepest and the lecture longest and the listeners ugliest then it was they both felt their patron in the background would be most pleased with them one day abruptly with a glance at this background mrs beale said to her companion well go tonight to the thingumbob at earls court an announcement putting forth its full lustre when she had made known that she referred to the great exhibition just opened in that quarter a collection of extraordinary foreign things in tremendous gardens with illuminations bands elephants switchbacks and sideshows as well as crowds of people among whom they might possibly see some one they knew maisie flew in the same bound at the neck of her friend and at the name of sir claude on which mrs beale confessed thatwell yes there was just a chance that he would be able to meet them he never of course in his terrible position knew what might happen from hour to hour but he hoped to be free and he had given mrs beale the tip bring her there on the quiet and ill try to turn upthis was clear enough on what so many weeks of privation had made of his desire to see the child it even appeared to represent on his part a yearning as constant as her own that in turn was just puzzling enough to make maisie express a bewilderment she couldnt see if they were so intensely of the same mind why the theory on which she had come back to mrs beale the general reunion the delightful trio should have broken down so in fact mrs beale furthermore only gave her more to think about in saying that their disappointment was the result of his having got into his head a kind of idea  what kind of idea  oh goodness knows she spoke with an approach to asperity hes so awfully delicate  delicatethat was ambiguous  about what he does dont you know said mrs beale she fumbled well about what we do  maisie wondered you and me  me and him silly cried mrs beale with this time a real giggle  but you dont do any harmyou dont said maisie wondering afresh and intending her emphasis as a decorous allusion to her parents  of course we dont you angelthats just the ground i take her companion exultantly responded he says he doesnt want you mixed up  mixed up with what  thats exactly what i want to know mixed up with what and how you are any more mixed mrs beale paused without ending her question she ended after an instant in a different way all you can say is that its his fancy  the tone of this in spite of its expressing a resignation the fruit of weariness that dismissed the subject conveyed so vividly how much such a fancy was not mrs beales own that our young lady was led by the mere fact of contact to arrive at a dim apprehension of the unuttered and the unknown the relation between her stepparents had then a mysterious residuum this was the first time she really had reflected that except as regards herself it was not a relationship to each other it was only what they might have happened to make it and she gathered that this in the event had been something that led sir claude to keep away from her didnt he fear she would be compromised the perception of such a scruple endeared him the more and it flashed over her that she might simplify everything by showing him how little she made of such a danger hadnt she lived with her eyes on it from her third year it was the condition most frequently discussed at the faranges where the word was always in the air and where at the age of five amid rounds of applause she could gabble it off she knew as well in short that a person could be compromised as that a person could be slapped with a hairbrush or left alone in the dark and it was equally familiar to her that each of these ordeals was in general held to have too little effect but the first thing was to make absolutely sure of mrs beale this was done by saying to her thoughtfully well if you dont mindand you really dont do you  mrs beale with a dawn of amusement considered mixing you up not a bit for what does it mean  whatever it means i dont in the least mind being mixed therefore if you dont and i dont maisie concluded dont you think that when i see him this evening i had better just tell him we dont and ask him why in the world he should     xviii   the child however was not destined to enjoy much of sir claude at the thingumbob which took for them a very different turn indeed on the spot mrs beale with hilarity had urged her to the course proposed but later at the exhibition she withdrew this allowance mentioning as a result of second thoughts that when a man was so sensitive anything at all frisky usually made him worse it would have been hard indeed for sir claude to be worse maisie felt as in the gardens and the crowd when the first dazzle had dropped she looked for him in vain up and down they had all their time the couple for frugal wistful wandering they had partaken together at home of the light vague mealmaisies name for it was a jamsupperto which they were reduced when mr farange sought his pleasure abroad it was abroad now entirely that mr farange pursued this ideal and it was the actual impression of his daughter derived from his wife that he had three days before joined a friends yacht at cowes  the place was full of sideshows to which mrs beale could introduce the little girl only alas by revealing to her so attractive so enthralling a name the sideshows each time were sixpence apiece and the fond allegiance enjoyed by the elder of our pair had been established from the earliest time in spite of a paucity of sixpences small coin dropped from her as halfheartedly as answers from bad children to lessons that had not been looked at maisie passed more slowly the great painted posters pressing with a linked arm closer to her friends pocket where she hoped for the audible chink of a shilling but the upshot of this was but to deepen her yearning if sir claude would only at last come the shillings would begin to ring the companions paused for want of one before the flowers of the forest a large presentment of bright brown ladiesthey were brown all overin a medium suggestive of tropical luxuriance and there maisie dolorously expressed her belief that he would never come at all mrs beale hereupon though discernibly disappointed reminded her that he had not been promised as a certaintya remark that caused the child to gaze at the flowers through a blur in which they became more magnificent yet oddly more confused and by which moreover confusion was imparted to the aspect of a gentleman who at that moment in the company of a lady came out of the brilliant booth the lady was so brown that maisie at first took her for one of the flowers but during the few seconds that this requireda few seconds in which she had also desolately given up sir claudeshe heard mrs beales voice behind her gather both wonder and pain into a single sharp little cry  of all the wickednessbeale  he had already without distinguishing them in the mass of strollers turned another wayit seemed at the brown ladys suggestion her course was marked over heads and shoulders by an upright scarlet plume as to the ownership of which maisie was instantly eager who is shewho is she  but mrs beale for a moment only looked after them the liarthe liar  maisie considered because hes notwhere one thought that was also a month ago in kensington gardens where her mother had not been perhaps he has come back she was quick to contribute  he never wentthe hound  that according to sir claude had been also what her mother had not done and maisie could only have a sense of something that in a maturer mind would be called the way history repeats itself  who is she she asked again  mrs beale fixed to the spot seemed lost in the vision of an opportunity missed if he had only seen meit came from between her teeth shes a brandnew one but he must have been with her since tuesday  maisie took it in shes almost black she then reported  theyre always hideous said mrs beale  this was a remark on which the child had again to reflect oh not his wives she remonstrantly exclaimed the words at another moment would probably have set her friend off but mrs beale was now in her instant vigilance too immensely on did you ever in your life see such a feather maisie presently continued  this decoration appeared to have paused at some distance and in spite of intervening groups they could both look at it oh thats the way they dressthe vulgarest of the vulgar  theyre coming backtheyll see us maisie the next moment cried and while her companion answered that this was exactly what she wanted and the child returned here they arehere they are the unconscious subjects of so much attention with a change of mind about their direction quickly retraced their steps and precipitated themselves upon their critics their unconsciousness gave mrs beale time to leap under her breath to a recognition which maisie caught  it must be mrs cuddon  maisie looked at mrs cuddon hardher lips even echoed the name what followed was extraordinarily rapida minute of livelier battle than had ever yet in so short a span at least been waged round our heroine the muffled shocklest people should noticewas violent and it was only for her later thought that the steps fell into their order the steps through which in a bewilderment not so much of sound as of silence she had come to find herself too soon for comprehension and too strangely for fear at the door of the exhibition with her father he thrust her into a hansom and got in after her and then it wasas she drove along with himthat she recovered a little what had happened face to face with them in the gardens he had seen them and there had been a moment of checked concussion during which in a glare of black eyes and a toss of red plumage mrs cuddon had recognised them ejaculated and vanished there had been another moment at which she became aware of sir claude also poised there in surprise but out of her fathers view as if he had been warned off at the very moment of reaching them it fell into its place with all the rest that she had heard mrs beale say to her father but whether low or loud was now lost to her something about his having this time a new one on which he had growled something indistinct but apparently in the tone and of the sort that the child from her earliest years had associated with hearing somebody retort to somebody that somebody was another oh i stick to the old mrs beale had then quite loudly pronounced and her accent even as the cab got away was still in the air maisies effective companion having spoken no other word from the moment of whisking her offnone at least save the indistinguishable address which over the top of the hansom and poised on the step he had given the driver reconstructing these things later maisie theorised that she at this point would have put a question to him had not the silence into which he charmed her or scared hershe could scarcely tell whichcome from his suddenly making her feel his arm about her feel as he drew her close that he was agitated in a way he had never yet shown her it struck her he trembled trembled too much to speak and this had the effect of making her with an emotion which though it had begun to throb in an instant was by no means all dread conform to his portentous hush the act of possession that his pressure in a manner advertised came back to her after the longest of the long intermissions that had ever let anything come back they drove and drove and he kept her close she stared straight before her holding her breath watching one dark street succeed another and strangely conscious that what it all meant was somehow that papa was less to be left out of everything than she had supposed it took her but a minute to surrender to this discovery which in the form of his present embrace suggested a purpose in him prodigiously reaffirmed and with that a confused confidence she neither knew exactly what he had done nor what he was doing she could only altogether impressed and rather proud vibrate with the sense that he had jumped up to do something and that she had as quickly become a part of it it was a part of it too that here they were at a house that seemed not large but in the fresh white front of which the streetlamp showed a smartness of flowerboxes the child had been in thousands of storiesall mrs wixs and her own to say nothing of the richest romances of french elisebut she had never been in such a story as this by the time he had helped her out of the cab which drove away and she heard in the door of the house the prompt little click of his key the arabian nights had quite closed round her  from this minute that pitch of the wondrous was in everything particularly in such an instant open sesame and in the departure of the cab a rattling void filled with relinquished stepparents it was with the vividness the almost blinding whiteness of the light that sprang responsive to papas quick touch of a little brass knob on the wall in a place that at the top of a short soft staircase struck her as the most beautiful she had ever seen in her life the next thing she perceived it to be was the drawingroom of a ladyof a lady she could see in a moment and not of a gentleman not even of one like papa himself or even like sir claudewhose things were as much prettier than mammas as it had always had to be confessed that mammas were prettier than mrs beales in the middle of the small bright room and the presence of more curtains and cushions more pictures and mirrors more palmtrees drooping over brocaded and gilded nooks more little silver boxes scattered over little crooked tables and little oval miniatures hooked upon velvet screens than mrs beale and her ladyship together could in an unnatural alliance have dreamed of mustering the child became aware with a sharp foretaste of compassion of something that was strangely like a relegation to obscurity of each of those women of taste it was a stranger operation still that her father should on the spot be presented to her as quite advantageously and even grandly at home in the dazzling scene and himself by so much the more separated from scenes inferior to it she spent with him in it while explanations continued to hang back twenty minutes that in their sudden drop of danger affected her though there were neither buns nor gingerbeer like an extemporised expensive treat  is she very rich he had begun to strike her as almost embarrassed so shy that he might have found himself with a young lady with whom he had little in common she was literally moved by this apprehension to offer him some tactful relief  beale farange stood and smiled at his young lady his back to the fanciful fireplace his light overcoatthe very lightest in londonwide open and his wonderful lustrous beard completely concealing the expanse of his shirtfront it pleased her more than ever to think that papa was handsome and though as high aloft as mamma and almost in his specially florid eveningdress as splendid of a beauty somehow less belligerent less terrible  the countess why do you ask me that  maisies eyes opened wider is she a countess  he seemed to treat her wonder as a positive tribute oh yes my dear but it isnt an english title  her manner appreciated this is it a french one  no nor french either its american  she conversed agreeably ah then of course she must be rich she took in such a combination of nationality and rank i never saw anything so lovely  did you have a sight of her beale asked  at the exhibition maisie smiled she was gone too quick  her father laughed she did slope she had feared he would say something about mrs beale and sir claude yet the way he spared them made her rather uneasy too all he risked was the next minute she has a horror of vulgar scenes  this was something she neednt take up she could still continue bland but where do you suppose she went  oh i thought shed have taken a cab and have been here by this time but shell turn up all right  im sure i hope she will maisie said she spoke with an earnestness begotten of the impression of all the beauty about them to which in person the countess might make further contribution we came awfully fast she added  her father again laughed loud yes my dear i made you step out he waited an instant then pursued i want her to see you  maisie at this rejoiced in the attention that for their evening out mrs beale even to the extent of personally doing up her old hat had given her appearance meanwhile her father went on youll like her awfully  oh im sure i shall after which either from the effect of having said so much or from that of a sudden glimpse of the impossibility of saying more she felt an embarrassment and sought refuge in a minor branch of the subject i thought she was mrs cuddon  beales gaiety rather increased than diminished you mean my wife did my dear child my wifes a damned fool he had the oddest air of speaking of his wife as of a person whom she might scarcely have known so that the refuge of her scruple didnt prove particularly happy beale on the other hand appeared after an instant himself to feel a scruple what i mean is to speak seriously that she doesnt really know anything about anything he paused following the childs charmed eyes and tentative step or two as they brought her nearer to the pretty things on one of the tables she thinks she has good things dont you know he quite jeered at mrs beales delusion  maisie felt she must confess that it was one everything she had missed at the sideshows was made up to her by the countesss luxuries yes she considered she does think that  there was again a dryness in the way beale replied that it didnt matter what she thought but there was an increasing sweetness for his daughter in being with him so long without his doing anything worse the whole hour of course was to remain with her for days and weeks ineffaceably illumined and confirmed by the end of which she was able to read into it a hundred things that had been at the moment mere miraculous pleasantness what they at the moment came to was simply that her companion was still in a good deal of a flutter yet wished not to show it and that just in proportion as he succeeded in this attempt he was able to encourage her to regard him as kind he moved about the room after a little showed her things spoke to her as a person of taste told her the name which she remembered of the famous french lady represented in one of the miniatures and remarked as if he had caught her wistful over a trinket or a trailing stuff that he made no doubt the countess on coming in would give her something jolly he spied a pink satin box with a lookingglass let into the cover which he raised with a quick facetious flourish to offer her the privilege of six rows of chocolate bonbons cutting out thereby sir claude who had never gone beyond four rows i can do what i like with these he said for i dont mind telling you i gave em to her myself the countess had evidently appreciated the gift there were numerous gaps a ravage now quite unchecked in the array even while they waited together maisie had her sense which was the mark of what their separation had become of her having grown for him since the last time he had as it were noticed her and by increase of years and of inches if by nothing else much more of a little person to reckon with yes this was a part of the positive awkwardness that he carried off by being almost foolishly tender there was a passage during which on a yellow silk sofa under one of the palms he had her on his knee stroking her hair playfully holding her off while he showed his shining fangs and let her with a vague affectionate helpless pointless dear old girl dear little daughter inhale the fragrance of his cherished beard she must have been sorry for him she afterwards knew so well could she privately follow his difficulty in being specific to her about anything she had such possibilities of vibration of response that it needed nothing more than this to make up to her in fact for omissions the tears came into her eyes again as they had done when in the park that day the captain told her so splendidly that her mother was good what was this but splendid toothis still directer goodness of her father and this unexampled shining solitude with him out of which everything had dropped but that he was papa and that he was magnificent it didnt spoil it that she finally felt he must have as he became restless some purpose he didnt quite see his way to bring out for in the freshness of their recovered fellowship she would have lent herself gleefully to his suggesting or even to his pretending that their relations were easy and graceful there was something in him that seemed and quite touchingly to ask her to help him to pretendpretend he knew enough about her life and her education her means of subsistence and her view of himself to give the questions he couldnt put her a natural domestic tone she would have pretended with ecstasy if he could only have given her the cue she waited for it while between his big teeth he breathed the sighs she didnt know to be stupid and as if though he was so stupid all through he had let the friendly suffusion of her eyes yet tell him she was ready for anything he floundered about wondering what the devil he could lay hold of     xix   when he had lighted a cigarette and begun to smoke in her face it was as if he had struck with the match the note of some queer clumsy ferment of old professions old scandals old duties a dim perception of what he possessed in her and what if everything had onlydamn itbeen totally different she might still be able to give him what she was able to give him however as his blinking eyes seemed to make out through the smoke would be simply what he should be able to get from her to give something to give here on the spot was all her own desire among the old things that came back was her little instinct of keeping the peace it made her wonder more sharply what particular thing she could do or not do what particular word she could speak or not speak what particular line she could take or not take that might for every one even for the countess give a better turn to the crisis she was ready in this interest for an immense surrender a surrender of everything but sir claude of everything but mrs beale the immensity didnt include them but if he had an idea at the back of his head she had also one in a recess as deep and for a time while they sat together there was an extraordinary mute passage between her vision of this vision of his his vision of her vision and her vision of his vision of her vision what there was no effective record of indeed was the small strange pathos on the childs part of an innocence so saturated with knowledge and so directed to diplomacy what further beale finally laid hold of while he masked again with his fine presence half the flounces of the fireplace was do you know my dear i shall soon be off to america it struck his daughter both as a short cut and as the way he wouldnt have said it to his wife but his wife figured with a bright superficial assurance in her response  do you mean with mrs beale  her father looked at her hard dont be a little ass  her silence appeared to represent a concentrated effort not to be then with the countess  with her or without her my dear that concerns only your poor daddy she has big interests over there and she wants me to take a look at them  maisie threw herself into them will that take very long  yes theyre in such a muddleit may take months now what i want to hear you know is whether youd like to come along  planted once more before him in the middle of the room she felt herself turning white i she gasped yet feeling as soon as she had spoken that such a note of dismay was not altogether pretty she felt it still more while her father replied with a shake of his legs a toss of his cigaretteash and a fidgety lookhe was for ever taking oneall the length of his waistcoat and trousers that she neednt be quite so disgusted it helped her in a few seconds to appear more as he would like her that she saw in the lovely light of the countesss splendour exactly however she appeared the right answer to make dear papa ill go with you anywhere  he turned his back to her and stood with his nose at the glass of the chimneypiece while he brushed specks of ash out of his beard then he abruptly said do you know anything about your brute of a mother  it was just of her brute of a mother that the manner of the question in a remarkable degree reminded her it had the free flight of one of idas fine bridgings of space with the sense of this was kindled for maisie at the same time an inspiration oh yes i know everything and she became so radiant that her father seeing it in the mirror turned back to her and presently on the sofa had her at his knee again and was again particularly affecting maisies inspiration instructed her pressingly that the more she should be able to say about mamma the less she would be called upon to speak of her stepparents she kept hoping the countess would come in before her power to protect them was exhausted and it was now in closer quarters with her companion that the idea at the back of her head shifted its place to her lips she told him she had met her mother in the park with a gentleman who while sir claude had strolled with her ladyship had been kind and had sat and talked to her narrating the scene with a remembrance of her pledge of secrecy to the captain quite brushed away by the joy of seeing beale listen without profane interruption it was almost an amazement but it was indeed all a joy thus to be able to guess that papa was at last quite tired of his angerof his anger at any rate about mamma he was only bored with her now that made it however the more imperative that his spent displeasure shouldnt be blown out again it charmed the child to see how much she could interest him and the charm remained even when after asking her a dozen questions he observed musingly and a little obscurely yes damned if she wont for in this too there was a detachment a wise weariness that made her feel safe she had had to mention sir claude though she mentioned him as little as possible and beale only appeared to look quite over his head it pieced itself together for her that this was the mildness of general indifference a source of profit so great for herself personally that if the countess was the author of it she was prepared literally to hug the countess she betrayed that eagerness by a restless question about her to which her father replied oh she has a head on her shoulders ill back her to get out of anything he looked at maisie quite as if he could trace the connexion between her enquiry and the impatience of her gratitude do you mean to say youd really come with me  she felt as if he were now looking at her very hard indeed and also as if she had grown ever so much older ill do anything in the world you ask me papa  he gave again with a laugh and with his legs apart his proprietary glance at his waistcoat and trousers thats a way my dear of saying no thank you you know you dont want to go the least little mite you cant humbug me beale farange laid down i dont want to bully youi never bullied you in my life but i make you the offer and its to take or to leave your mother will never again have any more to do with you than if you were a kitchenmaid she had turned out for going wrong therefore of course im your natural protector and youve a right to get everything out of me you can nows your chance you knowyou wont be halfclever if you dont you cant say i dont put it before youyou cant say i aint kind to you or that i dont play fair mind you never say that you knowit would bring me down on you i know whats proper ill take you again just as i have taken you again and again and im much obliged to you for making up such a face  she was conscious enough that her face indeed couldnt please him if it showed any signjust as she hoped it didntof her sharp impression of what he now really wanted to do wasnt he trying to turn the tables on her embarrass her somehow into admitting that what would really suit her little book would be after doing so much for good manners to leave her wholly at liberty to arrange for herself she began to be nervous again it rolled over her that this was their parting their parting for ever and that he had brought her there for so many caresses only because it was important such an occasion should look better for him than any other for her to spoil it by the note of discord would certainly give him ground for complaint and the child was momentarily bewildered between her alternatives of agreeing with him about her wanting to get rid of him and displeasing him by pretending to stick to him so she found for the moment no solution but to murmur very helplessly oh papaoh papa  i know what youre up todont tell me after which he came straight over and in the most inconsequent way in the world clasped her in his arms a moment and rubbed his beard against her cheek then she understood as well as if he had spoken it that what he wanted hang it was that she should let him off with all the honourswith all the appearance of virtue and sacrifice on his side it was exactly as if he had broken out to her i say you little booby help me to be irreproachable to be noble and yet to have none of the beastly bore of it theres only impropriety enough for one of us so you must take it all repudiate your dear old daddyin the face mind you of his tender supplications he cant be rough with youit isnt in his nature therefore youll have successfully chucked him because he was too generous to be as firm with you poor man as was after all his duty this was what he communicated in a series of tremendous pats on the back that portion of her person had never been so thumped since moddle thumped her when she choked after a moment he gave her the further impression of having become sure enough of her to be able very gracefully to say out you know your mother loathes you loathes you simply and ive been thinking over your precious manthe fellow you told me about  well maisie replied with competence im sure of him  her father was vague for an instant do you mean sure of his liking you  oh no of his liking her  beale had a return of gaiety theres no accounting for tastes its what they all say you know  i dont careim sure of him maisie repeated  sure you mean that shell bolt  maisie knew all about bolting but decidedly she was older and there was something in her that could wince at the way her father made the ugly wordugly enough at bestsound flat and low it prompted her to amend his allusion which she did by saying i dont know what shell do but shell be happy  let us hope so said bealealmost as for edification the more happy she is at any rate the less shell want you about thats why i press you he agreeably pursued to consider this handsome offeri mean seriously you knowof your sole surviving parent their eyes at this met again in a long and extraordinary communion which terminated in his ejaculating ah you little scoundrel she took it from him in the manner it seemed to her he would like best and with a success that encouraged him to go on you are a deep little devil her silence ticking like a watch acknowledged even this in confirmation of which he finally brought out youve settled it with the other pair  well what if i have she sounded to herself most bold  her father quite as in the old days broke into a peal why dont you know theyre awful  she grew bolder still i dont carenot a bit  but theyre probably the worst people in the world and the very greatest criminals beale pleasantly urged im not the man my dear not to let you know it  well it doesnt prevent them from loving me they love me tremendously maisie turned crimson to hear herself  her companion fumbled almost any onelet alone a daughterwould have seen how conscientious he wanted to be i dare say but do you know why she braved his eyes and he added youre a jolly good pretext  for what maisie asked  why for their game i neednt tell you what that is  the child reflected well then thats all the more reason  reason for what pray  for their being kind to me  and for your keeping in with them beale roared again it was as if his spirits rose and rose do you realise pray that in saying that youre a monster  she turned it over a monster  theyve made one of you upon my honour its quite awful it shows the kind of people they are dont you understand beale pursued that when theyve made you as horrid as they canas horrid as themselvestheyll just simply chuck you  she had at this a flicker of passion they wont chuck me  i beg your pardon her father courteously insisted its my duty to put it before you i shouldnt forgive myself if i didnt point out to you that theyll cease to require you he spoke as if with an appeal to her intelligence that she must be ashamed not adequately to meet and this gave a real distinction to his superior delicacy  it cleared the case as he had wished cease to require me because they wont care she paused with that sketch of her idea  of course sir claude wont care if his wife bolts thats his game it will suit him down to the ground  this was a proposition maisie could perfectly embrace but it still left a loophole for triumph she turned it well over you mean if mamma doesnt come back ever at all the composure with which her face was presented to that prospect would have shown a spectator the long road she had travelled well but that wont put mrs beale  in the same comfortable position beale took her up with relish he had sprung to his feet again shaking his legs and looking at his shoes right you are darling something more will be wanted for mrs beale he just paused then he added but she may not have long to wait for it  maisie also for a minute looked at his shoes though they were not the pair she most admired the laced yellow uppers and patentleather complement at last with a question she raised her eyes arent you coming back  once more he hung fire after which he gave a small laugh that in the oddest way in the world reminded her of the unique sounds she had heard emitted by mrs wix it may strike you as extraordinary that i should make you such an admission and in point of fact youre not to understand that i do but well put it that way to help your decision the point is that thats the way my wife will presently be sure to put it youll hear her shrieking that shes deserted so that she may just pile up her wrongs shell be as free as she likes thenas free you see as your mothers muff of a husband they wont have anything more to consider and theyll just put you into the street do i understand beale enquired that in the face of what i press on you you still prefer to take the risk of that it was the most wonderful appeal any gentleman had ever addressed to his daughter and it had placed maisie in the middle of the room again while her father moved slowly about her with his hands in his pockets and something in his step that seemed more than anything else he had done to show the habit of the place she turned her fevered little eyes over his friends brightnesses as if on her own side to press for some help in a quandary unexampled as if also the pressure reached him he after an instant stopped short completing the prodigy of his attitude and the pride of his loyalty by a supreme formulation of the general inducement youve an eye love yes theres money no end of money  this affected her at first in the manner of some great flashing dazzle in one of the pantomimes to which sir claude had taken her she saw nothing in it but what it directly conveyed and shall i never never see you again  if i do go to america beale brought it out like a man never never never  hereupon with the utmost absurdity she broke down everything gave way everything but the horror of hearing herself definitely utter such an ugliness as the acceptance of that so she only stiffened herself and said then i cant give you up  she held him some seconds looking at her showing her a strained grimace a perfect parade of all his teeth in which it seemed to her she could read the disgust he didnt quite like to express at this departure from the pliability she had practically promised but before she could attenuate in any way the crudity of her collapse he gave an impatient jerk which took him to the window she heard a vehicle stop beale looked out then he freshly faced her he still said nothing but she knew the countess had come back there was a silence again between them but with a different shade of embarrassment from that of their united arrival and it was still without speaking that abruptly repeating one of the embraces of which he had already been so prodigal he whisked her back to the lemon sofa just before the door of the room was thrown open it was thus in renewed and intimate union with him that she was presented to a person whom she instantly recognised as the brown lady  the brown lady looked almost as astonished though not quite as alarmed as when at the exhibition she had gasped in the face of mrs beale maisie in truth almost gasped in her own this was with the fuller perception that she was brown indeed she literally struck the child more as an animal than as a real lady she might have been a clever frizzled poodle in a frill or a dreadful human monkey in a spangled petticoat she had a nose that was far too big and eyes that were far too small and a moustache that was well not so happy a feature as sir claudes beale jumped up to her while to the childs astonishment though as if in a quick intensity of thought the countess advanced as gaily as if for many a day nothing awkward had happened for any one maisie in spite of a large acquaintance with the phenomenon had never seen it so promptly established that nothing awkward was to be mentioned the next minute the countess had kissed her and exclaimed to beale with bright tender reproach why you never told me half my dear child she cried it was awfully nice of you to come  but she hasnt comeshe wont come beale answered ive put it to her how much youd like it but she declines to have anything to do with us  the countess stood smiling and after an instant that was mainly taken up with the shock of her weird aspect maisie felt herself reminded of another smile which was not ugly though also interestedthe kind light thrown that day in the park from the clean fair face of the captain papas captainyeswas the countess but she wasnt nearly so nice as the other it all came back doubtless to maisies minor appreciation of ladies shouldnt you like me said this one endearingly to take you to spa  to spa the child repeated the name to gain time not to show how the countess brought back to her a dim remembrance of a strange woman with a horrid face who once years before in an omnibus bending to her from an opposite seat had suddenly produced an orange and murmured little dearie wont you have it she had felt then for some reason a small silly terror though afterwards conscious that her interlocutress unfortunately hideous had particularly meant to be kind this was also what the countess meant yet the few words she had uttered and the smile with which she had uttered them immediately cleared everything up oh no she wanted to go nowhere with her for her presence had already in a few seconds dissipated the happy impression of the room and put an end to the pleasure briefly taken in beales command of such elegance there was no command of elegance in his having exposed her to the approach of the short fat wheedling whiskered person in whom she had now to recognise the only figure wholly without attraction involved in any of the intimate connexions her immediate circle had witnessed the growth of she was abashed meanwhile however at having appeared to weigh in the balance the place to which she had been invited and she added as quickly as possible it isnt to america then the countess at this looked sharply at beale and beale airily enough asked what the deuce it mattered when she had already given him to understand she wanted to have nothing to do with them there followed between her companions a passage of which the sense was drowned for her in the deepening inward hum of her mere desire to get off though she was able to guess later on that her father must have put it to his friend that it was no use talking that she was an obstinate little pig and that besides she was really old enough to choose for herself it glimmered back to her indeed that she must have failed quite dreadfully to seem ideally other than rude inasmuch as before she knew it she had visibly given the impression that if they didnt allow her to go home she should cry oh if there had ever been a thing to cry about it was being so consciously and gawkily below the handsomest offers any one could ever have received the great pain of the thing was that she could see the countess liked her enough to wish to be liked in return and it was from the idea of a return she sought utterly to flee it was the idea of a return that after a confusion of loud words had broken out between the others brought to her lips with the tremor preceding disaster cant i please be sent home in a cab yes the countess wanted her and the countess was wounded and chilled and she couldnt help it and it was all the more dreadful because it only made the countess more coaxing and more impossible the only thing that sustained either of them perhaps till the cab camemaisie presently saw it would comewas its being in the air somehow that beale had done what he wanted he went out to look for a conveyance the servants he said had gone to bed but she shouldnt be kept beyond her time the countess left the room with him and alone in the possession of it maisie hoped she wouldnt come back it was all the effect of her facethe child simply couldnt look at it and meet its expression halfway all in a moment too that queer expression had leaped into the lovely thingsall in a moment she had had to accept her father as liking some one whom she was sure neither her mother nor mrs beale nor mrs wix nor sir claude nor the captain nor even mr perriam and lord eric could possibly have liked three minutes later downstairs with the cab at the door it was perhaps as a final confession of not having much to boast of that on taking leave of her he managed to press her to his bosom without her seeing his face for herself she was so eager to go that their parting reminded her of nothing not even of a single one of all the nevers that above as the penalty of not cleaving to him he had attached to the question of their meeting again there was something in the countess that falsified everything even the great interests in america and yet more the first flush of that superiority to mrs beale and to mamma which had been expressed in sèvres sets and silver boxes these were still there but perhaps there were no great interests in america mamma had known an american who was not a bit like this one she was not however of noble rank her name was only mrs tucker maisies detachment would none the less have been more complete if she had not suddenly had to exclaim oh dear i havent any money  her fathers teeth at this were such a picture of appetite without action as to be a match for any plea of poverty make your stepmother pay  stepmothers dont pay cried the countess no stepmother ever paid in her life the next moment they were in the street together and the next the child was in the cab with the countess on the pavement but close to her quickly taking money from a purse whisked out of a pocket her father had vanished and there was even yet nothing in that to reawaken the pang of loss heres money said the brown lady go the sound was commanding the cab rattled off maisie sat there with her hand full of coin all that for a cab as they passed a streetlamp she bent to see how much what she saw was a cluster of sovereigns there must then have been great interests in america it was still at any rate the arabian nights     xx   the money was far too much even for a fee in a fairytale and in the absence of mrs beale who though the hour was now late had not yet returned to the regents park susan ash in the hall as loud as maisie was low and as bold as she was bland produced on the exhibition offered under the dim vigil of the lamp that made the place a contrast to the childs recent scene of light the halfcrown that an unsophisticated cabman could pronounce to be the least he would take it was apparently long before mrs beale would arrive and in the interval maisie had been induced by the prompt susan not only to go to bed like a darling dear but in still richer expression of that character to devote to the repayment of obligations general as well as particular one of the sovereigns in the ordered array that on the dressingtable upstairs was naturally not less dazzling to a lone orphan of a housemaid than to the subject of the manoeuvres of a quartette this subject went to sleep with her property gathered into a knotted handkerchief the largest that could be produced and lodged under her pillow but the explanations that on the morrow were inevitably more complete with mrs beale than they had been with her humble friend found their climax in a surrender also more becomingly free there were explanations indeed that mrs beale had to give as well as to ask and the most striking of these was to the effect that it was dreadful for a little girl to take money from a woman who was simply the vilest of their sex the sovereigns were examined with some attention the result of which however was to make the author of that statement desire to know what if one really went into the matter they could be called but the wages of sin her companion went into it merely so far as the question of what then they were to do with them on which mrs beale who had by this time put them into her pocket replied with dignity and with her hand on the place were to send them back on the spot susan the child soon afterwards learnt had been invited to contribute to this act of restitution her one appropriated coin but a closer clutch of the treasure showed in her private assurance to maisie that there was a limit to the way she could be done maisie had been open with mrs beale about the whole of last nights transaction but she now found herself on the part of their indignant inferior a recipient of remarks that were so many ringing tokens of that ladys own suppressions one of these bore upon the extraordinary hourit was three in the morning if she really wanted to knowat which mrs beale had reentered the house another in accents as to which maisies criticism was still intensely tacit characterised her appeal as such a gime such a shime as one had never had to put up with a third treated with some vigour the question of the enormous sums due belowstairs in every department for gratuitous labour and wasted zeal our young ladys consciousness was indeed mainly filled for several days with the apprehension created by the too slow subsidence of her attendants sense of wrong these days would become terrific like the revolutions she had learnt by heart in histories if an outbreak in the kitchen should crown them and to promote that prospect she had through susans eyes more than one glimpse of the way in which revolutions are prepared to listen to susan was to gather that the spark applied to the inflammables and already causing them to crackle would prove to have been the circumstance of ones being called a horrid low thief for refusing to part with ones own the redeeming point of this tension was on the fifth day that it actually appeared to have had to do with a breathless perception in our heroines breast that scarcely more as the centre of sir claudes than as that of susans energies she had soon after breakfast been conveyed from london to folkestone and established at a lovely hotel these agents before her wondering eyes had combined to carry through the adventure and to give it the air of having owed its success to the fact that mrs beale had as susan said but just stepped out when sir claude watch in hand had met this fact with the exclamation then pack miss farange and come off with us there had ensued on the stairs a series of gymnastics of a nature to bring miss faranges heart into miss faranges mouth she sat with sir claude in a fourwheeler while he still held his watch held it longer than any doctor who had ever felt her pulse long enough to give her a vision of something like the ecstasy of neglecting such an opportunity to show impatience the ecstasy had begun in the schoolroom and over the berceuse quite in the manner of the same foretaste on the day a little while back when susan had panted up and she herself after the hint about the duchess had sailed down for what harm then had there been in drops and disappointments if she could still have even only a moment the sensation of such a name brought up it had remained with her that her father had foretold her she would some day be in the street but it clearly wouldnt be this day and she felt justified of the preference betrayed to that parent as soon as her visitor had set susan in motion and laid his hand while she waited with him kindly on her own this was what the captain in kensington gardens had done her present situation reminded her a little of that one and renewed the dim wonder of the fashion after which from the first such pats and pulls had struck her as the steps and signs of other peoples business and even a little as the wriggle or the overflow of their difficulties what had failed her and what had frightened her on the night of the exhibition lost themselves at present alike in the impression that any surprise now about to burst from sir claude would be too big to burst all at once any awe that might have sprung from his air of leaving out her stepmother was corrected by the force of a general rule the odd truth that if mrs beale now never came nor went without making her think of him it was never to balance that the main mark of his own renewed reality to appear to be a reference to mrs beale to be with sir claude was to think of sir claude and that law governed maisies mind until through a sudden lurch of the cab which had at last taken in susan and ever so many bundles and almost reached charing cross it popped again somehow into her dizzy head the longlost image of mrs wix  it was singular but from this time she understood and she followed followed with the sense of an ample fillingout of any void created by symptoms of avoidance and of flight her ecstasy was a thing that had yet more of a face than of a back to turn a pair of eyes still directed to mrs wix even after the slight surprise of their not finding her as the journey expanded either at the london station or at the folkestone hotel it took few hours to make the child feel that if she was in neither of these places she was at least everywhere else maisie had known all along a great deal but never so much as she was to know from this moment on and as she learned in particular during the couple of days that she was to hang in the air as it were over the sea which represented in breezy blueness and with a summer charm a crossing of more spaces than the channel it was granted her at this time to arrive at divinations so ample that i shall have no room for the goal if i attempt to trace the stages as to which therefore i must be content to say that the fullest expression we may give to sir claudes conduct is a poor and pale copy of the picture it presented to his young friend abruptly that morning he had yielded to the action of the idea pumped into him for weeks by mrs wix on lines of approach that she had been capable of the extraordinary art of preserving from entanglement in the fine network of his relations with mrs beale the breath of her sincerity blowing without a break had puffed him up to the flight by which in the degree i have indicated maisie too was carried off her feet this consisted neither in more nor in less than the brave stroke of his getting off from mrs beale as well as from his wifeof making with the child straight for some such foreign land as would give a support to mrs wixs dream that she might still see his errors renounced and his delinquencies redeemed it would all be a sacrificeunder eyes that would miss no faintest shadeto what even the strange frequenters of her ladyships earlier period used to call the real good of the little unfortunate maisies head held a suspicion of much that during the last long interval had confusedly but quite candidly come and gone in his own a glimpse almost awestricken in its gratitude of the miracle her old governess had wrought that functionary could not in this connexion have been more impressive even at secondhand if she had been a prophetess with an open scroll or some ardent abbess speaking with the lips of the church she had clung day by day to their plastic associate plying him with her deep narrow passion doing her simple utmost to convert him and so working on him that he had at last really embraced his fine chance that the chance was not delusive was sufficiently guaranteed by the completeness with which he could finally figure it out that in case of his taking action neither ida nor beale whose book on each side it would only too well suit would make any sort of row  it sounds no doubt too penetrating but it was not all as an effect of sir claudes betrayals that maisie was able to piece together the beauty of the special influence through which for such stretches of time he had refined upon propriety by keeping so far as possible his sentimental interests distinct she had ever of course in her mind fewer names than conceptions but it was only with this drawback that she now made out her companions absences to have had for their ground that he was the lover of her stepmother and that the lover of her stepmother could scarce logically pretend to a superior right to look after her maisie had by this time embraced the implication of a kind of natural divergence between lovers and little girls it was just this indeed that could throw light on the probable contents of the pencilled note deposited on the halltable in the regents park and which would greet mrs beale on her return maisie freely figured it as provisionally jocular in tone even though to herself on this occasion sir claude turned a graver face than he had shown in any crisis but that of putting her into the cab when she had been horrid to him after her parting with the captain he might really be embarrassed but he would be sure to her view to have muffled in some bravado of pleasantry the disturbance produced at her fathers by the removal of a valued servant not that there wasnt a great deal too that wouldnt be in the notea great deal for which a more comfortable place was maisies light little brain where it hummed away hour after hour and caused the first outlook at folkestone to swim in a softness of colour and sound it became clear in this medium that her stepfather had really now only to take into account his entanglement with mrs beale wasnt he at last disentangled from every one and every thing else the obstacle to the rupture pressed upon him by mrs wix in the interest of his virtue would be simply that he was in love or rather to put it more precisely that mrs beale had left him no doubt of the degree in which she was she was so much so as to have succeeded in making him accept for a time her infatuated grasp of him and even to some extent the idea of what they yet might do together with a little diplomacy and a good deal of patience i may not even answer for it that maisie was not aware of how in this mrs beale failed to share his all but insurmountable distaste for their allowing their little charge to breathe the air of their gross irregularityhis contention in a word that they should either cease to be irregular or cease to be parental their little charge for herself had long ago adopted the view that even mrs wix had at one time not thought prohibitively coarsethe view that she was after all as a little charge morally at home in atmospheres it would be appalling to analyse if mrs wix however ultimately appalled had now set her heart on strong measures maisie as i have intimated could also work round both to the reasons for them and to the quite other reasons for that ladys not as yet at least appearing in them at firsthand  oh decidedly i shall never get you to believe the number of things she saw and the number of secrets she discovered why in the world for instance couldnt sir claude have kept it from herexcept on the hypothesis of his not caring tothat when you came to look at it and so far as it was a question of vested interests he had quite as much right in her as her stepmother not to say a right that mrs beale was in no position to dispute he failed at all events of any such successful ambiguity as could keep her when once they began to look across at france from regarding even what was least explained as most in the spirit of their old happy times their rambles and expeditions in the easier better days of their first acquaintance never before had she had so the sense of giving him a lead for the sort of treatment of what was between them that would best carry it off or of his being grateful to her for meeting him so much in the right place she met him literally at the very point where mrs beale was most to be reckoned with the point of the jealousy that was sharp in that lady and of the need of their keeping it as long as possible obscure to her that poor mrs wix had still a hand yes she met him too in the truth of the matter that as her stepmother had had no one else to be jealous of she had made up for so gross a privation by directing the sentiment to a moral influence sir claude appeared absolutely to convey in a wink that a moral influence capable of pulling a string was after all a moral influence exposed to the scratching out of its eyes and that this being the case there was somebody they couldnt afford to leave unprotected before they should see a little better what mrs beale was likely to do maisie true enough had not to put it into words to rejoin in the coffeeroom at luncheon what can she do but come to you if papa does take a step that will amount to legal desertion neither had he then in answer to articulate anything but the jollity of their having found a table at a window from which as they partook of cold beef and apollinarisfor he hinted they would have to save lots of moneythey could let their eyes hover tenderly on the faroff white cliffs that so often had signalled to the embarrassed english a promise of safety maisie stared at them as if she might really make out after a little a queer dear figure perched on thema figure as to which she had already the subtle sense that wherever perched it would be the very oddest yet seen in france but it was at least as exciting to feel where mrs wix wasnt as it would have been to know where she was and if she wasnt yet at boulogne this only thickened the plot  if she was not to be seen that day however the evening was marked by an apparition before which none the less overstrained suspense folded on the spot its wings adjusting her respirations and attaching under dropped lashes all her thoughts to a smartness of frock and frill for which she could reflect that she had not appealed in vain to a loyalty in susan ash triumphant over the nice things their feverish flight had left behind maisie spent on a bench in the garden of the hotel the halfhour before dinner that mysterious ceremony of the table dhôte for which she had prepared with a punctuality of flutter sir claude beside her was occupied with a cigarette and the afternoon papers and though the hotel was full the garden shewed the particular void that ensues upon the sound of the dressingbell she had almost had time to weary of the human scene her own humanity at any rate in the shape of a smutch on her scanty skirt had held her so long that as soon as she raised her eyes they rested on a high fair drapery by which smutches were put to shame and which had glided toward her over the grass without her noting its rustle she followed up its stiff sheenup and up from the ground where it had stoppedtill at the end of a considerable journey her impression felt the shock of the fixed face which surmounting it seemed to offer the climax of the dressed condition why mamma she cried the next instantcried in a tone that as she sprang to her feet brought sir claude to his own beside her and gave her ladyship a few yards off the advantage of their momentary confusion poor maisies was immense her mothers drop had the effect of one of the iron shutters that in evening walks with susan ash she had seen suddenly at the touch of a spring rattle down over shining shopfronts the light of foreign travel was darkened at a stroke she had a horrible sense that they were caught and for the first time of her life in idas presence she so far translated an impulse into an invidious act as to clutch straight at the hand of her responsible confederate it didnt help her that he appeared at first equally hushed with horror a minute during which in the empty garden with its long shadows on the lawn its blue sea over the hedge and its startled peace in the air both her elders remained as stiff as tall tumblers filled to the brim and held straight for fear of a spill  at last in a tone that enriched the whole surprise by its unexpected softness her mother said to sir claude do you mind at all my speaking to her  oh no do you his reply was so long in coming that maisie was the first to find the right note  he laughed as he seemed to take it from her and she felt a sufficient concession in his manner of addressing their visitor how in the world did you know we were here  his wife at this came the rest of the way and sat down on the bench with a hand laid on her daughter whom she gracefully drew to her and in whom at her touch the fear just kindled gave a second jump but now in quite another direction sir claude on the further side resumed his seat and his newspapers so that the three grouped themselves like a family party his connexion in the oddest way in the world almost cynically and in a flash acknowledged and the mother patting the child into conformities unspeakable maisie could already feel how little it was sir claude and she who were caught she had the positive sense of their catching their relative catching her in the act of getting rid of her burden with a finality that showed her as unprecedentedly relaxed oh yes the fear had dropped and she had never been so irrevocably parted with as in the pressure of possession now supremely exerted by idas longgloved and muchbangled arm i went to the regents parkthis was presently her ladyships answer to sir claude  do you mean today  this morning just after your own call there thats how i found you out thats what has brought me  sir claude considered and maisie waited whom then did you see  ida gave a sound of indulgent mockery i like your scare i know your game i didnt see the person i risked seeing but i had been ready to take my chance of her she addressed herself to maisie she had encircled her more closely i asked for you my dear but i saw no one but a dirty parlourmaid she was red in the face with the great things that as she told me had just happened in the absence of her mistress and she luckily had the sense to have made out the place to which sir claude had come to take you if he hadnt given a false scent i should find you here that was the supposition on which ive proceeded ida had never been so explicit about proceeding or supposing and maisie drinking this in noted too how sir claude shared her fine impression of it i wanted to see you his wife continued and now you can judge of the trouble ive taken i had everything to do in town today but i managed to get off  maisie and her companion for a moment did justice to this achievement but maisie was the first to express it im glad you wanted to see me mamma then after a concentration more deep and with a plunge more brave a little more and youd have been too late it stuck in her throat but she brought it out were going to france  ida was magnificent ida kissed her on the forehead thats just what i thought likely it made me decide to run down i fancied that in spite of your scramble youd wait to cross and it added to the reason i have for seeing you  maisie wondered intensely what the reason could be but she knew ever so much better than to ask she was slightly surprised indeed to perceive that sir claude didnt and to hear him immediately enquire what in the name of goodness can you have to say to her  his tone was not exactly rude but it was impatient enough to make his wifes response a fresh specimen of the new softness that my dear man is all my own business  do you mean sir claude asked that you wish me to leave you with her  yes if youll be so good thats the extraordinary request i take the liberty of making her ladyship had dropped to a mildness of irony by which for a moment poor maisie was mystified and charmed puzzled with a glimpse of something that in all the years had at intervals peeped out ida smiled at sir claude with the strange air she had on such occasions of defying an interlocutor to keep it up as long her huge eyes her red lips the intense marks in her face formed an éclairage as distinct and public as a lamp set in a window the child seemed quite to see in it the very beacon that had lighted her path she suddenly found herself reflecting that it was no wonder the gentlemen were guided this must have been the way mamma had first looked at sir claude it brought back the lustre of the time they had outlived it must have been the way she looked also at mr perriam and lord eric above all it contributed in maisies mind to a completer view of that satisfied state of the captain our young lady grasped this idea with a quick lifting of the heart there was a stillness during which her mother flooded her with a wealth of support to the captains striking tribute this stillness remained long enough unbroken to represent that sir claude too might but be gasping again under the spell originally strong for him so that maisie quite hoped he would at least say something to show a recognition of how charming she could be  what he presently said was are you putting up for the night  his wife cast grandly about not hereive come from dover  over maisies head at this they still faced each other you spend the night there  yes i brought some things i went to the hotel and hastily arranged then i caught the train that whisked me on here you see what a day ive had of it  the statement may surprise but these were really as obliging if not as lucid words as into her daughters ears at least idas lips had ever dropped and there was a quick desire in the daughter that for the hour at any rate they should duly be welcomed as a ground of intercourse certainly mamma had a charm which when turned on became a large explanation and the only danger now in an impulse to applaud it would be that of appearing to signalise its rarity maisie however risked the peril in the geniality of an admission that ida had indeed had a rush and she invited sir claude to expose himself by agreeing with her that the rush had been even worse than theirs he appeared to meet this appeal by saying with detachment enough you go back there tonight  oh yesthere are plenty of trains again sir claude hesitated it would have been hard to say if the child between them more connected or divided them then he brought out quietly it will be late for you to knock about ill see you over  you neednt trouble thank you i think you wont deny that i can help myself and that it isnt the first time in my dreadful life that ive somehow managed it save for this allusion to her dreadful life they talked there maisie noted as if they were only rather superficial friends a special effect that she had often wondered at before in the midst of what she supposed to be intimacies this effect was augmented by the almost casual manner in which her ladyship went on i dare say i shall go abroad  from dover do you mean straight  how straight i cant say im excessively ill  this for a minute struck maisie as but a part of the conversation at the end of which time she became aware that it ought to strike herthough it apparently didnt strike sir claudeas a part of something graver it helped her to twist nearer ill mammareally ill  she regretted her really as soon as she had spoken it but there couldnt be a better proof of her mothers present polish than that ida showed no gleam of a temper to take it up she had taken up at other times much tinier things she only pressed maisies head against her bosom and said shockingly my dear i must go to that new place  what new place sir claude enquired  ida thought but couldnt recall it oh chose dont you know where every one goes i want some proper treatment its all ive ever asked for on earth but thats not what i came to say  sir claude in silence folded one by one his newspapers then he rose and stood whacking the palm of his hand with the bundle youll stop and dine with us  dear noi cant dine at this sort of hour i ordered dinner at dover  her ladyships tone in this one instance showed a certain superiority to those conditions in which her daughter had artlessly found folkestone a paradise it was yet not so crushing as to nip in the bud the eagerness with which the latter broke out but wont you at least have a cup of tea  ida kissed her again on the brow thanks love i had tea before coming she raised her eyes to sir claude she is sweet he made no more answer than if he didnt agree but maisie was at ease about that and was still taken up with the joy of this happier pitch of their talk which put more and more of a meaning into the captains version of her ladyship and literally kindled a conjecture that such an admirer might over there at the other place be waiting for her to dine was the same conjecture in sir claudes mind he partly puzzled her if it had risen there by the slight perversity with which he returned to a question that his wife evidently thought she had disposed of  he whacked his hand again with his paper i had really much better take you  and leave maisie here alone  mamma so clearly didnt want it that maisie leaped at the vision of a captain who had seen her on from dover and who while he waited to take her back would be hovering just at the same distance at which in kensington gardens the companion of his walk had herself hovered of course however instead of breathing any such guess she let sir claude reply all the more that his reply could contribute so much to her own present grandeur she wont be alone when she has a maid in attendance  maisie had never before had so much of a retinue and she waited also to enjoy the action of it on her ladyship you mean the woman you brought from town ida considered the person at the house spoke of her in a way that scarcely made her out company for my child her tone was that her child had never wanted in her hands for prodigious company but she as distinctly continued to decline sir claudes dont be an old goose she said charmingly let us alone  in front of them on the grass he looked graver than maisie at all now thought the occasion warranted i dont see why you cant say it before me  his wife smoothed one of her daughters curls say what dear  why what you came to say  at this maisie at last interposed she appealed to sir claude do let her say it to me  he looked hard for a moment at his little friend how do you know what she may say  she must risk it ida remarked  i only want to protect you he continued to the child  you want to protect yourselfthats what you mean his wife replied dont be afraid i wont touch you  she wont touch youshe wont maisie declared she felt by this time that she could really answer for it and something of the emotion with which she had listened to the captain came back to her it made her so happy and so secure that she could positively patronise mamma she did so in the captains very language shes good shes good she proclaimed  oh lordsir claude at this let himself go he appeared to have emitted some sound of derision that was smothered to maisies ears by her being again embraced by his wife ida released her and held her off a little looking at her with a very queer face then the child became aware that their companion had left them and that from the face in question a confirmatory remark had proceeded  i am good love said her ladyship     xxi   a good deal of the rest of idas visit was devoted to explaining as it were so extraordinary a statement this explanation was more copious than any she had yet indulged in and as the summer twilight gathered and she kept her child in the garden she was conciliatory to a degree that let her need to arrange things a little perceptibly peep out it was not merely that she explained she almost conversed all that was wanting was that she should have positively chattered a little less it was really the occasion of maisies life on which her mother was to have most to say to her that alone was an implication of generosity and virtue and no great stretch was required to make our young lady feel that she should best meet her and soonest have it over by simply seeming struck with the propriety of her contention they sat together while the parents gloved hand sometimes rested sociably on the childs and sometimes gave a corrective pull to a ribbon too meagre or a tress too thick and maisie was conscious of the effort to keep out of her eyes the wonder with which they were occasionally moved to blink oh there would have been things to blink at if one had let ones self go and it was lucky they were alone together without sir claude or mrs wix or even mrs beale to catch an imprudent glance though profuse and prolonged her ladyship was not exhaustively lucid and her account of her situation so far as it could be called descriptive was a muddle of inconsequent things bruised fruit of an occasion she had rather too lightly affronted none of them were really thought out and some were even not wholly insincere it was as if she had asked outright what better proof could have been wanted of her goodness and her greatness than just this marvellous consent to give up what she had so cherished it was as if she had said in so many words there have been things between usbetween sir claude and mewhich i neednt go into you little nuisance because you wouldnt understand them it suited her to convey that maisie had been kept so far as she was concerned or could imagine in a holy ignorance and that she must take for granted a supreme simplicity she turned this way and that in the predicament she had sought and from which she could neither retreat with grace nor emerge with credit she draped herself in the tatters of her impudence postured to her utmost before the last little triangle of cracked glass to which so many fractures had reduced the polished plate of filial superstition if neither sir claude nor mrs wix was there this was perhaps all the more a pity the scene had a style of its own that would have qualified it for presentation especially at such a moment as that of her letting it betray that she quite did think her wretched offspring better placed with sir claude than in her own soiled hands there was at any rate nothing scant either in her admissions or her perversions the mixture of her fear of what maisie might undiscoverably think and of the support she at the same time gathered from a necessity of selfishness and a habit of brutality this habit flushed through the merit she now made in terms explicit of not having come to folkestone to kick up a vulgar row she had not come to box any ears or to bang any doors or even to use any language she had come at the worst to lose the thread of her argument in an occasional dumb disgusted twitch of the toggery in which mrs beales low domestic had had the impudence to serve up miss farange she checked all criticism not committing herself even so far as for those missing comforts of the schoolroom on which mrs wix had presumed  i am goodim crazily im criminally good but it wont do for you any more and if ive ceased to contend with him and with you too who have made most of the trouble between us its for reasons that youll understand one of these days but too wellone of these days when i hope youll know what it is to have lost a mother im awfully ill but you mustnt ask me anything about it if i dont get off somewhere my doctor wont answer for the consequences hes stupefied at what ive bornehe says it has been put on me because i was formed to suffer im thinking of south africa but thats none of your business you must take your choiceyou cant ask me questions if youre so ready to give me up no i wont tell you you can find out for yourself south africas wonderful they say and if i do go it must be to give it a fair trial it must be either one thing or the other if he takes you you know he takes you ive struck my last blow for you i can follow you no longer from pillar to post i must live for myself at last while theres still a handful left of me im very very ill im very very tired im very very determined there you have it make the most of it your frocks too filthy but i came to sacrifice myself maisie looked at the peccant places there were moments when it was a relief to her to drop her eyes even on anything so sordid all her interviews all her ordeals with her mother had as she had grown older seemed to have before any other the hard quality of duration but longer than any strangely were these minutes offered to her as so pacific and so agreeably winding up the connexion it was her anxiety that made them long her fear of some hitch some check of the current one of her ladyships famous quick jumps she held her breath she only wanted by playing into her visitors hands to see the thing through but her impatience itself made at instants the whole situation swim there were things ida said that she perhaps didnt hear and there were things she heard that ida perhaps didnt say youre all i have and yet im capable of this your father wishes you were deadthat my dear is what your father wishes youll have to get used to it as ive donei mean to his wishing that im dead at all events you see for yourself how wonderful i am to sir claude he wishes me dead quite as much and im sure that if making me scenes about you could have killed me it was the mark of idas eloquence that she started more hares than she followed and she gave but a glance in the direction of this one going on to say that the very proof of her treating her husband like an angel was that he had just stolen off not to be fairly shamed she spoke as if he had retired on tiptoe as he might have withdrawn from a place of worship in which he was not fit to be present youll never know what ive been through about younever never never i spare you everything as i always have though i dare say you know things that if i did i mean if i knew them would make mewell no matter youre old enough at any rate to know there are a lot of things i dont say that i easily might though it would do me good i assure you to have spoken my mind for once in my life i dont speak of your fathers infamous wife that may give you a notion of the way im letting you off when i say you i mean your precious friends and backers if you dont do justice to my forbearing out of delicacy to mention just as a last word about your stepfather a little fact or two of a kind that really i should only have to mention to shine myself in comparison and after every calumny like pure gold if you dont do me that justice youll never do me justice at all  maisies desire to show what justice she did her had by this time become so intense as to have brought with it an inspiration the great effect of their encounter had been to confirm her sense of being launched with sir claude to make it rich and full beyond anything she had dreamed and everything now conspired to suggest that a single soft touch of her small hand would complete the good work and set her ladyship so promptly and majestically afloat as to leave the great seaway clear for the morrow this was the more the case as her hand had for some moments been rendered free by a marked manoeuvre of both of her mothers one of these capricious members had fumbled with visible impatience in some backward depth of drapery and had presently reappeared with a small article in its grasp the act had a significance for a little person trained in that relation from an early age to keep an eye on manual motions and its possible bearing was not darkened by the memory of the handful of gold that susan ash would never never believe mrs beale had sent backnot she shes too false and too greedyto the munificent countess to have guessed none the less that her ladyships purse might be the real figure of the object extracted from the rustling covert at her rearthis suspicion gave on the spot to the childs eyes a direction carefully distant it added moreover to the optimism that for an hour could ruffle the surface of her deep diplomacy ruffle it to the point of making her forget that she had never been safe unless she had also been stupid she in short forgot her habitual caution in her impulse to adopt her ladyships practical interests and show her ladyship how perfectly she understood them she saw without looking that her mother pressed a little clasp heard without wanting to the sharp click that marked the closing portemonnaie from which something had been taken what this was she just didnt see it was not too substantial to be locked with ease in the fold of her ladyships fingers nothing was less new to maisie than the art of not thinking singly so that at this instant she could both bring out what was on her tongues end and weigh as to the object in her mothers palm the question of its being a sovereign against the question of its being a shilling no sooner had she begun to speak than she saw that within a few seconds this question would have been settled she had foolishly checked the rising words of the little speech of presentation to which under the circumstances even such a high pride as idas had had to give some thought she had checked it completelythat was the next thing she felt the note she sounded brought into her companions eyes a look that quickly enough seemed at variance with presentations  that was what the captain said to me that day mamma i think it would have given you pleasure to hear the way he spoke of you  the pleasure maisie could now in consternation reflect would have been a long time coming if it had come no faster than the response evoked by her allusion to it her mother gave her one of the looks that slammed the door in her face never in a career of unsuccessful experiments had maisie had to take such a stare it reminded her of the way that once at one of the lectures in glower street something in a big jar that amid an array of strange glasses and bad smells had been promised as a beautiful yellow was produced as a beautiful black she had been sorry on that occasion for the lecturer but she was at this moment sorrier for herself oh nothing had ever made for twinges like mammas manner of saying the captain what captain  why when we met you in the gardensthe one who took me to sit with him that was exactly what he said  ida let it come on so far as to appear for an instant to pick up a lost thread what on earth did he say  maisie faltered supremely but supremely she brought it out what you say mammathat youre so good  what i say ida slowly rose keeping her eyes on her child and the hand that had busied itself in her purse conformed at her side and amid the folds of her dress to a certain stiffening of the arm i say youre a precious idiot and i wont have you put words into my mouth this was much more peremptory than a mere contradiction maisie could only feel on the spot that everything had broken short off and that their communication had abruptly ceased that was presently proved what business have you to speak to me of him  her daughter turned scarlet i thought you liked him  himthe biggest cad in london her ladyship towered again and in the gathering dusk the whites of her eyes were huge  maisies own however could by this time pretty well match them and she had at least now with the first flare of anger that had ever yet lighted her face for a foe the sense of looking up quite as hard as any one could look down well he was kind about you then he was and it made me like him he said thingsthey were beautiful they were they were she was almost capable of the violence of forcing this home for even in the midst of her surge of passionof which in fact it was a partthere rose in her a fear a pain a vision ominous precocious of what it might mean for her mothers fate to have forfeited such a loyalty as that there was literally an instant in which maisie fully sawsaw madness and desolation saw ruin and darkness and death ive thought of him often since and i hoped it was with himwith him here in her emotion it failed her the breath of her filial hope  but ida got it out of her you hoped you little horror  that it was he whos at dover that it was he whos to take you i mean to south africa maisie said with another drop  idas stupefaction on this kept her silent unnaturally long so long that her daughter could not only wonder what was coming but perfectly measure the decline of every symptom of her liberality she loomed there in her grandeur merely dark and dumb her wrath was clearly still as it had always been a thing of resource and variety what maisie least expected of it was by this law what now occurred it melted in the summer twilight gradually into pity and the pity after a little found a cadence to which the renewed click of her purse gave an accent she had put back what she had taken out youre a dreadful dismal deplorable little thing she murmured and with this she turned back and rustled away over the lawn  after she had disappeared maisie dropped upon the bench again and for some time in the empty garden and the deeper dusk sat and stared at the image her flight had still left standing it had ceased to be her mother only in the strangest way that it might become her father the father of whose wish that she were dead the announcement still lingered in the air it was a presence with vague edgesit continued to front her to cover her but what reality that she need reckon with did it represent if mr farange were on his side also going offgoing off to america with the countess or even only to spa that question had from the house a sudden gay answer in the great roar of a gong and at the same moment she saw sir claude look out for her from the wide lighted doorway at this she went to him and he came forward and met her on the lawn for a minute she was with him there in silence as just before at the last she had been with her mother  shes gone  shes gone  nothing more for the instant passed between them but to move together to the house where in the hall he indulged in one of those sudden pleasantries with which to the delight of his stepdaughter his native animation overflowed will miss farange do me the honour to accept my arm  there was nothing in all her days that miss farange had accepted with such bliss a bright rich element that floated them together to their feast before they reached which however she uttered in the spirit of a glad young lady taken in to her first dinner a sociable word that made him stop short she goes to south africa  to south africa his face for a moment seemed to swing for a jump the next it took its spring into the extreme of hilarity is that what she said  oh yes i didnt mistake maisie took to herself that credit for the climate  sir claude was now looking at a young woman with black hair a red frock and a tiny terrier tucked under her elbow she swept past them on her way to the diningroom leaving an impression of a strong scent which mingled amid the clatter of the place with the hot aroma of food he had become a little graver he still stopped to talk i seei see other people brushed by he was not too grave to notice them did she say anything else  oh yes a lot more  on this he met her eyes again with some intensity but only repeating i seei see  maisie had still her own vision which she brought out i thought she was going to give me something  what kind of a thing  some money that she took out of her purse and then put back  sir claudes amusement reappeared she thought better of it dear thrifty soul how much did she make by that manoeuvre  maisie considered i didnt see it was very small  sir claude threw back his head do you mean very little sixpence  maisie resented this almost as if at dinner she were already bandying jokes with an agreeable neighbour it may have been a sovereign  or even sir claude suggested a tenpound note she flushed at this sudden picture of what she perhaps had lost and he made it more vivid by adding rolled up in a tight little ball you knowher way of treating banknotes as if they were curlpapers maisies flush deepened both with the immense plausibility of this and with a fresh wave of the consciousness that was always there to remind her of his clevernessthe consciousness of how immeasurably more after all he knew about mamma than she she had lived with her so many times without discovering the material of her curlpapers or assisting at any other of her dealings with banknotes the tight little ball had at any rate rolled away from her for everquite like one of the other balls that idas cue used to send flying sir claude gave her his arm again and by the time she was seated at table she had perfectly made up her mind as to the amount of the sum she had forfeited everything about her howeverthe crowded room the bedizened banquet the savour of dishes the drama of figuresministered to the joy of life after dinner she smoked with her friendfor that was exactly what she felt she didon a porch a kind of terrace where the red tips of cigars and the light dresses of ladies made under the happy stars a poetry that was almost intoxicating they talked but little and she was slightly surprised at his asking for no more news of what her mother had said but she had no need of talkthere were a sense and a sound in everything to which words had nothing to add they smoked and smoked and there was a sweetness in her stepfathers silence at last he said let us take another turnbut you must go to bed soon oh you know were going to have a system their turn was back into the garden along the dusky paths from which they could see the black masts and the red lights of boats and hear the calls and cries that evidently had to do with happy foreign travel and their system was once more to get on beautifully in this further lounge without a definite exchange yet he finally spokehe broke out as he tossed away the match from which he had taken a fresh light i must go for a stroll im in a fidgeti must walk it off she fell in with this as she fell in with everything on which he went on you go up to miss ashit was the name they had started you must see shes not in mischief can you find your way alone  oh yes ive been up and down seven times she positively enjoyed the prospect of an eighth  still they didnt separate they stood smoking together under the stars then at last sir claude produced it im freeim free  she looked up at him it was the very spot on which a couple of hours before she had looked up at her mother youre freeyoure free  tomorrow we go to france he spoke as if he hadnt heard her but it didnt prevent her again concurring  tomorrow we go to france  again he appeared not to have heard her and after a momentit was an effect evidently of the depth of his reflexions and the agitation of his soulhe also spoke as if he had not spoken before im freeim free  she repeated her form of assent youre freeyoure free  this time he did hear her he fixed her through the darkness with a grave face but he said nothing more he simply stooped a little and drew her to himsimply held her a little and kissed her goodnight after which having given her a silent push upstairs to miss ash he turned round again to the black masts and the red lights maisie mounted as if france were at the top     xxii   the next day it seemed to her indeed at the bottomdown too far in shuddering plunges even to leave her a sense on the channel boat of the height at which sir claude remained and which had never in every way been so great as when much in the wet though in the angle of a screen of canvas he sociably sat with his stepdaughters head in his lap and that of mrs beales housemaid fairly pillowed on his breast maisie was surprised to learn as they drew into port that they had had a lovely passage but this emotion at boulogne was speedily quenched in others above all in the great ecstasy of a larger impression of life she was abroad and she gave herself up to it responded to it in the bright air before the pink houses among the barelegged fishwives and the redlegged soldiers with the instant certitude of a vocation her vocation was to see the world and to thrill with enjoyment of the picture she had grown older in five minutes and had by the time they reached the hotel recognised in the institutions and manners of france a multitude of affinities and messages literally in the course of an hour she found her initiation a consciousness much quickened by the superior part that as soon as they had gobbled down a french breakfastwhich was indeed a high note in the concertshe observed herself to play to susan ash sir claude who had already bumped against people he knew and who as he said had business and letters sent them out together for a walk a walk in which the child was avenged so far as poetic justice required not only for the loud giggles that in their london trudges used to break from her attendant but for all the years of her tendency to produce socially that impression of an excess of the queer something which had seemed to waver so widely between innocence and guilt on the spot at boulogne though there might have been excess there was at least no wavering she recognised she understood she adored and took possession feeling herself attuned to everything and laying her hand right and left on what had simply been waiting for her she explained to susan she laughed at susan she towered over susan and it was somehow susans stupidity of which she had never yet been so sure and susans bewilderment and ignorance and antagonism that gave the liveliest rebound to her immediate perceptions and adoptions the place and the people were all a picture together a picture that when they went down to the wide sands shimmered in a thousand tints with the pretty organisation of the plage with the gaiety of spectators and bathers with that of the language and the weather and above all with that of our young ladys unprecedented situation for it appeared to her that no one since the beginning of time could have had such an adventure or in an hour so much experience as a sequel to which she only needed in order to feel with conscious wonder how the past was changed to hear susan inscrutably aggravated express a preference for the edgware road the past was so changed and the circle it had formed already so overstepped that on that very afternoon in the course of another walk she found herself enquiring of sir claudewithout a single scrupleif he were prepared as yet to name the moment at which they should start for paris his answer it must be said gave her the least little chill  oh paris my dear childi dont quite know about paris  this required to be met but it was much less to challenge him than for the rich joy of her first discussion of the details of a tour that after looking at him a minute she replied well isnt that the real thing the thing that when one does come abroad  he had turned grave again and she merely threw that out it was a way of doing justice to the seriousness of their life she couldnt moreover be so much older since yesterday without reflecting that if by this time she probed a little he would recognise that she had done enough for mere patience there was in fact something in his eyes that suddenly to her own made her discretion shabby before she could remedy this he had answered her last question answered it in the way that of all ways she had least expected the thing it doesnt do not to do certainly paris is charming but my dear fellow paris eats your head off i mean its so beastly expensive  that note gave her a pangit suddenly let in a harder light were they poor then that is was he poor really poor beyond the pleasantry of apollinaris and cold beef they had walked to the end of the long jetty that enclosed the harbour and were looking out at the dangers they had escaped the grey horizon that was england the tumbled surface of the sea and the brown smacks that bobbed upon it why had he chosen an embarrassed time to make this foreign dash unless indeed it was just the dash economic of which she had often heard and on which after another look at the grey horizon and the bobbing boats she was ready to turn round with elation she replied to him quite in his own manner i see i see she smiled up at him our affairs are involved  thats it he returned her smile mine are not quite so bad as yours for yours are really my dear man in a state i cant see through at all but mine will dofor a mess  she thought this over but isnt france cheaper than england  england over there in the thickening gloom looked just then remarkably dear i dare say some parts  then cant we live in those parts  there was something that for an instant in satisfaction of this he had the air of being about to say and yet not saying what he presently said was this very place is one of them  then we shall live here  he didnt treat it quite so definitely as she liked since weve come to save money  this made her press him more how long shall we stay  oh three or four days  it took her breath away you can save money in that time  he burst out laughing starting to walk again and taking her under his arm he confessed to her on the way that she too had put a finger on the weakest of all his weaknesses the fact of which he was perfectly aware that he probably might have lived within his means if he had never done anything for thrift its the happy thoughts that do it he said theres nothing so ruinous as putting in a cheap week maisie heard afresh among the pleasant sounds of the closing day that steel click of idas change of mind she thought of the tenpound note it would have been delightful at this juncture to produce for her companions encouragement but the idea was dissipated by his saying irrelevantly in presence of the next thing they stopped to admire we shall stay till she arrives  she turned upon him mrs beale  mrs wix ive had a wire he went on she has seen your mother  seen mamma maisie stared where in the world  apparently in london theyve been together  for an instant this looked ominousa fear came into her eyes then she hasnt gone  your motherto south africa i give it up dear boy sir claude said and she seemed literally to see him give it up as he stood there and with a kind of absent gazeabsent that is from her affairsfollowed the fine stride and shining limbs of a young fishwife who had just waded out of the sea with her basketful of shrimps his thought came back to her sooner than his eyes but i dare say its all right she wouldnt come if it wasnt poor old thing she knows rather well what shes about  this was so reassuring that maisie after turning it over could make it fit into her dream well what is she about  he finally stopped looking at the fishwifehe met his companions enquiry oh you know there was something in the way he said it that made between them more of an equality than she had yet imagined but it had also more the effect of raising her up than of letting him down and what it did with her was shown by the sound of her assent  yesi know what she knew what she could know is by this time no secret to us it grew and grew at any rate the rest of that day in the air of what he took for granted it was better he should do that than attempt to test her knowledge but there at the worst was the gist of the matter it was open between them at last that their great change as speaking as if it had already lasted weeks maisie called it was somehow built up round mrs wix before she went to bed that night she knew further that sir claude since as he called it they had been on the rush had received more telegrams than one but they separated again without speaking of mrs beale  oh what a crossing for the straighteners and the old brown dresswhich latter appurtenance the child saw thriftily revived for the possible disasters of travel the wind got up in the night and from her little room at the inn maisie could hear the noise of the sea the next day it was raining and everything different this was the case even with susan ash who positively crowed over the bad weather partly it seemed for relish of the time their visitor would have in the boat and partly to point the moral of the folly of coming to such holes in the wet with sir claude maisie went to the folkestone packet on the arrival of which with many signs of the fray he made her wait under an umbrella by the quay whence almost ere the vessel touched he was to be descried in quest of their friend wrigglingthat had been his wordthrough the invalids massed upon the deck it was long till he reappearedit was not indeed till every one had landed when he presented the object of his benevolence in a light that maisie scarce knew whether to suppose the depth of prostration or the flush of triumph the lady on his arm still bent beneath her late ordeal was muffled in such draperies as had never before offered so much support to so much woe at the hotel an hour later this ambiguity dropped assisting mrs wix in private to refresh and reinvest herself maisie heard from her in detail how little she could have achieved if sir claude hadnt put it in her power it was a phrase that in her room she repeated in connexions indescribable he had put it in her power to have changes as she said of the most intimate order adapted to climates and occasions so various as to foreshadow in themselves the stages of a vast itinerary cheap weeks would of course be in their place after so much money spent on a governess sums not grudged however by this ladys pupil even on her feeling her own appearance give rise through the straighteners to an attention perceptibly mystified sir claude in truth had had less time to devote to it than to mrs wixs and moreover she would rather be in her own shoes than in her friends creaking new ones in the event of an encounter with mrs beale maisie was too lost in the idea of mrs beales judgement of so much newness to pass any judgement herself besides after much luncheon and many endearments the question took quite another turn to say nothing of the pleasure of the childs quick view that there were other eyes than susan ashs to open to what she could show she couldnt show much alas till it stopped raining which it declined to do that day but this had only the effect of leaving more time for mrs wixs own demonstration it came as they sat in the little white and gold salon which maisie thought the loveliest place she had ever seen except perhaps the apartment of the countess it came while the hard summer storm lashed the windows and blew in such a chill that sir claude with his hands in his pockets and cigarettes in his teeth fidgeting frowning looking out and turning back ended by causing a smoky little fire to be made in the dressy little chimney it came in spite of something that could only be named his air of wishing to put it off an air that had served himoh as all his airs served himto the extent of his having for a couple of hours confined the conversation to gratuitous jokes and generalities kept it on the level of the little empty coffeecups and petits verres mrs wix had two of each that struck maisie through the fumes of the french fire and the english tobacco as a token more than ever that they were launched she felt now in close quarters and as clearly as if mrs wix had told her that what this lady had come over for was not merely to be chaffed and to hear her pupil chaffed not even to hear sir claude who knew french in perfection imitate the strange sounds emitted by the english folk at the hotel it was perhaps half an effect of her present renovations as if her clothes had been somebodys else she had at any rate never produced such an impression of high colour of a redness associated in maisies mind at that pitch either with measles or with habits her heart was not at all in the gossip about boulogne and if her complexion was partly the result of the déjeuner and the petits verres it was also the brave signal of what she was there to say maisie knew when this did come how anxiously it had been awaited by the youngest member of the party her ladyship packed me offshe almost put me into the cab that was what mrs wix at last brought out     xxiii   sir claude was stationed at the window he didnt so much as turn round and it was left to the youngest of the three to take up the remark do you mean you went to see her yesterday  she came to see me she knocked at my shabby door she mounted my squalid stair she told me she had seen you at folkestone  maisie wondered she went back that evening  no yesterday morning she drove to me straight from the station it was most remarkable if i had a job to get off she did nothing to make it worseshe did a great deal to make it better mrs wix hung fire though the flame in her face burned brighter then she became capable of saying her ladyships kind she did what i didnt expect  maisie on this looked straight at her stepfathers back it might well have been for her at that hour a monument of her ladyships kindness it remained as such monumentally still and for a time that permitted the child to ask of their companion did she really help you  most practically again mrs wix paused again she quite resounded she gave me a tenpound note  at that still looking out sir claude at the window laughed loud so you see maisie weve not quite lost it  oh no maisie responded isnt that too charming she smiled at mrs wix we know all about it then on her friends showing such blankness as was compatible with such a flush she pursued she does want me to have you  mrs wix showed a final hesitation which however while sir claude drummed on the windowpane she presently surmounted it came to maisie that in spite of his drumming and of his not turning round he was really so much interested as to leave himself in a manner in her hands which somehow suddenly seemed to her a greater proof than he could have given by interfering she wants me to have you mrs wix declared  maisie answered this bang at sir claude then thats nice for all of us  of course it was his continued silence sufficiently admitted while mrs wix rose from her chair and as if to take more of a stand placed herself not without majesty before the fire the incongruity of her smartness the circumference of her stiff frock presented her as really more ready for paris than any of them she also gazed hard at sir claudes back your wife was different from anything she had ever shown me she recognises certain proprieties  which do you happen to remember sir claude asked  mrs wixs reply was prompt the importance for maisie of a gentlewoman of some one whos notwell so bad she objects to a mere maid and i dont in the least mind telling you what she wants me to do one thing was clearmrs wix was now bold enough for anything she wants me to persuade you to get rid of the person from mrs beales  maisie waited for sir claude to pronounce on this then she could only understand that he on his side waited and she felt particularly full of common sense as she met her responsibility oh i dont want susan with you she said to mrs wix  sir claude always from the window approved thats quite simple ill take her back  mrs wix gave a positive jump maisie caught her look of alarm take her you dont mean to go over on purpose  sir claude said nothing for a moment after which why shouldnt i leave you here he enquired  maisie at this sprang up oh do oh do oh do the next moment she was interlaced with mrs wix and the two on the hearthrug their eyes in each others eyes considered the plan with intensity then maisie felt the difference of what they saw in it  she can surely go back alone why should you put yourself out mrs wix demanded  oh shes an idiotshes incapable if anything should happen to her it would be awkward it was i who brought herwithout her asking if i turn her away i ought with my own hand to place her again exactly where i found her  mrs wixs face appealed to maisie on such folly and her manner as directed to their companion had to her pupils surprise an unprecedented firmness dear sir claude i think youre perverse pay her fare and give her a sovereign she has had an experience that she never dreamed of and that will be an advantage to her through life if she goes wrong on the way it will be simply because she wants to and with her expenses and her remunerationmake it even what you likeyoull have treated her as handsomely as you always treat every one  this was a new toneas new as mrs wixs cap and it could strike a young person with a sharpened sense for latent meanings as the upshot of a relation that had taken on a new character it brought out for maisie how much more even than she had guessed her friends were fighting side by side at the same time it needed so definite a justification that as sir claude now at last did face them she at first supposed him merely resentful of excessive familiarity she was therefore yet more puzzled to see him show his serene beauty untroubled as well as an equal interest in a matter quite distinct from any freedom but her ladyships did my wife come alone he could ask even that goodhumouredly  when she called on me mrs wix was red now his good humour wouldnt keep down her colour which for a minute glowed there like her ugly honesty nothere was some one in the cab the only attenuation she could think of was after a minute to add but they didnt come up  sir claude broke into a laughmaisie herself could guess what it was at while he now walked about still laughing and at the fireplace gave a gay kick to a displaced log she felt more vague about almost everything than about the drollery of such a they she in fact could scarce have told you if it was to deepen or to cover the joke that she bethought herself to observe perhaps it was her maid  mrs wix gave her a look that at any rate deprecated the wrong tone it was not her maid  do you mean there are this time two sir claude asked as if he hadnt heard  two maids maisie went on as if she might assume he had  the reproach of the straighteners darkened but sir claude cut across it with a sudden see here what do you mean and what do you suppose she meant  mrs wix let him for a moment in silence understand that the answer to his question if he didnt take care might give him more than he wanted it was as if with this scruple she measured and adjusted all she gave him in at last saying what she meant was to make me know that youre definitely free to have that straight from her was a joy i of course hadnt hoped for it made the assurance and my delight at it a thing i could really proceed upon you already know now certainly id have started even if she hadnt pressed me you already know what so long weve been looking for and what as soon as she told me of her step taken at folkestone i recognised with rapture that we have its your freedom that makes me rightshe fairly bristled with her logic but i dont mind telling you that its her action that makes me happy  her action sir claude echoed why my dear woman her action is just a hideous crime it happens to satisfy our sympathies in a way thats quite delicious but that doesnt in the least alter the fact that its the most abominable thing ever done she has chucked our friend here overboard not a bit less than if she had shoved her shrieking and pleading out of that window and down two floors to the pavingstones  maisie surveyed serenely the parties to the discussion oh your friend here dear sir claude doesnt plead and shriek  he looked at her a moment never never thats one only one but charming so far as it goes of about a hundred things we love her for then he pursued to mrs wix what i cant for the life of me make out is what ida is really up to what game she was playing in turning to you with that cursed cheek after the beastly way she has used you whereto explain her at alldoes she fancy she can presently when we least expect it take it out of us  she doesnt fancy anything nor want anything out of any one her cursed cheek as you call it is the best thing ive ever seen in her i dont care a fig for the beastly way she used mei forgive it all a thousand times over mrs wix raised her voice as she had never raised it she quite triumphed in her lucidity i understand her i almost admire her she quavered she spoke as if this might practically suffice yet in charity to fainter lights she threw out an explanation as ive said she was different upon my word i wouldnt have known her she had a glimmering she had an instinct they brought her it was a kind of happy thought and if you couldnt have supposed she would ever have had such a thing why of course i quite agree with you but she did have it there  maisie could feel again how a certain rude rightness in this plea might have been found exasperating but as she had often watched sir claude in apprehension of displeasures that didnt come so now instead of saying oh hell as her father used she observed him only to take refuge in a question that at the worst was abrupt  who is it this time do you know  mrs wix tried blind dignity who is what sir claude  the man who stands the cabs who was in the one that waited at your door  at this challenge she faltered so long that her young friends pitying conscience gave her a hand it wasnt the captain  this good intention however only converted the excellent womans scruple to a more ambiguous stare besides of course making sir claude go off mrs wix fairly appealed to him must i really tell you  his amusement continued did she make you promise not to  mrs wix looked at him still harder i mean before maisie  sir claude laughed again why she cant hurt him  maisie felt herself as it passed brushed by the light humour of this yes i cant hurt him  the straighteners again roofed her over after which they seemed to crack with the explosion of their wearers honesty amid the flying splinters mrs wix produced a name mr tischbein  there was for an instant a silence that under sir claudes influence and while he and maisie looked at each other suddenly pretended to be that of gravity we dont know mr tischbein do we dear  maisie gave the point all needful thought no i cant place mr tischbein  it was a passage that worked visibly on their friend you must pardon me sir claude she said with an austerity of which the note was real if i thank god to your face that he has in his mercyi mean his mercy to our chargeallowed me to achieve this act she gave out a long puff of pain it was time then as if still more to point the moral i said just now i understood your wife i said just now i admired her i stand to it i did both of those things when i saw how even she poor thing saw if you want the dots on the is you shall have them what she came to me for in spite of everything was that im justshe quavered it outwell just clean what she saw for her daughter was that there must at last be a decent person  maisie was quick enough to jump a little at the sound of this implication that such a person was what sir claude was not the next instant however she more profoundly guessed against whom the discrimination was made she was therefore left the more surprised at the complete candour with which he embraced the worst if shes bent on decent persons why has she given her to me you dont call me a decent person and ill do ida the justice that she never did i think im as indecent as any one and that theres nothing in my behaviour that makes my wifes surrender a bit less ignoble  dont speak of your behaviour mrs wix cried dont say such horrible things theyre false and theyre wicked and i forbid you its to keep you decent that im here and that ive done everything i have done its to save youi wont say from yourself because in yourself youre beautiful and good its to save you from the worst person of all i havent after all come over to be afraid to speak of her thats the person in whose place her ladyship wants such a person as even me and if she thought herself as she as good as told me not fit for maisies company its not as you may well suppose that she may make room for mrs beale  maisie watched his face as it took this outbreak and the most she saw in it was that it turned a little white that indeed made him look as susan ash would have said queer and it was perhaps a part of the queerness that he intensely smiled youre too hard on mrs beale she has great merits of her own  mrs wix at this instead of immediately replying did what sir claude had been doing before she moved across to the window and stared a while into the storm there was for a minute to maisies sense a hush that resounded with wind and rain sir claude in spite of these things glanced about for his hat on which maisie spied it first and making a dash for it held it out to him he took it with a gleam of a thankyou in his face and then something moved her still to hold the other side of the brim so that united by their grasp of this object they stood some seconds looking many things at each other by this time mrs wix had turned round do you mean to tell me she demanded that you are going back  to mrs beale maisie surrendered his hat and there was something that touched her in the embarrassed almost humiliated way their companions challenge made him turn it round and round she had seen people do that who she was sure did nothing else that sir claude did i cant just say my dear thing well see about iwell talk of it tomorrow meantime i must get some air  mrs wix with her back to the window threw up her head to a height that still for a moment had the effect of detaining him all the air in france sir claude wont i think give you the courage to deny that youre simply afraid of her  oh this time he did look queer maisie had no need of susans vocabulary to note it it would have come to her of itself as with his hand on the door he turned his eyes from his stepdaughter to her governess and then back again resting on maisies though for ever so short a time there was something they gave up to her and tried to explain his lips however explained nothing they only surrendered to mrs wix yes im simply afraid of her he opened the door and passed out it brought back to maisie his confession of fear of her mother it made her stepmother then the second lady about whom he failed of the particular virtue that was supposed most to mark a gentleman in fact there were three of them if she counted in mrs wix before whom he had undeniably quailed well his want of valour was but a deeper appeal to her tenderness to thrill with response to it she had only to remember all the ladies she herself had as they called it funked     xxiv   it continued to rain so hard that our young ladys private dream of explaining the continent to their visitor had to contain a provision for some adequate treatment of the weather at the table dhôte that evening she threw out a variety of lights this was the second ceremony of the sort she had sat through and she would have neglected her privilege and dishonoured her vocabularywhich indeed consisted mainly of the names of dishesif she had not been proportionately ready to dazzle with interpretations preoccupied and overawed mrs wix was apparently dim she accepted her pupils version of the mysteries of the menu in a manner that might have struck the child as the depression of a credulity conscious not so much of its needs as of its dimensions maisie was soon enoughthough it scarce happened before bedtimeconfronted again with the different sort of programme for which she reserved her criticism they remounted together to their sittingroom while sir claude who said he would join them later remained below to smoke and to converse with the old acquaintances that he met wherever he turned he had proposed his companions for coffee the enjoyment of the salon de lecture but mrs wix had replied promptly and with something of an air that it struck her their own apartments offered them every convenience they offered the good lady herself maisie could immediately observe not only that of this rather grand reference which already emulous so far as it went of her pupil she made as if she had spent her life in salons but that of a stiff french sofa where she could sit and stare at the faint french lamp in default of the french clock that had stopped as for some account of the time sir claude would so markedly interpose her demeanour accused him so directly of hovering beyond her reach that maisie sought to divert her by a report of susans quaint attitude on the matter of their conversation after lunch maisie had mentioned to the young woman for sympathys sake the plan for her relief but her disapproval of alien ways appeared strange to say only to prompt her to hug her gloom so that between mrs wixs effect of displacing her and the visible stiffening of her back the child had the sense of a double office and enlarged play for pacific powers  these powers played to no great purpose it was true in keeping before mrs wix the vision of sir claudes perversity which hung there in the pauses of talk and which he himself after unmistakeable delays finally made quite lurid by bursting init was near ten oclockwith an object held up in his hand she knew before he spoke what it was she knew at least from the underlying sense of all that since the hour spent after the exhibition with her father had not sprung up to reinstate mr farangeshe knew it meant a triumph for mrs beale the mere present sight of sir claudes face caused her on the spot to drop straight through her last impression of mr farange a plummet that reached still deeper down than the security of these days of flight she had wrapped that impression in silencea silence that had parted with half its veil to cover also from the hour of sir claudes advent the image of mr faranges wife but if the object in sir claudes hand revealed itself as a letter which he held up very high so there was something in his mere motion that laid mrs beale again bare here we are he cried almost from the door shaking his trophy at them and looking from one to the other then he came straight to mrs wix he had pulled two papers out of the envelope and glanced at them again to see which was which he thrust one out open to mrs wix read that she looked at him hard as if in fear it was impossible not to see he was excited then she took the letter but it was not her face that maisie watched while she read neither for that matter was it this countenance that sir claude scanned he stood before the fire and more calmly now that he had acted communed in silence with his stepdaughter  the silence was in truth quickly broken mrs wix rose to her feet with the violence of the sound she emitted the letter had dropped from her and lay upon the floor it had made her turn ghastly white and she was speechless with the effect of it its too abominableits too unspeakable she then cried  isnt it a charming thing sir claude asked it has just arrived enclosed in a word of her own she sends it on to me with the remark that comments superfluous i really think it is thats all you can say  she oughtnt to pass such a horror about said mrs wix she ought to put it straight in the fire  my dear woman shes not such a fool its much too precious he had picked the letter up and he gave it again a glance of complacency which produced a light in his face such a documenthe considered then concluded with a slight dropsuch a document is in fine a basis  a basis for what  wellfor proceedings  hers mrs wixs voice had become outright the voice of derision how can she proceed  sir claude turned it over how can she get rid of him wellshe is rid of him  not legally mrs wix had never looked to her pupil so much as if she knew what she was talking about  i dare say sir claude laughed but shes not a bit less deprived than i  of the power to get a divorce its just your want of the power that makes the scandal of your connexion with her therefore its just her want of it that makes that of hers with you thats all i contend mrs wix concluded with an unparalleled neigh of battle oh she did know what she was talking about  maisie had meanwhile appealed mutely to sir claude who judged it easier to meet what she didnt say than to meet what mrs wix did  its a letter to mrs beale from your father my dear written from spa and making the rupture between them perfectly irrevocable it lets her know and not in pretty language that as we technically say he deserts her it puts an end for ever to their relations he ran his eyes over it again then appeared to make up his mind in fact it concerns you maisie so nearly and refers to you so particularly that i really think you ought to see the terms in which this new situation is created for you and he held out the letter  mrs wix at this pounced upon it she had grabbed it too soon even for maisie to become aware of being rather afraid of it thrusting it instantly behind her she positively glared at sir claude see it wretched manthe innocent child see such a thing i think you must be mad and she shall not have a glimpse of it while im here to prevent  the breadth of her action had made sir claude turn redhe even looked a little foolish you think its too bad eh but its precisely because its bad that it seemed to me it would have a lesson and a virtue for her  maisie could do a quick enough justice to his motive to be able clearly to interpose she fairly smiled at him i assure you i can quite believe how bad it is she thought of something kept it back a moment and then spoke i know whats in it  he of course burst out laughing and while mrs wix groaned an oh heavens replied you wouldnt say that old boy if you did the point i make is he continued to mrs wix with a blandness now reestablishedthe point i make is simply that it sets mrs beale free  she hung fire but an instant free to live with you  free not to live not to pretend to live with her husband  ah theyre mighty different thingsa truth as to which her earnestness could now with a fine inconsequent look invite the participation of the child  before maisie could commit herself however the ground was occupied by sir claude who as he stood before their visitor with an expression half rueful half persuasive rubbed his hand sharply up and down the back of his head then why the deuce do you grant sodo you i may even say rejoice sothat by the desertion of my own precious partner im free  mrs wix met this challenge first with silence then with a demonstration the most extraordinary the most unexpected maisie could scarcely believe her eyes as she saw the good lady with whom she had associated no faintest shade of any art of provocation actually after an upward grimace give sir claude a great giggling insinuating naughty slap you wretchyou know why and she turned away the face that with this movement she left him to present to maisie was to abide with his stepdaughter as the very image of stupefaction but the pair lacked time to communicate either amusement or alarm before their admonisher was upon them again she had begun in fact to show infinite variety and she flashed about with a still quicker change of tone have you brought me that thing as a pretext for your going over  sir claude braced himself i cant after such news in common decency not go over i mean dont you know in common courtesy and humanity my dear lady you cant chuck a woman that way especially taking the moment when she has been most insulted and wronged a fellow must behave like a gentleman damn it dear good mrs wix we didnt come away we two to hang right on you know it was only to try our paces and just put in a few days that might prove to every one concerned that were in earnest its exactly because were in earnest that dash it we neednt be so awfully particular i mean dont you know we neednt be so awfully afraid he showed a vivacity an intensity of argument and if maisie counted his words she was all the more ready to swallow after a single swift gasp those that the next thing she became conscious he paused for a reply to we didnt come old girl did we he pleaded straight to stop right away for ever and put it all in now  maisie had never doubted she could be heroic for him oh no it was as if she had been shocked at the bare thought were just taking it as we find it she had a sudden inspiration which she backed up with a smile were just seeing what we can afford she had never yet in her life made any claim for herself but she hoped that this time frankly what she was doing would somehow be counted to her indeed she felt sir claude was counting it though she was afraid to look at himafraid she should show him tears she looked at mrs wix she reached her maximum i dont think i ought to be bad to mrs beale  she heard on this a deep sound something inarticulate and sweet from sir claude but tears were what mrs wix didnt scruple to show do you think you ought to be bad to me the question was the more disconcerting that mrs wixs emotion didnt deprive her of the advantage of her effect if you see that woman again youre lost she declared to their companion  sir claude looked at the moony globe of the lamp he seemed to see for an instant what seeing mrs beale would consist of it was also apparently from this vision that he drew strength to return her situation by what has happened is completely changed and its no use your trying to prove to me that i neednt take any account of that  if you see that woman youre lost mrs wix with greater force repeated  do you think shell not let me come back to you my dear lady i leave you here you and maisie as a hostage to fortune and i promise you by all thats sacred that i shall be with you again at the very latest on saturday i provide you with funds i install you in these lovely rooms i arrange with the people here that you be treated with every attention and supplied with every luxury the weather after this will mend it will be sure to be exquisite youll both be as free as air and you can roam all over the place and have tremendous larks you shall have a carriage to drive you the whole house shall be at your call youll have a magnificent position he paused he looked from one of his companions to the other as to see the impression he had made whether or no he judged it adequate he subjoined after a moment and youll oblige me above all by not making a fuss  maisie could only answer for the impression on herself though indeed from the heart even of mrs wixs rigour there floated to her sense a faint fragrance of depraved concession maisie had her dumb word for the show such a speech could make for the irresistible charm it could take from his dazzling sincerity and before she could do anything but blink at excess of light she heard this very word sound on mrs wixs lips just as if the poor lady had guessed it and wished snatching it from her to blight it like a crumpled flower youre dreadful youre terrible for you know but too well that its not a small thing to me that you should address me in terms that are princely princely was what he stood there and looked and sounded that was what maisie for the occasion found herself reduced to simple worship of him for being yet strange to say too as mrs wix went on an echo rang within her that matched the echo she had herself just produced how much you must want to see her to say such things as that and to be ready to do so much for the poor little likes of maisie and me she has a hold on you and you know it and you want to feel it again andgod knows or at least i do whats your motive and desireenjoy it once more and give yourself up to it it doesnt matter if its one day or three enough is as good as a feast and the lovely time youll have with her is something youre willing to pay for i dare say youd like me to believe that your pay is to get her to give you up but thats a matter on which i strongly urge you not to put down your money in advance give her up first then pay her what you please  sir claude took this to the end though there were things in it that made him colour called into his face more of the apprehension than maisie had ever perceived there of a particular sort of shock she had an odd sense that it was the first time she had seen any one but mrs wix really and truly scandalised and this fed her inference which grew and grew from moment to moment that mrs wix was proving more of a force to reckon with than either of them had allowed so much room for it was true that long before she had obtained a hold of him as she called it different in kind from that obtained by mrs beale and originally by her ladyship but maisie could quite feel with him now that he had really not expected this advantage to be driven so home oh they hadnt at all got to where mrs wix would stop for the next minute she was driving harder than ever it was the result of his saying with a certain dryness though so kindly that what most affected maisie in it was his patience my dear friend its simply a matter in which i must judge for myself youve judged for me i know a good deal of late in a way that i appreciate i assure you down to the ground but you cant do it always no one can do that for another dont you see in every case there are exceptions particular cases that turn up and that are awfully delicate it would be too easy if i could shift it all off on you it would be allowing you to incur an amount of responsibility that i should simply become quite ashamed of youll find im sure that youll have quite as much as youll enjoy if youll be so good as to accept the situation as circumstances happen to make it for you and to stay here with our friend till i rejoin you on the footing of as much pleasantness and as much comfortand i think i have a right to add to both of you of as much faith in meas possible  oh he was princely indeed that came out more and more with every word he said and with the particular way he said it and maisie could feel his monitress stiffen almost with anguish against the increase of his spell and then hurl herself as a desperate defence from it into the quite confessed poorness of violence of iteration youre afraid of herafraid afraid afraid oh dear oh dear oh dear mrs wix wailed it with a high quaver then broke down into a long shudder of helplessness and woe the next minute she had flung herself again on the lean sofa and had burst into a passion of tears  sir claude stood and looked at her a moment he shook his head slowly altogether tenderly ive already admitted itim in mortal terror so well let that settle the question i think you had best go to bed he added youve had a tremendous day and you must both be tired to death i shall not expect you to concern yourselves in the morning with my movements theres an early boat on i shall have cleared out before youre up and i shall moreover have dealt directly and most effectively i assure you with the haughty but not quite hopeless miss ash he turned to his stepdaughter as if at once to take leave of her and give her a sign of how through all tension and friction they were still united in such a way that she at least neednt worry maisie boyhe opened his arms to her with her culpable lightness she flew into them and while he kissed her chose the soft method of silence to satisfy him the silence that after battles of talk was the best balm she could offer his wounds they held each other long enough to reaffirm intensely their vows after which they were almost forced apart by mrs wixs jumping to her feet  her jump either with a quick return or with a final lapse of courage was also to supplication almost abject i beseech you not to take a step so miserable and so fatal i know her but too well even if you jeer at me for saying it little as ive seen her i know her i know her i know what shell doi see it as i stand here since youre afraid of her its the mercy of heaven dont for gods sake be afraid to show it to profit by it and to arrive at the very safety that it gives you im not afraid of her i assure you you must already have seen for yourself that theres nothing im afraid of now let me go to herill settle her and ill take that woman back without a hair of her touched let me put in the two or three dayslet me wind up the connexion you stay here with maisie with the carriage and the larks and the luxury then ill return to you and well go off togetherwell live together without a cloud take me take me she went on and onthe tide of her eloquence was high here i am i know what i am and what i aint but i say boldly to the face of you both that ill do better for you far than ever shell even try to i say it to yours sir claude even though i owe you the very dress on my back and the very shoes on my feet i owe you everythingthats just the reason and to pay it back in profusion what can that be but what i want here i am here i amshe spread herself into an exhibition that combined with her intensity and her decorations appeared to suggest her for strange offices and devotions for ridiculous replacements and substitutions she manipulated her gown as she talked she insisted on the items of her debt i have nothing of my own i knowno money no clothes no appearance no anything nothing but my hold of this little one truth which is all in the world i can bribe you with that the pair of you are more to me than all besides and that if youll let me help you and save you make what you both want possible in the one way it can be why ill work myself to the bone in your service  sir claude wavered there without an answer to this magnificent appeal he plainly cast about for one and in no small agitation and pain he addressed himself in his quest however only to vague quarters until he met again as he so frequently and actively met it the more than filial gaze of his intelligent little charge that gave himpoor plastic and dependent malehis issue if she was still a child she was yet of the sex that could help him out he signified as much by a renewed invitation to an embrace she freshly sprang to him and again they inaudibly conversed be nice to her be nice to her he at last distinctly articulated be nice to her as youve not even been to me on which without another look at mrs wix he somehow got out of the room leaving maisie under the slight oppression of these words as well as of the idea that he had unmistakeably once more dodged     xxv   every single thing he had prophesied came so true that it was after all no more than fair to expect quite as much for what he had as good as promised his pledges they could verify to the letter down to his very guarantee that a way would be found with miss ash roused in the summer dawn and vehemently squeezed by that interesting exile maisie fell back upon her couch with a renewed appreciation of his policy a memento of which when she rose later on to dress glittered at her from the carpet in the shape of a sixpence that had overflowed from susans pride of possession sixpences really for the fortyeight hours that followed seemed to abound in her life she fancifully computed the number of them represented by such a period of larks the number was not kept down she presently noticed by any scheme of revenge for sir claudes flight which should take on mrs wixs part the form of a refusal to avail herself of the facilities he had so bravely ordered it was in fact impossible to escape them it was in the good ladys own phrase ridiculous to go on foot when you had a carriage prancing at the door everything about them pranced the very waiters even as they presented the dishes to which from a similar sense of the absurdity of perversity mrs wix helped herself with a freedom that spoke to maisie quite as much of her depletion as of her logic her appetite was a sign to her companion of a great many things and testified no less on the whole to her general than to her particular condition she had arrears of dinner to make up and it was touching that in a dinnerless state her moral passion should have burned so clear she partook largely as a refuge from depression and yet the opportunity to partake was just a mark of the sinister symptoms that depressed her the affair was in short a combat in which the baser element triumphed between her refusal to be bought off and her consent to be clothed and fed it was not at any rate to be gainsaid that there was comfort for her in the developments of france comfort so great as to leave maisie free to take with her all the security for granted and brush all the danger aside that was the way to carry out in detail sir claudes injunction to be nice that was the way as well to look with her in a survey of the pleasures of life abroad straight over the head of any doubt  they shrank at last all doubts as the weather cleared up it had an immense effect on them and became quite as lovely as sir claude had engaged this seemed to have put him so into the secret of things and the joy of the world so waylaid the steps of his friends that little by little the spirit of hope filled the air and finally took possession of the scene to drive on the long cliff was splendid but it was perhaps better still to creep in the shadefor the sun was strongalong the manycoloured and manyodoured port and through the streets in which to english eyes everything that was the same was a mystery and everything that was different a joke best of all was to continue the creep up the long grand rue to the gate of the haute ville and passing beneath it mount to the quaint and crooked rampart with its rows of trees its quiet corners and friendly benches where brown old women in such whitefrilled caps and such long gold earrings sat and knitted or snoozed its little yellowfaced houses that looked like the homes of misers or of priests and its dark château where small soldiers lounged on the bridge that stretched across an empty moat and military washing hung from the windows of towers this was a part of the place that could lead maisie to enquire if it didnt just meet ones idea of the middle ages and since it was rather a satisfaction than a shock to perceive and not for the first time the limits in mrs wixs mind of the historic imagination that only added one more to the variety of kinds of insight that she felt it her own present mission to show they sat together on the old grey bastion they looked down on the little new town which seemed to them quite as old and across at the great dome and the high gilt virgin of the church that as they gathered was famous and that pleased them by its unlikeness to any place in which they had worshipped they wandered in this temple afterwards and mrs wix confessed that for herself she had probably made a fatal mistake early in life in not being a catholic her confession in its turn caused maisie to wonder rather interestedly what degree of lateness it was that shut the door against an escape from such an error they went back to the rampart on the second morningthe spot on which they appeared to have come furthest in the journey that was to separate them from everything objectionable in the past it gave them afresh the impression that had most to do with their having worked round to a confidence that on maisies part was determined and that she could see to be on her companions desperate she had had for many hours the sense of showing mrs wix so much that she was comparatively slow to become conscious of being at the same time the subject of a like aim the business went the faster however from the moment she got her glimpse of it it then fell into its place in her general her habitual view of the particular phenomenon that had she felt the need of words for it she might have called her personal relation to her knowledge this relation had never been so lively as during the time she waited with her old governess for sir claudes reappearance and what made it so was exactly that mrs wix struck her as having a new suspicion of it mrs wix had never yet had a suspicionthis was certainso calculated to throw her pupil in spite of the closer union of such adventurous hours upon the deep defensive her pupil made out indeed as many marvels as she had made out on the rush to folkestone and if in sir claudes company on that occasion mrs wix was the constant implication so in mrs wixs during these hours sir claude wasand most of all through long pausesthe perpetual the insurmountable theme it all took them back to the first flush of his marriage and to the place he held in the schoolroom at that crisis of love and pain only he had himself blown to a much bigger balloon the large consciousness he then filled out  they went through it all again and indeed while the interval dragged by the very weight of its charm they went in spite of defences and suspicions through everything their intensified clutch of the future throbbed like a clock ticking seconds but this was a timepiece that inevitably as well at the best rang occasionally a portentous hour oh there were several of these and two or three of the worst on the old citywall where everything else so made for peace there was nothing in the world maisie more wanted than to be as nice to mrs wix as sir claude had desired but it was exactly because this fell in with her inveterate instinct of keeping the peace that the instinct itself was quickened from the moment it was quickened however it found other work and that was how to begin with she produced the very complication she most sought to avert what she had essentially done these days had been to read the unspoken into the spoken so that thus with accumulations it had become more definite to her that the unspoken was unspeakably the completeness of the sacrifice of mrs beale there were times when every minute that sir claude stayed away was like a nail in mrs beales coffin that brought back to maisieit was a roundabout waythe beauty and antiquity of her connexion with the flower of the overmores as well as that ladys own grace and charm her peculiar prettiness and cleverness and even her peculiar tribulations a hundred things hummed at the back of her head but two of these were simple enough mrs beale was by the way after all just her stepmother and her relative she was justand partly for that very reasonsir claudes greatest intimate ladyintimate was maisies term so that what together they were on mrs wixs prescription to give up and break short off with was for one of them his particular favourite and for the other her fathers wife strangely indescribably her perception of reasons kept pace with her sense of trouble but there was something in her that without a supreme effort not to be shabby couldnt take the reasons for granted what it comes to perhaps for ourselves is that disinherited and denuded as we have seen her there still lingered in her life an echo of parental influenceshe was still reminiscent of one of the sacred lessons of home it was the only one she retained but luckily she retained it with force she enjoyed in a word an ineffaceable view of the fact that there were things papa called mamma and mamma called papa a low sneak for doing or for not doing now this rich memory gave her a name that she dreaded to invite to the lips of mrs beale she should personally wince so just to hear it the very sweetness of the foreign life she was steeped in added with each hour of sir claudes absence to the possibility of such pangs she watched beside mrs wix the great golden madonna and one of the earringed old women who had been sitting at the end of their bench got up and pottered away adieu mesdames said the old woman in a little cracked civil voicea demonstration by which our friends were so affected that they bobbed up and almost curtseyed to her they subsided again and it was shortly after in a summer hum of french insects and a phase of almost somnolent reverie that maisie most had the vision of what it was to shut out from such a perspective so appealing a participant it had not yet appeared so vast as at that moment this prospect of statues shining in the blue and of courtesy in romantic forms  why after all should we have to choose between you why shouldnt we be four she finally demanded  mrs wix gave the jerk of a sleeper awakened or the start even of one who hears a bullet whiz at the flag of truce her stupefaction at such a breach of the peace delayed for a moment her answer four improprieties do you mean because two of us happen to be decent people do i gather you to wish that i should stay on with you even if that woman is capable  maisie took her up before she could further phrase mrs beales capability stay on as my companionyes stay on as just what you were at mammas mrs beale would let you the child said  mrs wix had by this time fairly sprung to her arms and who id like to know would let mrs beale do you mean little unfortunate that you would  why not if now shes free  free are you imitating him well if sir claudes old enough to know better upon my word i think its right to treat you as if you also were youll have to at any rateto know betterif thats the line youre proposing to take mrs wix had never been so harsh but on the other hand maisie could guess that she herself had never appeared so wanton what was underlying however rather overawed than angered her she felt she could still insistnot for contradiction but for ultimate calm her wantonness meanwhile continued to work upon her friend who caught again on the rebound the sound of deepest provocation free free free if shes as free as you are my dear shes free enough to be sure  as i ammaisie after reflexion and despite whatever of portentous this seemed to convey risked a critical echo  well said mrs wix nobody you know is free to commit a crime  a crime the word had come out in a way that made the child sound it again  youd commit as great a one as their ownand so should iif we were to condone their immorality by our presence  maisie waited a little this seemed so fiercely conclusive why is it immorality she nevertheless presently enquired  her companion now turned upon her with a reproach softer because it was somehow deeper youre too unspeakable do you know what were talking about  in the interest of ultimate calm maisie felt that she must be above all clear certainly about their taking advantage of their freedom  well to do what  why to live with us  mrs wixs laugh at this was literally wild us thank you  then to live with me  the words made her friend jump you give me up you break with me for ever you turn me into the street  maisie though gasping a little bore up under the rain of challenges those it seems to me are the things you do to me  mrs wix made little of her valour i can promise you that whatever i do i shall never let you out of my sight you ask me why its immorality when youve seen with your own eyes that sir claude has felt it to be so to that dire extent that rather than make you face the shame of it he has for months kept away from you altogether is it any more difficult to see that the first time he tries to do his duty he washes his hands of hertakes you straight away from her  maisie turned this over but more for apparent consideration than from any impulse to yield too easily yes i see what you mean but at that time they werent free she felt mrs wix rear up again at the offensive word but she succeeded in touching her with a remonstrant hand i dont think you know how free theyve become  i know i believe at least as much as you do  maisie felt a delicacy but overcame it about the countess  your fatherstemptress mrs wix gave her a sidelong squint perfectly she pays him  oh does she at this the childs countenance fell it seemed to give a reason for papas behaviour and place it in a more favourable light she wished to be just i dont say shes not generous she was so to me  how to you  she gave me a lot of money  mrs wix stared and pray what did you do with a lot of money  i gave it to mrs beale  and what did mrs beale do with it  she sent it back  to the countess gammon said mrs wix she disposed of that plea as effectually as susan ash  well i dont care maisie replied what i mean is that you dont know about the rest  the rest what rest  maisie wondered how she could best put it papa kept me there an hour  i do knowsir claude told me mrs beale had told him  maisie looked incredulity how could shewhen i didnt speak of it  mrs wix was mystified speak of what  why of her being so frightful  the countess of course shes frightful mrs wix returned after a moment she added thats why she pays him  maisie pondered its the best thing about her thenif she gives him as much as she gave me  well its not the best thing about him or rather perhaps it is too mrs wix subjoined  but shes awfulreally and truly maisie went on  mrs wix arrested her you neednt go into details it was visibly at variance with this injunction that she yet enquired how does that make it any better  their living with me why for the countessand for her whiskershe has put me off on them i understood him maisie profoundly said  i hope then he understood you its more than i do mrs wix admitted  this was a real challenge to be plainer and our young lady immediately became so i mean it isnt a crime  why then did sir claude steal you away  he didnt stealhe only borrowed me i knew it wasnt for long maisie audaciously professed  you must allow me to reply to that cried mrs wix that you knew nothing of the sort and that you rather basely failed to back me up last night when you pretended so plump that you did you hoped in fact exactly as much as i did and as in my senseless passion i even hope now that this may be the beginning of better things  oh yes mrs wix was indeed for the first time sharp so that there at last stirred in our heroine the sense not so much of being proved disingenuous as of being precisely accused of the meanness that had brought everything down on her through her very desire to shake herself clear of it she suddenly felt herself swell with a passion of protest i never never hoped i wasnt going again to see mrs beale i didnt i didnt i didnt she repeated mrs wix bounced about with a force of rejoinder of which she also felt that she must anticipate the concussion and which though the good lady was evidently charged to the brim hung fire long enough to give time for an aggravation shes beautiful and i love her i love her and shes beautiful  and im hideous and you hate me mrs wix fixed her a moment then caught herself up i wont embitter you by absolutely accusing you of that though as for my being hideous its hardly the first time ive been told so i know it so well that even if i havent whiskershave ii dare say there are other ways in which the countess is a venus to me my pretensions must therefore seem to you monstrouswhich comes to the same thing as your not liking me but do you mean to go so far as to tell me that you want to live with them in their sin  you know what i want you know what i wantmaisie spoke with the shudder of rising tears  yes i do you want me to be as bad as yourself well i wont there mrs beales as bad as your father mrs wix went on  shes notshes not her pupil almost shrieked in retort  you mean because sir claude at least has beauty and wit and grace but he pays just as the countess pays mrs wix who now rose as she spoke fairly revealed a latent cynicism  it raised maisie also to her feet her companion had walked off a few steps and paused the two looked at each other as they had never looked and mrs wix seemed to flaunt there in her finery then doesnt he pay you too her unhappy charge demanded  at this she bounded in her place oh you incredible little waif she brought it out with a wail of violence after which with another convulsion she marched straight away  maisie dropped back on the bench and burst into sobs     xxvi   nothing so dreadful of course could be final or even for many minutes prolonged they rushed together again too soon for either to feel that either had kept it up and though they went home in silence it was with a vivid perception for maisie that her companions hand had closed upon her that hand had shown altogether these twentyfour hours a new capacity for closing and one of the truths the child could least resist was that a certain greatness had now come to mrs wix the case was indeed that the quality of her motive surpassed the sharpness of her angles both the combination and the singularity of which things when in the afternoon they used the carriage maisie could borrow from the contemplative hush of their grandeur the freedom to feel to the utmost she still bore the mark of the tone in which her friend had thrown out that threat of never losing sight of her this friend had been converted in short from feebleness to force and it was the light of her new authority that showed from how far she had come the threat in question sharply exultant might have produced defiance but before anything so ugly could happen another process had insidiously forestalled it the moment at which this process had begun to mature was that of mrs wixs breaking out with a dignity attuned to their own apartments and with an advantage now measurably gained they had ordered coffee after luncheon in the spirit of sir claudes provision and it was served to them while they awaited their equipage in the white and gold saloon it was flanked moreover with a couple of liqueurs and maisie felt that sir claude could scarce have been taken more at his word had it been followed by anecdotes and cigarettes the influence of these luxuries was at any rate in the air it seemed to her while she tiptoed at the chimneyglass pulling on her gloves and with a motion of her head shaking a feather into place to have had something to do with mrs wixs suddenly saying havent you really and truly any moral sense  maisie was aware that her answer though it brought her down to her heels was vague even to imbecility and that this was the first time she had appeared to practise with mrs wix an intellectual inaptitude to meet herthe infirmity to which she had owed so much success with papa and mamma the appearance did her injustice for it was not less through her candour than through her playfellows pressure that after this the idea of a moral sense mainly coloured their intercourse she began the poor child with scarcely knowing what it was but it proved something that with scarce an outward sign save her surrender to the swing of the carriage she could before they came back from their drive strike up a sort of acquaintance with the beauty of the day only deepened and the splendour of the afternoon sea and the haze of the far headlands and the taste of the sweet air it was the coachman indeed who smiling and cracking his whip turning in his place pointing to invisible objects and uttering unintelligible soundsall our tourists recognised strict features of a social order principally devoted to language it was this polite person i say who made their excursion fall so much short that their return left them still a stretch of the long daylight and an hour that at his obliging suggestion they spent on foot by the shining sands maisie had seen the plage the day before with sir claude but that was a reason the more for showing on the spot to mrs wix that it was as she said another of the places on her list and of the things of which she knew the french name the bathers so late were absent and the tide was low the seapools twinkled in the sunset and there were dry places as well where they could sit again and admire and expatiate a circumstance that while they listened to the lap of the waves gave mrs wix a fresh support for her challenge have you absolutely none at all  she had no need now as to the question itself at least to be specific that on the other hand was the eventual result of their quiet conjoined apprehension of the thing thatwell yes since they must face itmaisie absolutely and appallingly had so little of this marked more particularly the moment of the childs perceiving that her friend had risen to a level which mighttill superseded at all eventspass almost for sublime nothing more remarkable had taken place in the first heat of her own departure no act of perception less to be overtraced by our rough method than her vision the rest of that boulogne day of the manner in which she figured i so despair of courting her noiseless mental footsteps here that i must crudely give you my word for its being from this time forward a picture literally present to her mrs wix saw her as a little person knowing so extraordinarily much that for the account to be taken of it what she still didnt know would be ridiculous if it hadnt been embarrassing mrs wix was in truth more than ever qualified to meet embarrassment i am not sure that maisie had not even a dim discernment of the queer law of her own life that made her educate to that sort of proficiency those elders with whom she was concerned she promoted as it were their development nothing could have been more marked for instance than her success in promoting mrs beales she judged that if her whole history for mrs wix had been the successive stages of her knowledge so the very climax of the concatenation would in the same view be the stage at which the knowledge should overflow as she was condemned to know more and more how could it logically stop before she should know most it came to her in fact as they sat there on the sands that she was distinctly on the road to know everything she had not had governesses for nothing what in the world had she ever done but learn and learn and learn she looked at the pink sky with a placid foreboding that she soon should have learnt all they lingered in the flushed air till at last it turned to grey and she seemed fairly to receive new information from every brush of the breeze by the time they moved homeward it was as if this inevitability had become for mrs wix a long tense cord twitched by a nervous hand on which the valued pearls of intelligence were to be neatly strung  in the evening upstairs they had another strange sensation as to which maisie couldnt afterwards have told you whether it was bang in the middle or quite at the beginning that her companion sounded with fresh emphasis the note of the moral sense what mattered was merely that she did exclaim and again as at first appeared most disconnectedly god help me it does seem to peep out oh the queer confusions that had wooed it at last to such peeping none so queer however as the words of woe and it might verily be said of rage in which the poor lady bewailed the tragic end of her own rich ignorance there was a point at which she seized the child and hugged her as close as in the old days of partings and returns at which she was visibly at a loss how to make up to such a victim for such contaminations appealing as to what she had done and was doing in bewilderment in explanation in supplication for reassurance for pardon and even outright for pity  i dont know what ive said to you my own i dont know what im saying or what the turn youve given my life has rendered me heaven forgive me capable of saying have i lost all delicacy all decency all measure of how far and how bad it seems to me mostly that i have though im the last of whom you would ever have thought it ive just done it for you preciousnot to lose you which would have been worst of all so that ive had to pay with my own innocence if you do laugh for clinging to you and keeping you dont let me pay for nothing dont let me have been thrust for nothing into such horrors and such shames i never knew anything about them and i never wanted to know now i know too much too much the poor woman lamented and groaned i know so much that with hearing such talk i ask myself where i am and with uttering it too which is worse say to myself that im far too far from where i started i ask myself what i should have thought with my lost one if i had heard myself cross the line there are lines ive crossed with you where i should have fancied i had come to a pretty pass she gasped at the mere supposition ive gone from one thing to another and all for the real love of you and now what would any one sayi mean any one but themif they were to hear the way i go on ive had to keep up with you havent iand therefore what could i do less than look to you to keep up with me but its not them that are the worstby which i mean to say its not him its your dreadfully base papa and the one person in the world whom he could have found i do believeand shes not the countess duckwickeder than himself while they were about it at any rate since they were ruining you they might have done it so as to spare an honest woman then i shouldnt have had to do whatever it is thats the worst throw up at you the badness you havent taken in or find my advantage in the vileness you have what i did lose patience at this morning was at how it was that without your seeming to condemnfor you didnt you rememberyou yet did seem to know thank god in his mercy at last if you do  the night this time was warm and one of the windows stood open to the small balcony over the rail of which on coming back from dinner maisie had hung a long time in the enjoyment of the chatter the lights the life of the quay made brilliant by the season and the hour mrs wixs requirements had drawn her in from this pasture and mrs wixs embrace had detained her even though midway in the outpouring her confusion and sympathy had permitted or rather had positively helped her to disengage herself but the casement was still wide the spectacle the pleasure were still there and from her place in the room which with its polished floor and its panels of elegance was lighted from without more than from within the child could still take account of them she appeared to watch and listen after which she answered mrs wix with a question if i do know  if you do condemn the correction was made with some austerity  it had the effect of causing maisie to heave a vague sigh of oppression and then after an instant and as if under cover of this ambiguity pass out again upon the balcony she hung again over the rail she felt the summer night she dropped down into the manners of france there was a café below the hotel before which with little chairs and tables people sat on a space enclosed by plants in tubs and the impression was enriched by the flash of the white aprons of waiters and the music of a man and a woman who from beyond the precinct sent up the strum of a guitar and the drawl of a song about amour maisie knew what amour meant too and wondered if mrs wix did mrs wix remained within as still as a mouse and perhaps not reached by the performance after a while but not till the musicians had ceased and begun to circulate with a little plate her pupil came back to her is it a crime maisie then asked  mrs wix was as prompt as if she had been crouching in a lair branded by the bible  well he wont commit a crime  mrs wix looked at her gloomily hes committing one now  now  in being with her  maisie had it on her tongues end to return once more but now hes free she remembered however in time that one of the things she had known for the last entire hour was that this made no difference after that and as if to turn the right way she was on the point of a blind dash a weak reversion to the reminder that it might make a difference might diminish the crime for mrs beale till such a reflexion was in its order also quashed by the visibility in mrs wixs face of the collapse produced by her inference from her pupils manner that after all her pains her pupil didnt even yet adequately understand never so much as when confronted had maisie wanted to understand and all her thought for a minute centred in the effort to come out with something which should be a disproof of her simplicity just trust me dear thats allshe came out finally with that and it was perhaps a good sign of her action that with a long impartial moan mrs wix floated her to bed  there was no letter the next morning from sir claudewhich mrs wix let out that she deemed the worst of omens yet it was just for the quieter communion they so got with him that when after the coffee and rolls which made them more foreign than ever it came to going forth for fresh drafts upon his credit they wandered again up the hill to the rampart instead of plunging into distraction with the crowd on the sands or into the sea with the seminude bathers they gazed once more at their gilded virgin they sank once more upon their battered bench they felt once more their distance from the regents park at last mrs wix became definite about their friends silence he is afraid of her she has forbidden him to write the fact of his fear maisie already knew but her companions mention of it had at this moment two unexpected results the first was her wondering in dumb remonstrance how mrs wix with a devotion not after all inferior to her own could put into such an allusion such a grimness of derision the second was that she found herself suddenly drop into a deeper view of it she too had been afraid as we have seen of the people of whom sir claude was afraid and by that law she had had her due measure of latest apprehension of mrs beale what occurred at present however was that whereas this sympathy appeared vain as for him the ground of it loomed dimly as a reason for selfish alarm that uneasiness had not carried her far before mrs wix spoke again and with an abruptness so great as almost to seem irrelevant has it never occurred to you to be jealous of her  it never had in the least yet the words were scarce in the air before maisie had jumped at them she held them well she looked at them hard at last she brought out with an assurance which there was no one alas but herself to admire well yessince you ask me she debated then continued lots of times  mrs wix glared askance an instant such approval as her look expressed was not wholly unqualified it expressed at any rate something that presumably had to do with her saying once more yes hes afraid of her  maisie heard and it had afresh its effect on her even through the blur of the attention now required by the possibility of that idea of jealousya possibility created only by her feeling she had thus found the way to show she was not simple it struck out of mrs wix that this lady still believed her moral sense to be interested and feigned so what could be such a gage of her sincerity as a peep of the most restless of the passions such a revelation would baffle discouragement and discouragement was in fact so baffled that helped in some degree by the mere intensity of their need to hope which also according to its nature sprang from the dark portent of the absent letter the real pitch of their morning was reached by the note not of mutual scrutiny but of unprecedented frankness there were broodings indeed and silences and maisie sank deeper into the vision that for her friend she was at the most superficial and that also positively she was the more so the more she tried to appear complete was the sum of all knowledge only to know how little in this presence one would ever reach it the answer to that question luckily lost itself in the brightness suffusing the scene as soon as maisie had thrown out in regard to mrs beale such a remark as she had never dreamed she should live to make if i thought she was unkind to himi dont know what i should do  mrs wix dropped one of her squints she even confirmed it by a wild grunt i know what i should  maisie at this felt that she lagged well i can think of one thing  mrs wix more directly challenged her what is it then  maisie met her expression as if it were a game with forfeits for winking id kill her that at least she hoped as she looked away would guarantee her moral sense she looked away but her companion said nothing for so long that she at last turned her head again then she saw the straighteners all blurred with tears which after a little seemed to have sprung from her own eyes there were tears in fact on both sides of the spectacles and they were even so thick that it was presently all maisie could do to make out through them that slowly finally mrs wix put forth a hand it was the material pressure that settled this and even at the end of some minutes more things besides it settled in its own way one thing in particular which though often between them heaven knew hovered round and hung over was yet to be established without the shadow of an attenuating smile oh there was no gleam of levity as little of humour as of deprecation in the long time they now sat together or in the way in which at some unmeasured point of it mrs wix became distinct enough for her own dignity and yet not loud enough for the snoozing old women  i adore him i adore him  maisie took it well in so well that in a moment more she would have answered profoundly so do i but before that moment passed something took place that brought other words to her lips nothing more very possibly than the closer consciousness in her hand of the significance of mrs wixs their hands remained linked in unutterable sign of their union and what maisie at last said was simply and serenely oh i know  their hands were so linked and their union was so confirmed that it took the far deep note of a bell borne to them on the summer air to call them back to a sense of hours and proprieties they had touched bottom and melted together but they gave a start at last the bell was the voice of the inn and the inn was the image of luncheon they should be late for it they got up and their quickened step on the return had something of the swing of confidence when they reached the hotel the table dhôte had begun this was clear from the threshold clear from the absence in the hall and on the stairs of the personnel as mrs wix saidshe had picked that upall collected in the diningroom they mounted to their apartments for a brush before the glass and it was maisie who in passing and from a vain impulse threw open the white and gold door she was thus first to utter the sound that brought mrs wix almost on top of her as by the other accident it would have brought her on top of mrs wix it had at any rate the effect of leaving them bunched together in a strained stare at their new situation this situation had put on in a flash the bright form of mrs beale she stood there in her hat and her jacket amid bags and shawls smiling and holding out her arms if she had just arrived it was a different figure from either of the two that for their benefit wan and tottering and none too soon to save life the channel had recently disgorged she was as lovely as the day that had brought her over as fresh as the luck and the health that attended her it came to maisie on the spot that she was more beautiful than she had ever been all this was too quick to count but there was still time in it to give the child the sense of what had kindled the light that leaped out of the open arms the open eyes the open mouth it leaped out with mrs beales loud cry at her im free im free     xxvii   the greatest wonder of all was the way mrs beale addressed her announcement so far as could be judged equally to mrs wix who as if from sudden failure of strength sank into a chair while maisie surrendered to the visitors embrace as soon as the child was liberated she met with profundity mrs wixs stupefaction and actually was able to see that while in a manner sustaining the encounter her face yet seemed with intensity to say now for gods sake dont crow i told you so maisie was somehow on the spot aware of an absence of disposition to crow it had taken her but an extra minute to arrive at such a quick survey of the objects surrounding mrs beale as showed that among them was no appurtenance of sir claudes she knew his dressingbag nowoh with the fondest knowledgeand there was an instant during which its not being there was a stroke of the worst news she was yet to learn what it could be to recognise in some lapse of a sequence the proof of an extinction and therefore remained unaware that this momentary pang was a foretaste of the experience of death it of course yielded in a flash to mrs beales brightness it gasped itself away in her own instant appeal youve come alone  without sir claude strangely mrs beale looked even brighter yes in the eagerness to get at you you abominable little villainand her stepmother laughing clear administered to her cheek a pat that was partly a pinch what were you up to and what did you take me for but im glad to be abroad and after all its you who have shown me the way i mightnt without you have been able to cometo come that is so soon well here i am at any rate and in a moment more i should have begun to worry about you this will do very wellshe was goodnatured about the place and even presently added that it was charming then with a rosier glow she made again her great point im free im free maisie made on her side her own she carried back her gaze to mrs wix whom amazement continued to hold she drew afresh her old friends attention to the superior way she didnt take that up what she did take up the next minute was the question of sir claude where is he wont he come  mrs beales consideration of this oscillated with a smile between the two expectancies with which she was flanked it was conspicuous it was extraordinary her unblinking acceptance of mrs wix a miracle of which maisie had even now begun to read a reflexion in that ladys long visage hell come but we must make him she gaily brought forth  make him maisie echoed  we must give him time we must play our cards  but he promised us awfully maisie replied  my dear child he has promised me awfully i mean lots of things and not in every case kept his promise to the letter mrs beales good humour insisted on taking for granted mrs wixs to whom her attention had suddenly grown prodigious i dare say he has done the same with you and not always come to time but he makes it up in his own wayand it isnt as if we didnt know exactly what he is theres one thing he is she went on which makes everything else only a question for us of tact they scarce had time to wonder what this was before as they might have said it flew straight into their face hes as free as i am  yes i know said maisie as if however independently weighing the value of that she really weighed also the oddity of her stepmothers treating it as news to her who had been the first person literally to whom sir claude had mentioned it for a few seconds as if with the sound of it in her ears she stood with him again in memory and in the twilight in the hotel garden at folkestone  anything mrs beale overlooked was she indeed divined but the effect of an exaltation of high spirits a tendency to soar that showed even when she droppedstill quite impartiallyalmost to the confidential well thenweve only to wait he cant do without us long im sure mrs wix he cant do without you hes devoted to you he has told me so much about you the extent i count on you you know count on you to help me was an extent that even all her radiance couldnt express what it couldnt express quite as much as what it could made at any rate every instant her presence and even her famous freedom loom larger and it was this mighty mass that once more led her companions bewildered and disjoined to exchange with each other as through a thickening veil confused and ineffectual signs they clung together at least on the common ground of unpreparedness and maisie watched without relief the havoc of wonder in mrs wix it had reduced her to perfect impotence and but that gloom was black upon her she sat as if fascinated by mrs beales high style it had plunged her into a long deep hush for what had happened was the thing she had least allowed for and before which the particular rigour she had worked up could only grow limp and sick sir claude was to have reappeared with his accomplice or without her never never his accomplice without him mrs beale had gained apparently by this time an advantage she could pursue she looked at the droll dumb figure with jesting reproach you really wont shake hands with me never mind youll come round she put the matter to no test going on immediately and instead of offering her hand raising it with a pretty gesture that her bent head met to a long black pin that played a part in her back hair are hats worn at luncheon if youre as hungry as i am we must go right down  mrs wix stuck fast but she met the question in a voice her pupil scarce recognised i wear mine  mrs beale swallowing at one glance her brandnew bravery which she appeared at once to refer to its origin and to follow in its flights accepted this as conclusive oh but ive not such a beauty then she turned rejoicingly to maisie ive got a beauty for you my dear  a beauty  a love of a hatin my luggage i remembered thatshe nodded at the object on her stepdaughters headand ive brought you one with a peacocks breast its the most gorgeous blue  it was too strange this talking with her there already not about sir claude but about peacockstoo strange for the child to have the presence of mind to thank her but the felicity in which she had arrived was so proof against everything that maisie felt more and more the depth of the purpose that must underlie it she had a vague sense of its being abysmal the spirit with which mrs beale carried off the awkwardness in the white and gold salon of such a want of breath and of welcome mrs wix was more breathless than ever the embarrassment of mrs beales isolation was as nothing to the embarrassment of her grace the perception of this dilemma was the germ on the childs part of a new question altogether what if with this indulgence but the idea lost itself in something too frightened for hope and too conjectured for fear and while everything went by leaps and bounds one of the waiters stood at the door to remind them that the table dhôte was half over  had you come up to wash hands mrs beale hereupon asked them go and do it quickly and ill be with you theyve put my boxes in that nice roomit was sir claudes trust him she laughed to have a nice one the door of a neighbouring room stood open and now from the threshold addressing herself again to mrs wix she launched a note that gave the very key of what as she would have said she was up to dear lady please attend to my daughter  she was up to a change of deportment so complete that it representedoh for offices still honourably subordinate if not too explicitly menialan absolute coercion an interested clutch of the old womans respectability there was response to maisies view i may say at once in the jump of that respectability to its feet it was itself capable of one of the leaps one of the bounds just mentioned and it carried its charge with this momentum and while mrs beale popped into sir claudes chamber straight away to where at the end of the passage pupil and governess were quartered the greatest stride of all for that matter was that within a few seconds the pupil had in another relation been converted into a daughter maisies eyes were still following it when after the rush with the door almost slammed and no thought of soap and towels the pair stood face to face mrs wix in this position was the first to gasp a sound can it ever be that she has one  maisie felt still more bewildered one what  why moral sense  they spoke as if you might have two but mrs wix looked as if it were not altogether a happy thought and maisie didnt see how even an affirmative from her own lips would clear up what had become most of a mystery it was to this larger puzzle she sprang pretty straight is she my mother now  it was a point as to which an horrific glimpse of the responsibility of an opinion appeared to affect mrs wix like a blow in the stomach she had evidently never thought of it but she could think and rebound if she is hes equally your father  maisie however thought further then my father and my mother  but she had already faltered and mrs wix had already glared back ought to live together dont begin it again she turned away with a groan to reach the washingstand and maisie could by this time recognise with a certain ease that that way verily madness did lie mrs wix gave a great untidy splash but the next instant had faced round she has taken a new line  she was nice to you maisie concurred  what she thinks sogo and dress the young lady but its something she panted then she thought out the rest if he wont have her why shell have you shell be the one  the one to keep me abroad  the one to give you a home mrs wix saw further she mastered all the portents oh shes cruelly clever its not a moral sense she reached her climax its a game  a game  not to lose him she has sacrificed himto her duty  then wont he come maisie pleaded  mrs wix made no answer her vision absorbed her he has fought but she has won  then wont he come the child repeated  mrs wix made it out yes hang him she had never been so profane  for all maisie minded soontomorrow  too soonwhenever indecently soon  but then we shall be together the child went on it made mrs wix look at her as if in exasperation but nothing had time to come before she precipitated together with you the air of criticism continued but took voice only in her companions bidding her wash herself and come down the silence of quick ablutions fell upon them presently broken however by one of maisies sudden reversions mercy isnt she handsome  mrs wix had finished she waited shell attract attention they were rapid and it would have been noticed that the shock the beauty had given them acted incongruously as a positive spur to their preparations for rejoining her she had none the less when they returned to the sittingroom already descended the open door of her room showed it empty and the chambermaid explained here again they were delayed by another sharp thought of mrs wixs but what will she live on meanwhile  maisie stopped short till sir claude comes  it was nothing to the violence with which her friend had been arrested wholl pay the bills  maisie thought cant she  she she hasnt a penny  the child wondered but didnt papa  leave her a fortune mrs wix would have appeared to speak of papa as dead had she not immediately added why he lives on other women  oh yes maisie remembered then cant he send she faltered again even to herself it sounded queer  some of their money to his wife mrs wix pave a laugh still stranger than the weird suggestion i dare say shed take it  they hurried on again yet again on the stairs maisie pulled up well if she had stopped in england she threw out  mrs wix considered and he had come over instead  yes as we expected maisie launched her speculation what then would she have lived on  mrs wix hung fire but an instant on other men and she marched downstairs     xxviii   mrs beale at table between the pair plainly attracted the attention mrs wix had foretold no other lady present was nearly so handsome nor did the beauty of any other accommodate itself with such art to the homage it produced she talked mainly to her other neighbour and that left maisie leisure both to note the manner in which eyes were riveted and nudges interchanged and to lose herself in the meanings that dimly as yet and disconnectedly but with a vividness that fed apprehension she could begin to read into her stepmothers independent move mrs wix had helped her by talking of a game it was a connexion in which the move could put on a strategic air her notions of diplomacy were thin but it was a kind of cold diplomatic shoulder and an elbow of more than usual point that temporarily at least were presented to her by the averted inclination of mrs beales head there was a phrase familiar to maisie so often was it used by this lady to express the idea of ones getting what one wanted one got itmrs beale always said she at all events always got it or proposed to get itby making love she was at present making love singular as it appeared to mrs wix and her young friends mind had never moved in such freedom as on thus finding itself face to face with the question of what she wanted to get this period of the omelette aux rognons and the poulet sauté while her sole surviving parent her fourth fairly chattered to her governess left maisie rather wondering if her governess would hold out it was strange but she became on the spot quite as interested in mrs wixs moral sense as mrs wix could possibly be in hers it had risen before her so pressingly that this was something new for mrs wix to resist resisting mrs beale herself promised at such a rate to become a very different business from resisting sir claudes view of her more might come of what had happenedwhatever it wasthan maisie felt she could have expected she put it together with a suspicion that had she ever in her life had a sovereign changed would have resembled an impression baffled by the want of arithmetic that her change was wrong she groped about in it that she was perhaps playing the passive part in a case of violent substitution a victim was what she should surely be if the issue between her stepparents had been settled by mrs beales saying well if she can live with but one of us alone with which in the world should it be but me that answer was far from what for days she had nursed herself in and the desolation of it was deepened by the absence of anything from sir claude to show he had not had to take it as triumphant had not mrs beale upstairs as good as given out that she had quitted him with the snap of a tension left him dropped him in london after some struggle as a sequel to which her own advent represented that she had practically sacrificed him maisie assisted in fancy at the probable episode in the regents park finding elements almost of terror in the suggestion that sir claude had not had fair play they drew something as she sat there even from the pride of an association with such beauty as mrs beales and the child quite forgot that though the sacrifice of mrs beale herself was a solution she had not invented she would probably have seen sir claude embark upon it without a direct remonstrance  what her stepmother had clearly now promised herself to wring from mrs wix was an assent to the great modification the change as smart as a jugglers trick in the interest of which nothing so much mattered as the new convenience of mrs beale maisie could positively seize the moral that her elbow seemed to point in ribs thinly defendedthe moral of its not mattering a straw which of the stepparents was the guardian the essence of the question was that a girl wasnt a boy if maisie had been a mere rough trousered thing destined at the best probably to grow up a scamp sir claude would have been welcome as the case stood he had simply tumbled out of it and mrs wix would henceforth find herself in the employ of the right person these arguments had really fallen into their place for our young friend at the very touch of that tone in which she had heard her new title declared she was still as a result of so many parents a daughter to somebody even after papa and mamma were to all intents dead if her fathers wife and her mothers husband by the operation of a natural or for all she knew a legal rule were in the shoes of their defunct partners then mrs beales partner was exactly as defunct as sir claudes and her shoes the very pair to which in farange v farange and others the divorce court had given priority the subject of that celebrated settlement saw the rest of her day really filled out with the pomp of all that mrs beale assumed the assumption rounded itself there between this ladys entertainers flourished in a way that left them in their bottomless element scarce a free pair of eyes to exchange signals it struck maisie even a little that there was a rope or two mrs wix might have thrown out if she would a rocket or two she might have sent up they had at any rate never been so long together without communion or telegraphy and their companion kept them apart by simply keeping them with her from this situation they saw the grandeur of their intenser relation to her pass and pass like an endless procession it was a day of lively movement and of talk on mrs beales part so brilliant and overflowing as to represent music and banners she took them out with her promptly to walk and to drive and eventowards nightsketched a plan for carrying them to the etablissement where for only a franc apiece they should listen to a concert of celebrities it reminded maisie the plan of the sideshows at earls court and the franc sounded brighter than the shillings which had at that time failed yet this too like the other was a frustrated hope the francs failed like the shillings and the sideshows had set an example to the concert the etablissement in short melted away and it was little wonder that a lady who from the moment of her arrival had been so gallantly in the breach should confess herself it last done up maisie could appreciate her fatigue the day had not passed without such an observers discovering that she was excited and even mentally comparing her state to that of the breakers after a gale it had blown hard in london and she would take time to go down it was of the condition known to the child by report as that of talking against time that her emphasis her spirit her humour which had never dropped now gave the impression  she too was delighted with foreign manners but her daughters opportunities of explaining them to her were unexpectedly forestalled by her own tone of large acquaintance with them one of the things that nipped in the bud all response to her volubility was maisies surprised retreat before the fact that continental life was what she had been almost brought up on it was mrs beale disconcertingly who began to explain it to her friends it was she who wherever they turned was the interpreter the historian and the guide she was full of reference to her early travelsat the age of eighteen she had at that period made with a distinguished dutch family a stay on the lake of geneva maisie had in the old days been regaled with anecdotes of these adventures but they had with time become phantasmal and the heroines quite showy exemption from bewilderment at boulogne her acuteness on some of the very subjects on which maisie had been acute to mrs wix were a high note of the majesty of the variety of advantage with which she had alighted it was all a part of the wind in her sails and of the weight with which her daughter was now to feel her hand the effect of it on maisie was to add already the burden of time to her separation from sir claude this might to her sense have lasted for days it was as if with their main agitation transferred thus to france and with neither mamma now nor mrs beale nor mrs wix nor herself at his side he must be fearfully alone in england hour after hour she felt as if she were waiting yet she couldnt have said exactly for what there were moments when mrs beales flow of talk was a mere rattle to smother a knock at no part of the crisis had the rattle so public a purpose as when instead of letting maisie go with mrs wix to prepare for dinner she pushed herwith a push at last incontestably maternalstraight into the room inherited from sir claude she titivated her little charge with her own brisk hands then she brought out im going to divorce your father  this was so different from anything maisie had expected that it took some time to reach her mind she was aware meanwhile that she probably looked rather wan to marry sir claude  mrs beale rewarded her with a kiss its sweet to hear you put it so  this was a tribute but it left maisie balancing for an objection how can you when hes married  he isntpractically hes free you know  free to marry  free first to divorce his own fiend  the benefit that these last days she had felt she owed a certain person left maisie a moment so illprepared for recognising this lurid label that she hesitated long enough to risk mamma  she isnt your mamma any longer mrs beale returned sir claude has paid her money to cease to be then as if remembering how little to the child a pecuniary transaction must represent she lets him off supporting her if hell let her off supporting you  mrs beale appeared however to have done injustice to her daughters financial grasp and support me himself maisie asked  take the whole bother and burden of you and never let her hear of you again its a regular signed contract  why thats lovely of her maisie cried  its not so lovely my dear but that hell get his divorce  maisie was briefly silent after which nohe wont get it she said then she added still more boldly and you wont get yours  mrs beale who was at the dressingglass turned round with amusement and surprise how do you know that  oh i know cried maisie  from mrs wix  maisie debated then after an instant took her cue from mrs beales absence of anger which struck her the more as she had felt how much of her courage she needed from mrs wix she admitted  mrs beale at the glass again made play with a powderpuff my own sweet shes mistaken was all she said  there was a certain force in the very amenity of this but our young lady reflected long enough to remember that it was not the answer sir claude himself had made the recollection nevertheless failed to prevent her saying do you mean then that he wont come till he has got it  mrs beale gave a last touch she was ready she stood there in all her elegance i mean my dear that its because he hasnt got it that i left him  this opened a view that stretched further than maisie could reach she turned away from it but she spoke before they went out again do you like mrs wix now  why my chick i was just going to ask you if you think she has come at all to like poor bad me  maisie thought at this hint but unsuccessfully i havent the least idea but ill find out  do said mrs beale rustling out with her in a scented air and as if it would be a very particular favour  the child tried promptly at bedtime relieved now of the fear that their visitor would wish to separate her for the night from her attendant have you held out she began as soon as the two doors at the end of the passage were again closed on them  mrs wix looked hard at the flame of the candle held out  why she has been making love to you has she won you over  mrs wix transferred her intensity to her pupils face over to what  to her keeping me instead  instead of sir claude mrs wix was distinctly gaining time  yes who else since its not instead of you  mrs wix coloured at this lucidity yes that is what she means  well do you like it maisie asked  she actually had to wait for oh her friend was embarrassed my opposition to the connexiontheirswould then naturally to some extent fall she has treated me today as if i werent after all quite such a worm not that i dont know very well where she got the pattern of her politeness but of course mrs wix hastened to add i shouldnt like her as the one nearly so well as him  nearly so well maisie echoed i should hope indeed not she spoke with a firmness under which she was herself the first to quiver i thought you adored him  i do mrs wix sturdily allowed  then have you suddenly begun to adore her too  mrs wix instead of directly answering only blinked in support of her sturdiness my dear in what a tone you ask that youre coming out  why shouldnt i youve come out mrs beale has come out we each have our turn and maisie threw off the most extraordinary little laugh that had ever passed her young lips  there passed mrs wixs indeed the next moment a sound that more than matched it youre most remarkable she neighed  her pupil though wholly without aspirations to pertness barely faltered i think youve done a great deal to make me so  very true i have she dropped to humility as if she recalled her so recent selfarraignment  would you accept her then thats what i ask said maisie  as a substitute mrs wix turned it over she met again the childs eyes she has literally almost fawned upon me  she hasnt fawned upon him she hasnt even been kind to him  mrs wix looked as if she had now an advantage then do you propose to kill her  you dont answer my question maisie persisted i want to know if you accept her  mrs wix continued to hedge i want to know if you do  everything in the childs person at this announced that it was easy to know not for a moment  not the two now mrs wix had caught on she flushed with it only him alone  him alone or nobody  not even me cried mrs wix  maisie looked at her a moment then began to undress oh youre nobody     xxix   her sleep was drawn out she instantly recognised lateness in the way her eyes opened to mrs wix erect completely dressed more dressed than ever and gazing at her from the centre of the room the next thing she was sitting straight up wide awake with the fear of the hours of abroad that she might have lost mrs wix looked as if the day had already made itself felt and the process of catching up with it began for maisie in hearing her distinctly say my poor dear he has come  sir claude maisie clearing the little bedrug with the width of her spring felt the polished floor under her bare feet  he crossed in the night he got in early mrs wixs head jerked stiffly backward hes there  and youve seen him  no hes therehes there mrs wix repeated her voice came out with a queer extinction that was not a voluntary drop and she trembled so that it added to their common emotion visibly pale they gazed at each other  isnt it too beautiful maisie panted back at her a challenge with an answer to which however she was not ready at once the term maisie had used was a flash of diplomacyto prevent at any rate mrs wixs using another to that degree it was successful there was only an appeal strange and mute in the white old face which produced the effect of a want of decision greater than could by any stretch of optimism have been associated with her attitude toward what had happened for maisie herself indeed what had happened was oddly as she could feel less of a simple rapture than any arrival or return of the same supreme friend had ever been before what had become overnight what had become while she slept of the comfortable faculty of gladness she tried to wake it up a little wider by talking by rejoicing by plunging into water and into clothes and she made out that it was ten oclock but also that mrs wix had not yet breakfasted the day before at nine they had had together a café complet in their sittingroom mrs wix on her side had evidently also a refuge to seek she sought it in checking the precipitation of some of her pupils present steps in recalling to her with an approach to sternness that of such preliminaries those embodied in a thorough use of soap should be the most thorough and in throwing even a certain reprobation on the idea of hurrying into clothes for the sake of a mere stepfather she took her in hand with a silent insistence she reduced the process to sequences more definite than any it had known since the days of moddle whatever it might be that had now with a difference begun to belong to sir claudes presence was still after all compatible for our young lady with the instinct of dressing to see him with almost untidy haste mrs wix meanwhile luckily was not wholly directed to repression hes therehes there she had said over several times it was her answer to every invitation to mention how long she had been up and her motive for respecting so rigidly the slumber of her companion it formed for some minutes her only account of the whereabouts of the others and her reason for not having yet seen them as well as of the possibility of their presently being found in the salon  hes therehes there she declared once more as she made on the child with an almost invidious tug a strained undergarment meet  do you mean hes in the salon maisie asked again  hes with her mrs wix desolately said hes with her she reiterated  do you mean in her own room maisie continued  she waited an instant god knows  maisie wondered a little why or how god should know this however delayed but an instant her bringing out well wont she go back  go back never  shell stay all the same  all the more  then wont sir claude go maisie asked  go backif she doesnt mrs wix appeared to give this question the benefit of a minutes thought why should he have comeonly to go back  maisie produced an ingenious solution to make her go to take her  mrs wix met it without a concession if he can make her go so easily why should he have let her come  maisie considered oh just to see me she has a right  yesshe has a right  shes my mother maisie tentatively tittered  yesshes your mother  besides maisie went on he didnt let her come he doesnt like her coming and if he doesnt like it  mrs wix took her up he must lump itthats what he must do your mother was right about himi mean your real one he has no strength nonone at all she seemed more profoundly to muse he might have had some even with heri mean with her ladyship hes just a poor sunk slave she asserted with sudden energy  maisie wondered again a slave  to his passions  she continued to wonder and even to be impressed after which she went on but how do you know hell stay  because he likes usand mrs wix with her emphasis of the word whirled her charge round again to deal with posterior hooks she had positively never shaken her so  it was as if she quite shook something out of her but how will that help him if wein spite of his likingdont stay  do you mean if we go off and leave him with her mrs wix put the question to the back of her pupils head it wont help him it will be his ruin hell have got nothing hell have lost everything it will be his utter destruction for hes certain after a while to loathe her  then when he loathes herit was astonishing how she caught the ideahell just come right after us maisie announced  never  never  shell keep him shell hold him for ever  maisie doubted when he loathes her  that wont matter she wont loathe him people dont mrs wix brought up  some do mamma does maisie contended  mamma does not it was startlingher friend contradicted her flat she loves himshe adores him a woman knows mrs wix spoke not only as if maisie were not a woman but as if she would never be one i know she cried  then why on earth has she left him  mrs wix hesitated he hates her dont stoop solift up your hair you know how im affected toward him she added with dignity but you must also know that i see clear  maisie all this time was trying hard to do likewise then if she has left him for that why shouldnt mrs beale leave him  because shes not such a fool  not such a fool as mamma  preciselyif you will have it does it look like her leaving him mrs wix enquired she brooded again then she went on with more intensity do you want to know really and truly why so that she may be his wretchedness and his punishment  his punishmentthis was more than as yet maisie could quite accept for what  for everything thats what will happen hell be tied to her for ever she wont mind in the least his hating her and she wont hate him back shell only hate us  us the child faintly echoed  shell hate you  me why i brought them together maisie resentfully cried  you brought them together there was a completeness in mrs wixs assent yes it was a pretty job sit down she began to brush her pupils hair and as she took up the mass of it with some force of hand went on with a sharp recall your mother adored him at firstit might have lasted but he began too soon with mrs beale as you say she pursued with a brisk application of the brush you brought them together  i brought them togethermaisie was ready to reaffirm it she felt none the less for a moment at the bottom of a hole then she seemed to see a way out but i didnt bring mamma together she just faltered  with all those gentlemenmrs wix pulled her up no it isnt quite so bad as that  i only said to the captainmaisie had the quick memory of itthat i hoped he at least he was awfully nice would love her and keep her  and even that wasnt much harm threw in mrs wix  it wasnt much good maisie was obliged to recognise she cant bear himnot even a mite she told me at folkestone  mrs wix suppressed a gasp then after a bridling instant during which she might have appeared to deflect with difficulty from her odd consideration of idas wrongs he was a nice sort of person for her to talk to you about  oh i like him maisie promptly rejoined and at this with an inarticulate sound and an inconsequence still more marked her companion bent over and dealt her on the cheek a rapid peck which had the apparent intention of a kiss  well if her ladyship doesnt agree with you what does it only prove mrs wix demanded in conclusion it proves that shes fond of sir claude  maisie in the light of some of the evidence reflected on that till her hair was finished but when she at last started up she gave a sign of no very close embrace of it she grasped at this moment mrs wixs arm he must have got his divorce  since day before yesterday dont talk trash  this was spoken with an impatience which left the child nothing to reply whereupon she sought her defence in a completely different relation to the fact well i knew he would come  so did i but not in twentyfour hours i gave him a few days mrs wix wailed  maisie whom she had now released looked at her with interest how many did she give him  mrs wix faced her a moment then as if with a bewildered sniff you had better ask her but she had no sooner uttered the words than she caught herself up lord o mercy how we talk  maisie felt that however they talked she must see him but she said nothing more for a time a time during which she conscientiously finished dressing and mrs wix also kept silence it was as if they each had almost too much to think of and even as if the child had the sense that her friend was watching her and seeing if she herself were watched at last mrs wix turned to the window and stoodsightlessly as maisie could guesslooking away then our young lady before the glass gave the supreme shake well im ready and now to see him  mrs wix turned round but as if without having heard her its tremendously grave there were slow still tears behind the straighteners  it isit is maisie spoke as if she were now dressed quite up to the occasion as if indeed with the last touch she had put on the judgementcap i must see him immediately  how can you see him if he doesnt send for you  why cant i go and find him  because you dont know where he is  cant i just look in the salon that still seemed simple to maisie  mrs wix however instantly cut it off i wouldnt have you look in the salon for all the world then she explained a little the salon isnt ours now  ours  yours and mine its theirs  theirs maisie with her stare continued to echo you mean they want to keep us out  mrs wix faltered she sank into a chair and as maisie had often enough seen her do before covered her face with her hands they ought to at least the situations too monstrous  maisie stood there a momentshe looked about the room ill go to himill find him  i wont i wont go near them cried mrs wix  then ill see him alone the child spied what she had been looking forshe possessed herself of her hat perhaps ill take him out and with decision she quitted the room  when she entered the salon it was empty but at the sound of the opened door some one stirred on the balcony and sir claude stepping straight in stood before her he was in light fresh clothes and wore a straw hat with a bright ribbon these things besides striking her in themselves as the very promise of the grandest of grand tours gave him a certain radiance and as it were a tropical ease but such an effect only marked rather more his having stopped short and for a longer minute than had ever at such a juncture elapsed not opened his arms to her his pause made her pause and enabled her to reflect that he must have been up some time for there were no traces of breakfast and that though it was so late he had rather markedly not caused her to be called to him had mrs wix been right about their forfeiture of the salon was it all his now all his and mrs beales such an idea at the rate her small thoughts throbbed could only remind her of the way in which what had been hers hitherto was what was exactly most mrs beales and his it was strange to be standing there and greeting him across a gulf for he had by this time spoken smiled and said my dear child my dear child but without coming any nearer in a flash she saw he was differentmore so than he knew or designed the next minute indeed it was as if he caught an impression from her face this made him hold out his hand then they met he kissed her he laughed she thought he even blushed something of his affection rang out as usual here i am you see againas i promised you  it was not as he had promised themhe had not promised them mrs beale but maisie said nothing about that what she said was simply i knew you had come mrs wix told me  oh yes and where is she  in her room she got me upshe dressed me  sir claude looked at her up and down a sweetness of mockery that she particularly loved came out in his face whenever he did that and it was not wanting now he raised his eyebrows and his arms to play at admiration he was evidently after all disposed to be gay got you upi should think so she has dressed you most beautifully isnt she coming  maisie wondered if she had better tell she said not  doesnt she want to see a poor devil  she looked about under the vibration of the way he described himself and her eyes rested on the door of the room he had previously occupied is mrs beale in there  sir claude looked blankly at the same object i havent the least idea  you havent seen her  not the tip of her nose  maisie thought there settled on her in the light of his beautiful smiling eyes the faintest purest coldest conviction that he wasnt telling the truth she hasnt welcomed you  not by a single sign  then where is she  sir claude laughed he seemed both amused and surprised at the point she made of it i give it up  doesnt she know youve come  he laughed again perhaps she doesnt care  maisie with an inspiration pounced on his arm has she gone  he met her eyes and then she could see that his own were really much graver than his manner gone she had flown to the door but before she could raise her hand to knock he was beside her and had caught it let her be i dont care about her i want to see you  then she hasnt gone  maisie fell back with him he still looked as if it were a joke but the more she saw of him the more she could make out that he was troubled it wouldnt be like her  she stood wondering at him did you want her to come  how can you suppose he put it to her candidly we had an immense row over it  do you mean youve quarrelled  sir claude was at a loss what has she told you  that im hers as much as yours that she represents papa  his gaze struck away through the open window and up to the sky she could hear him rattle in his trouserspockets his money or his keys yesthats what she keeps saying it gave him for a moment an air that was almost helpless  you say you dont care about her maisie went on do you mean youve quarrelled  we do nothing in life but quarrel  he rose before her as he said this so soft and fair so rich in spite of what might worry him in restored familiarities that it gave a bright blur to the meaningto what would otherwise perhaps have been the palpable promiseof the words  oh your quarrels she exclaimed with discouragement  i assure you hers are quite fearful  i dont speak of hers i speak of yours  ah dont do it till ive had my coffee youre growing up clever he added then he said i suppose youve breakfasted  oh noive had nothing  nothing in your roomhe was all compunction my dear old manwell breakfast then together he had one of his happy thoughts i saywell go out  that was just what i hoped ive brought my hat  you are clever well go to a café maisie was already at the door he glanced round the room a momentmy stick but there appeared to be no stick no matter i left itoh he remembered with an odd drop and came out  you left it in london she asked as they went downstairs  yesin london fancy  you were in such a hurry to come maisie explained  he had his arm round her that must have been the reason  halfway down he stopped short again slapping his leg and poor mrs wix  maisies face just showed a shadow do you want her to come  dear noi want to see you alone  thats the way i want to see you she replied like before  like before he gaily echoed but i mean has she had her coffee  no nothing  then ill send it up to her madame he had already at the foot of the stair called out to the stout patronne a lady who turned to him from the bustling breezy hall a countenance covered with fresh matutinal powder and a bosom as capacious as the velvet shelf of a chimneypiece over which her round white face framed in its golden frizzle might have figured as a showy clock he ordered with particular recommendations mrs wixs repast and it was a charm to hear his easy brilliant french even his companions ignorance could measure the perfection of it the patronne rubbing her hands and breaking in with high swift notes as into a florid duet went with him to the street and while they talked a moment longer maisie remembered what mrs wix had said about every ones liking him it came out enough through the morning powder it came out enough in the heaving bosom how the landlady liked him he had evidently ordered something lovely for mrs wix et bien soigné nestcepas  soyez tranquillethe patronne beamed upon him et pour madame  madame he echoedit just pulled him up a little  rien encore  rien encore come maisie she hurried along with him but on the way to the café he said nothing     xxx   after they were seated there it was different the place was not below the hotel but further along the quay with wide clear windows and a floor sprinkled with bran in a manner that gave it for maisie something of the added charm of a circus they had pretty much to themselves the painted spaces and the red plush benches these were shared by a few scattered gentlemen who picked teeth with facial contortions behind little bare tables and by an old personage in particular a very old personage with a red ribbon in his buttonhole whose manner of soaking buttered rolls in coffee and then disposing of them in the little that was left of the interval between his nose and chin might at a less anxious hour have cast upon maisie an almost envious spell they too had their café au lait and their buttered rolls determined by sir claudes asking her if she could with that light aid wait till the hour of déjeuner his allusion to this meal gave her in the shaded sprinkled coolness the scene as she vaguely felt of a sort of ordered mirrored licence the haunt of thosethe irregular like herselfwho went to bed or who rose too late something to think over while she watched the whiteaproned waiter perform as nimbly with plates and saucers as a certain conjurer her friend had in london taken her to a musichall to see sir claude had presently begun to talk again to tell her how london had looked and how long he had felt himself on either side to have been absent all about susan ash too and the amusement as well as the difficulty he had had with her then all about his return journey and the channel in the night and the crowd of people coming over and the way there were always too many one knew he spoke of other matters beside especially of what she must tell him of the occupations while he was away of mrs wix and her pupil hadnt they had the good time he had promisedhad he exaggerated a bit the arrangements made for their pleasure maisie had somethingnot all there wasto say of his success and of their gratitude she had a complication of thought that grew every minute grew with the consciousness that she had never seen him in this particular state in which he had been given back  mrs wix had once saidit was once or fifty times once was enough for maisie but more was not too muchthat he was wonderfully various well he was certainly so to the childs mind on the present occasion he was much more various than he was anything else besides the fact that they were together in a shop at a nice little intimate table as they had so often been in london only made greater the difference of what they were together about this difference was in his face in his voice in every look he gave her and every movement he made they were not the looks and the movements he really wanted to show and she could feel as well that they were not those she herself wanted she had seen him nervous she had seen every one she had come in contact with nervous but she had never seen him so nervous as this little by little it gave her a settled terror a terror that partook of the coldness she had felt just before at the hotel to find herself on his answer about mrs beale disbelieve him she seemed to see at present to touch across the table as if by laying her hand on it what he had meant when he confessed on those several occasions to fear why was such a man so often afraid it must have begun to come to her now that there was one thing just such a man above all could be afraid of he could be afraid of himself his fear at all events was there his fear was sweet to her beautiful and tender to her was having coffee and buttered rolls and talk and laughter that were no talk and laughter at all with her his fear was in his jesting postponing perverting voice it was just in this makebelieve way he had brought her out to imitate the old london playtimes to imitate indeed a relation that had wholly changed a relation that she had with her very eyes seen in the act of change when the day before in the salon mrs beale rose suddenly before her she rose before her for that matter now and even while their refreshment delayed maisie arrived at the straight question for which on their entrance his first word had given opportunity are we going to have déjeuner with mrs beale  his reply was anything but straight you and i  maisie sat back in her chair mrs wix and me  sir claude also shifted thats an enquiry my dear child that mrs beale herself must answer yes he had shifted but abruptly after a moment during which something seemed to hang there between them and as it heavily swayed just fan them with the air of its motion she felt that the whole thing was upon them do you mind he broke out my asking you what mrs wix has said to you  said to me  this day or twowhile i was away  do you mean about you and mrs beale  sir claude resting on his elbows fixed his eyes a moment on the white marble beneath them no i think we had a good deal of thatdidnt webefore i left you it seems to me we had it pretty well all out i mean about yourself about yourdont you knowassociating with us as i might say and staying on with us while you were alone with our friend what did she say  maisie felt the weight of the question it kept her silent for a space during which she looked at sir claude whose eyes remained bent nothing she returned at last  he showed incredulity nothing  nothing maisie repeated on which an interruption descended in the form of a tray bearing the preparations for their breakfast these preparations were as amusing as everything else the waiter poured their coffee from a vessel like a wateringpot and then made it froth with the curved stream of hot milk that dropped from the height of his raised arm but the two looked across at each other through the whole play of french pleasantness with a gravity that had now ceased to dissemble sir claude sent the waiter off again for something and then took up her answer hasnt she tried to affect you  face to face with him thus it seemed to maisie that she had tried so little as to be scarce worth mentioning again therefore an instant she shut herself up presently she found her middle course mrs beale likes her now and theres one thing ive found outa great thing mrs wix enjoys her being so kind she was tremendously kind all day yesterday  i see and what did she do sir claude asked  maisie was now busy with her breakfast and her companion attacked his own so that it was all in form at least even more than their old sociability everything she could think of she was as nice to her as you are the child said she talked to her all day  and what did she say to her  oh i dont know maisie was a little bewildered with his pressing her so for knowledge it didnt fit into the degree of intimacy with mrs beale that mrs wix had so denounced and that according to that lady had now brought him back in bondage wasnt he more aware than his stepdaughter of what would be done by the person to whom he was bound in a moment however she added she made love to her  sir claude looked at her harder and it was clearly something in her tone that made him quickly say you dont mind my asking you do you  not at all only i should think youd know better than i  what mrs beale did yesterday  she thought he coloured a trifle but almost simultaneously with that impression she found herself answering yesif you have seen her  he broke into the loudest of laughs why my dear boy i told you just now ive absolutely not i say dont you believe me  there was something she was already so afraid of that it covered up other fears didnt you come back to see her she enquired in a moment didnt you come back because you always want to so much  he received her enquiry as he had received her doubtwith an extraordinary absence of resentment i can imagine of course why you think that but it doesnt explain my doing what i have it was as i said to you just now at the inn really and truly you i wanted to see  she felt an instant as she used to feel when in the back garden at her mothers she took from him the highest push of a swinghigh high highthat he had had put there for her pleasure and that had finally broken down under the weight and the extravagant patronage of the cook well thats beautiful but to see me you mean and go away again  my going away again is just the point i cant tell yetit all depends  on mrs beale maisie asked she wont go away he finished emptying his coffeecup and then when he had put it down leaned back in his chair where she could see that he smiled on her this only added to her idea that he was in trouble that he was turning somehow in his pain and trying different things he continued to smile and she went on dont you know that  yes i may as well confess to you that as much as that i do know she wont go away shell stay  shell stay shell stay maisie repeated  just so wont you have some more coffee  yes please  and another buttered roll  yes please  he signed to the hovering waiter who arrived with the shining spout of plenty in either hand and with the friendliest interest in mademoiselle les tartines sont là their cups were replenished and while he watched almost musingly the bubbles in the fragrant mixture just sojust so sir claude said again and again its awfully awkward he exclaimed when the waiter had gone  that she wont go  welleverything well well well but he pulled himself together he began again to eat i came back to ask you something thats what i came back for  i know what you want to ask me maisie said  are you very sure  im almost very  well then risk it you mustnt make me risk everything  she was struck with the force of this you want to know if i should be happy with them  with those two ladies only no no old man vous ny êtes pas so nowthere sir claude laughed  well then what is it  the next minute instead of telling her what it was he laid his hand across the table on her own and held her as if under the prompting of a thought mrs wix would stay with her  without you oh yesnow  on account as you just intimated of mrs beales changed manner  maisie with her sense of responsibility weighed both mrs beales changed manner and mrs wixs human weakness i think she talked her round  sir claude thought a moment ah poor dear  do you mean mrs beale  oh nomrs wix  she likes being talked roundtreated like any one else oh she likes great politeness maisie expatiated it affects her very much  sir claude to her surprise demurred a little to this very muchup to a certain point  oh up to any point maisie returned with emphasis  well havent i been polite to her  lovelyand she perfectly worships you  then my dear child why cant she let me alonethis time sir claude unmistakeably blushed before maisie however could answer his question which would indeed have taken her long he went on in another tone mrs beale thinks she has probably quite broken her down but she hasnt  though he spoke as if he were sure maisie was strong in the impression she had just uttered and that she now again produced she has talked her round  ah yes round to herself but not round to me  oh she couldnt bear to hear him say that to you dont you really believe how she loves you  sir claude examined his belief of course i know shes wonderful  shes just every bit as fond of you as i am said maisie she told me so yesterday  ah then he promptly exclaimed she has tried to affect you i dont love her dont you see i do her perfect justice he pursued but i mean i dont love her as i do you and im sure you wouldnt seriously expect it shes not my daughtercome old chap shes not even my mother though i dare say it would have been better for me if she had been ill do for her what id do for my mother but i wont do more his real excitement broke out in a need to explain and justify himself though he kept trying to correct and conceal it with laughs and mouthfuls and other vain familiarities suddenly he broke off wiping his moustache with sharp pulls and coming back to mrs beale did she try to talk you over  noto me she said very little very little indeed maisie continued  sir claude seemed struck with this she was only sweet to mrs wix  as sweet as sugar cried maisie  he looked amused at her comparison but he didnt contest it he uttered on the contrary in an assenting way a little inarticulate sound i know what she can be but much good may it have done her mrs wix wont come round thats what makes it so fearfully awkward  maisie knew it was fearfully awkward she had known this now she felt for some time and there was something else it more pressingly concerned her to learn what is it you meant you came over to ask me  well said sir claude i was just going to say let me tell you it will surprise you she had finished breakfast now and she sat back in her chair again she waited in silence to hear he had pushed the things before him a little way and had his elbows on the table this time she was convinced she knew what was coming and once more for the crash as with mrs wix lately in her room she held her breath and drew together her eyelids he was going to say she must give him up he looked hard at her again then he made his effort should you see your way to let her go  she was bewildered to let who  mrs wix simply i put it at the worst should you see your way to sacrifice her of course i know what im asking  maisies eyes opened wide again this was so different from what she had expected and stay with you alone  he gave another push to his coffeecup with me and mrs beale of course it would be rather rum but everything in our whole story is rather rum you know whats more unusual than for any one to be given up like you by her parents  oh nothing is more unusual than that maisie concurred relieved at the contact of a proposition as to which concurrence could have lucidity  of course it would be quite unconventional sir claude went oni mean the little household we three should make together but things have got beyond that dont you see they got beyond that long ago we shall stay abroad at any rateits ever so much easier and its our affair and nobody elses its no ones business but ours on all the blessed earth i dont say that for mrs wix poor deari do her absolute justice i respect her i see what she means she has done me a lot of good but there are the facts there they are simply and here am i and here are you and she wont come round shes right from her point of view im talking to you in the most extraordinary wayim always talking to you in the most extraordinary way aint i one would think you were about sixty and that ii dont know what any one would think i am unless a beastly cad he suggested ive been awfully worried and thiss what it has come to youve done us the most tremendous good and youll do it still and always dont you see we cant let you goyoure everything there are the facts as i say she is your mother now mrs beale by what has happened and i in the same way im your father no one can contradict that and we cant get out of it my idea would be a nice little placesomewhere in the southwhere she and you would be together and as good as any one else and i should be as good too dont you see for i shouldnt live with you but i should be close to youjust round the corner and it would be just the same my idea would be that it should all be perfectly open and frank honi soit qui mal y pense dont you know youre the best thingyou and what we can do for youthat either of us has ever known he came back to that when i say to her give her up come she lets me have it bang in the face give her up yourself its the same old vicious circleand when i say vicious i dont mean a pun a whatdyecallem mrs wix is the obstacle i mean you know if she has affected you she has affected me and yet here i am i never was in such a tight place please believe its only that that makes me put it to you as i do my dear child isnt thatto put it sojust the way out of it that came to me yesterday in london after mrs beale had gone i had the most infernal atrocious day go straight over and put it to her let her choose freely her own self so i do old girli put it to you can you choose freely  this long address slowly and brokenly uttered with fidgets and falterings with lapses and recoveries with a mottled face and embarrassed but supplicating eyes reached the child from a quarter so close that after the shock of the first sharpness she could see intensely its direction and follow it from point to point all the more that it came back to the point at which it had started there was a word that had hummed all through it do you call it a sacrifice  of mrs wix ill call it whatever you call it i wont funk iti havent have i ill face it in all its baseness does it strike you it is base for me to get you well away from her to smuggle you off here into a corner and bribe you with sophistries and buttered rolls to betray her  to betray her  wellto part with her  maisie let the question wait the concrete image it presented was the most vivid side of it if i part with her where will she go  back to london  but i mean what will she do  oh as for that i wont pretend i know i dont we all have our difficulties  that to maisie was at this moment more striking than it had ever been then wholl teach me  sir claude laughed out what mrs wix teaches  she smiled dimly she saw what he meant it isnt so very very much  its so very very little he returned that thats a thing weve positively to consider we probably shouldnt give you another governess to begin with we shouldnt be able to get onenot of the only kind that would do it wouldnt dothe kind that would do he queerly enough explained i mean they wouldnt stayheighho wed do you ourselves particularly me you see i can now i havent got to mindwhat i used to i wont fight shy as i didshe can show out with me our relation all round is more regular  it seemed wonderfully regular the way he put it yet none the less while she looked at it as judiciously as she could the picture it made persisted somehow in being a combination quite distinctan old woman and a little girl seated in deep silence on a battered old bench by the rampart of the haute ville it was just at that hour yesterday they were hand in hand they had melted together i dont think you yet understand how she clings to you maisie said at last  i doi do but for all that and he gave turning in his conscious exposure an oppressed impatient sigh the sigh even his companion could recognise of the man naturally accustomed to that argument the man who wanted thoroughly to be reasonable but who if really he had to mind so many things would be always impossibly hampered what it came to indeed was that he understood quite perfectly if mrs wix clung it was all the more reason for shaking mrs wix off  this vision of what she had brought him to occupied our young lady while to ask what he owed he called the waiter and put down a gold piece that the man carried off for change sir claude looked after him then went on how could a woman have less to reproach a fellow with i mean as regards herself  maisie entertained the question yes how could she have less so why are you so sure shell go  surely you heard whyyou heard her come out three nights ago how can she do anything but goafter what she then said ive done what she warned me ofshe was absolutely right so here we are her liking mrs beale as you call it now is a motive sufficient with other things to make her for your sake stay on without me its not a motive sufficient to make her even for yours stay on with meswallow dont you see what she cant swallow and when you say shes as fond of me as you are i think i can if thats the case challenge you a little on it would you only with those two stay on without me  the waiter came back with the change and that gave her under this appeal a moments respite but when he had retreated again with the tip gathered in with graceful thanks on a subtle hint from sir claudes forefinger the latter while pocketing the money followed the appeal up would you let her make you live with mrs beale  without you never maisie then answered never she said again  it made him quite triumph and she was indeed herself shaken by the mere sound of it so you see youre not like her he exclaimed so ready to give me away then he came back to his original question can you choose i mean can you settle it by a word yourself will you stay on with us without her now in truth she felt the coldness of her terror and it seemed to her that suddenly she knew as she knew it about sir claude what she was afraid of she was afraid of herself she looked at him in such a way that it brought she could see wonder into his face a wonder held in check however by his frank pretension to play fair with her not to use advantages not to hurry nor hustle heronly to put her chance clearly and kindly before her may i think she finally asked  certainly certainly but how long  oh only a little while she said meekly  he had for a moment the air of wishing to look at it as if it were the most cheerful prospect in the world but what shall we do while youre thinking he spoke as if thought were compatible with almost any distraction  there was but one thing maisie wished to do and after an instant she expressed it have we got to go back to the hotel  do you want to  oh no  theres not the least necessity for it he bent his eyes on his watch his face was now very grave we can do anything else in the world he looked at her again almost as if he were on the point of saying that they might for instance start off for paris but even while she wondered if that were not coming he had a sudden drop we can take a walk  she was all ready but he sat there as if he had still something more to say this too however didnt come so she herself spoke i think i should like to see mrs wix first  before you decide all rightall right he had put on his hat but he had still to light a cigarette he smoked a minute with his head thrown back looking at the ceiling then he said theres one thing to rememberive a right to impress it on you we stand absolutely in the place of your parents its their defection their extraordinary baseness that has made our responsibility never was a young person more directly committed and confided he appeared to say this over at the ceiling through his smoke a little for his own illumination it carried him after a pause somewhat further though i admit it was to each of us separately  he gave her so at that moment and in that attitude the sense of wanting as it were to be on her sideon the side of what would be in every way most right and wise and charming for herthat she felt a sudden desire to prove herself not less delicate and magnanimous not less solicitous for his own interests what were these but that of the regularity he had just before spoken of it was to each of you separately she accordingly with much earnestness remarked but dont you remember i brought you together  he jumped up with a delighted laugh remember rather you brought us together you brought us together come     xxxi   she remained out with him for a time of which she could take no measure save that it was too short for what she wished to make of itan interval a barrier indefinite insurmountable they walked about they dawdled they looked in shopwindows they did all the old things exactly as if to try to get back all the old safety to get something out of them that they had always got before this had come before whatever it was without their trying and nothing came now but the intenser consciousness of their quest and their subterfuge the strangest thing of all was what had really happened to the old safety what had really happened was that sir claude was free and that mrs beale was free and yet that the new medium was somehow still more oppressive than the old she could feel that sir claude concurred with her in the sense that the oppression would be worst at the inn where till something should be settled they would feel the want of somethingof what could they call it but a footing the question of the settlement loomed larger to her now it depended she had learned so completely on herself her choice as her friend had called it was there before her like an impossible sum on a slate a sum that in spite of her plea for consideration she simply got off from doing while she walked about with him she must see mrs wix before she could do her sum therefore the longer before she saw her the more distant would be the ordeal she met at present no demand whatever of her obligation she simply plunged to avoid it deeper into the company of sir claude she saw nothing that she had seen hithertono touch in the foreign picture that had at first been always before her the only touch was that of sir claudes hand and to feel her own in it was her mute resistance to time she went about as sightlessly as if he had been leading her blindfold if they were afraid of themselves it was themselves they would find at the inn she was certain now that what awaited them there would be to lunch with mrs beale all her instinct was to avoid that to draw out their walk to find pretexts to take him down upon the beach to take him to the end of the pier he said no other word to her about what they had talked of at breakfast and she had a dim vision of how his way of not letting her see him definitely wait for anything from her would make any one who should know of it would make mrs wix for instance think him more than ever a gentleman it was true that once or twice on the jetty on the sands he looked at her for a minute with eyes that seemed to propose to her to come straight off with him to paris that however was not to give her a nudge about her responsibility he evidently wanted to procrastinate quite as much as she did he was not a bit more in a hurry to get back to the others maisie herself at this moment could be secretly merciless to mrs wix to the extent at any rate of not caring if her continued disappearance did make that lady begin to worry about what had become of her even begin to wonder perhaps if the truants hadnt found their remedy her want of mercy to mrs beale indeed was at least as great for mrs beales worry and wonder would be as much greater as the object at which they were directed when at last sir claude at the far end of the plage which they had already in the manycoloured crowd once traversed suddenly with a look at his watch remarked that it was time not to get back to the table dhôte but to get over to the station and meet the paris paperswhen he did this she found herself thinking quite with intensity what mrs beale and mrs wix would say on the way over to the station she had even a mental picture of the stepfather and the pupil established in a little place in the south while the governess and the stepmother in a little place in the north remained linked by a community of blankness and by the endless series of remarks it would give birth to the paris papers had come in and her companion with a strange extravagance purchased no fewer than eleven it took up time while they hovered at the bookstall on the restless platform where the little volumes in a row were all yellow and pink and one of her favourite old women in one of her favourite old caps absolutely wheedled him into the purchase of three they had thus so much to carry home that it would have seemed simpler with such a provision for a nice straight journey through france just to nip as she phrased it to herself into the coupé of the train that a little further along stood waiting to start she asked sir claude where it was going  to paris fancy  she could fancy well enough they stood there and smiled he with all the newspapers under his arm and she with the three books one yellow and two pink he had told her the pink were for herself and the yellow one for mrs beale implying in an interesting way that these were the natural divisions in france of literature for the young and for the old she knew how prepared they looked to pass into the train and she presently brought out to her companion i wish we could go wont you take me  he continued to smile would you really come  oh yes oh yes try  do you want me to take our tickets  yes take them  without any luggage  she showed their two armfuls smiling at him as he smiled at her but so conscious of being more frightened than she had ever been in her life that she seemed to see her whiteness as in a glass then she knew that what she saw was sir claudes whiteness he was as frightened as herself havent we got plenty of luggage she asked take the ticketshavent you time when does the train go  sir claude turned to a porter when does the train go  the man looked up at the stationclock in two minutes monsieur est placé  pas encore  et vos billetsvous navez que le temps then after a look at maisie monsieur veutil que je les prenne the man said  sir claude turned back to her veuxtu lieu quil en prenne  it was the most extraordinary thing in the world in the intensity of her excitement she not only by illumination understood all their french but fell into it with an active perfection she addressed herself straight to the porter prenny prenny oh prenny  ah si mademoiselle le veut he waited there for the money  but sir claude only staredstared at her with his white face you have chosen then youll let her go  maisie carried her eyes wistfully to the train where amid cries of en voiture en voiture heads were at windows and doors banging loud the porter was pressing ah vous navez plus le temps  its goingits going cried maisie  they watched it move they watched it start then the man went his way with a shrug its gone sir claude said  maisie crept some distance up the platform she stood there with her back to her companion following it with her eyes keeping down tears nursing her pink and yellow books she had had a real fright but had fallen back to earth the odd thing was that in her fall her fear too had been dashed down and broken it was gone she looked round at last from where she had paused at sir claudes and then saw that his wasnt it sat there with him on the bench to which against the wall of the station he had retreated and where leaning back and as she thought rather queer he still waited she came down to him and he continued to offer his ineffectual intention of pleasantry yes ive chosen she said to him ill let her go if youif you  she faltered he quickly took her up if i if i  if youll give up mrs beale  oh he exclaimed on which she saw how much how hopelessly he was afraid she had supposed at the café that it was of his rebellion of his gathering motive but how could that be when his temptationsthat temptation for example of the train they had just lostwere after all so slight mrs wix was right he was afraid of his weaknessof his weakness  she couldnt have told you afterwards how they got back to the inn she could only have told you that even from this point they had not gone straight but once more had wandered and loitered and in the course of it had found themselves on the edge of the quay wherestill apparently with half an hour to sparethe boat prepared for folkestone was drawn up here they hovered as they had done at the station here they exchanged silences again but only exchanged silences there were punctual people on the deck choosing places taking the best some of them already contented all established and shawled facing to england and attended by the steward who confined on such a day to the lighter offices tucked up the ladies feet or opened bottles with a pop they looked down at these things without a word they even picked out a good place for two that was left in the lee of a lifeboat and if they lingered rather stupidly neither deciding to go aboard nor deciding to come away it was sir claude quite as much as she who wouldnt move it was sir claude who cultivated the supreme stillness by which she knew best what he meant he simply meant that he knew all she herself meant but there was no pretence of pleasantry now their faces were grave and tired when at last they lounged off it was as if his fear his fear of his weakness leaned upon her heavily as they followed the harbour in the hall of the hotel as they passed in she saw a battered old box that she recognised an ancient receptacle with dangling labels that she knew and a big painted w lately done over and intensely personal that seemed to stare at her with a recognition and even with some suspicion of its own sir claude caught it too and there was agitation for both of them in the sight of this object on the move was mrs wix going and was the responsibility of giving her up lifted at a touch from her pupil her pupil and her pupils companion transfixed a moment held in the presence of the omen communication more intense than in the presence either of the paris train or of the channel steamer then and still without a word they went straight upstairs there however on the landing out of sight of the people below they collapsed so that they had to sink down together for support they simply seated themselves on the uppermost step while sir claude grasped the hand of his stepdaughter with a pressure that at another moment would probably have made her squeal their books and papers were all scattered she thinks youve given her up  then i must see heri must see her maisie said  to bid her goodbye  i must see heri must see her the child only repeated  they sat a minute longer sir claude with his tight grip of her hand and looking away from her looking straight down the staircase to where round the turn electric bells rattled and the pleasant seadraught blew at last loosening his grasp he slowly got up while she did the same they went together along the lobby but before they reached the salon he stopped again if i give up mrs beale  ill go straight out with you again and not come back till she has gone  he seemed to wonder till mrs beale he had made it sound like a bad joke  i mean till mrs wix leavesin that boat  sir claude looked almost foolish is she going in that boat  i suppose so i wont even bid her goodbye maisie continued ill stay out till the boat has gone ill go up to the old rampart  the old rampart  ill sit on that old bench where you see the gold virgin  the gold virgin he vaguely echoed but it brought his eyes back to her as if after an instant he could see the place and the thing she namedcould see her sitting there alone while i break with mrs beale  while you break with mrs beale  he gave a long deep smothered sigh i must see her first  you wont do as i do go out and wait  waitonce more he appeared at a loss  till they both have gone maisie said  giving us up  giving us up  oh with what a face for an instant he wondered if that could be but his wonder the next moment only made him go to the door and with his hand on the knob stand as if listening for voices maisie listened but she heard none all she heard presently was sir claudes saying with speculation quite choked off but so as not to be heard in the salon mrs beale will never go on this he pushed open the door and she went in with him the salon was empty but as an effect of their entrance the lady he had just mentioned appeared at the door of the bedroom is she going he then demanded  mrs beale came forward closing her door behind her ive had the most extraordinary scene with her she told me yesterday shed stay  and my arrival has altered it  oh we took that into account mrs beale was flushed which was never quite becoming to her and her face visibly testified to the encounter to which she alluded evidently however she had not been worsted and she held up her head and smiled and rubbed her hands as if in sudden emulation of the patronne she promised shed stay even if you should come  then why has she changed  because shes a hound the reason she herself gives is that youve been out too long  sir claude stared what has that to do with it  youve been out an age mrs beale continued i myself couldnt imagine what had become of you the whole morning she exclaimed and luncheon long since over  sir claude appeared indifferent to that did mrs wix go down with you he only asked  not she she never budgedand mrs beales flush to maisies vision deepened she moped thereshe didnt so much as come out to me and when i sent to invite her she simply declined to appear she said she wanted nothing and i went down alone but when i came up fortunately a little primedand mrs beale smiled a fine smile of battleshe was in the field  and you had a big row  we had a big rowshe assented with a frankness as large and while you left me to that sort of thing i should like to know where you were she paused for a reply but sir claude merely looked at maisie a movement that promptly quickened her challenge where the mischief have you been  you seem to take it as hard as mrs wix sir claude returned  i take it as i choose to take it and you dont answer my question  he looked again at maisieas if for an aid to this effort whereupon she smiled at her stepmother and offered weve been everywhere  mrs beale however made her no response thereby adding to a surprise of which our young lady had already felt the light brush she had received neither a greeting nor a glance but perhaps this was not more remarkable than the omission in respect to sir claude parted with in london two days before of any sign of a sense of their reunion most remarkable of all was mrs beales announcement of the pledge given by mrs wix and not hitherto revealed to her pupil instead of heeding this witness she went on with acerbity it might surely have occurred to you that something would come up  sir claude looked at his watch i had no idea it was so late nor that we had been out so long we werent hungry it passed like a flash what has come up  oh that shes disgusted said mrs beale  with whom then  with maisie even now she never looked at the child who stood there equally associated and disconnected for having no moral sense  how should she have sir claude tried again to shine a little at the companion of his walk how at any rate is it proved by her going out with me  dont ask me ask that woman she drivels when she doesnt rage mrs beale declared  and she leaves the child  she leaves the child said mrs beale with great emphasis and looking more than ever over maisies head  in this position suddenly a change came into her face caused as the others could the next thing see by the reappearance of mrs wix in the doorway which on coming in at sir claudes heels maisie had left gaping i dont leave the childi dont i dont she thundered from the threshold advancing upon the opposed three but addressing herself directly to maisie she was girdedpositively harnessedfor departure arrayed as she had been arrayed on her advent and armed with a small fat rusty reticule which almost in the manner of a battleaxe she brandished in support of her words she had clearly come straight from her room where maisie in an instant guessed she had directed the removal of her minor effects i dont leave you till ive given you another chance will you come with me  maisie turned to sir claude who struck her as having been removed to a distance of about a mile to mrs beale she turned no more than mrs beale had turned she felt as if already their difference had been disclosed what had come out about that in the scene between the two women enough came out now at all events as she put it practically to her stepfather will you come wont you she enquired as if she had not already seen that she should have to give him up it was the last flare of her dream by this time she was afraid of nothing  i should think youd be too proud to ask mrs wix interposed mrs wix was herself conspicuously too proud  but at the childs words mrs beale had fairly bounded come away from me maisie it was a wail of dismay and reproach in which her stepdaughter was astonished to read that she had had no hostile consciousness and that if she had been so actively grand it was not from suspicion but from strange entanglements of modesty  sir claude presented to mrs beale an expression positively sick dont put it to her that way there had indeed been something in mrs beales tone and for a moment our young lady was reminded of the old days in which so many of her friends had been compromised  this friend blushed she was before mrs wix and though she bridled she took the hint noit isnt the way then she showed she knew the way dont be a still bigger fool dear but go straight to your room and wait there till i can come to you  maisie made no motion to obey but mrs wix raised a hand that forestalled every evasion dont move till youve heard me im going but i must first understand have you lost it again  maisie surveyedfor the idea of a describable lossthe immensity of space then she replied lamely enough i feel as if i had lost everything  mrs wix looked dark do you mean to say you have lost what we found together with so much difficulty two days ago as her pupil failed of response she continued do you mean to say youve already forgotten what we found together  maisie dimly remembered my moral sense  your moral sense havent i after all brought it out she spoke as she had never spoken even in the schoolroom and with the book in her hand  it brought back to the childs recollection how she sometimes couldnt repeat on friday the sentence that had been glib on wednesday and she dealt all feebly and ruefully with the present tough passage sir claude and mrs beale stood there like visitors at an exam she had indeed an instant a whiff of the faint flower that mrs wix pretended to have plucked and now with such a peremptory hand thrust at her nose then it left her and as if she were sinking with a slip from a foothold her arms made a short jerk what this jerk represented was the spasm within her of something still deeper than a moral sense she looked at her examiner she looked at the visitors she felt the rising of the tears she had kept down at the station they had nothingno distinctly nothingto do with her moral sense the only thing was the old flat shameful schoolroom plea i dont knowi dont know  then youve lost it mrs wix seemed to close the book as she fixed the straighteners on sir claude youve nipped it in the bud youve killed it when it had begun to live  she was a newer mrs wix than ever a mrs wix high and great but sir claude was not after all to be treated as a little boy with a missed lesson ive not killed anything he said on the contrary i think ive produced life i dont know what to call iti havent even known how decently to deal with it to approach it but whatever it is its the most beautiful thing ive ever metits exquisite its sacred he had his hands in his pockets and though a trace of the sickness he had just shown perhaps lingered there his face bent itself with extraordinary gentleness on both the friends he was about to lose do you know what i came back for he asked of the elder  i think i do cried mrs wix surprisingly unmollified and with the heat of her late engagement with mrs beale still on her brow that lady as if a little besprinkled by such turns of the tide uttered a loud inarticulate protest and averting herself stood a moment at the window  i came back with a proposal said sir claude  to me mrs wix asked  to maisie that she should give you up  and does she  sir claude wavered tell her he then exclaimed to the child also turning away as if to give her the chance but mrs wix and her pupil stood confronted in silence maisie whiter than evermore awkward more rigid and yet more dumb they looked at each other hard and as nothing came from them sir claude faced about again you wont tell heryou cant still she said nothing whereupon addressing mrs wix he broke into a kind of ecstasy she refusedshe refused  maisie at this found her voice i didnt refuse i didnt she repeated  it brought mrs beale straight back to her you accepted angelyou accepted she threw herself upon the child and before maisie could resist had sunk with her upon the sofa possessed of her encircling her youve given her up already youve given her up for ever and youre ours and ours only now and the sooner shes off the better  maisie had shut her eyes but at a word of sir claudes they opened let her go he said to mrs beale  never never never cried mrs beale maisie felt herself more compressed  let her go sir claude more intensely repeated he was looking at mrs beale and there was something in his voice maisie knew from a loosening of arms that she had become conscious of what it was she slowly rose from the sofa and the child stood there again dropped and divided youre freeyoure free sir claude went on at which maisies back became aware of a push that vented resentment and that placed her again in the centre of the room the cynosure of every eye and not knowing which way to turn  she turned with an effort to mrs wix i didnt refuse to give you up i said i would if hed give up  give up mrs beale burst from mrs wix  give up mrs beale what do you call that but exquisite sir claude demanded of all of them the lady mentioned included speaking with a relish as intense now as if some lovely work of art or of nature had suddenly been set down among them he was rapidly recovering himself on this basis of fine appreciation she made her conditionwith such a sense of what it should be she made the only right one  the only right onemrs beale returned to the charge she had taken a moment before a snub from him but she was not to be snubbed on this how can you talk such rubbish and how can you back her up in such impertinence what in the world have you done to her to make her think of such stuff she stood there in righteous wrath she flashed her eyes round the circle maisie took them full in her own knowing that here at last was the moment she had had most to reckon with but as regards her stepdaughter mrs beale subdued herself to a question deeply mild have you made my own love any such condition as that  somehow now that it was there the great moment was not so bad what helped the child was that she knew what she wanted all her learning and learning had made her at last learn that so that if she waited an instant to reply it was only from the desire to be nice bewilderment had simply gone or at any rate was going fast finally she answered will you give him up will you  ah leave her aloneleave her leave her sir claude in sudden supplication murmured to mrs beale  mrs wix at the same instant found another apostrophe isnt it enough for you madam to have brought her to discussing your relations  mrs beale left sir claude unheeded but mrs wix could make her flame my relations what do you know you hideous creature about my relations and what business on earth have you to speak of them leave the room this instant you horrible old woman  i think you had better goyou must really catch your boat sir claude said distressfully to mrs wix he was out of it now or wanted to be he knew the worst and had accepted it what now concerned him was to prevent to dissipate vulgarities wont you gowont you just get off quickly  with the child as quickly as you like not without her mrs wix was adamant  then why did you lie to me you fiend mrs beale almost yelled why did you tell me an hour ago that you had given her up  because i despaired of herbecause i thought she had left me mrs wix turned to maisie you were with themin their connexion but now your eyes are open and i take you  no you dont and mrs beale made with a great fierce jump a wild snatch at her stepdaughter she caught her by the arm and completing an instinctive movement whirled her round in a further leap to the door which had been closed by sir claude the instant their voices had risen she fell back against it and even while denouncing and waving off mrs wix kept it closed in an incoherence of passion you dont take her but you bundle yourself she stays with her own people and shes rid of you i never heard anything so monstrous sir claude had rescued maisie and kept hold of her he held her in front of him resting his hands very lightly on her shoulders and facing the loud adversaries mrs beales flush had dropped she had turned pale with a splendid wrath she kept protesting and dismissing mrs wix she glued her back to the door to prevent maisies flight she drove out mrs wix by the window or the chimney youre a nice onediscussing relationswith your talk of our connexion and your insults what in the worlds our connexion but the love of the child whos our duty and our life and who holds us together as closely as she originally brought us  i know i know maisie said with a burst of eagerness i did bring you  the strangest of laughs escaped from sir claude you did bring usyou did his hands went up and down gently on her shoulders  mrs wix so dominated the situation that she had something sharp for every one there you have it you see she pregnantly remarked to her pupil  will you give him up maisie persisted to mrs beale  to you you abominable little horror that lady indignantly enquired and to this raving old demon who has filled your dreadful little mind with her wickedness have you been a hideous little hypocrite all these years that ive slaved to make you love me and deludedly believed you did  i love sir claudei love him maisie replied with an awkward sense that she appeared to offer it as something that would do as well sir claude had continued to pat her and it was really an answer to his pats  she hates youshe hates you he observed with the oddest quietness to mrs beale  his quietness made her blaze and you back her up in it and give me up to outrage  no i only insist that shes freeshes free  mrs beale staredmrs beale glared free to starve with this pauper lunatic  ill do more for her than you ever did mrs wix retorted ill work my fingers to the bone  maisie with sir claudes hands still on her shoulders felt just as she felt the fine surrender in them that over her head he looked in a certain way at mrs wix you neednt do that she heard him say she has means  meansmaisie mrs beale shrieked means that her vile father has stolen  ill get them backill get them back ill look into it he smiled and nodded at mrs wix  this had a fearful effect on his other friend havent i looked into it i should like to know and havent i found an abyss its too inconceivableyour cruelty to me she wildly broke out she had hot tears in her eyes  he spoke to her very kindly almost coaxingly well look into it again well look into it together it is an abyss but he can be madeor ida can think of the money theyre getting now he laughed its all right its all right he continued it wouldnt doit wouldnt do we cant work her in its perfectly trueshes unique were not good enoughoh no and quite exuberantly he laughed again  not good enough and that beast is mrs beale shouted  at this for a moment there was a hush in the room and in the midst of it sir claude replied to the question by moving with maisie to mrs wix the next thing the child knew she was at that ladys side with an arm firmly grasped mrs beale still guarded the door let them pass said sir claude at last  she remained there however maisie saw the pair look at each other then she saw mrs beale turn to her im your mother now maisie and hes your father  thats just where it is sighed mrs wix with an effect of irony positively detached and philosophic  mrs beale continued to address her young friend and her effort to be reasonable and tender was in its way remarkable were representative you know of mr farange and his former wife this person represents mere illiterate presumption we take our stand on the law  oh the law the law mrs wix superbly jeered you had better indeed let the law have a look at you  let them passlet them pass sir claude pressed his friend hardhe pleaded  but she fastened herself still to maisie do you hate me dearest  maisie looked at her with new eyes but answered as she had answered before will you give him up  mrs beales rejoinder hung fire but when it came it was noble you shouldnt talk to me of such things she was shocked she was scandalised to tears  for mrs wix however it was her discrimination that was indelicate you ought to be ashamed of yourself she roundly cried  sir claude made a supreme appeal will you be so good as to allow these horrors to terminate  mrs beale fixed her eyes on him and again maisie watched them you should do him justice mrs wix went on to mrs beale weve always been devoted to him maisie and iand he has shown how much he likes us he would like to please her he would like even i think to please me but he hasnt given you up  they stood confronted the stepparents still under maisies observation that observation had never sunk so deep as at this particular moment yes my dear i havent given you up sir claude said to mrs beale at last and if youd like me to treat our friends here as solemn witnesses i dont mind giving you my word for it that i never never will there he dauntlessly exclaimed  he cant mrs wix tragically commented  mrs beale erect and alive in her defeat jerked her handsome face about he cant she literally mocked  he cant he cant he cantsir claudes gay emphasis wonderfully carried it off  mrs beale took it all in yet she held her ground on which maisie addressed mrs wix shant we lose the boat  yes we shall lose the boat mrs wix remarked to sir claude  mrs beale meanwhile faced full at maisie i dont know what to make of you she launched  goodbye said maisie to sir claude  goodbye maisie sir claude answered  mrs beale came away from the door goodbye she hurled at maisie then passed straight across the room and disappeared in the adjoining one  sir claude had reached the other door and opened it mrs wix was already out on the threshold maisie paused she put out her hand to her stepfather he took it and held it a moment and their eyes met as the eyes of those who have done for each other what they can goodbye he repeated  goodbye and maisie followed mrs wix  they caught the steamer which was just putting off and hustled across the gulf found themselves on the deck so breathless and so scared that they gave up half the voyage to letting their emotion sink it sank slowly and imperfectly but at last in midchannel surrounded by the quiet sea mrs wix had courage to revert i didnt look back did you  yes he wasnt there said maisie  not on the balcony  maisie waited a moment then he wasnt there she simply said again  mrs wix also was silent a while he went to her she finally observed  oh i know the child replied  mrs wix gave a sidelong look she still had room for wonder at what maisie knew
